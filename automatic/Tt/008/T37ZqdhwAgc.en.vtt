another<00:00:21.780> time<00:00:22.020> but<00:00:22.140> this<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.350> template<00:00:22.830> P<00:00:23.070> and

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
another time but this is template P and

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.570 
another time but this is template P and
this<00:00:24.630> template<00:00:25.110> can<00:00:25.320> make<00:00:25.500> cups<00:00:25.770> tumblers<00:00:26.400> you

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
this template can make cups tumblers you

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.240 
this template can make cups tumblers you
could<00:00:26.730> stack<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.390> make<00:00:27.570> bottles<00:00:28.080> it's<00:00:28.439> a

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
could stack it to make bottles it's a

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.479 
could stack it to make bottles it's a
very<00:00:29.610> nice<00:00:29.820> size<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:31.200> it's<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.950> just<00:00:32.009> makes<00:00:32.400> a

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
very nice size and it's it just makes a

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.790 
very nice size and it's it just makes a
lot<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.700> variety<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.510> form<00:00:33.900> so<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.440> have<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
lot of variety of form so I have the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.810 
lot of variety of form so I have the
straight<00:00:35.160> sided<00:00:37.250> version<00:00:38.250> right<00:00:38.400> now<00:00:38.580> and<00:00:38.730> I'm

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
straight sided version right now and I'm

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.000 
straight sided version right now and I'm
going<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.030> put<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.690> bottom<00:00:40.080> on<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.260> because<00:00:40.830> this

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
going to put a bottom on it because this

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.240 
going to put a bottom on it because this
can<00:00:41.190> be<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.670> base<00:00:42.600> and<00:00:42.870> I'm<00:00:42.930> going<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.080> take<00:00:43.320> one

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
can be a base and I'm going to take one

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.580 
can be a base and I'm going to take one
of<00:00:44.280> my<00:00:44.400> biscuit<00:00:45.090> cutters<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.570> will<00:00:45.840> dust<00:00:46.440> some

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
of my biscuit cutters I will dust some

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.320 
of my biscuit cutters I will dust some
cornstarch<00:00:47.010> on<00:00:47.400> there<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.790> that's<00:00:47.940> just<00:00:48.059> to

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:48.330 
cornstarch on there and that's just to

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.990 
cornstarch on there and that's just to
take<00:00:48.540> the<00:00:49.410> top<00:00:49.650> layer<00:00:49.830> of<00:00:49.890> moisture<00:00:50.400> off<00:00:50.550> so

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
take the top layer of moisture off so

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.700 
take the top layer of moisture off so
that<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.300> cookie<00:00:51.570> cutter<00:00:51.809> or<00:00:52.110> biscuit<00:00:52.500> cutter

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
that the cookie cutter or biscuit cutter

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.000 
that the cookie cutter or biscuit cutter
doesn't<00:00:53.460> stick<00:00:53.909> to<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.600> clay<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:54.989> much<00:00:55.379> just

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
doesn't stick to the clay so much just

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.119 
doesn't stick to the clay so much just
pull<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.280> away<00:00:56.519> just<00:00:57.000> like<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.330> the<00:00:57.449> bowl<00:00:58.129> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
pull that away just like in the bowl the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.880 
pull that away just like in the bowl the
same<00:00:59.489> basic<00:01:00.000> setup<00:01:00.269> that<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.900> used<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.650> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
same basic setup that I used in the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.390 
same basic setup that I used in the
first<00:01:02.220> piece<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.360> bowl<00:01:03.890> happens<00:01:04.890> with<00:01:05.040> all<00:01:05.250> of

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
first piece the bowl happens with all of

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.039 
first piece the bowl happens with all of
the<00:01:05.489> templates<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.000> just<00:01:06.180> set<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.570> setting

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
the templates you just set and setting

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.719 
the templates you just set and setting
them<00:01:07.229> all<00:01:07.350> up<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.770> same<00:01:07.979> way<00:01:08.010> with<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> bevel

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
them all up in the same way with a bevel

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.480 
them all up in the same way with a bevel
cut<00:01:08.940> and<00:01:09.240> then<00:01:10.020> an<00:01:10.440> overlap<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.220> then<00:01:11.369> we're

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
cut and then an overlap so then we're

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.969 
cut and then an overlap so then we're
going<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:13.159> score<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:15.560> now<00:01:16.560> I'm<00:01:16.619> adding<00:01:16.920> a

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
going to score this now I'm adding a

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.649 
going to score this now I'm adding a
base<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.549> but<00:01:17.880> then<00:01:18.000> we'll<00:01:18.150> also<00:01:18.240> show

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
base to this but then we'll also show

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.660 
base to this but then we'll also show
how<00:01:19.909> this<00:01:20.909> can<00:01:21.240> be<00:01:21.479> used<00:01:22.110> for<00:01:22.380> multiple<00:01:23.340> forms

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
how this can be used for multiple forms

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.270 
how this can be used for multiple forms
just<00:01:24.240> by<00:01:24.360> stacking<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:25.080> run<00:01:25.890> your<00:01:26.010> finger

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
just by stacking and run your finger

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.320 
just by stacking and run your finger
around<00:01:26.370> get<00:01:26.790> it<00:01:26.880> clean<00:01:28.790> set<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.150> there

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
around get it clean set that on there

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.540 
around get it clean set that on there
you<00:01:33.330> can<00:01:33.480> paddle<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.020> make<00:01:34.440> sure<00:01:34.590> it's<00:01:34.770> nice

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
you can paddle it make sure it's nice

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.680 
you can paddle it make sure it's nice
and<00:01:35.580> tight<00:01:36.890> and<00:01:38.150> then<00:01:39.150> again<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.510> want<00:01:39.660> to

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
and tight and then again you want to

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:46.580 
and tight and then again you want to
always<00:01:40.020> soften<00:01:40.380> your<00:01:40.980> edges<00:01:44.150> and<00:01:45.590> generally

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
always soften your edges and generally

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.580 
always soften your edges and generally
in<00:01:46.680> with<00:01:47.010> something<00:01:47.370> that<00:01:47.640> has<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.910> flat<00:01:48.270> bottom

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
in with something that has a flat bottom

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.950 
in with something that has a flat bottom
you<00:01:49.590> also<00:01:49.770> want<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.190> go<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:51.560> just<00:01:52.560> gently

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
you also want to go in and just gently

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.300 
you also want to go in and just gently
run<00:01:54.960> your<00:01:55.110> thumb<00:01:55.140> across<00:01:55.650> the<00:01:55.800> bottom<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.159> that

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
run your thumb across the bottom so that

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.149 
run your thumb across the bottom so that
it<00:01:56.460> ever<00:01:57.120> so<00:01:57.420> gently<00:01:57.690> goes<00:01:58.680> down<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> bit

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
it ever so gently goes down a bit

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.450 
it ever so gently goes down a bit
because<00:01:59.310> things<00:01:59.730> tend<00:01:59.820> to<00:02:00.150> dry<00:02:00.690> and<00:02:01.400> get<00:02:02.400> a

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
because things tend to dry and get a

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.070 
because things tend to dry and get a
little<00:02:02.700> bit<00:02:02.880> bowed<00:02:03.210> if<00:02:03.420> it's<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.659> flat<00:02:03.870> bottom

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
little bit bowed if it's a flat bottom

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.890 
little bit bowed if it's a flat bottom
so<00:02:04.710> now<00:02:04.890> we<00:02:05.490> have<00:02:05.760> really<00:02:06.300> just<00:02:06.540> a<00:02:06.630> straight

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
so now we have really just a straight

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.009 
so now we have really just a straight
sided<00:02:07.800> tumbler<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.580> we'll<00:02:09.390> if<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.629> cleaned

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
sided tumbler and we'll if you cleaned

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:11.180 
sided tumbler and we'll if you cleaned
up<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.259> edge<00:02:10.379> that's<00:02:10.769> a<00:02:10.830> perfectly

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
up the edge that's a perfectly

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.890 
up the edge that's a perfectly
acceptable<00:02:11.400> form<00:02:12.090> if<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.269> like<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.510> straight

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
acceptable form if you like a straight

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.600 
acceptable form if you like a straight
sided<00:02:13.140> form<00:02:13.560> but<00:02:14.010> I'm<00:02:14.099> going<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.280> show<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.459> how

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
sided form but I'm going to show you how

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.670 
sided form but I'm going to show you how
to<00:02:14.670> push<00:02:14.909> this<00:02:15.120> out<00:02:15.360> I'm<00:02:16.080> going<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.349> be<00:02:16.440> pushing

to bottom I'm going to show you a couple
different<00:02:24.569> versions<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.349> how<00:02:26.069> this<00:02:26.940> can<00:02:27.180> be

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
different versions of how this can be

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.270 
different versions of how this can be
used<00:02:27.360> so<00:02:28.349> if<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:28.560> want<00:02:28.799> to<00:02:28.920> give<00:02:29.069> this<00:02:29.220> a

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
used so if you want to give this a

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.150 
used so if you want to give this a
little<00:02:29.580> bit<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:30.050> volume<00:02:31.050> you<00:02:31.620> just<00:02:31.860> go<00:02:31.980> in<00:02:32.130> like

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
little bit of volume you just go in like

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.760 
little bit of volume you just go in like
we<00:02:32.340> did<00:02:32.580> before<00:02:32.730> and

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
we did before and

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
push out the rim we'll want to kind of

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.600 
push out the rim we'll want to kind of
go<00:02:45.510> inward<00:02:46.020> so<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.440> keep<00:02:46.770> it<00:02:46.950> true<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.220> size<00:02:47.580> you

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
go inward so to keep it true to size you

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.610 
go inward so to keep it true to size you
just<00:02:48.000> push<00:02:48.360> it<00:02:48.390> back<00:02:48.510> out<00:02:48.840> if<00:02:49.110> you<00:02:49.290> don't<00:02:49.470> want

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
just push it back out if you don't want

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.260 
just push it back out if you don't want
it<00:02:49.710> to<00:02:49.770> go<00:02:49.890> inward<00:02:50.040> let's<00:02:50.580> just<00:02:50.820> do<00:02:50.940> one<00:02:51.150> more

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
it to go inward let's just do one more

00:02:51.270 --> 00:03:02.110 
it to go inward let's just do one more
round<00:02:57.080> and<00:02:58.790> then<00:03:00.260> we'll<00:03:01.260> take<00:03:01.470> this<00:03:01.650> around

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
round and then we'll take this around

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.730 
round and then we'll take this around
I'm<00:03:03.120> very<00:03:03.480> careful<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:04.140> make<00:03:04.170> sure<00:03:04.320> that<00:03:04.620> all

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
I'm very careful to make sure that all

my edges are nice and clean and I clean

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.320 
my edges are nice and clean and I clean
up<00:03:06.750> my<00:03:06.870> slip<00:03:07.320> in<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:08.220> video<00:03:08.520> I'm<00:03:08.940> not<00:03:09.120> going<00:03:09.270> to

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
up my slip in the video I'm not going to

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.180 
up my slip in the video I'm not going to
spend<00:03:10.080> a<00:03:10.200> lot<00:03:10.350> of<00:03:10.410> time<00:03:10.680> doing<00:03:10.860> all<00:03:11.040> that

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.560 
spend a lot of time doing all that
cleanup<00:03:11.460> because<00:03:11.790> I'd<00:03:11.910> rather<00:03:12.090> spend<00:03:12.510> the

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
cleanup because I'd rather spend the

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.970 
cleanup because I'd rather spend the
time<00:03:12.750> giving<00:03:13.080> more<00:03:13.230> information<00:03:13.800> but<00:03:13.950> just

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
time giving more information but just

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.190 
time giving more information but just
know<00:03:14.310> that<00:03:14.340> I'm<00:03:14.610> very<00:03:14.690> careful<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:15.990> make<00:03:16.170> sure

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
know that I'm very careful to make sure

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.100 
know that I'm very careful to make sure
that<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.650> craftsmanship<00:03:17.340> is<00:03:17.760> good<00:03:18.120> so<00:03:18.570> that

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
that the craftsmanship is good so that

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.950 
that the craftsmanship is good so that
pushed<00:03:19.500> out<00:03:19.680> slightly<00:03:19.980> makes<00:03:20.340> a<00:03:20.490> very<00:03:20.640> nice

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:20.960 
pushed out slightly makes a very nice

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.560 
pushed out slightly makes a very nice
tumbler<00:03:21.960> form<00:03:22.380> now<00:03:23.130> you<00:03:23.190> can<00:03:23.670> take<00:03:23.910> the

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
tumbler form now you can take the

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.270 
tumbler form now you can take the
template<00:03:25.500> H<00:03:25.770> and<00:03:27.080> make<00:03:28.080> a<00:03:28.320> foot<00:03:28.620> ring<00:03:28.830> for<00:03:29.100> this

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
template H and make a foot ring for this

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.310 
template H and make a foot ring for this
so<00:03:30.030> this<00:03:30.300> template<00:03:30.810> makes<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:32.190> foot<00:03:32.430> ring<00:03:33.320> you

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
so this template makes the foot ring you

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.860 
so this template makes the foot ring you
can<00:03:34.440> just<00:03:34.700> fill<00:03:35.700> this<00:03:35.850> over<00:03:36.240> and<00:03:36.480> you'll<00:03:36.600> see

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
can just fill this over and you'll see

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.710 
can just fill this over and you'll see
that<00:03:37.380> just<00:03:38.220> by<00:03:38.370> adding<00:03:38.610> that<00:03:38.820> if<00:03:39.270> you<00:03:39.390> slipped

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
that just by adding that if you slipped

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.480 
that just by adding that if you slipped
and<00:03:39.870> scored<00:03:40.170> that<00:03:40.320> on<00:03:40.530> I'm<00:03:40.890> not<00:03:41.100> going<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:41.370> do

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
and scored that on I'm not going to do

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:42.680 
and scored that on I'm not going to do
that<00:03:41.640> because<00:03:41.820> I'm<00:03:42.000> going<00:03:42.120> to<00:03:42.180> show<00:03:42.360> you<00:03:42.420> how

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
that because I'm going to show you how

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.050 
that because I'm going to show you how
that<00:03:42.870> can<00:03:43.050> also<00:03:43.230> become<00:03:43.530> a<00:03:43.710> neck<00:03:44.010> that<00:03:44.790> gives

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
that can also become a neck that gives

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.340 
that can also become a neck that gives
you<00:03:45.300> a<00:03:45.830> tumbler<00:03:46.830> with<00:03:46.980> a<00:03:47.010> foot<00:03:47.280> ring<00:03:47.460> which

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
you a tumbler with a foot ring which

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.750 
you a tumbler with a foot ring which
just<00:03:49.350> elevates<00:03:49.770> it<00:03:49.890> a<00:03:49.980> little<00:03:50.160> bit<00:03:50.310> makes<00:03:50.550> it

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
just elevates it a little bit makes it

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.350 
just elevates it a little bit makes it
just<00:03:50.940> a<00:03:51.120> little<00:03:51.330> bit<00:03:51.540> more<00:03:52.020> of<00:03:52.860> a<00:03:53.430> refined<00:03:53.910> form

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
just a little bit more of a refined form

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.430 
just a little bit more of a refined form
I<00:03:54.540> think<00:03:54.810> with<00:03:55.020> the<00:03:55.320> foot<00:03:55.890> ring<00:03:56.160> on<00:03:56.400> it<00:03:57.260> you<00:03:58.260> can

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
I think with the foot ring on it you can

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.410 
I think with the foot ring on it you can
also<00:03:58.680> use<00:03:59.490> that<00:03:59.850> instead<00:04:00.480> of<00:04:00.720> making<00:04:02.120> that<00:04:03.120> via

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
also use that instead of making that via

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
also use that instead of making that via
tumbler<00:04:03.900> with<00:04:04.080> the<00:04:04.170> foot<00:04:04.380> ring<00:04:05.960> you<00:04:06.960> can<00:04:07.200> use

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
tumbler with the foot ring you can use

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.900 
tumbler with the foot ring you can use
this<00:04:09.350> this<00:04:10.350> way<00:04:10.590> so<00:04:10.650> there's<00:04:11.010> no<00:04:11.190> right<00:04:11.610> side

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
this this way so there's no right side

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.300 
this this way so there's no right side
up<00:04:12.150> they're<00:04:12.540> all<00:04:12.690> just<00:04:13.200> parts<00:04:13.710> that<00:04:13.920> you<00:04:14.040> build

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
up they're all just parts that you build

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.640 
up they're all just parts that you build
with<00:04:14.580> so<00:04:15.150> you<00:04:15.240> can<00:04:15.360> use<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:15.930> form<00:04:16.170> this<00:04:16.380> way

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
with so you can use the form this way

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.520 
with so you can use the form this way
and<00:04:17.010> you<00:04:17.609> can<00:04:17.820> take<00:04:18.090> your<00:04:19.520> 4<00:04:20.520> inch<00:04:20.820> disc<00:04:21.530> to

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
and you can take your 4 inch disc to

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.320 
and you can take your 4 inch disc to
make<00:04:22.680> a<00:04:22.710> base<00:04:23.010> for<00:04:23.340> that<00:04:23.460> out<00:04:23.700> of<00:04:23.850> clay<00:04:24.060> I'm<00:04:24.210> not

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
make a base for that out of clay I'm not

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.910 
make a base for that out of clay I'm not
going<00:04:24.480> to<00:04:24.540> do<00:04:24.660> it<00:04:24.780> because<00:04:24.960> again<00:04:25.320> I<00:04:25.500> just<00:04:25.770> want

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
going to do it because again I just want

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.410 
going to do it because again I just want
to<00:04:25.980> show<00:04:26.160> information<00:04:26.490> you<00:04:27.030> know<00:04:27.180> that<00:04:27.360> you

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
to show information you know that you

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.900 
to show information you know that you
would<00:04:27.540> slip<00:04:27.720> and<00:04:27.900> score<00:04:28.200> that<00:04:28.230> and<00:04:28.620> add<00:04:29.610> it<00:04:29.790> on

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
would slip and score that and add it on

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.890 
would slip and score that and add it on
and<00:04:30.240> then<00:04:30.810> this<00:04:31.350> can<00:04:31.710> become<00:04:32.390> the<00:04:33.390> neck<00:04:33.630> of<00:04:33.810> a

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
and then this can become the neck of a

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.800 
and then this can become the neck of a
vase<00:04:34.140> and<00:04:34.580> if<00:04:35.580> you<00:04:35.700> wanted<00:04:36.000> to<00:04:36.090> add<00:04:36.240> little

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
vase and if you wanted to add little

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.640 
vase and if you wanted to add little
handles<00:04:39.810> you<00:04:40.710> would<00:04:40.860> just<00:04:41.130> cut<00:04:41.850> out<00:04:42.650> some

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
handles you would just cut out some

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.630 
handles you would just cut out some
wedges<00:04:43.860> this<00:04:44.490> is<00:04:44.550> a<00:04:44.700> very<00:04:44.970> quick<00:04:45.240> handle<00:04:45.750> what

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
wedges this is a very quick handle what

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.330 
wedges this is a very quick handle what
this

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
this

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.020 
this
video<00:04:48.730> is<00:04:49.150> meant<00:04:49.630> to<00:04:50.230> accomplish<00:04:50.620> my<00:04:51.550> hope<00:04:51.790> is

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
video is meant to accomplish my hope is

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
that it's just explaining the set of

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:00.210 
that it's just explaining the set of
templates<00:04:56.380> in<00:04:56.560> a<00:04:56.680> way<00:04:56.860> that<00:04:57.600> has<00:04:58.600> you<00:04:59.220> wanting

so<00:05:30.850> then<00:05:31.030> this<00:05:31.180> vase<00:05:32.880> can<00:05:33.880> hat<00:05:34.120> you<00:05:34.330> can<00:05:34.510> attach

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
so then this vase can hat you can attach

so then this vase can hat you can attach
these<00:05:35.229> little<00:05:35.500> handles<00:05:35.919> and<00:05:36.160> then<00:05:36.370> that<00:05:36.520> can

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:36.729 
these little handles and then that can

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:44.010 
these little handles and then that can
become<00:05:36.880> a<00:05:38.100> vase<00:05:39.100> form<00:05:39.960> if<00:05:41.250> you<00:05:42.250> want<00:05:42.760> to<00:05:43.180> ruffle

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
become a vase form if you want to ruffle

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.690 
become a vase form if you want to ruffle
the<00:05:44.110> edges<00:05:44.470> remember<00:05:44.950> everything<00:05:45.550> is

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
the edges remember everything is

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.909 
the edges remember everything is
interchangeable<00:05:46.139> so<00:05:47.139> you<00:05:47.229> can<00:05:47.350> touch<00:05:47.590> those

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
interchangeable so you can touch those

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.159 
interchangeable so you can touch those
on<00:05:48.190> you<00:05:48.760> can<00:05:48.970> make<00:05:49.150> a<00:05:49.180> ruffled<00:05:49.660> edge<00:05:49.780> on<00:05:50.020> this

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 
on you can make a ruffled edge on this

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:52.770 
on you can make a ruffled edge on this
just<00:05:50.440> like<00:05:50.530> we<00:05:50.740> did<00:05:50.919> on<00:05:51.070> the<00:05:51.220> bowl<00:05:51.430> you<00:05:51.780> can

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
just like we did on the bowl you can

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:58.010 
just like we did on the bowl you can
also<00:05:52.990> now<00:05:53.470> take<00:05:54.220> these<00:05:54.550> parts<00:05:55.180> and<00:05:56.310> stack<00:05:57.310> them

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
also now take these parts and stack them

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.560 
also now take these parts and stack them
so<00:05:59.020> just<00:05:59.470> say<00:05:59.620> this<00:05:59.889> was<00:06:00.160> our<00:06:00.460> tumbler<00:06:01.389> with

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.570 
so just say this was our tumbler with

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.900 
so just say this was our tumbler with
the<00:06:01.660> base<00:06:01.870> and<00:06:02.310> if<00:06:03.310> you<00:06:03.400> wanted<00:06:03.610> to<00:06:03.729> make<00:06:03.880> a

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:03.910 
the base and if you wanted to make a

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.800 
the base and if you wanted to make a
bottle<00:06:04.419> form<00:06:04.780> you<00:06:05.740> just<00:06:06.010> start<00:06:06.250> to<00:06:06.370> stack<00:06:06.810> so

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
bottle form you just start to stack so

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.540 
bottle form you just start to stack so
that<00:06:07.840> is<00:06:08.289> two<00:06:08.979> P<00:06:09.849> templates<00:06:10.419> and<00:06:11.130> then<00:06:12.130> the<00:06:12.430> H

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
that is two P templates and then the H

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.550 
that is two P templates and then the H
template<00:06:13.120> put<00:06:13.330> together<00:06:13.450> I<00:06:13.720> usually<00:06:14.139> line<00:06:14.349> my

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 
template put together I usually line my

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.190 
template put together I usually line my
seams<00:06:14.889> up<00:06:15.389> because<00:06:16.389> it<00:06:16.539> just<00:06:16.660> it's<00:06:16.900> the<00:06:17.050> weight

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.200 
seams up because it just it's the weight

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.719 
seams up because it just it's the weight
for<00:06:17.860> me<00:06:18.010> it's<00:06:18.280> just<00:06:18.550> a<00:06:18.639> natural<00:06:18.849> way<00:06:19.330> to<00:06:19.630> have

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729 
for me it's just a natural way to have

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:23.969 
for me it's just a natural way to have
things<00:06:21.729> line<00:06:22.030> up<00:06:22.240> then<00:06:22.539> you<00:06:22.720> can<00:06:22.930> take<00:06:23.139> another

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:23.979 
things line up then you can take another

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:26.040 
things line up then you can take another
template<00:06:24.610> I'm<00:06:24.760> using<00:06:24.940> template<00:06:25.389> n<00:06:25.510> which<00:06:25.900> is

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.050 
template I'm using template n which is

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.040 
template I'm using template n which is
the<00:06:26.080> smallest<00:06:26.729> blue<00:06:27.729> template<00:06:28.210> which<00:06:28.660> makes<00:06:28.930> a

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
the smallest blue template which makes a

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.870 
the smallest blue template which makes a
form<00:06:29.289> like<00:06:29.440> this<00:06:29.500> and<00:06:29.919> you<00:06:30.370> can<00:06:30.580> start

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 
form like this and you can start

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.600 
form like this and you can start
stacking<00:06:31.240> to<00:06:31.930> create<00:06:32.530> an<00:06:32.650> even<00:06:32.889> larger<00:06:33.070> form

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.610 
stacking to create an even larger form

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.020 
stacking to create an even larger form
you<00:06:34.270> can<00:06:34.450> have<00:06:34.660> a<00:06:34.960> fat<00:06:35.320> neck<00:06:35.590> like<00:06:35.830> that<00:06:36.030> this

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.030 
you can have a fat neck like that this

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.550 
you can have a fat neck like that this
would<00:06:37.210> be<00:06:37.300> the<00:06:37.479> D<00:06:37.660> template<00:06:38.760> or<00:06:40.139> you<00:06:41.139> can<00:06:41.320> use

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:41.560 
would be the D template or you can use

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.010 
would be the D template or you can use
the<00:06:41.919> long<00:06:42.160> neck<00:06:42.460> which<00:06:42.820> is<00:06:42.849> the<00:06:43.150> C<00:06:43.330> template<00:06:43.810> to

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.020 
the long neck which is the C template to

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.290 
the long neck which is the C template to
create<00:06:44.169> an<00:06:44.560> even<00:06:44.710> longer<00:06:45.039> neck<00:06:45.370> and<00:06:45.639> remember

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
create an even longer neck and remember

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.940 
create an even longer neck and remember
you<00:06:46.389> know<00:06:46.510> you<00:06:46.570> can<00:06:46.780> interchange<00:06:47.080> these<00:06:47.650> so

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:47.950 
you know you can interchange these so

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:49.680 
you know you can interchange these so
this<00:06:48.130> could<00:06:48.340> just<00:06:48.520> as<00:06:48.639> easily<00:06:48.880> go<00:06:49.240> like<00:06:49.450> that

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:49.690 
this could just as easily go like that

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:53.580 
this could just as easily go like that
and<00:06:50.020> then<00:06:50.430> you<00:06:51.430> can<00:06:51.610> put<00:06:51.880> this<00:06:52.810> part<00:06:53.139> on<00:06:53.289> top

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:53.590 
and then you can put this part on top

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.800 
and then you can put this part on top
which<00:06:53.979> is<00:06:54.010> template<00:06:54.550> e<00:06:54.729> so<00:06:55.389> you<00:06:55.450> just<00:06:55.630> keep

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:55.810 
which is template e so you just keep

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.469 
which is template e so you just keep
stacking<00:06:56.169> forms<00:06:56.860> and<00:06:57.070> taking<00:06:57.400> them<00:06:57.520> apart<00:06:57.909> to

00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 
stacking forms and taking them apart to

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:00.029 
stacking forms and taking them apart to
see<00:06:58.510> where<00:06:58.930> you'd<00:06:59.080> like<00:06:59.200> to<00:06:59.260> be<00:06:59.500> so<00:06:59.710> that's<00:06:59.830> why

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:00.039 
see where you'd like to be so that's why

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:02.100 
see where you'd like to be so that's why
I<00:07:00.070> recommend<00:07:00.640> that<00:07:00.760> you<00:07:00.880> make<00:07:01.030> a<00:07:01.090> lot<00:07:01.180> of<00:07:01.450> parts

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.110 
I recommend that you make a lot of parts

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:04.290 
I recommend that you make a lot of parts
so<00:07:02.379> that<00:07:02.560> you<00:07:02.680> can<00:07:02.830> explore<00:07:03.310> form<00:07:03.819> just<00:07:04.210> by

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:04.300 
so that you can explore form just by

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.869 
so that you can explore form just by
using<00:07:04.659> the<00:07:04.900> parts<00:07:05.229> as<00:07:05.460> building<00:07:06.460> blocks<00:07:06.490> so

00:07:06.869 --> 00:07:06.879 
using the parts as building blocks so

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:09.360 
using the parts as building blocks so
this<00:07:07.030> is<00:07:07.150> just<00:07:07.270> a<00:07:07.419> shorter<00:07:07.810> version<00:07:08.310> so<00:07:09.310> you

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:09.370 
this is just a shorter version so you

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.399 
this is just a shorter version so you
get<00:07:09.759> the<00:07:10.000> idea<00:07:10.300> of<00:07:10.389> how<00:07:10.719> you<00:07:11.169> can<00:07:11.379> make

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:11.409 
get the idea of how you can make

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:15.330 
get the idea of how you can make
multiple<00:07:12.069> forms<00:07:12.699> just<00:07:13.449> by<00:07:14.009> alternating<00:07:15.009> what

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:15.340 
multiple forms just by alternating what

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:26.999 
multiple forms just by alternating what
parts<00:07:15.669> you<00:07:15.759> use<00:07:16.090> on<00:07:16.449> them

00:07:26.999 --> 00:07:27.009 

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:28.830 

you

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:28.840 
you

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.900 
you
