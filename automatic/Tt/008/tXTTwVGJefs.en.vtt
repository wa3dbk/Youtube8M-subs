00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:04.090
 Hello people 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.830
 I wanted a little one 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.830
 make the story of oil and Emre Amar 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:13.299
 Just after I was asked what to do and so on for 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:15.389
 that's always in front of us 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.570
 I've got core on both day as well as both the yard and Egon 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:23.220
 the add-on Jamba installed 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.589
 Wyss extra for her would have to be multi boxing 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:29.539
 just show off I want to play 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:30.659
 my group 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:32.340
 Invited fact 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.100
 How Ernie Noel is fighting the app is right in the group 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.180
 almost immediately accepted 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.540
 Zeller reveals, and for example, you can also have your son complaining 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.520
 and additional bar milieu Red 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.060
 as a whole 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.920
 Quests and stuff like the Sharan with the other Carter 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.540
 here with the 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.060
 Detlef, so to speak 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.060
 For example, if we have whole quests of boars 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.280
 as you see 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.070
 we see them nothing 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.380
 It's not just a celebration 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.470
 if I am here on mine 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.510
 Manchester 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.850
 on Santos block 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.850
 and now I can, for example, on the banker Rolf 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.250
 the oldest tournament comes 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.250
 now percent yes has the whole circle through part 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.930
 The attempt to educate them, you see, too, is not the strong one 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.850
 qualified Celtic holds tight 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.850
 the fear 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.260
 here you can see the 1 1 1 1 1 part of this clique festival he's with 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.750
 she looks at the club 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.380
 HM made 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.650
 Estonians completely 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.030
 Knilli topped up 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.720
 had Christian Ehm can for the Dierig collective Gandhi company entirely 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.930
 clear 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.790
 this is the setting of Jan Marco Merz Maria Schrägstrich 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.840
 Hayley Amber 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.700
 or you have around here 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.450
 the Amber Barkhausen i 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.450
 Cuisine set everything 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.470
 Under Profile greed you can create your own profile a song 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.480
 and so I've got some percent profit 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.559
 Anvil worry because Yvonne is gambling on Ambo 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:18.589
 ABB USA the profile 

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:21.819
 if you give them a whole lot of settings to sailors 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.239
 I have a specialist now 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.359
 Use here is for example Comic Action you can make your own channel 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:28.089
 to let 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:32.039
 Photo Andy Anson characters could gnaw up to the percent solidified 

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:34.699
 Payout also required clock no to FK 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:37.649
 Now we have a very important threesome 

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:39.200
 Percent the team 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.250
 how can you adjust the team Bührer one and the 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.199
 Percent of those who almost runs along 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.509
 here you can get tens of dozens 

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:51.509
 Define setting options 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:56.639
 Anyway, what I've done here, for example, has already done that except 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:59.989
 to the team AXA of Florence picture 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.969
 So the service providers of all 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:04.479
 Automatic Youth 

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:05.760
 you can set here 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.889
 that is crazy for example 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:11.049
 very seldom with these two left it is here with ships in front 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.389
 adjusted 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:15.389
 that means I can with my arisen quasi loaded everything 

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:19.429
 So far, no problem should be synonymous with my Stearns 

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:20.979
 could trade 

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:22.729
 10 between possible 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:25.909
 By that one should as I said happened to him how to play 

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:27.839
 so my character is 

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:29.319
 set the mass 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.789
 and percent 

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:33.469
 the character that follows only 

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:35.069
 it ran 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.149
 that heals the boss 

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:40.109
 then I have Yuko tags 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:41.769
 Commerce Cellist 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.299
 this could adjust the 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:45.519
 just under 30 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:47.179
 Amalia 

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:50.430
 Perceive Red and Hubert Faltermeier loses his life 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.239
 Moth under and certain value comes 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:54.459
 mummy 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.359
 you can not make it a fig leaf with us 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.049
 BZ had every team 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.049
 If you have such a nice one over there again 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.139
 but when I need Manha »unnecessarily 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:10.719
 every one of his jerks was she has anyway 

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:14.569
 moronic 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.879
 The going to get EUR 2 follow up 

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:20.750
 for example, to kick it after the 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.789
 Fight that she should be 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.639
 again the master on site so you in Bern 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.189
 Here you can also put in the empty 

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:30.069
 what was very important was on 11 

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:32.180
 it is before him that is to say 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.180
 if the 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:40.599
 so that the hin that the consequences with which my people had resume 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:43.759
 can 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:46.139
 FPL helper 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.659
 I do not use either 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:51.879
 Although here we can provide Mappus for your for your team 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.849
 we still

 Sell ​​all the Commerzbank set 

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:06.939
 Thun Select are affordable until team change press from the team 

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:13.009
 and so on Autopsy Oro in the Quest IX Apple so the Master CERT 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:14.569
 automatic Wolters 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:15.900
 that has accepted 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.320
 it is her conversation with the measure and he automatically then from SuS 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.039
 divide 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:21.430
 against you only for quests 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.360

 Here is its Greatest that means all need old and partly sell and 

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:37.830
 so what 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.830
 quasi tuned into the whole set tuning 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:46.289
 Brain Tumors Life percent if running here is below 60% 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:49.289
 Christine regularly because of peace 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:51.889
 could adjust itself 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:54.830
 no life anymore 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.479
 me still photo Wiebke he 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.479
 Weigh that is very useful 

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:04.809
 when it comes to big 

00:06:04.809 --> 00:06:06.319
 should say 

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:07.409
 taxi 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:11.550
 Techn measures called taxi, that is to say, are called stock makes an automatic 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.550
 Followers before you Go have ever addressed

 Vice Richard probably just trying to convey a bit 

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:26.879
 and doing a lot of stuff just have to try a little bit 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.409
 and have our specific questions 

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:34.409
 best just write 

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:36.879
 then my two hunters thank you
