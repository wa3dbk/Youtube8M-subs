00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
topic of prize money particularly the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.110 
topic of prize money particularly the
majors<00:00:34.620> reared<00:00:35.100> its<00:00:35.309> head<00:00:35.400> when<00:00:35.760> we<00:00:35.879> start

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
majors reared its head when we start

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.009 
majors reared its head when we start
with<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.330> Andrew<00:00:36.600> do<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.720> think<00:00:36.930> these

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.019 
with you Andrew do you think these

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:38.240 
with you Andrew do you think these
players<00:00:37.320> are<00:00:37.470> getting<00:00:37.559> enough<00:00:37.860> money<00:00:38.040> at<00:00:38.159> the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
players are getting enough money at the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.009 
players are getting enough money at the
slams<00:00:38.519> I<00:00:38.790> think<00:00:39.330> probably<00:00:39.540> they<00:00:39.720> could<00:00:39.870> get

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019 
slams I think probably they could get

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:41.570 
slams I think probably they could get
more<00:00:40.229> I<00:00:40.470> guess<00:00:40.769> is<00:00:40.920> how<00:00:41.010> I<00:00:41.040> look<00:00:41.280> at<00:00:41.400> when<00:00:41.519> you

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580 
more I guess is how I look at when you

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.799 
more I guess is how I look at when you
look<00:00:41.610> at<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.879> amount<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.269> money<00:00:42.479> that<00:00:42.570> comes

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
look at the amount of money that comes

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.649 
look at the amount of money that comes
into<00:00:43.080> a<00:00:43.170> grand<00:00:43.440> slam<00:00:43.589> event<00:00:44.089> and<00:00:45.089> why<00:00:45.299> people

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:45.659 
into a grand slam event and why people

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:47.509 
into a grand slam event and why people
were<00:00:45.750> there<00:00:45.989> at<00:00:46.589> the<00:00:46.769> end<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:46.979> the<00:00:47.040> day<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.400> at

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
were there at the end of the day and at

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:48.799 
were there at the end of the day and at
the<00:00:47.549> beginning<00:00:47.699> of<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.120> day<00:00:48.299> and<00:00:48.540> at<00:00:48.720> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
the beginning of the day and at the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.899 
the beginning of the day and at the
middle<00:00:49.019> of<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.170> day<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:50.129> think<00:00:50.339> there's

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:50.909 
middle of the day I think there's

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:52.820 
middle of the day I think there's
certainly<00:00:51.180> room<00:00:51.269> for<00:00:51.390> players<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.739> know

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:52.830 
certainly room for players to you know

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.770 
certainly room for players to you know
be<00:00:52.979> taking<00:00:53.220> a<00:00:53.280> bigger<00:00:53.430> slice<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.790> the<00:00:53.940> pie<00:00:54.120> Tom

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.079 
be taking a bigger slice of the pie Tom
the<00:00:55.100> slabs<00:00:56.100> are<00:00:56.280> obviously<00:00:56.549> paying<00:00:56.790> more

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.089 
the slabs are obviously paying more

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:58.729 
the slabs are obviously paying more
money<00:00:57.119> than<00:00:57.659> the<00:00:57.750> run-of-the-mill<00:00:57.869> event<00:00:58.530> but

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
money than the run-of-the-mill event but

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.410 
money than the run-of-the-mill event but
as<00:00:58.860> a<00:00:58.890> percent<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.610> what<00:00:59.820> they<00:00:59.940> bring<00:01:00.150> in<00:01:00.360> a

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
as a percent of what they bring in a

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.210 
as a percent of what they bring in a
percent<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.869> gross<00:01:01.019> revenues<00:01:01.559> it's<00:01:01.739> much<00:01:02.010> much

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
percent of gross revenues it's much much

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.770 
percent of gross revenues it's much much
less<00:01:02.489> or<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.760> be<00:01:02.940> concerned<00:01:03.180> with<00:01:03.299> this<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
less or you be concerned with this the

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.630 
less or you be concerned with this the
players<00:01:04.019> have<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.229> great<00:01:05.070> argument<00:01:05.339> here<00:01:05.610> I

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
players have a great argument here I

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.390 
players have a great argument here I
mean<00:01:05.700> they<00:01:05.850> take<00:01:06.060> twenty<00:01:06.420> percent<00:01:06.780> or<00:01:07.110> less<00:01:07.500> at

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
mean they take twenty percent or less at

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.340 
mean they take twenty percent or less at
every<00:01:08.729> slam<00:01:08.969> pretty<00:01:09.299> much<00:01:09.509> you've<00:01:09.930> grown<00:01:10.049> ever

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
every slam pretty much you've grown ever

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.569 
every slam pretty much you've grown ever
news<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.649> comes<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:10.920> at<00:01:11.039> every<00:01:11.250> slight<00:01:11.399> if

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:11.579 
news that comes in at every slight if

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:12.920 
news that comes in at every slight if

you compare that to any other sporting

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.190 
you compare that to any other sporting
event<00:01:13.200> it's<00:01:13.380> basically<00:01:14.070> half<00:01:14.789> or<00:01:15.570> even<00:01:15.630> less

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
event it's basically half or even less

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.349 
event it's basically half or even less
than<00:01:16.649> half<00:01:16.859> of<00:01:17.100> what<00:01:17.159> any<00:01:17.579> other<00:01:17.789> athlete<00:01:17.969> in

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:18.359 
than half of what any other athlete in

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:20.300

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
any other sport is bring in it's a

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.859 
any other sport is bring in it's a
fantastic<00:01:20.820> argument<00:01:21.179> and<00:01:21.299> they're<00:01:21.630> not<00:01:21.719> going

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
fantastic argument and they're not going

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.630 
fantastic argument and they're not going
to<00:01:21.929> get<00:01:22.079> it<00:01:22.200> all<00:01:22.320> at<00:01:22.350> once<00:01:22.710> but<00:01:23.009> i<00:01:23.250> think<00:01:23.549> the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
to get it all at once but i think the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.069 
to get it all at once but i think the
slams<00:01:23.880> are<00:01:24.030> responding<00:01:24.539> and<00:01:24.630> question<00:01:24.929> is<00:01:24.960> how

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 
slams are responding and question is how

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:26.510 
slams are responding and question is how
quickly<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:25.560> respond<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.009> then<00:01:26.159> one<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
quickly to respond and then one of the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.789 
quickly to respond and then one of the
other<00:01:26.549> tournaments<00:01:27.179> do<00:01:27.329> as<00:01:27.869> well<00:01:28.170> big<00:01:28.590> thing

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
other tournaments do as well big thing

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.469 
other tournaments do as well big thing
they<00:01:28.950> have<00:01:29.100> going<00:01:29.130> or<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.609> think<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.090> players

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
they have going or I think the players

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.719 
they have going or I think the players
have<00:01:30.810> going<00:01:31.109> for<00:01:31.320> them<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.649> a<00:01:31.950> Roger<00:01:32.250> Federer

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
have going for them is a Roger Federer

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.310 
have going for them is a Roger Federer
in<00:01:32.789> their<00:01:32.969> corner<00:01:33.240> now<00:01:33.420> he<00:01:33.479> helps<00:01:33.840> him<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:34.170> the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
in their corner now he helps him on the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.260 
in their corner now he helps him on the
court<00:01:34.590> obviously<00:01:34.740> given<00:01:35.429> the<00:01:35.520> men's<00:01:35.939> tennis

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.590

biggest profile but he is also a big
advocate<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:40.229> feel<00:01:40.920> like<00:01:41.070> four<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.640> these<00:01:41.869> lower

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
advocate I feel like four of these lower

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.050 
advocate I feel like four of these lower
tier<00:01:43.200> players<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.009> ATP<00:01:44.490> which<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.820> think

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
tier players in the ATP which I think

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.569 
tier players in the ATP which I think
might<00:01:45.509> be<00:01:45.689> surprising<00:01:46.310> comparing<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.429> guess

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
might be surprising comparing it I guess

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.160 
might be surprising comparing it I guess

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.410 
to other sports you know you don't
usually<00:01:49.319> see<00:01:49.499> that<00:01:49.890> those<00:01:50.579> big<00:01:50.850> names<00:01:51.090> kind<00:01:51.329> of

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
usually see that those big names kind of

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.419 
usually see that those big names kind of
always<00:01:51.569> looking<00:01:51.689> out<00:01:52.170> for<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.499> think<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.859> the

always looking out for I think the the

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:56.450 
always looking out for I think the the

and more tournaments because they don't

for everyone to get on the same page
that's<00:02:49.739> why<00:02:49.890> I<00:02:49.920> think<00:02:50.160> a<00:02:50.190> boycott<00:02:50.549> would<00:02:50.730> be

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
that's why I think a boycott would be

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.400 
that's why I think a boycott would be
tough<00:02:51.060> well<00:02:51.540> there's<00:02:51.959> a<00:02:51.989> lot<00:02:52.140> of<00:02:52.170> nice

tough well there's a lot of nice

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
arguments are tough you're also

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.300 
arguments are tough you're also
