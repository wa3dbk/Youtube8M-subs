I'm just going to continue with the
second<00:03:22.270> layer<00:03:22.390> so<00:03:22.660> now<00:03:22.900> what<00:03:23.140> I'm<00:03:23.230> going<00:03:23.350> to<00:03:23.410> do

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
second layer so now what I'm going to do

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.040 
second layer so now what I'm going to do
is<00:03:23.620> I'm<00:03:23.710> going<00:03:23.800> to<00:03:23.890> use<00:03:24.010> a<00:03:24.070> different<00:03:24.130> side

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
is I'm going to use a different side

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.320

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
because um sometimes extra polish will

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:54.220 
because um sometimes extra polish will
kind<00:03:28.510> of<00:03:28.600> ruin<00:03:29.050> where<00:03:29.320> you're<00:03:29.530> going
