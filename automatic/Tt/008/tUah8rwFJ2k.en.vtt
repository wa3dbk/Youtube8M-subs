like a crazy porn rain
me<00:00:21.240> trying<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.600> throw

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:49.819 

as<00:00:40.360> I<00:00:40.570> please<00:00:40.870> lien<00:00:41.080> had<00:00:41.290> a<00:00:41.320> teaspoon<00:00:41.830> through

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:01:02.630 

dalia<00:00:50.829> distance

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.740 

try<00:01:03.390> this<00:01:03.450> sure<00:01:03.930> balances<00:01:04.610> heavy

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.990 

so<00:01:11.470> the<00:01:11.560> weird<00:01:11.800> thing<00:01:12.100> is<00:01:12.340> that<00:01:12.820> it<00:01:12.910> keeps

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
so the weird thing is that it keeps

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.380 
so the weird thing is that it keeps
hitting<00:01:13.540> my<00:01:13.780> board<00:01:14.110> I<00:01:14.350> see<00:01:14.560> it<00:01:14.650> hit<00:01:14.770> point<00:01:15.390> it's

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
hitting my board I see it hit point it's

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.320 
hitting my board I see it hit point it's
just<00:01:16.480> not<00:01:17.610> what<00:01:18.610> was<00:01:18.850> that<00:01:18.970> about<00:01:19.090> I<00:01:19.240> think

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
just not what was that about I think

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.730 
just not what was that about I think
it's<00:01:19.510> because<00:01:19.660> I'm<00:01:19.750> too<00:01:19.900> far<00:01:20.140> away<00:01:20.260> and<00:01:20.680> I'm

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
it's because I'm too far away and I'm

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.100 
it's because I'm too far away and I'm
not<00:01:20.830> powerful<00:01:21.310> enough<00:01:21.490> to<00:01:21.910> grow<00:01:22.330> it<00:01:22.480> hard

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
not powerful enough to grow it hard

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.470 
not powerful enough to grow it hard
enough<00:01:23.230> to<00:01:23.590> get<00:01:23.740> it<00:01:23.830> to<00:01:23.860> penetrate<00:01:24.700> from<00:01:25.300> that

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
enough to get it to penetrate from that

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.840 
enough to get it to penetrate from that
far<00:01:25.780> instead<00:01:26.500> of<00:01:26.590> two<00:01:26.980> spins<00:01:27.450> two<00:01:28.450> holes

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
far instead of two spins two holes

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:51.370 
far instead of two spins two holes
Oh

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:02:00.910 

I<00:01:58.180> actually<00:01:59.180> bought<00:01:59.450> these<00:01:59.630> a<00:01:59.689> while<00:01:59.960> back<00:02:00.350> for

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
I actually bought these a while back for

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.340 
I actually bought these a while back for
an<00:02:01.549> upgrade<00:02:02.000> to<00:02:02.270> my<00:02:02.420> cold<00:02:02.689> still<00:02:02.899> sure<00:02:03.079> flights

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
an upgrade to my cold still sure flights

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.569 
an upgrade to my cold still sure flights
this<00:02:03.530> is<00:02:03.680> kind<00:02:03.979> of<00:02:04.039> like<00:02:04.159> a<00:02:04.220> happy<00:02:04.460> medium

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
this is kind of like a happy medium

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.060 
this is kind of like a happy medium
between<00:02:04.909> the<00:02:05.299> sure<00:02:05.539> balance<00:02:05.929> and<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.860> sure

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
between the sure balance and the sure

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.770 
between the sure balance and the sure
flight<00:02:07.369> plus<00:02:07.640> it's<00:02:07.820> slim<00:02:08.090> easy<00:02:08.390> for<00:02:08.599> them<00:02:08.690> to

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
flight plus it's slim easy for them to

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.839 
flight plus it's slim easy for them to
hold<00:02:08.959> I<00:02:09.380> think<00:02:10.130> I<00:02:10.160> could<00:02:10.310> do<00:02:10.399> this<00:02:10.489> with<00:02:10.670> two

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
hold I think I could do this with two

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:26.080 
hold I think I could do this with two
things<00:02:11.090> no<00:02:11.269> problem

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:39.020 

all<00:02:26.840> crazy

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.300 

I<00:02:39.120> don't<00:02:40.050> practice<00:02:40.290> rotational<00:02:40.800> throwing

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
I don't practice rotational throwing

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.210 
I don't practice rotational throwing
very<00:02:42.030> often<00:02:42.390> I've<00:02:42.569> been<00:02:42.720> all<00:02:43.050> about<00:02:43.260> knows<00:02:43.709> me

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.100 

see<00:02:48.220> sometimes<00:02:48.459> I'll<00:02:49.090> change<00:02:49.390> my<00:02:49.450> throw<00:02:49.810> I'm

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
see sometimes I'll change my throw I'm

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.750 
see sometimes I'll change my throw I'm
not<00:02:50.290> very<00:02:50.440> consistent<00:02:50.980> it's<00:02:51.489> a<00:02:51.580> key<00:02:51.730> to

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
not very consistent it's a key to

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.050 
not very consistent it's a key to
rotational<00:02:52.239> 13<00:02:52.540> consistency<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.790> it<00:02:54.790> looks

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
rotational 13 consistency and it looks

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.570 
rotational 13 consistency and it looks
like<00:02:55.150> I<00:02:55.510> was<00:02:56.049> under<00:02:56.890> spitting<00:02:57.250> it<00:02:57.340> I<00:02:57.370> was

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
like I was under spitting it I was

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:04.179 
like I was under spitting it I was
snapping<00:02:57.879> my<00:02:58.180> wrist<00:02:58.409> towards<00:02:59.409> target

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:04.189 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:07.130 

you<00:03:05.189> can<00:03:05.310> tell<00:03:05.519> that<00:03:05.700> I<00:03:05.939> throw<00:03:06.420> like<00:03:07.110> this

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
you can tell that I throw like this

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.319 
you can tell that I throw like this
which<00:03:07.650> are<00:03:07.799> not<00:03:08.220> supposed<00:03:08.579> to<00:03:08.640> do<00:03:08.849> you're<00:03:09.180> such

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
which are not supposed to do you're such

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.319 
which are not supposed to do you're such
a<00:03:09.360> thorough<00:03:09.599> just<00:03:09.900> like<00:03:10.079> this<00:03:10.819> then<00:03:11.819> how<00:03:12.180> we're

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
a thorough just like this then how we're

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.210 
a thorough just like this then how we're
kind<00:03:12.510> of<00:03:12.569> it<00:03:12.689> release<00:03:13.439> the<00:03:13.620> air<00:03:13.739> release<00:03:13.890> here

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
kind of it release the air release here

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.860 
kind of it release the air release here
releasing<00:03:14.579> it<00:03:14.819> release<00:03:15.150> there

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
releasing it release there

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:24.309 
releasing it release there
it's<00:03:16.170> like<00:03:16.319> terrific<00:03:16.739> you<00:03:16.860> spent<00:03:17.099> the<00:03:17.220> beans

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.030 

earlier<00:03:25.319> I<00:03:25.409> was<00:03:25.500> talking<00:03:25.590> about<00:03:25.890> sure

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
earlier I was talking about sure

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.210 
earlier I was talking about sure
balances<00:03:26.580> and<00:03:26.879> then<00:03:27.510> these<00:03:27.780> are<00:03:28.170> heavy<00:03:28.530> they

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
balances and then these are heavy they

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.250 
balances and then these are heavy they
are<00:03:29.250> I<00:03:29.790> don't<00:03:30.000> know<00:03:30.060> maybe<00:03:30.360> even<00:03:30.900> three<00:03:31.230> times

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
are I don't know maybe even three times

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.710 
are I don't know maybe even three times
the<00:03:31.650> weight<00:03:31.799> as<00:03:32.010> this<00:03:32.340> sure<00:03:32.940> flights<00:03:33.239> I<00:03:33.569> mean

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
the weight as this sure flights I mean

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.119 
the weight as this sure flights I mean
they're<00:03:33.840> just<00:03:33.870> big<00:03:34.379> I'm<00:03:34.709> gonna<00:03:34.799> try<00:03:34.980> it<00:03:35.040> again

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
they're just big I'm gonna try it again

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.100 
they're just big I'm gonna try it again
maybe<00:03:35.400> after<00:03:35.879> half<00:03:36.060> an<00:03:36.209> hour<00:03:36.299> practice<00:03:36.840> I

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
maybe after half an hour practice I

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.380 
maybe after half an hour practice I
should<00:03:38.069> be<00:03:38.129> better<00:03:38.310> at<00:03:38.430> throwing<00:03:38.760> these<00:03:39.060> and

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
should be better at throwing these and

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.539 
should be better at throwing these and
maybe<00:03:39.720> get<00:03:39.870> some<00:03:39.900> impulse<00:03:40.739> into<00:03:41.099> it<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:41.400> get

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549

nothing too short just how you do an oh
Sid<00:03:57.580> got<00:03:58.360> a<00:03:58.390> follow<00:03:58.720> through<00:03:58.810> like<00:04:01.080> I<00:04:02.080> snapped

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
Sid got a follow through like I snapped

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:11.490 
Sid got a follow through like I snapped
it<00:04:02.680> too<00:04:03.370> far<00:04:03.580> I<00:04:03.870> over-rotated<00:04:04.870> I<00:04:10.260> was<00:04:11.260> gonna

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
it too far I over-rotated I was gonna

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.500 
it too far I over-rotated I was gonna
say<00:04:11.800> I<00:04:12.099> don't<00:04:12.160> recommend<00:04:12.580> the<00:04:12.849> share<00:04:13.060> balances

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510

but<00:04:13.780> I<00:04:14.019> think<00:04:14.200> it<00:04:14.290> just<00:04:14.440> takes<00:04:14.620> a<00:04:14.950> while<00:04:15.250> to<00:04:15.280> use

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
but I think it just takes a while to use
