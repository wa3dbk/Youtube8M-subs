okay<00:03:20.060> so<00:03:21.060> it<00:03:21.239> looks<00:03:21.450> like<00:03:21.540> I<00:03:22.489> haven't<00:03:23.489> got<00:03:24.150> it

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
okay so it looks like I haven't got it

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.710 
okay so it looks like I haven't got it
right<00:03:26.040> yet<00:03:26.340> so<00:03:26.880> we<00:03:27.030> know<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.299> tester<00:03:27.660> is

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
right yet so we know the tester is

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.620 
right yet so we know the tester is
working<00:03:28.109> so<00:03:28.290> all<00:03:29.220> I'm<00:03:29.370> going<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.549> do<00:03:30.290> is<00:03:32.630> I'm

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
working so all I'm going to do is I'm

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.210 
working so all I'm going to do is I'm
going<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:33.840> turn<00:03:34.139> this<00:03:34.380> a<00:03:34.440> little<00:03:34.590> bit<00:03:37.220> that

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
going to turn this a little bit that

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.949 
going to turn this a little bit that
feels<00:03:38.669> pretty<00:03:38.730> good<00:03:39.000> I<00:03:41.450> just<00:03:42.450> didn't<00:03:42.780> make<00:03:42.900> the

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
feels pretty good I just didn't make the

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:49.580 
feels pretty good I just didn't make the
proper<00:03:43.500> connection<00:03:44.220> yet<00:03:44.489> I<00:03:48.380> think<00:03:49.380> that's

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
proper connection yet I think that's

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.680 
proper connection yet I think that's
going<00:03:49.799> to<00:03:49.859> do<00:03:50.040> it<00:03:50.160> let's<00:03:51.060> check<00:03:51.269> it<00:03:51.419> out<00:03:53.690> of

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
going to do it let's check it out of

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.270 
going to do it let's check it out of
course<00:03:54.959> if<00:03:55.200> you<00:03:55.290> had<00:03:55.410> a<00:03:55.440> longer<00:03:55.680> cable<00:03:56.010> it's

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
course if you had a longer cable it's

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.250 
course if you had a longer cable it's
going<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.459> be<00:03:56.519> much<00:03:56.639> easier<00:03:58.910> ok<00:03:59.910> tip<00:04:00.540> to<00:04:00.959> tip

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
going to be much easier ok tip to tip

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.550 
going to be much easier ok tip to tip
there<00:04:01.889> we<00:04:02.040> go<00:04:02.480> so<00:04:03.480> we<00:04:03.870> got<00:04:03.989> a<00:04:04.019> great<00:04:04.260> connection

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
there we go so we got a great connection

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.059 
there we go so we got a great connection
now<00:04:05.660> that's<00:04:06.660> how<00:04:06.840> you<00:04:06.900> do<00:04:07.109> it<00:04:07.139> and<00:04:07.799> that<00:04:07.949> is<00:04:08.040> a

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
now that's how you do it and that is a

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.220 
now that's how you do it and that is a
