because<00:00:32.480> just<00:00:33.480> just<00:00:34.260> watching<00:00:34.770> like<00:00:34.920> just

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
because just just watching like just

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.760 
because just just watching like just
even<00:00:35.940> mentioning<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.540> i<00:00:36.600> knew<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.590> match

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770

would<00:00:37.920> be<00:00:38.070> great<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.280> think<00:00:38.460> Cesaro<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:39.180> on<00:00:39.390> a

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
would be great I think Cesaro is on a

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.080 
would be great I think Cesaro is on a
roll<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.379> think<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:41.430> reminds<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:41.940> a

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
roll that I think it reminds you of a

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.420 
roll that I think it reminds you of a
young<00:00:42.270> Randy<00:00:42.480> Orton<00:00:42.840> when<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.050> look<00:00:43.230> back

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
that was thrown it started off as an

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
uppercut war and then it ended up just

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.830 
uppercut war and then it ended up just
uh<00:01:15.930> just<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.580> know<00:01:17.700> since<00:01:17.939> our<00:01:18.060> winning<00:01:18.420> very

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
uh just you know since our winning very

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.859 
uh just you know since our winning very
clean<00:01:19.229> there<00:01:19.680> was<00:01:19.799> one<00:01:20.100> RKO<00:01:20.640> spotted<00:01:21.570> Cesaro

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
clean there was one RKO spotted Cesaro

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.289 
clean there was one RKO spotted Cesaro
kind<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.229> reversed<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.740> but<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.130> don't<00:01:24.090> think

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
kind of reversed it but I don't think

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.359 
kind of reversed it but I don't think
well<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.869> was<00:01:24.990> gonna<00:01:25.080> say<00:01:25.320> bizarro<00:01:26.009> should<00:01:26.250> have

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
well I was gonna say bizarro should have

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.679 
well I was gonna say bizarro should have
you<00:01:26.460> know<00:01:26.490> kicked<00:01:26.790> out<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:26.939> an<00:01:27.090> RKO<00:01:27.420> but<00:01:27.600> I

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
you know kicked out of an RKO but I

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.179 
you know kicked out of an RKO but I
think<00:01:27.869> house<00:01:27.960> may<00:01:28.200> be<00:01:28.229> pushing<00:01:28.560> though<00:01:28.829> over

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
think house may be pushing though over

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.760 
think house may be pushing though over
the<00:01:29.220> top<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:30.329> got<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.570> clean<00:01:30.780> win<00:01:31.020> which<00:01:31.530> was

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
the top you got the clean win which was

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.749 
the top you got the clean win which was
very<00:01:32.250> surprising<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.920> either<00:01:34.920> way<00:01:35.250> it's<00:01:35.610> I

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
very surprising and either way it's I

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.399 
very surprising and either way it's I
