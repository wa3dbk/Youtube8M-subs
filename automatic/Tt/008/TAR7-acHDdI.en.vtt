00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
nokia n900 so you can see it's all

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.719 
nokia n900 so you can see it's all
crackly<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.320> broken<00:01:55.829> up<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.219> i<00:01:56.430> thought<00:01:56.579> that

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
crackly and broken up and i thought that

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.459 
crackly and broken up and i thought that
was<00:01:56.790> just<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.240> preview<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.930> thought<00:01:58.079> once<00:01:58.290> I

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
was just the preview it I thought once I

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.050 
was just the preview it I thought once I
rendered<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.250> would<00:01:59.430> solve<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.820> problem

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
rendered it it would solve that problem

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.490 
rendered it it would solve that problem
know<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.509> when<00:02:00.630> I<00:02:00.659> rendered<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.079> sounded

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
know that when I rendered it sounded

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.999 
know that when I rendered it sounded
just<00:02:01.829> like<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:03.360> next<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:04.140> tried<00:02:04.740> opening

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
just like that so next I tried opening

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:11.970 
just like that so next I tried opening
up<00:02:05.369> single<00:02:06.180> era<00:02:08.390> and<00:02:09.390> I'll<00:02:09.509> import<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:10.110> video

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
up single era and I'll import that video

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:24.420 
up single era and I'll import that video
and<00:02:13.409> I<00:02:14.409> had<00:02:14.620> even<00:02:15.099> more<00:02:15.340> audio<00:02:15.790> issues<00:02:16.330> here<00:02:23.430> so

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
and I had even more audio issues here so

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.780 
and I had even more audio issues here so
you<00:02:25.120> can<00:02:25.269> hear<00:02:25.569> that<00:02:25.780> it's<00:02:26.430> playing<00:02:27.430> really

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
you can hear that it's playing really

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.910 
you can hear that it's playing really
fast<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.269> video<00:02:28.510> which<00:02:29.140> is<00:02:29.319> off<00:02:29.590> here<00:02:29.830> on

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
fast the video which is off here on

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.460 
fast the video which is off here on
another<00:02:30.129> screen<00:02:30.430> is<00:02:30.780> playing<00:02:31.780> at<00:02:32.080> a<00:02:32.140> normal

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
another screen is playing at a normal

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.920 
another screen is playing at a normal
rate<00:02:32.650> but<00:02:33.549> the<00:02:33.640> audio<00:02:33.790> was<00:02:34.209> playing<00:02:34.510> real<00:02:34.660> fast

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
rate but the audio was playing real fast

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.780 
rate but the audio was playing real fast
and<00:02:35.110> looping<00:02:35.470> over<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.769> over<00:02:35.890> again<00:02:36.129> and<00:02:36.459> I

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
and looping over and over again and I

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.100 
and looping over and over again and I
tried<00:02:37.000> a<00:02:37.030> few<00:02:37.180> other<00:02:37.330> editors<00:02:37.720> and<00:02:37.840> they<00:02:37.900> did

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
tried a few other editors and they did

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.050 
tried a few other editors and they did
the<00:02:38.200> same<00:02:38.410> thing<00:02:38.440> so<00:02:39.129> I<00:02:39.160> said<00:02:39.459> to<00:02:39.489> myself<00:02:39.670> how

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
the same thing so I said to myself how

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.800 
the same thing so I said to myself how
can<00:02:40.120> i<00:02:40.329> fix<00:02:40.390> this<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:41.400> i<00:02:42.400> decided<00:02:42.849> the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
can i fix this and i decided the

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.410 
can i fix this and i decided the
simplest<00:02:44.260> way<00:02:44.700> was<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.910> open<00:02:46.030> up<00:02:46.209> a<00:02:46.269> terminal

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
simplest way was to open up a terminal

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.330 
simplest way was to open up a terminal
I'll<00:02:47.170> make<00:02:47.319> this<00:02:47.410> bigger<00:02:47.650> so<00:02:47.829> you<00:02:47.860> can<00:02:48.040> see<00:02:48.250> it

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
I'll make this bigger so you can see it

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.849 
I'll make this bigger so you can see it
here<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:48.819> I'm<00:02:49.599> in<00:02:49.930> my<00:02:50.019> home<00:02:50.200> directory<00:02:50.349> and

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859 
here and I'm in my home directory and

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.630 
here and I'm in my home directory and
you<00:02:50.950> can<00:02:51.069> see<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.609> video<00:02:51.970> right<00:02:52.599> here<00:02:52.629> it's

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
you can see the video right here it's

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.770 
you can see the video right here it's
automatically<00:02:54.640> saved<00:02:54.970> on<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.209> phone<00:02:55.420> but

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
automatically saved on the phone but

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.619 
automatically saved on the phone but
with<00:02:55.989> a<00:02:56.019> date<00:02:56.230> stamp<00:02:56.500> by<00:02:56.829> the<00:02:56.890> way<00:02:57.099> and<00:02:57.629> what

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
with a date stamp by the way and what

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.860 
with a date stamp by the way and what
I'm<00:02:58.750> going<00:02:58.780> to<00:02:59.079> do<00:02:59.290> is<00:03:00.000> I'm<00:03:01.000> going<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.299> use<00:03:01.629> em

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
I'm going to do is I'm going to use em

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.910 
I'm going to do is I'm going to use em
encoder<00:03:02.319> which<00:03:02.980> is<00:03:03.190> part<00:03:03.489> of<00:03:03.609> the<00:03:03.849> Empire

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
encoder which is part of the Empire

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.460 
encoder which is part of the Empire
actually<00:03:05.940> let's<00:03:06.940> just<00:03:07.000> do<00:03:07.239> em<00:03:07.390> player<00:03:07.660> because

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
actually let's just do em player because

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.339 
actually let's just do em player because
n<00:03:08.620> player<00:03:08.829> will<00:03:09.040> convert<00:03:09.370> videos<00:03:09.940> as<00:03:10.150> well<00:03:10.349> and

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
n player will convert videos as well and

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.559 
n player will convert videos as well and
I<00:03:11.410> think<00:03:11.440> it<00:03:11.650> just<00:03:11.709> uses<00:03:11.920> em<00:03:12.160> encoder<00:03:12.459> so<00:03:13.239> M

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
I think it just uses em encoder so M

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:16.199 
I think it just uses em encoder so M
player<00:03:14.170> and<00:03:14.440> then<00:03:15.250> we'll<00:03:15.430> do<00:03:15.549> the<00:03:15.579> switch<00:03:15.940> for

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
player and then we'll do the switch for

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.210 
player and then we'll do the switch for
V<00:03:16.690> 0<00:03:16.720> which<00:03:17.049> is<00:03:17.200> video<00:03:17.530> out<00:03:17.769> well<00:03:18.010> we<00:03:18.069> don't

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
V 0 which is video out well we don't

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.750 
V 0 which is video out well we don't
want<00:03:18.430> video<00:03:18.760> I'm<00:03:19.209> going<00:03:19.660> to<00:03:19.750> do<00:03:19.930> null<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:20.760> then

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
want video I'm going to do null and then

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.199 
want video I'm going to do null and then
I'll<00:03:21.880> do<00:03:22.319> audio<00:03:23.319> out<00:03:23.380> here<00:03:24.130> and<00:03:24.340> type<00:03:24.849> of<00:03:24.970> audio

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
I'll do audio out here and type of audio

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.449 
I'll do audio out here and type of audio
I<00:03:25.239> want<00:03:25.450> is<00:03:25.599> PCM<00:03:26.319> which<00:03:26.769> is<00:03:26.889> going<00:03:27.040> to<00:03:27.099> be<00:03:27.190> a<00:03:27.220> WAV

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
I want is PCM which is going to be a WAV

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.879 
I want is PCM which is going to be a WAV
file<00:03:27.819> and<00:03:28.540> we're<00:03:28.930> going<00:03:29.049> to<00:03:29.079> say<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.530> file

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
file and we're going to say the file

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:32.009 
file and we're going to say the file
that<00:03:29.919> we're<00:03:30.220> going<00:03:30.310> to<00:03:30.370> output<00:03:30.579> to<00:03:31.120> and<00:03:31.720> we'll

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
that we're going to output to and we'll

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:37.710 
that we're going to output to and we'll
just<00:03:32.169> gave<00:03:32.319> it<00:03:32.470> a<00:03:32.500> name<00:03:32.680> of<00:03:33.299> n900<00:03:35.130> audio<00:03:36.720> dot

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
just gave it a name of n900 audio dot

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.680 
just gave it a name of n900 audio dot
wave<00:03:38.380> so<00:03:39.310> I<00:03:39.340> had<00:03:39.459> export<00:03:39.940> as<00:03:40.090> wav<00:03:40.120> and<00:03:40.329> then<00:03:40.599> we

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
wave so I had export as wav and then we

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.809 
wave so I had export as wav and then we
just<00:03:40.810> have<00:03:40.870> to<00:03:41.109> say<00:03:41.680> what<00:03:42.010> video<00:03:42.370> we<00:03:42.549> want<00:03:42.700> to

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
just have to say what video we want to

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.839 
just have to say what video we want to
grab<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:43.090> audio<00:03:43.329> from<00:03:43.569> which<00:03:44.380> is<00:03:44.530> there<00:03:44.849> hit

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:45.849 
grab the audio from which is there hit

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:48.420

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
having any problems with audio just

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.930 
having any problems with audio just
takes<00:04:56.800> one<00:04:56.950> extra<00:04:57.190> stuff<00:04:57.370> to<00:04:57.490> convert<00:04:57.790> the

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
takes one extra stuff to convert the

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.450 
takes one extra stuff to convert the
audio<00:04:57.970> if<00:04:58.810> anyone<00:04:59.080> knows<00:04:59.200> a<00:04:59.230> better<00:04:59.440> way<00:04:59.710> go

audio if anyone knows a better way go

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.760 
audio if anyone knows a better way go
ahead<00:05:00.670> and<00:05:00.760> comment<00:05:01.350> but<00:05:02.350> I<00:05:02.380> think<00:05:02.470> that's

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
ahead and comment but I think that's

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.640 
ahead and comment but I think that's
probably<00:05:02.890> your<00:05:03.250> best<00:05:03.430> way<00:05:03.730> and<00:05:04.320> unless<00:05:05.320> you

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
probably your best way and unless you

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.910 
probably your best way and unless you
can<00:05:05.770> use<00:05:05.920> you<00:05:06.400> probably<00:05:06.670> use<00:05:06.820> em<00:05:07.560> mplayer<00:05:08.560> to

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:08.920 
can use you probably use em mplayer to

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.020 
can use you probably use em mplayer to
convert<00:05:09.460> the<00:05:09.700> video<00:05:09.970> to<00:05:10.620> another<00:05:12.030> video

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
convert the video to another video

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.660 
convert the video to another video
format<00:05:13.720> but<00:05:14.530> then<00:05:15.340> you're<00:05:15.430> going<00:05:15.520> to<00:05:15.580> be

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 
format but then you're going to be

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.160 
format but then you're going to be
repressing<00:05:16.030> the<00:05:16.330> video<00:05:16.540> and<00:05:16.840> you<00:05:16.900> don't<00:05:17.050> want
