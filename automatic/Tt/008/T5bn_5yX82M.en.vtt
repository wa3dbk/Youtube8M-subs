Farragut the rat catcher right that I

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.889 
Farragut the rat catcher right that I
remember<00:00:52.720> the<00:00:53.200> original<00:00:53.710> idea<00:00:54.010> of<00:00:54.100> transfers

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
remember the original idea of transfers

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.170 
remember the original idea of transfers
was<00:00:55.899> a<00:00:55.930> time-travel<00:00:56.890> piece<00:00:57.160> that<00:00:57.610> Charlie<00:00:58.030> had

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
was a time-travel piece that Charlie had

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.510 
was a time-travel piece that Charlie had
in<00:00:58.329> his<00:00:58.480> head<00:00:58.750> about<00:00:59.079> a<00:00:59.190> time-traveling<00:01:00.190> cop

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
in his head about a time-traveling cop

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.810 
in his head about a time-traveling cop
we<00:01:01.239> took<00:01:01.420> the<00:01:01.570> script<00:01:01.840> and<00:01:02.219> we<00:01:03.219> read<00:01:03.489> it<00:01:03.670> and

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
we took the script and we read it and

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.300 
we took the script and we read it and
then<00:01:03.910> we<00:01:03.969> put<00:01:04.210> it<00:01:04.299> aside<00:01:04.390> and<00:01:04.629> we<00:01:05.290> created<00:01:06.159> our

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
then we put it aside and we created our

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.719 
then we put it aside and we created our
own<00:01:07.380> version<00:01:08.380> of<00:01:08.470> transit<00:01:09.010> I<00:01:09.280> think<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.580> only

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
own version of transit I think the only

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.760 
own version of transit I think the only
thing<00:01:09.850> that<00:01:10.180> we<00:01:10.270> kept<00:01:10.540> was<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:10.900> idea<00:01:11.260> that<00:01:11.590> he

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
thing that we kept was the idea that he

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.649 
thing that we kept was the idea that he
was<00:01:11.950> a<00:01:11.979> cop<00:01:12.250> from<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:12.520> future<00:01:12.640> who<00:01:13.210> came<00:01:13.450> back

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
was a cop from the future who came back

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.730 
was a cop from the future who came back
to<00:01:13.720> the<00:01:13.990> past<00:01:14.260> and<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:16.479> ancestor<00:01:17.290> thing<00:01:17.530> was

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
to the past and the ancestor thing was

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.200 
to the past and the ancestor thing was
in<00:01:17.890> there<00:01:18.070> that<00:01:18.159> he<00:01:18.280> that<00:01:18.460> he<00:01:18.520> trapped<00:01:18.940> that<00:01:19.120> he

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
in there that he that he trapped that he

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.090 
in there that he that he trapped that he
who<00:01:19.330> was<00:01:19.540> the<00:01:19.780> abscess<00:01:20.290> the<00:01:20.470> time<00:01:20.680> travel

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
who was the abscess the time travel

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.770 
who was the abscess the time travel
through<00:01:21.280> an<00:01:21.369> ancestor<00:01:22.000> was<00:01:22.150> in<00:01:22.299> there<00:01:22.479> yeah<00:01:22.750> I

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
through an ancestor was in there yeah I

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.120 
through an ancestor was in there yeah I
think<00:01:22.900> that<00:01:23.170> was<00:01:23.320> in<00:01:23.470> the<00:01:23.560> air<00:01:23.619> we<00:01:23.770> liked<00:01:23.950> that

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
think that was in the air we liked that

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.560 
think that was in the air we liked that
idea<00:01:24.310> we<00:01:24.640> kept<00:01:24.909> that<00:01:25.090> because<00:01:25.330> we<00:01:25.450> thought

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
idea we kept that because we thought

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.850 
idea we kept that because we thought
that<00:01:25.750> was<00:01:25.840> pretty<00:01:26.049> cool<00:01:26.290> when<00:01:26.530> we<00:01:26.560> played

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
that was pretty cool when we played

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.830 
that was pretty cool when we played
obviously<00:01:27.670> with<00:01:27.790> that<00:01:27.940> a<00:01:27.970> lot<00:01:28.240> brains<00:01:28.630> will

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
obviously with that a lot brains will

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.140 
obviously with that a lot brains will
administer<00:01:29.080> the<00:01:29.409> transfer<00:01:29.830> center<00:01:30.040> he'll<00:01:31.030> be

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
administer the transfer center he'll be

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:32.609 
administer the transfer center he'll be
in<00:01:31.240> charge<00:01:31.479> of<00:01:31.630> my<00:01:31.720> bones<00:01:31.990> when<00:01:32.290> I'm<00:01:32.409> gone

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
in charge of my bones when I'm gone

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.550 
in charge of my bones when I'm gone
don't<00:01:33.369> worry<00:01:33.549> Jack<00:01:33.850> I<00:01:34.180> don't<00:01:34.540> hold<00:01:34.840> a<00:01:34.960> grudge<00:01:34.990> I

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
don't worry Jack I don't hold a grudge I

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.510 
don't worry Jack I don't hold a grudge I
still<00:01:35.890> think<00:01:36.070> it's<00:01:36.159> one<00:01:36.280> of<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.430> most

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
still think it's one of the most

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.520 
still think it's one of the most
credible<00:01:37.799> time-travel<00:01:39.780> sort<00:01:40.780> of<00:01:40.900> inventions

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
credible time-travel sort of inventions

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.780 
credible time-travel sort of inventions
you<00:01:41.650> know<00:01:41.830> I<00:01:41.860> mean<00:01:42.070> people<00:01:42.340> get<00:01:42.430> into<00:01:42.729> a

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
you know I mean people get into a

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.640 
you know I mean people get into a
machine<00:01:43.210> and<00:01:43.540> traveling<00:01:43.930> back<00:01:44.049> in<00:01:44.080> time<00:01:44.260> and

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
machine and traveling back in time and

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.070 
machine and traveling back in time and
we've<00:01:44.770> seen<00:01:44.979> that<00:01:45.159> forever<00:01:45.520> but<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:46.510> idea<00:01:46.930> of

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
we've seen that forever but the idea of

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.719 
we've seen that forever but the idea of
someone<00:01:47.350> being<00:01:47.650> able<00:01:47.799> to<00:01:47.950> inhabit<00:01:48.340> the

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
someone being able to inhabit the

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.060 
someone being able to inhabit the
consciousness<00:01:49.540> of<00:01:49.720> an<00:01:50.170> ancestor<00:01:50.770> is<00:01:50.860> pretty

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
consciousness of an ancestor is pretty

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.030 
consciousness of an ancestor is pretty
cool

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
cool

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.510 
cool
I<00:01:53.260> think<00:01:54.260> the<00:01:54.380> villain<00:01:54.740> was<00:01:54.920> in<00:01:55.100> there<00:01:55.280> he<00:01:55.400> may

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
I think the villain was in there he may

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.340 
I think the villain was in there he may
even<00:01:55.670> have<00:01:55.820> been<00:01:56.000> called<00:01:56.270> Whistler<00:01:56.690> but<00:01:56.810> I<00:01:56.870> he

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
even have been called Whistler but I he

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.800 
even have been called Whistler but I he
had<00:01:57.440> a<00:01:57.500> completely<00:01:57.800> different

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
had a completely different

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.880 
had a completely different
