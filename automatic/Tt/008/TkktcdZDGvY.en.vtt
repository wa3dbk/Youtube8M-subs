it's<00:01:36.150> up<00:01:36.240> there<00:01:36.390> attached<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.960> bolt<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.320> I

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
it's up there attached to the bolt and I

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.980 
it's up there attached to the bolt and I
have<00:01:37.710> two<00:01:38.009> wrenches<00:01:38.280> hooked<00:01:38.700> together<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.270> I

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
have two wrenches hooked together and I

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.080 
have two wrenches hooked together and I
can<00:01:40.200> move<00:01:40.380> them<00:01:40.710> like<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.549> I'll<00:01:41.729> give<00:01:41.909> me<00:01:42.000> an

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
can move them like this I'll give me an

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.350 
can move them like this I'll give me an
extra<00:01:42.450> foot<00:01:43.409> of<00:01:43.530> leverage<00:01:43.950> on<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.189> bolt<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:45.329> I

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
extra foot of leverage on that bolt so I

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.510 
extra foot of leverage on that bolt so I
can<00:01:45.570> break<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.899> loose<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.890> before<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.220> get<00:01:47.399> too

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
can break it loose so before I get too

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.770 
can break it loose so before I get too
crazy<00:01:47.729> disconnecting<00:01:48.390> things<00:01:48.570> on<00:01:48.689> the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
crazy disconnecting things on the

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.389 
crazy disconnecting things on the
starter<00:01:49.110> I'm<00:01:49.229> going<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.439> go<00:01:49.530> ahead<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.979> remove

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
starter I'm going to go ahead and remove

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.120 
starter I'm going to go ahead and remove
the<00:01:51.119> battery<00:01:51.630> connection<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.770> negative

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
the battery connection the negative

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.499 
the battery connection the negative
battery<00:01:53.310> terminal<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.090> doesn't<00:01:54.329> start

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
battery terminal so it doesn't start

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.730 
battery terminal so it doesn't start
sparking<00:01:54.990> on<00:01:55.110> me<00:01:55.290> or<00:01:55.350> anything<00:01:55.409> when<00:01:55.649> I'm

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
sparking on me or anything when I'm

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.010 
sparking on me or anything when I'm
working<00:01:56.040> below<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.479> and<00:01:57.479> now<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:57.899> that's

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
working below it and now that that's

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.109 
working below it and now that that's
done<00:01:58.439> I've<00:01:59.070> already<00:01:59.280> popped<00:01:59.610> off<00:01:59.820> this<00:01:59.969> little

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
done I've already popped off this little

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.870 
done I've already popped off this little
plastic<00:02:00.450> piece<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:01.259> was<00:02:01.680> sitting<00:02:02.189> just<00:02:02.430> like

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
plastic piece it was sitting just like

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.569 
plastic piece it was sitting just like
this<00:02:03.329> up<00:02:04.259> underneath<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.890> starter<00:02:05.310> on<00:02:05.340> that

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
this up underneath the starter on that

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.910 
this up underneath the starter on that
little<00:02:05.820> bolt<00:02:06.030> right<00:02:06.210> there<00:02:06.479> that's<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:07.110> 14

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
little bolt right there that's a 14

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.249 
little bolt right there that's a 14
millimeter<00:02:08.390> so<00:02:09.390> I'm<00:02:09.479> going<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.629> unscrew<00:02:09.899> that

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
millimeter so I'm going to unscrew that

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.410 
millimeter so I'm going to unscrew that
and<00:02:10.470> pop<00:02:10.770> off<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.039> connection<00:02:11.700> from<00:02:12.180> the

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
and pop off that connection from the

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.020 
and pop off that connection from the
starter

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
starter

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.300 
starter
and<00:02:13.120> then<00:02:13.780> there's<00:02:14.020> one<00:02:14.530> more<00:02:14.800> connection<00:02:15.069> on

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
and then there's one more connection on

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.710 
and then there's one more connection on
the<00:02:15.430> other<00:02:15.459> side<00:02:16.000> you<00:02:16.150> can<00:02:16.270> barely<00:02:16.630> see<00:02:17.140> it

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
the other side you can barely see it

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.820 
the other side you can barely see it
just<00:02:19.720> plugs<00:02:20.110> right<00:02:20.200> into<00:02:20.470> this<00:02:20.680> little

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
just plugs right into this little

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.680 
just plugs right into this little
plastic<00:02:21.190> connection<00:02:21.910> on<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.090> starter<00:02:22.450> so<00:02:22.630> I'm

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
plastic connection on the starter so I'm

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.570 
plastic connection on the starter so I'm
going<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:22.870> undo<00:02:23.080> that<00:02:23.110> as<00:02:23.380> well<00:02:23.560> that'll<00:02:24.490> get

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
going to undo that as well that'll get

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.160 
going to undo that as well that'll get
rid<00:02:24.640> of<00:02:24.850> all<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.090> electrical<00:02:25.540> components

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
rid of all the electrical components

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.620 
rid of all the electrical components
from<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:26.440> starter<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:26.980> allow<00:02:27.670> me<00:02:27.819> to<00:02:28.030> pull<00:02:28.600> it

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
from the starter and allow me to pull it

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.930 
from the starter and allow me to pull it
out<00:02:28.870> from<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.140> transmission<00:02:29.620> there's<00:02:30.580> a<00:02:30.670> shot

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
out from the transmission there's a shot

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.970 
out from the transmission there's a shot
with<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:31.150> disconnected<00:02:31.720> got<00:02:32.380> that<00:02:32.560> nut<00:02:32.800> off

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
with it disconnected got that nut off

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.220 
with it disconnected got that nut off
and<00:02:33.220> then<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.430> little<00:02:33.730> wire<00:02:34.330> just<00:02:34.750> pops<00:02:34.989> down

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
and then a little wire just pops down

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.020 
and then a little wire just pops down
off<00:02:35.440> of<00:02:35.470> that<00:02:35.620> bottom<00:02:36.010> part<00:02:36.250> the<00:02:36.760> little

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
off of that bottom part the little

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.910 
off of that bottom part the little
plastic<00:02:37.300> connection<00:02:38.020> is<00:02:38.140> down<00:02:38.350> there<00:02:38.620> with<00:02:38.650> it

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
plastic connection is down there with it

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.800 
plastic connection is down there with it
as<00:02:39.010> well<00:02:39.250> that's<00:02:39.730> popped<00:02:40.090> off<00:02:40.270> the<00:02:40.300> starter

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
as well that's popped off the starter

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.780 
as well that's popped off the starter
remember<00:02:41.620> that<00:02:41.739> if<00:02:41.830> you<00:02:41.920> try<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.190> do<00:02:42.400> this<00:02:42.580> with

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
remember that if you try to do this with

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.940 
remember that if you try to do this with
your<00:02:42.910> vehicle<00:02:43.300> hot<00:02:43.540> you're<00:02:44.110> gonna<00:02:44.350> have<00:02:44.650> a<00:02:44.680> bad

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
your vehicle hot you're gonna have a bad

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.650 
your vehicle hot you're gonna have a bad
time<00:02:44.980> because<00:02:45.489> these<00:02:45.790> things<00:02:46.030> are<00:02:46.239> right<00:02:46.450> up

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
time because these things are right up

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.350 
time because these things are right up
right<00:02:46.900> next<00:02:47.080> to<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.380> bolts<00:02:48.000> now<00:02:49.000> I've<00:02:49.180> got

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
right next to the bolts now I've got

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.830 
right next to the bolts now I've got
those<00:02:49.540> two<00:02:49.600> bolts<00:02:50.170> out<00:02:51.120> on<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.330> sides<00:02:52.600> of<00:02:52.750> the

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
those two bolts out on the sides of the

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.710 
those two bolts out on the sides of the
starter<00:02:53.640> that<00:02:54.640> hole<00:02:55.000> for<00:02:55.269> the<00:02:55.330> starter<00:02:55.660> is

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
starter that hole for the starter is

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.300 
starter that hole for the starter is
pretty<00:02:55.930> worthless<00:02:56.080> because<00:02:56.709> the<00:02:56.890> starter

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
pretty worthless because the starter

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.850 
pretty worthless because the starter
comes<00:02:58.000> out<00:02:58.180> better<00:02:58.450> down<00:02:58.690> here<00:02:58.720> anyway<00:02:59.440> so<00:02:59.830> I

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
comes out better down here anyway so I

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.199 
comes out better down here anyway so I
pulled<00:03:00.160> it<00:03:00.310> down<00:03:00.489> out<00:03:00.850> by<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.420> axle<00:03:02.019> and<00:03:03.060> that

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.720 

is<00:03:07.209> it<00:03:07.480> so<00:03:08.380> there<00:03:08.500> we<00:03:08.590> go<00:03:08.709> now<00:03:09.489> I'm<00:03:09.550> going<00:03:09.670> to

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
is it so there we go now I'm going to

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.610 
is it so there we go now I'm going to
take<00:03:09.880> the<00:03:09.970> other<00:03:10.030> starter<00:03:10.480> put<00:03:11.140> it<00:03:11.230> back<00:03:11.380> in

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
take the other starter put it back in

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.559 
take the other starter put it back in
next<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.100> the<00:03:12.220> axle<00:03:12.700> and<00:03:12.880> try<00:03:13.209> to<00:03:13.269> mount<00:03:13.510> that

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
next to the axle and try to mount that

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.660 
next to the axle and try to mount that
