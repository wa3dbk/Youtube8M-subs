ourselves we just knew too steep of what
we<00:01:28.910> do<00:01:29.090> and<00:01:29.330> good<00:01:30.140> things<00:01:30.350> will<00:01:30.380> happen

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.380

were tough and physical and

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.010 
were tough and physical and
fundamentally<00:02:12.430> sound<00:02:12.610> from<00:02:13.480> what<00:02:13.720> we<00:02:13.810> watched

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
fundamentally sound from what we watched

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.140 
fundamentally sound from what we watched
on<00:02:14.170> film<00:02:14.440> they<00:02:14.650> give<00:02:14.980> up<00:02:15.130> very<00:02:15.490> very<00:02:15.550> very<00:02:15.910> few

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
on film they give up very very very few

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.840 
on film they give up very very very few
penalties<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.110> we<00:02:17.530> knew<00:02:17.620> that<00:02:17.800> coming<00:02:17.980> in<00:02:18.220> so

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
penalties and we knew that coming in so

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.280 
penalties and we knew that coming in so
we<00:02:18.970> just<00:02:19.000> had<00:02:19.210> to<00:02:19.330> match<00:02:19.540> that<00:02:19.570> and<00:02:19.780> matched<00:02:20.140> up

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
we just had to match that and matched up

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:38.090 
we just had to match that and matched up
with<00:02:20.380> physicality
