end<00:02:18.440> and<00:02:19.440> it's<00:02:19.620> made<00:02:19.800> out<00:02:19.830> of<00:02:20.010> stainless<00:02:20.250> steel

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
end and it's made out of stainless steel

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.290 
end and it's made out of stainless steel
the<00:02:22.790> grips<00:02:23.790> are<00:02:23.970> pretty<00:02:24.180> grippy<00:02:26.300> contours

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
the grips are pretty grippy contours

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.610 
the grips are pretty grippy contours
your<00:02:27.720> hand<00:02:29.330> fits<00:02:30.330> me<00:02:30.540> perfectly

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
your hand fits me perfectly

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:39.320 
your hand fits me perfectly
I<00:02:33.620> think<00:02:34.620> it's<00:02:34.800> 25<00:02:35.370> centimeters<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:38.330> 12

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
I think it's 25 centimeters and 12

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.860 
I think it's 25 centimeters and 12
centimeters<00:02:40.160> handle<00:02:43.550> it<00:02:44.550> also<00:02:44.910> has<00:02:45.570> a

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
centimeters handle it also has a

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.310 
centimeters handle it also has a
sharpener

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
sharpener

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.430 
sharpener
also<00:02:49.320> I<00:02:49.350> think<00:02:50.480> Rob<00:02:51.480> elastic<00:02:51.900> waistbands<00:02:52.500> I

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
also I think Rob elastic waistbands I

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.360 
also I think Rob elastic waistbands I
think<00:02:55.440> that's<00:02:55.650> how<00:02:55.830> you<00:02:55.860> do<00:02:56.190> it

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
think that's how you do it

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.740 
think that's how you do it
I'm<00:02:56.520> not<00:02:56.730> sure<00:02:57.350> I'm<00:02:58.350> not<00:02:59.120> never<00:03:00.120> sharpening<00:03:00.690> a

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750
