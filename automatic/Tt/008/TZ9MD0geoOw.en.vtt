pill to get scalp row and one of them is

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.870 
pill to get scalp row and one of them is
you<00:00:28.109> have<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.349> get<00:00:28.500> fifty<00:00:28.859> one<00:00:29.369> shot<00:00:29.640> one<00:00:29.849> kill

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.060 
you have to get fifty one shot one kill
metals<00:00:30.420> which<00:00:30.689> means<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.260> have<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.470> snipe<00:00:31.769> and

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
metals which means you have to snipe and

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.030 
metals which means you have to snipe and
get<00:00:32.189> 50<00:00:32.460> kills<00:00:32.669> with<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.850> sniper<00:00:33.410> and<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.980> just

get 50 kills with a sniper and I just

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.740 
get 50 kills with a sniper and I just
hope<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.520> kill<00:00:35.730> them<00:00:35.880> one<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.360> one<00:00:36.540> hit

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.950 
hope that you kill them one and one hit
with<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.050> but<00:00:37.260> i<00:00:37.469> think<00:00:38.070> i<00:00:38.160> use<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.960> l96a1

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
with it but i think i use the l96a1

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.049 
with it but i think i use the l96a1
because<00:00:40.739> it's<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.160> most<00:00:41.309> consistent<00:00:41.610> one<00:00:41.879> who

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
because it's the most consistent one who

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.400 
because it's the most consistent one who
killed<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.750> get<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.440> know<00:00:43.739> Snipes<00:00:44.010> with<00:00:45.410> so

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
killed to get a you know Snipes with so

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.779 
killed to get a you know Snipes with so
I<00:00:46.469> would<00:00:46.620> recommend<00:00:46.680> using<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.219> gun<00:00:47.430> for

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
I would recommend using that gun for

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.580 
I would recommend using that gun for

really awesome that way you can call on

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.430 
really awesome that way you can call on
your<00:02:47.550> killstreaks<00:02:47.970> faster<00:02:48.390> which<00:02:48.870> is<00:02:49.080> pretty

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
your killstreaks faster which is pretty

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.920 
your killstreaks faster which is pretty
easily<00:02:49.650> of<00:02:50.459> course<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:50.820> can<00:02:50.940> pick<00:02:51.090> up<00:02:51.239> weapons

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
easily of course you can pick up weapons

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.960 
easily of course you can pick up weapons
off<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.230> ground<00:02:52.530> faster<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:53.489> can<00:02:53.640> swap

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
off the ground faster and you can swap

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.530 
off the ground faster and you can swap
your<00:02:54.180> weapons<00:02:54.540> faster<00:02:54.989> so<00:02:55.950> I<00:02:56.580> just<00:02:57.209> think<00:02:57.360> it

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
your weapons faster so I just think it

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.500 
your weapons faster so I just think it
really<00:02:58.160> it<00:02:59.160> really<00:02:59.220> changes<00:02:59.880> like<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.239> speed

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
really it really changes like the speed

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.180 
really it really changes like the speed
at<00:03:00.660> which<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:00.810> can<00:03:01.019> play<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.290> game<00:03:01.470> because

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
at which you can play the game because

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.340 
at which you can play the game because
like<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.670> noticed<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:03.510> like<00:03:03.720> with<00:03:03.870> scout<00:03:04.110> pro
