00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:17.780
 now you are going to listen to what I say 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:21.590
 mobile that was that is no longer nor are I 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:26.720
 as immense as the sky I will be able to 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:31.720
 cardin so that your body sleeps in a 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:35.680
 thicker and wide wider sea that you live 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:38.370
 I'm going to build a ship to arrive 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.370
 the dream 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:47.860
 in a black universe as the slogan no more 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:51.680
 I'm going to build your boat so that 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:56.630
 name the sad sir we are one of the 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:01:04.810
 back and loving we will not leave and although nobody 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:04.810
 he creates it by flying 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:12.730
 far where nobody us to 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.730
 thought 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:27.159
 taking more women from free as the 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:27.159
 wind and live 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:40.160
 and loving you to get out of breath 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:44.780
 I used to dream dreaming in the second without 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:48.100
 reason without colors without laments without anyone 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.100
 to endure 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.180
 but we do not know 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.060
 do not 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.860
 zone 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.300
 vivÃ­s 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:23.660

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.680
 this love this because I know that that is not 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:29.459
 true 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:34.340
 and I'm living it 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.340
 my love is not like that 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.230
 It is very good 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:55.189

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.980
 do not 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.340
 super one hundred percent to my trade 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.530
 in character 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.750

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.970

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.200

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.150
 number for contract please because 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.340
 have made an extraordinary duo the 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.349
 true that I thought baby was not beating 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.959
 I was doing it because of the salsa theme that 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:38.390
 anthony in the song I thought it sack but 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.000
 I thought about it but you let me leave with the 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:45.349
 mouth open and pleasantly surprised 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.680
 thank you very much, mari carmen sea 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:51.590
 very good very well baby I must tell you that 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.900
 this has been your test of fire 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.790
 Upon entering the room has heard 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.890
 very rich the two have done very well 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.599
 I worry about Maria when 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.250
 tune-ups are very followed and very 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:02.900
 serious is no longer worrying but in 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.160
 The two have generally looked very rich 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.739
 9 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:10.459
 thank you very much Ricardo Ricardo 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:12.080
 we hear good as you know is 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.640
 this challenge always find it more difficult 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.340
 the artists that have to change 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.220
 gender move on to another record sing in 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.500
 another style and really here who 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.200
 had really the wall to jump the 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.630
 abb I think marc knows that this song 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.229
 It works better for you as we all know 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.990
 historical of the true marking this 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:34.690
 but I think 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.200
 baby that you have passed the test well I think 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.380
 I have found good solutions 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.820
 thinking about how he sees the real baby 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.680
 would face the song entertained the 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.260
 difficulties that this song puts you and 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.150
 I think both have gone well the challenge 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.530
 I think this is the first concert of 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.740
 I am the one in which I feel that both 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:56.560
 they are more amazing than solos 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.180
 when the wolves are the hardest part 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.280
 because he receives in the letter receives in the 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.410
 song the same day this man for 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.720
 today in the morning then it's really 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.550
 a merit of you and your teachers 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.560

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.900
