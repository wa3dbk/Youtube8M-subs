00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
several lights around that I think as

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.699 
several lights around that I think as
far<00:02:24.310> as<00:02:24.489> I<00:02:24.730> know<00:02:24.790> all<00:02:24.939> the<00:02:25.180> lights<00:02:25.390> are<00:02:25.569> working

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
far as I know all the lights are working

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.679 
far as I know all the lights are working
you<00:02:26.709> can<00:02:26.860> see<00:02:27.040> some<00:02:27.280> staining<00:02:27.670> in<00:02:28.030> there<00:02:28.450> but

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:28.689 
you can see some staining in there but

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:30.750 
you can see some staining in there but
that<00:02:28.870> was<00:02:29.079> before<00:02:29.650> it's<00:02:29.829> all<00:02:29.980> been<00:02:30.159> sealed<00:02:30.459> now

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.600 
that was before it's all been sealed now
and<00:02:31.060> I<00:02:31.840> think<00:02:32.049> as<00:02:32.500> far<00:02:32.530> as<00:02:32.739> I<00:02:32.980> know<00:02:33.040> nothing's

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
starter for this to get it going

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.050 
starter for this to get it going
usually<00:02:47.709> takes<00:02:47.950> an<00:02:48.099> hour<00:02:48.250> or<00:02:48.370> two<00:02:48.609> for<00:02:48.819> it<00:02:48.940> to

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
that's just a couple years we replaced

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.140 
that's just a couple years we replaced
that<00:03:58.330> to<00:03:58.709> transmission<00:03:59.709> was<00:04:00.640> flush<00:04:00.909> when<00:04:01.060> we

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
that to transmission was flush when we

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.300 
that to transmission was flush when we
first<00:04:01.390> got<00:04:01.599> it<00:04:01.840> the<00:04:02.110> radiators<00:04:02.739> been<00:04:02.950> flushed

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
first got it the radiators been flushed

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.960 
first got it the radiators been flushed
and<00:04:03.610> it's<00:04:04.239> a<00:04:04.480> it's<00:04:04.810> a<00:04:05.019> good<00:04:05.140> running<00:04:05.500> vehicle

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
and it's a it's a good running vehicle

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.180 
and it's a it's a good running vehicle
so<00:04:06.970> I'm<00:04:07.090> hoping<00:04:07.420> it'll<00:04:07.599> find<00:04:07.870> a<00:04:07.989> good<00:04:08.140> home<00:04:08.349> for

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.360 
so I'm hoping it'll find a good home for
somebody<00:04:09.400> that<00:04:09.700> likes<00:04:09.909> it<00:04:10.180> and<00:04:10.680> will<00:04:11.680> get<00:04:11.890> lots
