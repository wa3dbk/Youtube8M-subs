00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
or did they just shut but this will be

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.170 
or did they just shut but this will be
open<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:54.430> there<00:02:55.430> will<00:02:55.519> be<00:02:55.550> three<00:02:55.850> things<00:02:55.970> in

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
open and there will be three things in

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.759 
open and there will be three things in
here<00:02:56.300> not<00:02:56.570> about<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.870> armor<00:02:57.170> in<00:02:57.260> the<00:02:57.380> armor<00:02:57.680> I

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
here not about the armor in the armor I

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.530 
here not about the armor in the armor I
have<00:03:00.769> the<00:03:00.920> armor<00:03:01.370> in<00:03:01.550> layman's<00:03:02.000> way<00:03:02.060> already

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
have the armor in layman's way already

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.000 
have the armor in layman's way already
and<00:03:02.810> I<00:03:03.590> noticed<00:03:03.890> in<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.160> in<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:05.830> comments<00:03:06.830> on

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
and I noticed in the in the comments on

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.050 
and I noticed in the in the comments on
the<00:03:07.190> Nexus<00:03:07.970> for<00:03:08.630> this<00:03:08.810> mod<00:03:09.080> this<00:03:09.910> people<00:03:10.910> were

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
the Nexus for this mod this people were

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.370 
the Nexus for this mod this people were
saying<00:03:11.360> they<00:03:11.480> did<00:03:11.630> not<00:03:11.720> have<00:03:11.900> well<00:03:12.200> there's<00:03:12.350> a

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
saying they did not have well there's a

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.830 
saying they did not have well there's a
reason<00:03:12.650> for<00:03:12.680> that<00:03:12.800> it's<00:03:13.550> because<00:03:13.580> if<00:03:14.510> you<00:03:14.660> take

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
reason for that it's because if you take

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.900 
reason for that it's because if you take
the<00:03:14.959> armor<00:03:15.200> off<00:03:15.230> well<00:03:16.190> if<00:03:16.370> you<00:03:16.459> don't<00:03:16.610> have<00:03:16.760> the

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
the armor off well if you don't have the

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.540 
the armor off well if you don't have the
armor<00:03:17.120> on<00:03:17.269> it<00:03:17.900> doesn't<00:03:18.470> show<00:03:18.590> up<00:03:19.180> so<00:03:20.180> yeah

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
armor on it doesn't show up so yeah

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.760 
armor on it doesn't show up so yeah
put<00:03:23.550> the<00:03:23.670> armor<00:03:23.910> on<00:03:23.940> it's<00:03:24.480> still<00:03:24.690> on<00:03:24.810> here<00:03:25.290> but

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
put the armor on it's still on here but

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.080 
put the armor on it's still on here but
that's<00:03:26.400> because<00:03:26.550> you<00:03:26.700> have<00:03:26.790> to<00:03:26.850> close<00:03:27.060> your

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
that's because you have to close your

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.300 
that's because you have to close your
pip-boy<00:03:27.450> open<00:03:28.440> them<00:03:28.530> back<00:03:28.650> up<00:03:28.860> and<00:03:29.040> there<00:03:29.250> it

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
pip-boy open them back up and there it

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.690 
pip-boy open them back up and there it
is

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
is

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.260

the<00:03:33.390> officials<00:03:34.640> or<00:03:35.750> by<00:03:37.580> default<00:03:38.580> you'll<00:03:38.850> have

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
the officials or by default you'll have

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.040
