00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.720 

I<00:00:19.699> use<00:00:20.699> very<00:00:21.259> traditional<00:00:22.259> notation<00:00:22.730> until

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
I use very traditional notation until

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:32.810 
I use very traditional notation until
the<00:00:23.849> point<00:00:24.090> when<00:00:25.020> it<00:00:25.259> cannot<00:00:25.529> be<00:00:25.800> used<00:00:26.070> anymore

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.279 

I<00:00:32.870> have<00:00:33.870> invented<00:00:34.590> or<00:00:34.949> used<00:00:35.670> some<00:00:36.120> some<00:00:36.930> signs

00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:37.289 
I have invented or used some some signs

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:41.209 
I have invented or used some some signs
which<00:00:37.710> are<00:00:37.949> already<00:00:38.579> in<00:00:39.059> use<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.750> try<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.500> keep

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
which are already in use I try to keep

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.149 
which are already in use I try to keep
as<00:00:41.550> simple<00:00:42.539> as<00:00:42.690> possible<00:00:42.930> but<00:00:43.500> it's<00:00:43.949> not

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:44.159 
as simple as possible but it's not

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:49.399 
as simple as possible but it's not
always<00:00:44.370> very<00:00:44.789> simple<00:00:47.839> this<00:00:48.839> is<00:00:49.019> the<00:00:49.170> piece<00:00:49.379> of

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:49.409 
always very simple this is the piece of

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:51.289 
always very simple this is the piece of
music<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.979> is<00:00:50.159> not<00:00:50.190> music<00:00:50.549> it's<00:00:50.790> material

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:51.299 
music that is not music it's material

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:53.689 
music that is not music it's material
which<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.960> which<00:00:52.290> is<00:00:52.320> falling<00:00:52.710> apart<00:00:53.100> if<00:00:53.519> you

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
which is which is falling apart if you

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.060 
which is which is falling apart if you
can<00:00:53.850> do<00:00:53.969> this<00:00:55.519> so<00:00:56.519> that<00:00:56.670> you<00:00:56.879> hear<00:00:57.180> yourself

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
can do this so that you hear yourself

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.410 
can do this so that you hear yourself
and<00:00:59.989> then<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.110> bowl<00:01:01.940> doesn't<00:01:02.940> do<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> tremolo

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
and then the bowl doesn't do a tremolo

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.870 
and then the bowl doesn't do a tremolo
the<00:01:03.629> boat<00:01:03.839> comes<00:01:07.310> just<00:01:08.310> comes<00:01:08.580> in

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
the boat comes just comes in

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.279 
the boat comes just comes in
and<00:01:10.969> the<00:01:11.600> tremolo<00:01:11.840> starts<00:01:12.880> in<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:14.119> next<00:01:14.360> bar

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:19.510 

that's<00:01:18.289> it's<00:01:18.710> another<00:01:19.039> thing<00:01:19.280> that<00:01:19.430> was

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
that's it's another thing that was

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.700 
that's it's another thing that was
impossible<00:01:19.820> -<00:01:20.119> really<00:01:20.810> hard<00:01:21.289> -<00:01:21.409> how<00:01:21.530> do<00:01:21.590> you

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
impossible - really hard - how do you

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.130 
impossible - really hard - how do you
notate<00:01:22.039> that<00:01:22.070> whatever<00:01:22.880> happens<00:01:23.360> you<00:01:23.960> have<00:01:23.990> to

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
notate that whatever happens you have to

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.560 
notate that whatever happens you have to
be<00:01:24.350> able<00:01:24.590> to<00:01:24.679> have<00:01:24.829> this<00:01:24.979> completely<00:01:25.610> lose

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
be able to have this completely lose

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.289 
be able to have this completely lose
hand<00:01:27.130> which<00:01:28.130> also<00:01:28.549> at<00:01:28.789> the<00:01:28.880> end<00:01:29.060> of<00:01:29.179> this

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
hand which also at the end of this

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:36.270 
hand which also at the end of this
movement<00:01:29.689> when<00:01:29.750> you<00:01:29.869> get<00:01:29.990> to<00:01:30.079> come<00:01:30.229> to<00:01:30.380> this

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.429 

that<00:01:37.280> you<00:01:37.460> and<00:01:37.640> you<00:01:37.789> are<00:01:37.880> never<00:01:38.060> doing<00:01:38.509> doing

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
that you and you are never doing doing

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.179 
that you and you are never doing doing
this<00:01:39.590> kind<00:01:39.860> of<00:01:39.979> thing<00:01:40.220> so<00:01:41.829> this<00:01:42.829> one<00:01:43.069> is<00:01:43.159> like

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
this kind of thing so this one is like

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.160 
this kind of thing so this one is like
that<00:01:43.369> and<00:01:43.880> then

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.360 

well<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.290> one<00:01:49.440> is<00:01:49.530> in<00:01:49.650> fact<00:01:49.830> very

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
well this one is in fact very

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:57.999 
well this one is in fact very
straightforward

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.179 

but<00:01:59.009> with<00:01:59.189> with<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.670> lightness<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.180> touch<00:02:00.240> it

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
but with with the lightness of touch it

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.020 
but with with the lightness of touch it
always<00:02:02.189> has<00:02:02.579> this<00:02:02.790> this<00:02:03.920> feeling<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.670> demo

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
always has this this feeling of the demo

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.029 
always has this this feeling of the demo
you<00:02:06.180> have<00:02:06.360> more<00:02:06.539> fingers<00:02:06.899> than<00:02:06.930> than<00:02:07.530> than

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
you have more fingers than than than

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.309 
you have more fingers than than than
what<00:02:08.489> we<00:02:08.670> think<00:02:08.880> actually<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.810> can<00:02:09.959> think<00:02:10.200> of

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
what we think actually you can think of

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:17.680 
what we think actually you can think of
it<00:02:10.440> as<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:11.120> almost<00:02:12.120> as<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.510> trill<00:02:12.810> of<00:02:12.840> thumb<00:02:13.709> but

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.850 

then<00:02:18.690> it<00:02:18.810> has<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.110> then<00:02:19.640> then<00:02:20.640> use<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.860> use

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
then it has to then then use that use

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.070 
then it has to then then use that use
that<00:02:23.190> kind<00:02:23.430> of<00:02:23.610> being<00:02:24.209> irregular<00:02:24.780> with<00:02:24.900> the

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
that kind of being irregular with the

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.770 
that kind of being irregular with the
with<00:02:25.349> the<00:02:25.440> fingers<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.180> always<00:02:27.180> so<00:02:27.540> light

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
with the fingers and always so light

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.270 
with the fingers and always so light
that<00:02:28.200> that<00:02:28.860> we<00:02:29.069> also<00:02:29.250> hear<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.850> open<00:02:30.360> string

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.830 

it's<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.459> only<00:02:35.580> way<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:35.850> know<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.330> that<00:02:36.660> you

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
it's the only way I know that that you

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.870 
it's the only way I know that that you
can<00:02:36.989> basically<00:02:37.140> play<00:02:37.709> a<00:02:37.739> six<00:02:38.010> note<00:02:38.220> chord<00:02:38.580> on

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
can basically play a six note chord on

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:47.390 
can basically play a six note chord on
the<00:02:39.330> Chandler<00:02:44.360> yeah<00:02:45.360> I<00:02:45.860> don't<00:02:46.860> think<00:02:47.130> that

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
the Chandler yeah I don't think that

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.160 
the Chandler yeah I don't think that
anybody<00:02:48.090> sitting<00:02:48.480> in<00:02:48.569> the<00:02:48.660> audience<00:02:48.840> should

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
anybody sitting in the audience should

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.220 
anybody sitting in the audience should
ever<00:02:49.349> notice<00:02:49.799> the<00:02:50.099> fact<00:02:50.640> that<00:02:50.970> there<00:02:51.690> is<00:02:51.870> some

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
ever notice the fact that there is some

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.960 
ever notice the fact that there is some
extended<00:02:53.160> technique<00:02:53.670> being<00:02:54.390> used<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:56.730> thing

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
extended technique being used the thing

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.000 
extended technique being used the thing
that<00:02:57.209> we<00:02:57.390> as<00:02:57.569> interpreters<00:02:58.319> have<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.620> learn<00:02:58.799> is

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
that we as interpreters have to learn is

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.830 
that we as interpreters have to learn is
how<00:02:59.040> to<00:02:59.220> assimilate<00:02:59.700> them<00:03:00.150> so<00:03:00.390> that<00:03:00.600> they

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
how to assimilate them so that they

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:09.760 
how to assimilate them so that they
sound<00:03:01.320> like<00:03:01.500> part<00:03:02.190> of<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:02.400> language

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.260 

Louis's<00:03:10.770> piece<00:03:10.980> is<00:03:11.160> a<00:03:11.190> very<00:03:11.490> involved<00:03:12.060> piece

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
Louis's piece is a very involved piece

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.990 
Louis's piece is a very involved piece
it's<00:03:12.510> a<00:03:12.570> very<00:03:12.750> complicated<00:03:13.080> piece<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.860> he<00:03:14.820> is

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
it's a very complicated piece and he is

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.420 
it's a very complicated piece and he is
very<00:03:15.290> specific<00:03:16.290> about<00:03:16.590> everything<00:03:17.160> that<00:03:17.190> he

specific things at L Tony do you have
harmonics<00:03:22.470> there<00:03:23.450> yeah<00:03:25.610> okay<00:03:26.640> all<00:03:27.540> the

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
harmonics there yeah okay all the

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.160 
harmonics there yeah okay all the
accents<00:03:28.170> at<00:03:28.470> L<00:03:29.220> can<00:03:29.790> be<00:03:29.910> really<00:03:30.300> sharp<00:03:30.660> this

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
accents at L can be really sharp this

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.250 
accents at L can be really sharp this
passage<00:03:31.530> especially<00:03:32.040> is<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:33.090> most<00:03:33.330> heavy

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
passage especially is the most heavy

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.850 
passage especially is the most heavy
expressive<00:03:35.130> passage<00:03:35.880> in<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.120> piece<00:03:36.440> so<00:03:37.440> and<00:03:37.770> I

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
expressive passage in the piece so and I

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.070 
expressive passage in the piece so and I
would<00:03:37.920> really<00:03:38.220> if<00:03:38.670> we<00:03:39.120> can<00:03:39.300> stress<00:03:39.780> the

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
would really if we can stress the

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.360 
would really if we can stress the
difference<00:03:40.410> between<00:03:40.710> the<00:03:40.860> notes<00:03:41.040> that<00:03:41.160> have

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
difference between the notes that have

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.820 
difference between the notes that have
no<00:03:41.580> vibrato<00:03:41.760> at<00:03:42.150> all<00:03:42.270> and<00:03:42.540> lots<00:03:43.350> and<00:03:43.560> lots<00:03:43.680> of

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
no vibrato at all and lots and lots of

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:58.960 
no vibrato at all and lots and lots of
vibrato<00:03:44.100> can<00:03:56.120> we<00:03:57.120> hear<00:03:57.330> that<00:03:57.840> those<00:03:58.140> listen<00:03:58.710> a

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
vibrato can we hear that those listen a

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.880 
vibrato can we hear that those listen a
harmonic<00:03:59.970> Lysander's<00:04:00.480> I<00:04:00.660> don't<00:04:01.290> hear<00:04:01.530> them<00:04:01.680> on

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
harmonic Lysander's I don't hear them on

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.070 
harmonic Lysander's I don't hear them on
Europe<00:04:02.550> I<00:04:02.730> think<00:04:02.940> you<00:04:03.060> are<00:04:03.240> pressing<00:04:03.630> too<00:04:03.900> much

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
Europe I think you are pressing too much

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.560 
Europe I think you are pressing too much
the<00:04:04.260> strings<00:04:04.590> because<00:04:04.860> it

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
the strings because it

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.630 
the strings because it
these<00:04:07.140> aren't<00:04:07.710> they<00:04:07.860> supposed<00:04:08.130> to<00:04:08.250> be<00:04:08.310> over

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
these aren't they supposed to be over

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.000 
these aren't they supposed to be over
harmonics<00:04:09.420> yeah<00:04:09.870> yeah<00:04:10.050> okay<00:04:10.440> it<00:04:10.500> could<00:04:10.950> be

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
harmonics yeah yeah okay it could be

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.770 
harmonics yeah yeah okay it could be
just<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:11.310> do<00:04:11.820> that<00:04:11.970> bah

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
just to do that bah

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.199 
just to do that bah
the<00:04:12.900> most<00:04:13.050> Dutch<00:04:13.200> are<00:04:13.410> and<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:13.650> bar<00:04:14.180> so<00:04:15.180> that

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
the most Dutch are and the bar so that

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.010 
the most Dutch are and the bar so that
you<00:04:15.450> try<00:04:16.109> and<00:04:16.290> not<00:04:16.770> produce<00:04:17.720> stopped<00:04:18.720> note

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
you try and not produce stopped note

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.380 
you try and not produce stopped note
notes<00:04:19.590> they're<00:04:20.190> the<00:04:20.459> glissandos<00:04:21.060> it's<00:04:21.209> really

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
notes they're the glissandos it's really

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.620 
notes they're the glissandos it's really
a<00:04:21.420> guideline<00:04:21.989> you<00:04:22.140> don't<00:04:22.290> have<00:04:22.380> to

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
a guideline you don't have to

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.090 
a guideline you don't have to
it's<00:04:24.630> I<00:04:24.840> wouldn't<00:04:25.140> worry<00:04:25.530> about<00:04:25.620> hitting<00:04:25.980> each

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.100 
it's I wouldn't worry about hitting each

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.520 
it's I wouldn't worry about hitting each
one<00:04:26.640> specifically<00:04:27.419> it's<00:04:27.690> just<00:04:27.900> that<00:04:28.260> that

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
one specifically it's just that that

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.620 
one specifically it's just that that
kind<00:04:28.800> of<00:04:28.890> sound<00:04:29.130> is<00:04:29.280> what<00:04:29.430> yet<00:04:29.669> what<00:04:30.180> he<00:04:30.390> must

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
kind of sound is what yet what he must

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:50.440 
kind of sound is what yet what he must
be<00:04:30.750> asked<00:04:31.080> yeah

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.659 

even<00:04:51.450> if<00:04:51.630> if<00:04:52.110> the<00:04:52.350> score<00:04:52.680> would<00:04:52.950> be<00:04:53.010> very

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
even if if the score would be very

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.629 
even if if the score would be very
detailed<00:04:54.510> in<00:04:54.870> notation<00:04:55.290> there<00:04:56.130> are<00:04:56.310> still

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
detailed in notation there are still

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.040 
detailed in notation there are still
hundreds<00:04:57.419> of<00:04:58.400> interpreted<00:04:59.400> and<00:04:59.639> if<00:05:00.570> if

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
hundreds of interpreted and if if

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.310 
hundreds of interpreted and if if
composer<00:05:01.590> is<00:05:01.889> there<00:05:02.190> interesting<00:05:03.060> to

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
composer is there interesting to

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.500 
composer is there interesting to
communicate<00:05:04.320> what<00:05:04.560> exactly<00:05:05.400> is<00:05:05.669> behind<00:05:05.880> every

note<00:05:06.720> the<00:05:07.350> extended<00:05:07.860> techniques<00:05:08.180> certainly

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
note the extended techniques certainly

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.490 
note the extended techniques certainly
didn't<00:05:09.360> come<00:05:09.479> out<00:05:09.540> of<00:05:09.660> a<00:05:09.720> desire<00:05:10.020> just<00:05:10.080> to<00:05:10.260> use

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
didn't come out of a desire just to use

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.530 
didn't come out of a desire just to use
extended<00:05:10.979> techniques<00:05:11.160> when<00:05:11.940> I<00:05:11.970> start<00:05:12.300> a<00:05:12.360> piece

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 
extended techniques when I start a piece

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.140 
extended techniques when I start a piece
I<00:05:12.870> often<00:05:13.500> start<00:05:13.710> it<00:05:13.889> from<00:05:14.130> the<00:05:14.490> sounds<00:05:14.700> of<00:05:15.000> the

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.150 
I often start it from the sounds of the

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.790 
I often start it from the sounds of the
piece<00:05:15.330> I<00:05:15.479> have<00:05:15.630> certain<00:05:15.990> sounds<00:05:16.470> in<00:05:16.560> mind

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
piece I have certain sounds in mind

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.340 
piece I have certain sounds in mind
certain<00:05:17.130> textures<00:05:17.729> that<00:05:17.940> I<00:05:18.300> want<00:05:18.630> to<00:05:18.720> use<00:05:19.020> it

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
certain textures that I want to use it

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.960 
certain textures that I want to use it
was<00:05:19.530> a<00:05:19.560> bit<00:05:19.710> of<00:05:19.800> unique<00:05:20.160> circumstance<00:05:20.790> with

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
was a bit of unique circumstance with

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.390 
was a bit of unique circumstance with
this<00:05:21.090> piece<00:05:21.330> because<00:05:21.540> the<00:05:22.110> ensemble<00:05:22.650> is<00:05:22.770> quite

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
this piece because the ensemble is quite

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.090 
this piece because the ensemble is quite
non-standard<00:05:24.270> this<00:05:24.479> lo<00:05:24.720> trio<00:05:25.080> in<00:05:25.380> one<00:05:25.770> regard

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
non-standard this lo trio in one regard

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.060 
non-standard this lo trio in one regard
it<00:05:26.370> gave<00:05:26.610> me<00:05:26.820> lots<00:05:27.210> of<00:05:27.360> possibilities<00:05:28.070> things

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.070 
it gave me lots of possibilities things

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.590 
it gave me lots of possibilities things
I<00:05:29.190> haven't<00:05:29.340> done<00:05:29.460> before<00:05:29.580> and<00:05:30.030> it<00:05:30.150> sounds<00:05:30.510> I

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
I haven't done before and it sounds I

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.450 
I haven't done before and it sounds I
haven't<00:05:30.900> explored<00:05:31.229> and<00:05:31.500> on<00:05:32.010> the<00:05:32.100> other<00:05:32.220> hand

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
haven't explored and on the other hand

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.400 
haven't explored and on the other hand
it<00:05:32.639> was<00:05:32.820> sort<00:05:33.570> of<00:05:33.630> nerve-wracking<00:05:34.139> to<00:05:34.260> say

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
it was sort of nerve-wracking to say

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.629 
it was sort of nerve-wracking to say
well<00:05:34.620> how<00:05:34.740> am<00:05:34.770> I<00:05:34.979> going<00:05:35.160> to<00:05:35.310> make<00:05:35.430> these

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 
well how am I going to make these

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:36.890 
well how am I going to make these
instruments<00:05:36.000> work<00:05:36.330> together

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
instruments work together

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.170 
instruments work together
I<00:05:36.930> think<00:05:37.229> if<00:05:37.470> each<00:05:38.340> note<00:05:38.729> I<00:05:38.880> mean<00:05:39.060> because

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
I think if each note I mean because

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.820 
I think if each note I mean because
every<00:05:39.450> note<00:05:39.600> has<00:05:39.630> an<00:05:39.840> accent<00:05:40.260> so<00:05:40.590> I<00:05:40.620> think

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
every note has an accent so I think

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.380 
every note has an accent so I think
it'll<00:05:40.950> be<00:05:41.070> easier<00:05:41.100> to<00:05:41.460> play<00:05:41.580> together<00:05:41.789> you

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
it'll be easier to play together you

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.960 
it'll be easier to play together you
could<00:05:42.510> have<00:05:42.630> even<00:05:43.080> more<00:05:43.350> accent<00:05:43.830> but<00:05:44.160> so<00:05:44.640> sort

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
could have even more accent but so sort

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.090 
could have even more accent but so sort
of<00:05:45.000> like<00:05:45.150> a<00:05:45.180> miniature<00:05:45.960> Forte<00:05:46.590> piano<00:05:46.620> or

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
of like a miniature Forte piano or

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
of like a miniature Forte piano or
something<00:05:47.190> at<00:05:47.460> the<00:05:47.490> beginning<00:05:47.669> so<00:05:47.910> you<00:05:48.000> get<00:05:48.090> a

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
something at the beginning so you get a

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.909 
something at the beginning so you get a
little<00:05:48.210> kick<00:05:48.539> on<00:05:48.720> each<00:05:48.840> note<00:05:49.110> it<00:05:49.650> should<00:05:49.800> have

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:49.919 
little kick on each note it should have

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:53.240 
little kick on each note it should have
a<00:05:49.950> sort<00:05:50.220> of<00:05:50.280> jittery<00:05:51.120> feel<00:05:52.110> and<00:05:52.470> I<00:05:53.070> think

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
a sort of jittery feel and I think

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:59.860 
a sort of jittery feel and I think
that'll<00:05:53.430> help<00:05:53.550> make<00:05:53.850> it<00:05:54.030> more<00:05:54.479> rhythmic

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.030 

physically<00:06:00.870> getting<00:06:01.200> to<00:06:01.500> some<00:06:01.770> of<00:06:01.890> those

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.040 
physically getting to some of those

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.650 
physically getting to some of those
notes<00:06:02.310> has<00:06:02.580> been<00:06:02.790> a<00:06:03.000> little<00:06:03.330> bit<00:06:03.480> of<00:06:03.570> a

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
notes has been a little bit of a

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.600 
notes has been a little bit of a
challenge<00:06:04.050> but<00:06:04.260> when<00:06:04.680> you<00:06:04.860> get<00:06:05.370> something

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
challenge but when you get something

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:07.460 
challenge but when you get something
that<00:06:05.760> is<00:06:05.910> unfamiliar<00:06:06.540> or<00:06:06.780> a<00:06:06.810> challenge<00:06:07.290> you

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:07.470
