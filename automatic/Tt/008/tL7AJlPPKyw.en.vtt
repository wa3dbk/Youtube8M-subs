shugden was very consistent for me but

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.540 
shugden was very consistent for me but
when<00:02:44.440> it<00:02:44.560> comes<00:02:44.740> to<00:02:44.860> his<00:02:44.950> week<00:02:45.130> for<00:02:45.370> guys

when it comes to his week for guys

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.520 
when it comes to his week for guys
everything<00:02:46.090> you<00:02:46.180> can<00:02:46.330> think<00:02:46.360> of<00:02:46.690> it<00:02:47.230> was<00:02:47.380> just

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
everything you can think of it was just

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.949 
everything you can think of it was just
bad<00:02:47.740> just<00:02:48.250> full<00:02:48.459> stop<00:02:48.730> just<00:02:49.180> very<00:02:49.330> very<00:02:49.510> bad

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
bad just full stop just very very bad

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.260 
bad just full stop just very very bad
and<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.590> biggest<00:02:50.920> weakness<00:02:51.370> is<00:02:51.520> obviously

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
and the biggest weakness is obviously

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.480 
and the biggest weakness is obviously
his<00:02:52.540> pace<00:02:52.810> you<00:02:53.080> know<00:02:53.200> he's<00:02:53.350> got<00:02:53.470> 66<00:02:54.220> piece

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
his pace you know he's got 66 piece

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.000 
his pace you know he's got 66 piece
which<00:02:54.910> in<00:02:55.180> my<00:02:55.360> opinion<00:02:55.510> is<00:02:55.959> nowhere<00:02:56.800> near

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
which in my opinion is nowhere near

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.490 
which in my opinion is nowhere near
enough<00:02:57.220> especially<00:02:57.760> if<00:02:58.150> you<00:02:58.270> use<00:02:58.300> in<00:02:58.690> a<00:02:58.810> three

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
enough especially if you use in a three

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.740 
enough especially if you use in a three
at<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.650> back<00:03:00.060> formation<00:03:01.060> you<00:03:01.209> know<00:03:01.330> you<00:03:01.390> need

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
at the back formation you know you need

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.199 
at the back formation you know you need
to<00:03:01.870> have<00:03:02.020> peace<00:03:02.320> in<00:03:02.560> your<00:03:03.130> defense<00:03:03.580> to<00:03:03.700> counter

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
to have peace in your defense to counter

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.000 
to have peace in your defense to counter
the<00:03:04.420> amount<00:03:04.690> of<00:03:04.810> pasty<00:03:05.200> attackers<00:03:05.740> you<00:03:05.830> come

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
the amount of pasty attackers you come

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.430 
the amount of pasty attackers you come
up<00:03:06.130> against<00:03:06.459> like<00:03:06.580> I've<00:03:06.730> already<00:03:06.910> mentioned

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
up against like I've already mentioned

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.680 
up against like I've already mentioned
and<00:03:08.440> unless<00:03:08.680> you<00:03:08.890> get<00:03:09.040> lucky<00:03:09.100> and<00:03:09.700> your

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
and unless you get lucky and your

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.110 
and unless you get lucky and your

opponent doesn't run round a boa for
some<00:03:13.269> reason<00:03:13.690> then<00:03:14.200> you're<00:03:14.769> gonna<00:03:14.860> have<00:03:15.070> a

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
some reason then you're gonna have a

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.620 
some reason then you're gonna have a
hard<00:03:15.280> time<00:03:15.489> stopping<00:03:15.760> them<00:03:16.060> you<00:03:16.180> know<00:03:16.300> because

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
hard time stopping them you know because

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.420 
hard time stopping them you know because
when<00:03:16.989> you<00:03:17.080> come<00:03:17.260> up<00:03:17.350> against<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.709> boa<00:03:17.860> all<00:03:18.190> you

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
when you come up against the boa all you

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.820 
when you come up against the boa all you
need<00:03:18.640> to<00:03:18.670> do<00:03:18.970> is<00:03:19.180> just<00:03:19.239> sprint<00:03:20.200> round<00:03:20.470> him<00:03:20.650> and

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
need to do is just sprint round him and

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.680 
need to do is just sprint round him and
you're<00:03:21.010> not<00:03:21.190> going<00:03:21.489> to<00:03:21.610> have<00:03:21.880> a<00:03:22.090> chance<00:03:22.450> in

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
you're not going to have a chance in

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.930 
you're not going to have a chance in
hell<00:03:22.750> in<00:03:23.350> catching<00:03:24.190> up<00:03:24.310> with<00:03:24.489> them<00:03:24.640> but<00:03:24.820> his

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
hell in catching up with them but his

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.759 
hell in catching up with them but his
positioning<00:03:25.630> does<00:03:25.870> help<00:03:26.140> with<00:03:26.350> that<00:03:26.470> quite<00:03:26.739> a

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
positioning does help with that quite a

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.830 
positioning does help with that quite a
bit<00:03:26.860> though<00:03:27.190> guys<00:03:27.400> is<00:03:27.670> positioning<00:03:28.540> for<00:03:28.570> me

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
bit though guys is positioning for me

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.930 
bit though guys is positioning for me
was<00:03:29.290> half<00:03:29.560> decent<00:03:29.860> one<00:03:30.250> of<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.400> biggest<00:03:30.580> their

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
was half decent one of the biggest their

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.580 
was half decent one of the biggest their
pluses<00:03:31.239> that<00:03:31.420> i<00:03:31.570> did<00:03:31.780> find<00:03:32.050> with<00:03:32.230> him<00:03:32.320> he's<00:03:32.440> got

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
pluses that i did find with him he's got

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.560 
pluses that i did find with him he's got
high<00:03:32.769> defensive<00:03:33.280> workrate<00:03:33.519> medium<00:03:34.060> attacking

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
high defensive workrate medium attacking

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.180 
high defensive workrate medium attacking
but<00:03:34.720> he<00:03:34.780> felt<00:03:35.019> like<00:03:35.080> he<00:03:35.320> had<00:03:35.350> a<00:03:35.440> high-low<00:03:35.920> work

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
but he felt like he had a high-low work

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.280 
but he felt like he had a high-low work
great<00:03:36.459> he<00:03:36.610> hardly<00:03:36.880> ever<00:03:37.000> attacked<00:03:37.540> for<00:03:37.900> me<00:03:38.080> and

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
great he hardly ever attacked for me and

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.990 
great he hardly ever attacked for me and
so<00:03:38.920> that's<00:03:39.130> something<00:03:39.310> that<00:03:39.459> i<00:03:39.580> do<00:03:39.670> like<00:03:39.970> to

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
so that's something that i do like to

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.120 
so that's something that i do like to
see<00:03:40.300> in<00:03:40.450> my<00:03:40.600> center<00:03:40.989> backs<00:03:41.200> his<00:03:41.530> tackling
