well the DP to the most obvious

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:36.569 
well the DP to the most obvious
difference<00:00:34.930> in<00:00:35.469> appearance<00:00:35.770> will<00:00:36.370> be<00:00:36.460> the

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
difference in appearance will be the

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:39.330 
difference in appearance will be the
larger<00:00:36.940> lens<00:00:37.120> and<00:00:37.450> what<00:00:37.840> we<00:00:37.960> do<00:00:38.140> it<00:00:38.260> done<00:00:38.590> is<00:00:38.829> in

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
larger lens and what we do it done is in

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.979 
larger lens and what we do it done is in
response<00:00:40.000> to<00:00:40.180> requests<00:00:40.539> for<00:00:40.660> many<00:00:40.809> of<00:00:40.930> the

response to requests for many of the

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:42.930 
response to requests for many of the
consumers<00:00:41.440> who<00:00:41.949> wanted<00:00:42.250> more<00:00:42.489> than<00:00:42.520> just<00:00:42.699> the

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
consumers who wanted more than just the

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.150 
consumers who wanted more than just the
wide-angle<00:00:43.120> lens<00:00:43.600> the<00:00:44.079> DP<00:00:44.410> 2<00:00:44.590> now<00:00:44.739> features

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
wide-angle lens the DP 2 now features

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.369 
wide-angle lens the DP 2 now features
more<00:00:45.340> of<00:00:45.430> a<00:00:45.489> standard<00:00:45.879> lens<00:00:46.059> it's<00:00:46.600> a<00:00:46.660> 24-point

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
more of a standard lens it's a 24-point

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.319 
more of a standard lens it's a 24-point
2<00:00:47.559> millimeter<00:00:47.949> lens<00:00:48.129> which<00:00:48.699> effectively<00:00:49.120> is

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
2 millimeter lens which effectively is

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.090 
2 millimeter lens which effectively is
equivalent<00:00:49.809> to<00:00:49.840> about<00:00:49.960> a<00:00:50.109> 42<00:00:50.559> millimeter<00:00:50.949> lens

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
equivalent to about a 42 millimeter lens

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.310 
equivalent to about a 42 millimeter lens
on<00:00:51.399> a<00:00:51.489> full-frame<00:00:51.940> camera<00:00:52.000> so<00:00:52.870> it<00:00:52.899> gives<00:00:53.079> more

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
on a full-frame camera so it gives more

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.740 
on a full-frame camera so it gives more
of<00:00:53.440> a<00:00:53.500> normal<00:00:53.850> angle<00:00:54.850> of<00:00:55.149> view<00:00:55.300> which<00:00:55.510> could<00:00:55.690> be

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
of a normal angle of view which could be

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.270 
of a normal angle of view which could be
used<00:00:55.930> for<00:00:55.989> portraiture<00:00:56.440> as<00:00:56.649> well<00:00:56.829> as<00:00:56.980> you<00:00:57.190> know

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
used for portraiture as well as you know

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.430 
used for portraiture as well as you know
candid<00:00:57.969> shots<00:00:58.180> and<00:00:58.359> so<00:00:58.480> on<00:00:58.629> it's<00:00:59.170> a<00:00:59.199> little

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
candid shots and so on it's a little

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.319 
candid shots and so on it's a little
faster<00:00:59.769> aperture<00:01:00.160> its<00:01:00.309> 2.8<00:01:00.789> so<00:01:01.090> it<00:01:01.149> gives<00:01:01.239> a

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
faster aperture its 2.8 so it gives a

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:02.729 
faster aperture its 2.8 so it gives a
little<00:01:01.420> more<00:01:01.570> control<00:01:01.899> over<00:01:02.019> depth<00:01:02.410> of<00:01:02.530> field

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
little more control over depth of field

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.060 
little more control over depth of field
and<00:01:02.920> it<00:01:03.579> can<00:01:03.730> be<00:01:03.850> stopped<00:01:04.090> down<00:01:04.300> to<00:01:04.540> f/11

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
and it can be stopped down to f/11

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.350 
and it can be stopped down to f/11
without<00:01:06.070> significant<00:01:06.640> diffraction<00:01:07.090> because

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
without significant diffraction because

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.230

of the larger sensor ok inside what you

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.880 
of the larger sensor ok inside what you
can't<00:01:10.479> see<00:01:10.689> is<00:01:10.900> a<00:01:10.930> new<00:01:11.110> image<00:01:11.290> processor

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
can't see is a new image processor

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.390 
can't see is a new image processor

called the true too image sensor and

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.390 
called the true too image sensor and
this<00:01:15.909> will<00:01:16.119> provide<00:01:16.560> faster<00:01:17.560> write<00:01:18.040> speeds

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
this will provide faster write speeds

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.450 
this will provide faster write speeds

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
having the larger sensor is a big

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.010 
having the larger sensor is a big
advantage<00:04:37.639> because<00:04:38.180> it<00:04:38.509> allows<00:04:38.719> for<00:04:38.749> each

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
individual pixel to be larger larger

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.730 
individual pixel to be larger larger
pictures<00:04:41.719> are<00:04:41.840> more<00:04:41.990> sensitive<00:04:42.199> they<00:04:42.590> can

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
pictures are more sensitive they can

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.769 
pictures are more sensitive they can
capture<00:04:42.979> more<00:04:43.249> light<00:04:43.340> and<00:04:43.490> produce<00:04:44.330> more<00:04:44.569> of<00:04:44.689> a

00:04:44.769 --> 00:04:44.779 
capture more light and produce more of a

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:47.260 
capture more light and produce more of a
signal<00:04:44.990> and<00:04:45.289> less<00:04:45.409> noise<00:04:45.710> will<00:04:46.219> brain<00:04:46.550> in<00:04:46.849> the

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.480 
little bit higher yeah at this point I
don't<00:05:12.229> have<00:05:12.349> a<00:05:12.409> firm<00:05:12.590> price<00:05:12.770> from<00:05:13.009> the<00:05:13.129> factory

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
don't have a firm price from the factory

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.399 
don't have a firm price from the factory
but<00:05:13.699> I<00:05:13.729> anticipate<00:05:14.000> the<00:05:14.449> DP<00:05:14.750> 20<00:05:14.930> b<00:05:15.139> is<00:05:15.259> so

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:15.409 
but I anticipate the DP 20 b is so

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:17.619 
but I anticipate the DP 20 b is so
somewhat<00:05:15.949> higher<00:05:16.129> than<00:05:16.370> the<00:05:16.460> DP<00:05:16.759> 1<00:05:16.909> although

00:05:17.619 --> 00:05:17.629 
somewhat higher than the DP 1 although

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:19.689 
somewhat higher than the DP 1 although
hopefully<00:05:17.960> not<00:05:18.409> too<00:05:18.529> significantly<00:05:19.099> so<00:05:19.339> and

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:19.699 
hopefully not too significantly so and

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.339 
hopefully not too significantly so and
so<00:05:20.539> the<00:05:20.629> difference<00:05:20.870> between<00:05:21.020> the<00:05:21.229> two

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:21.349 
so the difference between the two

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:22.839 
so the difference between the two
cameras<00:05:21.680> in<00:05:21.800> the<00:05:21.889> focal<00:05:22.189> length<00:05:22.339> will<00:05:22.490> the<00:05:22.580> DP

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:22.849 
cameras in the focal length will the DP

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:24.909 
cameras in the focal length will the DP
1<00:05:22.999> remain<00:05:23.479> as<00:05:23.719> an<00:05:24.169> option<00:05:24.439> for<00:05:24.499> you<00:05:24.620> the<00:05:24.710> want

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 
1 remain as an option for you the want

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:26.860 
1 remain as an option for you the want
wider<00:05:25.129> focal<00:05:25.520> yes<00:05:25.879> both<00:05:26.120> both<00:05:26.300> cameras<00:05:26.719> will

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
wider focal yes both both cameras will

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.329 
wider focal yes both both cameras will
be<00:05:26.900> remained<00:05:27.379> in<00:05:27.500> production<00:05:27.650> so<00:05:28.129> the

00:05:28.329 --> 00:05:28.339 
be remained in production so the

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:29.559 
be remained in production so the
customers<00:05:28.819> have<00:05:28.969> a<00:05:29.029> choice<00:05:29.180> of<00:05:29.449> either

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:29.569 
customers have a choice of either

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:31.629 
customers have a choice of either
getting<00:05:29.900> the<00:05:29.960> wide<00:05:30.139> angle<00:05:30.319> or<00:05:30.979> the<00:05:31.009> normal

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 
getting the wide angle or the normal

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:34.269 
getting the wide angle or the normal
type<00:05:31.819> lens<00:05:32.089> or<00:05:32.360> hopefully<00:05:33.169> both<00:05:33.349> they're

00:05:34.269 --> 00:05:34.279 
type lens or hopefully both they're

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:36.760 
type lens or hopefully both they're
right<00:05:34.460> by<00:05:34.639> two<00:05:35.139> well<00:05:36.139> it's<00:05:36.229> great<00:05:36.319> we'll<00:05:36.560> stay

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
right by two well it's great we'll stay

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.800 
right by two well it's great we'll stay
tuned<00:05:36.979> for<00:05:37.219> the<00:05:37.250> DP<00:05:37.819> 2<00:05:38.000> coming<00:05:38.330> to<00:05:38.449> a<00:05:38.479> store
