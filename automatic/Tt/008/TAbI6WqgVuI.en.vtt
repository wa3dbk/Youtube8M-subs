pretty<00:00:42.600> good<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.050> right<00:00:43.170> here<00:00:43.320> is<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.440> slogan

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
pretty good and right here is the slogan

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.740 
pretty good and right here is the slogan
which<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.460> which<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:44.969> think<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.239> says<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:45.600> your

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
which is which I think it says it's your

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.830 
which is which I think it says it's your
funkin<00:00:46.170> car<00:00:47.000> going<00:00:48.000> with<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.329> funk<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.660> audio

theme and right here you can see it's a

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.389 
theme and right here you can see it's a
push<00:00:51.449> terminals<00:00:51.770> which<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.920> very<00:00:53.219> handy

that right here showing you this little

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.100 
that right here showing you this little
plastic<00:01:55.979> around<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.630> magnet<00:01:57.630> it's<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.869> same

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
plastic around the magnet it's the same

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.139 
plastic around the magnet it's the same
kind<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.619> material<00:01:58.950> that's<00:01:58.979> on<00:01:59.310> top<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.969> one

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
kind of material that's on top the one

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.420 
kind of material that's on top the one
that<00:02:00.270> showed<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.570> can<00:02:00.719> take<00:02:00.840> off<00:02:01.219> it's<00:02:02.219> pretty

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
that showed you can take off it's pretty

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.620 
that showed you can take off it's pretty
good<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:02.820> mean<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.210> could<00:02:03.299> take<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.540> off

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
good I mean you could take it off

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.080 
good I mean you could take it off
probably<00:02:03.869> if<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.079> want<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.469> but<00:02:04.920> why<00:02:05.850> not

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
probably if you want to but why not

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.999 
probably if you want to but why not
leave<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.329> on<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.689> rehired<00:02:07.229> right<00:02:07.829> here<00:02:07.950> I'm

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
leave it on and rehired right here I'm

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.650 
leave it on and rehired right here I'm
just<00:02:08.039> going<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.520> basket<00:02:09.030> which<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.479> like<00:02:09.629> a

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
just going to the basket which is like a

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.479 
just going to the basket which is like a
chrome<00:02:09.989> look<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.530> mean<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.069> looks<00:02:11.190> pretty<00:02:11.400> good

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
chrome look I mean it looks pretty good

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.430 
chrome look I mean it looks pretty good
I<00:02:11.550> guess<00:02:11.610> it's<00:02:12.060> like<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.209> black<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.750> chrome

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
I guess it's like a black and chrome

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.070 
I guess it's like a black and chrome
look<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.250> moving<00:02:15.180> on<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:15.510> I'm<00:02:15.600> going<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.810> tell

look and moving on and I'm going to tell

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.860 
look and moving on and I'm going to tell

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
you can kind of get an idea of the size

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.310 
you can kind of get an idea of the size

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
of the subwoofer so the mountain

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.240 
of the subwoofer so the mountain
mounting<00:02:22.800> depth<00:02:23.010> is<00:02:23.220> 6<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:23.700> 18<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:25.560> mountain

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
mounting depth is 6 and 18 the mountain

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.290 
mounting depth is 6 and 18 the mountain
diameter<00:02:26.940> is<00:02:27.120> nine<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:27.780> one<00:02:28.110> eighth<00:02:28.320> and<00:02:28.590> the

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
diameter is nine and one eighth and the

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.870 
diameter is nine and one eighth and the
outer<00:02:30.300> diameter<00:02:31.080> of<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.380> subwoofer<00:02:31.860> is<00:02:32.040> ten
