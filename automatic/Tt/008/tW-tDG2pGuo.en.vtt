up<00:00:44.190> with<00:00:44.489> braces<00:00:44.760> like<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.300> did<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.079> just<00:00:46.320> a

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
up with braces like I did that is just a

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.470 
up with braces like I did that is just a
death<00:00:46.710> sentence<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.370> had<00:00:47.550> braces<00:00:47.730> for<00:00:48.120> four<00:00:48.390> and

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
death sentence I had braces for four and

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.090 
death sentence I had braces for four and
a<00:00:48.570> half<00:00:48.600> years<00:00:49.140> before<00:00:49.530> they<00:00:49.620> finally<00:00:49.860> took

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
a half years before they finally took

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.889 
a half years before they finally took
them<00:00:50.250> out<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:50.730> might<00:00:50.940> even<00:00:51.360> more<00:00:51.510> fit<00:00:51.870> than

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
them out so might even more fit than

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.810 
them out so might even more fit than
they<00:00:52.140> are<00:00:52.260> right<00:00:52.289> now<00:00:52.530> but<00:00:53.070> yeah<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.250> just<00:00:53.430> I

for<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.360> butterfinger<00:02:06.930> i<00:02:07.110> would<00:02:07.710> get<00:02:07.860> this<00:02:08.039> but

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
for a butterfinger i would get this but

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.279 
for a butterfinger i would get this but
the<00:02:08.970> chance<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.479> happening<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:10.200> me

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
the chance of that happening and me

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.750 
the chance of that happening and me
getting<00:02:10.470> this<00:02:10.649> over<00:02:10.800> other<00:02:11.160> ice<00:02:11.370> cream<00:02:11.640> at
