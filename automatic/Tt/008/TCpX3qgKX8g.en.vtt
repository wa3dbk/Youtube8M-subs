00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.890 
up with a ridgepole Timberline hitch is
a<00:01:31.770> very<00:01:32.100> useful<00:01:32.430> knot<00:01:32.909> that's<00:01:33.180> two<00:01:33.600> half

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
a very useful knot that's two half

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.380 
a very useful knot that's two half
hitches<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.500> way<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.009> then<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.790> half<00:01:36.119> hitch

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
hitches that way and then a half hitch

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.350 
hitches that way and then a half hitch
that<00:01:36.750> way<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.560> allows<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.430> slide<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.150> knot

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
and tighten things up and then it won't

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.880 
and tighten things up and then it won't
loosen<00:01:43.320> up<00:01:44.149> so<00:01:45.149> in<00:01:45.450> your<00:01:45.630> campsite<00:01:46.200> choose<00:01:46.860> a
