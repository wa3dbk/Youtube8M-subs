 Review I decided to become a young Norwegian 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.410
 star of martinoy dagar which is not so 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.940
 long ago moved to real madrid and already had 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.219
 play a couple of matches for the main team 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.750
 let's start in order first I will say 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.250
 that he is 15 years old it will cause you 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.020
 some difficulty as in mode 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.690
 career players can search range 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.129
 from 16 to 50 years old if you start your 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.660
 career not for real madrid but first 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.030
 transfer window purchase martinus 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.160
 opportunities will not be his growth is 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.079
 175 centimeters which is very good for 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.520
 player of his age but overall rating 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.289
 is 67 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.850
 his playing position is central 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.620
 attacking midfielder right 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.780
 midfielder and central midfielder 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.949
 gaming foot left yasopp weak foot 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.049
 reception on 4 stars 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.130
 him in arklej you are high middle of 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.680
 gaming talent he is present 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.390
 entertainment and strong gaming quality 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.979
 March can be noted acceleration dexterity 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.200
 jerk speed balance body wielding 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.270
 sword and dribbling for a player of his level 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.560
 own a decent short pass and weak 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.600
 of the parties and I can note the fact that he 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.310
 sometimes not strong enough to close 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.380
 the ball housing and poor Martin 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.299
 a blow that sometimes prevents him from scoring a goal 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.860
 if we talk about his position on the field 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.380
 suitable for him playing the scheme 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.360
 scheme 4222 is perfect for Mars 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.770
 which side to place it on the right 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.020
 or left will depend on how you 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.549
 will use it as mars and 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.840
 on set legos footballer's 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.400
 using him as a player who 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.290
 passes on the flank and make a canopy 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.619
 it would be logical to put it on the left 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.570
 wing 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.579
 if you use his strong point 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.290
 dribble shift from flank to center and 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.640
 strike then it will be right 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.140
 put on the right flank 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.000
 Well, now I will tell you about my 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.439
 impression of the game play Martin 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.149
 quite a lot of urine in 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.979
 seasons mode, I immediately felt it 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.570
 play style more correct action 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.280
 will be right flank dribbling shifts 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.170
 center of the penalty opponent and give away 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.399
 fed the ball forward with what Martin 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.200
 coped well in those matches 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.850
 whom he played with me if I speak 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.830
 about career mode then this is one of the most 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.930
 fictitious players and its development in common 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.250
 rating of more than 90 you are guaranteed 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.260
 that's basically all I wanted 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.790
 I hope to talk about this martin 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.500
