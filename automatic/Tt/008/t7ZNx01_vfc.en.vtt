00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.800
 in the 18th century the anatomical models 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.960
 began to be used regularly with 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.400
 educational purposes however they were 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.789
 unique pieces of wax what the 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.860
 became expensive and fragile today is 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:16.360
 they make with a plastic-based resin and 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.220
 can be found in faculties of 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.820
 medicine consultations and even in 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.820
 art schools 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.560
 this model of a human torso has 20 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.420
 removable parts the front 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.130
 the back and sides offer 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.630
 different perspectives of the structure 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.630
 internal and external body 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.039
 the operators empty each part of the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.609
 model using a polymer resin 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:50.039
 Plastic poured into the resin in molds 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:54.980
 of nickel from the different parts like 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.980
 this skull or east heart mold 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.100
 then join the two molds that form 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.609
 each piece and close them with clamps 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.609
 Fixing 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.210
 and the molds go into a gas oven 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.670
 programmed at 225 degrees centigrade 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.440
 when the heat penetrates the molds the 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.230
 resin covers evenly all the 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.230
 interior surface about ten or twelve 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:23.880
 minutes later the boiling 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.470
 workers spray them with water to 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.420
 cool them before removing the 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.420
 clamps and take out the hot piece 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.340
 here we have some shoulder muscles 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.340
 fresh out of the mold 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.950
 the cross section of a heart 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.799
 an arm 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.470
 and a leg that the operators put to 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.860
 cool in a strong plaster mold 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.860
 heat 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.560
 with a needle the resin is punctured and 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:06.799
 releases the trapped air so that the 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.270
 piece is not broken and then 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.979
 they make small holes for 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.979
 pegs that will hold the pieces 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.410
 Each piece is painted by hand to highlight 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.410
 key elements 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.840
 an artist paints meticulously in blue 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.879
 the veins of this leg 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.350
 and then use yellow for 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:31.970
 Nerve endings 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.970
 and red for the arteries 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.010
 even the nails have a touch of color 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.810
 before mounting the model the operators 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.540
 they insert metal pins first into 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.110
 each piece will be used to join the pieces 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.110
 each 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.920
 Now the artist can now finish 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.980
 paint the arteries of this muscle the 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.980
 shoulder 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:05.269
 the gray areas indicate the ligaments 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.670
 then he directs his attention to the 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.420
 head first paints the eyes to give 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.420
 life to the figure 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.879
 the details are important 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.900
 this final touch gets the eyes 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.900
 come alive 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.390
 the pieces pass to a tempered furnace 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:40.909
 for about 15 minutes to soften the 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.120
 plastic in this way are easier to 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:45.829
 ride here and an operator places the 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.970
 mold head on a pin 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:51.010
 metal placed on the torso 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.180
 places the brain within the model of 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.180
 head and cover it 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.420
 no no no 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.550
 later add muscles to an arm 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.269
 inserting the plug into a hole 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.269
 in the next room 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.720
 adds radial blockage a muscle that 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.450
 helps to flex the hand 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.070
 and finally the deltoid the muscle that 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.160
 raise the arm the joint of the 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.160
 shoulder 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.220
 surrounds the arm with tape to 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.940
 that no piece falls when the 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.940
 join the torso 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.750
 hooks and closures or what sides 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.110
 hold the pieces once mounted the 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.110
 model 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.980
 this life- size muscular model 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:47.680
 It measures one meter 38 centimeters 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.500
 It has 45 different pieces all 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.680
 anatomically correct 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:57.090
 the human body truly a 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.090
 extraordinary structure
