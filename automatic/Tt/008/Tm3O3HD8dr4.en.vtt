improving<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:45.739> camera<00:03:46.129> a<00:03:46.160> lot<00:03:46.340> and<00:03:46.599> now<00:03:47.599> we

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:47.660 
improving the camera a lot and now we

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.039 
improving the camera a lot and now we
have<00:03:47.959> a<00:03:48.169> 8<00:03:48.470> megapixel<00:03:48.519> sensor<00:03:49.519> which<00:03:50.480> is<00:03:50.660> the

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
have a 8 megapixel sensor which is the

have a 8 megapixel sensor which is the
CMOS<00:03:51.440> sensor<00:03:51.889> which<00:03:52.370> is<00:03:52.549> the<00:03:52.940> same<00:03:53.150> which<00:03:53.389> is

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
CMOS sensor which is the same which is

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:00.009 
CMOS sensor which is the same which is
on<00:03:53.629> my<00:03:53.810> DSLR<00:03:54.379> it<00:03:54.949> has<00:03:55.750> 3264<00:03:56.750> x<00:03:57.280> 200<00:03:58.389> 2004<00:03:59.389> and<00:03:59.510> 48

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
on my DSLR it has 3264 x 200 2004 and 48

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.330 
on my DSLR it has 3264 x 200 2004 and 48
pixels<00:04:00.530> of<00:04:00.940> of<00:04:01.940> images<00:04:02.870> sixty<00:04:03.739> percent<00:04:03.980> more

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
pixels of of images sixty percent more

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.839 
pixels of of images sixty percent more
pixels<00:04:05.019> so<00:04:06.019> it<00:04:06.230> has<00:04:06.440> a<00:04:06.470> five-element<00:04:07.159> lens<00:04:07.250> in

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
pixels so it has a five-element lens in

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.969 
pixels so it has a five-element lens in
thirty<00:04:08.359> percent<00:04:08.629> more<00:04:08.930> sharpness<00:04:09.229> and<00:04:09.500> here

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:09.979 
thirty percent more sharpness and here

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:12.640 
thirty percent more sharpness and here
comes<00:04:10.190> the<00:04:10.370> big<00:04:10.549> part<00:04:10.849> it<00:04:11.060> has<00:04:11.359> a<00:04:11.479> f<00:04:11.810> 2.4

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
comes the big part it has a f 2.4

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.619 
comes the big part it has a f 2.4
aperture<00:04:13.159> which<00:04:13.370> is<00:04:13.519> more<00:04:13.760> than<00:04:13.940> my<00:04:14.120> kit<00:04:14.389> lens

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629 
aperture which is more than my kit lens

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.439 
aperture which is more than my kit lens
on<00:04:14.870> my<00:04:14.930> DSLR<00:04:15.769> even<00:04:16.519> though<00:04:16.609> it's<00:04:16.729> a<00:04:16.789> big<00:04:16.970> one

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
on my DSLR even though it's a big one

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:21.310 
on my DSLR even though it's a big one
but<00:04:17.690> it's<00:04:18.260> a<00:04:19.010> very<00:04:19.039> nice<00:04:19.820> aperture<00:04:20.630> for<00:04:21.289> a
