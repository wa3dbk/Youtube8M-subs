00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.490
 Wind power is the fastest growing form of renewable energy 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.309
 Trelleborg is in the front row and delivers 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.820
 Wind turbine manufacturers offer a wide range of sealing solutions 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.939
 Typical applications include PC Winter 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.880
 These goals fit the position of the rotor blades to the respective

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.990
 Wind turbines are in operation around the clock, making them the highest 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.770
 Requirements for the quality of the seals 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.940
 It is ideally suited for our PTFE based sealing material 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.010
 Dießener measurements increase the life expectancy 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.200
 In the pitch cylinder, Turk's seals are part of a complex 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.200

 Dirt particles affect the pulse generator system 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.330
 Trelleborg sealing solutions can also be found in the main trends Tel 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.209
 and sin accumulator 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:25.879
 the transmission in the wind turbine converts the rotation of the main source into the 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.879
 faster rotation of the power generator 

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:34.199
 it contains v rain 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:38.069
 the back v prevents Köhler from exiting the gearbox 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.899
 While in the air, the danger is also in a damage to the transmission through
