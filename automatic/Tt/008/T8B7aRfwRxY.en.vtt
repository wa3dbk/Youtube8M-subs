00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 after Richthofen and his group 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.990
 he is thanked for his thanks 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.160
 the wonderful for dg 2 and does 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.160
 on the way to the paradise 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.410
 arrived in paradise also known as 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.360
 web shangri-la he is on the way 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.619
 for the last fragments of the comet 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.600
 to find 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.790
 Richthofen wanted the comet itself 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.800
 there necessarily had which 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.260
 after completing the easter egg 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.660
 has been located on an altar where 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.580
 judge's name is now he has the 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.480
 golden bar and the focus 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.520
 comet 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.250
 so he has the complete power over the 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.739
 group 935 from there they travel 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.080
 further into the secret moon base you 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.300
 however, previously hold in aria fiftyone 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.930
 however, she also became zombies 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.940
 overrun 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.280
 but you could in the last second 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.409
 escape with the help of a teleport that 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.150
 However, they flee to the moon base 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:02.780
 she was also from zombies 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.269
 overrun 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.090
 so are the last scientists 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.140
 who should study element 115 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.690
 already dead 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.190
 in now there is another machine in 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.560
 shape of a pyramid 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.080
 after doing the easter egg 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.420
 momentarily hovers over the pyramid 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.909
 it's like a prison for you and her 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.130
 no piece can move quite openly 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.899
 has now completed his plan and all 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.909
 Players get death after completing the death 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.909
 bring for 90 seconds and all 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.130
 drinks with dempsey takeo nicolai 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.140
 However decide the 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.270
 insane nazi to stop 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.090
 In addition, however, saw dr max system 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.039
 betrayal of Richthofen ahead and 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.880
 secretly forged a plan around him 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.460
 to stop 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.369
 moth should come that far 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.159
 end a free construction field right body 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.600
 and exchange with him the mind 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.240
 right condition is now the one 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.520
 the imprisoned in the pyramid 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.610
 our moment the mind is located 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.189
 now in the direction of body to the end 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.710
 The rockets started from the group and 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:09.289
 Take course on the earth around all zombies 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.060
 and hellhounds to destroy but what 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.849
 went wrong because if you look 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.190
 looking at the ariane 5 d one and new town 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.530
 so you can see that the zombies survived 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.810
 have the map new towns like the 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.780
 same time as you can when you're on 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.970
 New Town The round 24 reached you can see 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.250
 that the eyes of the zombies glow blue 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.069
 and control over all 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.209
 In turn, zombies have an easter egg 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.040
 was on the moon 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.930
 because at this time exchanges 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.930
 currently with richthofen the body 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.290
 while on the map in yukon 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.180
 plays and as fbi or cdc member 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.910
 bond to a group of scientists 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.200
 look who was there to place new 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.410
 to investigate 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.120
 because the element 1150 was broadcast 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.880
 and you have not heard from them for a long time 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.130
 You could have been quite open in between 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.710
 Listening to the radio and of course, too 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.360
 notice that new town zombies to 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.370
 same time as moon plays 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.620
 At the very latest then you get it with you 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.140
 when you die on the map in newtown 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.390
 because then you see the rocket from now 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.040
 meet on earth and like that 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.800
 whole area is destroyed 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.320
 the reason, however, is that max 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.450
 Ghost tries to kill all zombies 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.730
 so right now no control 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.890
 More about all the zombies has after 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.400
 the earth was destroyed here you play 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.950
 four survivors of the zombie apocalypse 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.230
 rassmann measures the semmel stÃ¼hlinger and 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.000
 Morden Johnson the first time you can 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.440
 different objects and 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.270
 build miracle weapons yourself 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.880
 you have to have a workbench and the 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:19.370
 items find the four characters 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.480
 manages to smell smells and max mystery 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.850
 to find a laboratory 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:25.760
 now the player can decide whether on 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.560
 Max or Richthofen wants to help me 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.360
 friends that was now the third part 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.250
 the zombie story at the end of the 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.140
 fourth story I also the 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.150
 you'll upload with it next few days 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.480
 I still understand the rest 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.410
 in the end so a little yes special video 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.150
 with insert 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.370
 because we have on both sides 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.560
 once the quite open easter egg on 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.660
 made different cards and once 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.170
 the maxis easter egg on different 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.910
 cards 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.250
 The video I will then with purely 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.290
 cut in the next part and then you are 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.180
 her in any case up to date and 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.680
 then you can understand how is in the 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.690
 black ops three continues 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.270
 So my friends I hope you leave 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.950
 we can see each other next time 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.660
 it is again the first start for 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.610
 you 're fine , your ears are stiff 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.599
