really clean and then we're just going
to<00:01:25.659> tease<00:01:25.930> out<00:01:26.200> the<00:01:26.470> lower<00:01:26.680> floor<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:28.450> you<00:01:28.540> can

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
to tease out the lower floor so you can

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.749 
to tease out the lower floor so you can
see<00:01:28.840> how<00:01:29.020> we've<00:01:29.200> released<00:01:29.500> the<00:01:29.649> lower<00:01:29.890> thinks

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
see how we've released the lower thinks

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.370 
see how we've released the lower thinks
are<00:01:30.909> really<00:01:31.479> really<00:01:31.689> important<00:01:32.020> you've<00:01:32.110> kept

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
are really really important you've kept

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.440 
are really really important you've kept
the<00:01:32.530> natural<00:01:32.920> shape<00:01:33.130> this<00:01:33.850> part<00:01:34.119> in<00:01:34.270> this<00:01:34.390> part

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
the natural shape this part in this part

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.359 
the natural shape this part in this part
of<00:01:34.719> the<00:01:34.810> shell<00:01:35.020> this<00:01:35.170> is<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.439> strongest<00:01:36.100> part

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
of the shell this is the strongest part

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.600 
of the shell this is the strongest part
so<00:01:37.000> it's<00:01:37.090> really<00:01:37.270> important<00:01:37.719> that<00:01:37.780> we<00:01:37.960> just

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
so it's really important that we just

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.789 
so it's really important that we just
crack<00:01:39.610> it<00:01:39.640> we're<00:01:40.360> turning<00:01:40.689> around<00:01:40.799> completely

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
crack it we're turning around completely

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.600 
crack it we're turning around completely
and<00:01:42.100> do<00:01:42.159> the<00:01:42.250> same<00:01:42.430> thing<00:01:43.200> just<00:01:44.200> twist

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
and do the same thing just twist

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.900 
and do the same thing just twist
and<00:01:46.540> it<00:01:46.630> will<00:01:46.690> open<00:01:46.840> like<00:01:47.110> this<00:01:47.230> and<00:01:47.820> there<00:01:48.820> you

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
and it will open like this and there you

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.700 
and it will open like this and there you
go<00:01:49.060> it's<00:01:49.570> really<00:01:49.750> really<00:01:50.110> important<00:01:50.500> to<00:01:50.560> know

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
go it's really really important to know

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.550 
go it's really really important to know
that<00:01:51.540> we're<00:01:52.540> not<00:01:52.660> fully<00:01:52.900> we're<00:01:53.140> not<00:01:53.290> finished
