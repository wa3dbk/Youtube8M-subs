which<00:02:50.069> we've<00:02:50.280> got<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:51.030> natal<00:02:51.450> end<00:02:51.599> on<00:02:51.720> this

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
which we've got the natal end on this

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.080 
which we've got the natal end on this
end

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.670

and then somewhere out here this is the
new<00:02:57.799> hard<00:02:58.040> drive<00:02:59.980> have<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.159> ask<00:03:01.280> you<00:03:01.459> about

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
new hard drive have to ask you about

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.520 
new hard drive have to ask you about
that<00:03:01.609> there<00:03:02.239> is<00:03:02.359> a<00:03:02.599> way<00:03:02.900> to<00:03:02.930> remove<00:03:03.349> the

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
that there is a way to remove the

that there is a way to remove the
current<00:03:03.739> hard<00:03:03.920> drive<00:03:04.099> it's<00:03:04.819> hard<00:03:04.999> to<00:03:05.030> do<00:03:05.150> it

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
current hard drive it's hard to do it

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:15.640 
current hard drive it's hard to do it
elegantly<00:03:12.700> now<00:03:13.700> you<00:03:13.909> can<00:03:14.030> see<00:03:14.150> there's<00:03:14.329> a<00:03:14.650> 250

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
elegantly now you can see there's a 250

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.099 
elegantly now you can see there's a 250
gigabyte<00:03:15.799> label<00:03:16.370> on<00:03:16.489> it<00:03:18.609> and<00:03:19.609> then<00:03:20.540> I<00:03:20.840> can<00:03:21.079> just

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
gigabyte label on it and then I can just

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:26.199 
gigabyte label on it and then I can just
pop<00:03:22.040> it<00:03:22.189> out<00:03:24.909> how<00:03:25.909> do<00:03:25.969> you<00:03:26.060> go<00:03:26.180> about

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
pop it out how do you go about

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.270 
pop it out how do you go about
transferring<00:03:26.719> data<00:03:26.870> from<00:03:27.169> the<00:03:27.260> existing<00:03:27.680> Xbox

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
transferring data from the existing Xbox

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.729 
transferring data from the existing Xbox
so<00:03:28.579> if<00:03:28.669> you<00:03:28.730> have<00:03:28.819> an<00:03:28.909> existing<00:03:29.150> console<00:03:29.750> it's

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
so if you have an existing console it's

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.830 
so if you have an existing console it's
the<00:03:30.919> same<00:03:31.159> data<00:03:31.879> transfer<00:03:32.269> process<00:03:32.629> that<00:03:32.750> we

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
the same data transfer process that we

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.990 
the same data transfer process that we
have<00:03:32.959> today<00:03:33.109> actually<00:03:33.349> so<00:03:33.799> you<00:03:34.459> can<00:03:34.609> use<00:03:34.639> the

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
have today actually so you can use the

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.020 
have today actually so you can use the
data<00:03:35.269> transfer<00:03:35.689> which<00:03:36.680> we<00:03:36.949> are<00:03:37.280> actually

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
data transfer which we are actually

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.000 
data transfer which we are actually
going<00:03:38.269> to<00:03:38.359> make<00:03:38.510> a<00:03:38.540> retail<00:03:39.049> product<00:03:39.439> so<00:03:39.919> you

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
going to make a retail product so you

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.629 
going to make a retail product so you
can<00:03:40.159> now<00:03:40.250> buy<00:03:40.639> that<00:03:40.849> for<00:03:41.000> 1995<00:03:41.569> in<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:42.650> US<00:03:42.919> you

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:43.639 
can now buy that for 1995 in the US you

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.939 
can now buy that for 1995 in the US you
can<00:03:43.760> also<00:03:43.879> do<00:03:44.120> transfer<00:03:45.079> via<00:03:45.199> USB<00:03:45.469> thumb<00:03:45.769> drive

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:45.949 
can also do transfer via USB thumb drive

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:48.129 
can also do transfer via USB thumb drive
so<00:03:46.370> we<00:03:46.609> enabled<00:03:46.969> that<00:03:47.090> you<00:03:47.689> know<00:03:47.780> a<00:03:47.810> month<00:03:47.989> or

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139 
so we enabled that you know a month or

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.830 
so we enabled that you know a month or
so<00:03:48.260> ago<00:03:48.579> you<00:03:49.579> can<00:03:49.730> take<00:03:49.939> you<00:03:50.209> know<00:03:50.239> just<00:03:50.599> up<00:03:50.810> to

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
so ago you can take you know just up to

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.500 
so ago you can take you know just up to
16<00:03:51.290> gigs<00:03:51.530> of<00:03:51.650> data<00:03:51.739> and<00:03:51.919> move<00:03:52.069> it<00:03:52.159> over<00:03:52.189> USB<00:03:52.549> or

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
16 gigs of data and move it over USB or

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.750 
16 gigs of data and move it over USB or
you<00:03:53.629> can<00:03:53.780> do<00:03:53.959> auto<00:03:54.319> download<00:03:54.590> via<00:03:55.099> Xbox<00:03:55.549> Live

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760 
you can do auto download via Xbox Live

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.199 
you can do auto download via Xbox Live
so<00:03:56.510> for<00:03:57.049> any<00:03:57.169> P<00:03:57.709> DLC<00:03:58.099> or<00:03:58.370> anything<00:03:59.000> else<00:03:59.120> you

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
so for any P DLC or anything else you

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.179 
so for any P DLC or anything else you
downloaded<00:03:59.629> you<00:03:59.720> can<00:03:59.750> redownload<00:04:00.169> that<00:04:00.530> to

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:01.189 
downloaded you can redownload that to

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:03.460 
downloaded you can redownload that to
any<00:04:01.310> consolation<00:04:01.729> okay<00:04:02.329> any<00:04:02.689> like<00:04:02.989> speed

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
any consolation okay any like speed

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.189 
any consolation okay any like speed
changes<00:04:04.250> to<00:04:04.489> the<00:04:04.609> drive<00:04:04.879> is<00:04:05.090> just<00:04:05.419> larger<00:04:05.930> than

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:06.199 
changes to the drive is just larger than

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:07.629 
changes to the drive is just larger than
the<00:04:06.379> optimization<00:04:07.040> of<00:04:07.069> you<00:04:07.220> guys<00:04:07.400> have<00:04:07.609> done

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:07.639 
the optimization of you guys have done

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:11.110 
the optimization of you guys have done
as<00:04:08.060> far<00:04:08.269> as<00:04:08.509> her<00:04:09.459> for<00:04:10.459> you<00:04:10.579> and<00:04:10.819> that<00:04:10.909> might

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
as far as her for you and that might

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.879 
as far as her for you and that might
actually<00:04:11.269> improve<00:04:11.780> my<00:04:11.959> game<00:04:12.019> mo<00:04:12.379> times<00:04:12.650> right

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:12.889 
actually improve my game mo times right

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:14.830 
actually improve my game mo times right
now<00:04:13.370> so<00:04:13.609> performance<00:04:14.269> you<00:04:14.449> know<00:04:14.509> the<00:04:14.629> drives

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
now so performance you know the drives

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.759 
now so performance you know the drives
are<00:04:14.959> always<00:04:15.139> going<00:04:15.229> to<00:04:15.319> be<00:04:15.349> going<00:04:15.470> up<00:04:15.650> in

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
are always going to be going up in

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:17.800 
are always going to be going up in
performance<00:04:16.250> but<00:04:16.849> there<00:04:17.000> wasn't<00:04:17.150> you<00:04:17.449> there's

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
performance but there wasn't you there's

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.449 
performance but there wasn't you there's
there's<00:04:18.139> always<00:04:18.380> optimization<00:04:19.039> but<00:04:19.190> nothing

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
there's always optimization but nothing

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.310 
there's always optimization but nothing
specific<00:04:19.729> it's<00:04:20.120> not<00:04:20.299> twice<00:04:20.690> as<00:04:20.870> fast<00:04:21.019> or

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
specific it's not twice as fast or

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.790 
specific it's not twice as fast or
anything<00:04:22.570> let's<00:04:23.570> get<00:04:23.840> back<00:04:23.990> to<00:04:24.199> the<00:04:24.349> power

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
anything let's get back to the power

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.670 
anything let's get back to the power
brick<00:04:25.039> here<00:04:25.840> which<00:04:26.840> is<00:04:27.020> quite<00:04:27.199> light<00:04:27.470> now

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
brick here which is quite light now

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.399 
brick here which is quite light now
compared<00:04:28.070> to<00:04:28.190> the<00:04:28.340> original<00:04:29.210> one<00:04:29.690> but<00:04:29.870> not

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:30.409 
compared to the original one but not

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:33.550 
compared to the original one but not
really<00:04:30.590> that<00:04:30.770> much<00:04:30.830> smaller<00:04:32.080> scale<00:04:33.080> of<00:04:33.349> lights

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
really that much smaller scale of lights

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:42.520 
really that much smaller scale of lights
here<00:04:33.800> on<00:04:33.919> this<00:04:34.009> side

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:48.680 

Co<00:04:43.530> else<00:04:43.680> we<00:04:43.800> have<00:04:43.949> power<00:04:44.820> cable<00:04:47.389> here<00:04:48.389> he's

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
Co else we have power cable here he's

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.230 
Co else we have power cable here he's
the<00:04:48.720> AV<00:04:49.560> Adapter<00:04:50.190> and<00:04:50.430> I'm<00:04:50.610> not<00:04:50.790> seeing

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
the AV Adapter and I'm not seeing

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.110 
the AV Adapter and I'm not seeing
anything<00:04:51.479> HD<00:04:52.260> this<00:04:52.650> is<00:04:52.889> composite<00:04:53.580> so<00:04:53.850> we've

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
anything HD this is composite so we've

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.939 
anything HD this is composite so we've
got<00:04:54.330> standard<00:04:55.080> definition<00:04:55.500> out<00:04:55.620> of<00:04:55.680> the<00:04:55.740> box

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
got standard definition out of the box

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:04.909 
got standard definition out of the box
so<00:04:56.790> far<00:05:00.830> we<00:05:01.830> have<00:05:01.860> an<00:05:02.190> xbox<00:05:02.430> 360<00:05:03.090> headset<00:05:03.919> in

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
so far we have an xbox 360 headset in

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:09.530 
so far we have an xbox 360 headset in
black<00:05:05.190> to<00:05:05.460> match<00:05:05.580> the<00:05:05.790> console<00:05:06.180> and<00:05:08.360> a<00:05:09.360> black

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.540 
black to match the console and a black

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:20.510 
black to match the console and a black
controller<00:05:09.930> as<00:05:10.139> well<00:05:18.470> so<00:05:19.470> again<00:05:19.770> pretty

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
controller as well so again pretty

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.559 
controller as well so again pretty
standard<00:05:20.850> stuff<00:05:22.130> fantasy<00:05:23.130> is<00:05:23.400> really

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:25.569 
standard stuff fantasy is really

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:29.609 
standard stuff fantasy is really
I<00:05:26.219> believe<00:05:27.219> it<00:05:27.369> is<00:05:27.839> isn't<00:05:28.839> that<00:05:28.869> the<00:05:29.110> shiny<00:05:29.439> is

00:05:29.609 --> 00:05:29.619 
I believe it is isn't that the shiny is

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:32.369 
I believe it is isn't that the shiny is
that<00:05:29.800> different<00:05:30.899> they<00:05:31.899> did<00:05:32.050> mention<00:05:32.229> that

00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:32.379 
that different they did mention that

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:34.169 
that different they did mention that
they<00:05:32.619> made<00:05:32.830> the<00:05:32.860> AIDS<00:05:33.069> Chrome's<00:05:33.490> match<00:05:33.879> the

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:34.179 
they made the AIDS Chrome's match the

00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:36.839 
they made the AIDS Chrome's match the
new<00:05:34.330> console<00:05:34.839> so<00:05:35.050> it<00:05:35.110> could<00:05:35.259> be<00:05:35.849> computed

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:36.849 
new console so it could be computed

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:38.549 
new console so it could be computed
slavery<00:05:37.149> time<00:05:37.360> obviously<00:05:38.080> not<00:05:38.199> a<00:05:38.259> different

00:05:38.549 --> 00:05:38.559 
slavery time obviously not a different

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:49.889 
slavery time obviously not a different
shape<00:05:46.559> no<00:05:47.559> matter<00:05:47.589> he<00:05:48.490> does<00:05:48.729> have<00:05:49.449> batteries

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:49.899 
shape no matter he does have batteries
