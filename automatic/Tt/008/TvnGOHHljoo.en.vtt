now<00:04:37.550> but<00:04:38.200> you<00:04:39.200> know<00:04:39.320> it's<00:04:39.500> it's<00:04:39.740> the<00:04:40.190> superhero

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
now but you know it's it's the superhero

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.570 
now but you know it's it's the superhero
genre<00:04:40.940> so<00:04:41.630> these<00:04:41.960> things<00:04:42.200> kind<00:04:43.040> of<00:04:43.100> keep<00:04:43.250> going

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
genre so these things kind of keep going

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
anybody who gets powers is going to have

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.320 
anybody who gets powers is going to have
a<00:04:51.320> different<00:04:51.560> bumpy<00:04:52.460> road<00:04:52.700> to<00:04:53.060> travel

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
a different bumpy road to travel

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.960 
a different bumpy road to travel
demostracion<00:04:54.290> told<00:04:54.530> that<00:04:54.830> there<00:04:55.640> is<00:04:55.729> a<00:04:55.760> lot

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
demostracion told that there is a lot

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.750 
demostracion told that there is a lot
less<00:04:56.180> dead<00:04:56.479> zone<00:04:56.810> on<00:04:57.050> the<00:04:57.320> DualShock<00:04:57.740> 4<00:04:58.220> yeah

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:58.760 
less dead zone on the DualShock 4 yeah

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.909 
less dead zone on the DualShock 4 yeah
how<00:04:59.090> if<00:04:59.900> you<00:05:00.080> have<00:05:00.290> to<00:05:00.410> estimate<00:05:00.620> the

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
how if you have to estimate the

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.850 
how if you have to estimate the
percentage<00:05:01.130> of<00:05:01.580> increase<00:05:02.390> in<00:05:02.900> the<00:05:03.410> precision

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
percentage of increase in the precision

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.219 
percentage of increase in the precision
and<00:05:03.919> responsiveness<00:05:04.550> of<00:05:04.850> the<00:05:05.120> i<00:05:05.479> could<00:05:06.080> not

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
and responsiveness of the i could not

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.370 
and responsiveness of the i could not
give<00:05:06.470> you<00:05:06.620> a<00:05:07.419> exact<00:05:08.419> example<00:05:08.930> of<00:05:09.050> how<00:05:09.200> much

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
give you a exact example of how much

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.830 
give you a exact example of how much
more<00:05:09.590> precise<00:05:09.950> it<00:05:10.100> is<00:05:10.190> I<00:05:10.460> can't<00:05:10.910> say<00:05:11.120> that<00:05:11.150> when

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
more precise it is I can't say that when

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.900 
more precise it is I can't say that when
Sony<00:05:12.650> would<00:05:12.919> ask<00:05:13.160> us<00:05:13.340> hey<00:05:13.490> what<00:05:13.640> do<00:05:13.700> you<00:05:13.729> want

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
Sony would ask us hey what do you want

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.940 
Sony would ask us hey what do you want
the<00:05:14.000> new<00:05:14.090> controller<00:05:14.479> to<00:05:14.630> do<00:05:14.780> well<00:05:14.990> answer<00:05:15.800> was

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
the new controller to do well answer was

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.340 
the new controller to do well answer was
we<00:05:16.430> want<00:05:16.580> to<00:05:16.669> make<00:05:17.240> sure<00:05:17.270> that<00:05:17.660> shooting

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
we want to make sure that shooting

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.650 
we want to make sure that shooting
people<00:05:18.650> is<00:05:18.860> as<00:05:19.700> good<00:05:19.910> as<00:05:20.090> humanly<00:05:20.630> possible

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
people is as good as humanly possible

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.450 
people is as good as humanly possible
because<00:05:21.320> it<00:05:21.440> feels<00:05:21.590> like<00:05:21.740> fifty<00:05:22.130> percent<00:05:22.340> of

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
because it feels like fifty percent of

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.460 
because it feels like fifty percent of
games<00:05:22.729> feature<00:05:23.090> that<00:05:23.390> aiming<00:05:23.750> mechanic<00:05:24.169> yeah

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
games feature that aiming mechanic yeah

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.800 
games feature that aiming mechanic yeah
so<00:05:24.740> the<00:05:24.830> offical<00:05:25.010> roller<00:05:25.340> has<00:05:25.490> to<00:05:25.610> do<00:05:25.729> that<00:05:25.880> it

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
so the offical roller has to do that it

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.210 
so the offical roller has to do that it
has<00:05:26.930> to<00:05:26.990> be<00:05:27.169> industry<00:05:27.650> leader<00:05:27.830> has<00:05:28.040> to<00:05:28.070> be

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
has to be industry leader has to be

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.460 
has to be industry leader has to be
terrific<00:05:28.669> at<00:05:28.970> it<00:05:29.120> and<00:05:29.240> they<00:05:29.510> reacted<00:05:29.990> by<00:05:30.110> Kunis

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
terrific at it and they reacted by Kunis

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.610 
terrific at it and they reacted by Kunis
much<00:05:31.160> improved<00:05:31.810> joysticks<00:05:32.810> with<00:05:33.320> much

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
much improved joysticks with much

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.850 
much improved joysticks with much
tighter<00:05:33.919> spring
