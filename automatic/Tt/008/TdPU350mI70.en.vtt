00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 the invention of a miner's physician may 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.859
 to help solve the problems of 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.510
 people suffering from cataracts through 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.580
 of a 3d printer 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.799
 he created a device capable of 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.529
 expand the patient's pupil to 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.949
 removal of the lesion 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:21.390
 the invention is microscopic much smaller than 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.600
 a paper clip 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.740
 instrument was developed by the 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.470
 ophthalmology of the holy house of beautiful 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.150
 using the technology of the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.560
 3d printer 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.649
 I had seen research in the area of 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.750
 neurology with parts of clan skull and 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.460
 research in the field of orthopedics with 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.500
 human prostheses 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.420
 I said why do not you have some? 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.000
 thing in the part the physiologist in this 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.700
 version you can see the 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.219
 ring the aid in the surgery of 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.949
 cataract of patients suffering from 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.320
 small or poor pupil syndrome 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.930
 mainly affects people with 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.270
 diabetes, the function of the ring is precisely 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.250
 betray this patient's pupil to 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.369
 people take this cataract is behind the 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.320
 pupil that 5% of cases not 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.750
 brass to pupil the rest of can 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.510
 usually with eye drops this simulation 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.360
 on the computer shows how the instrument is 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.570
 used puts the ring to open the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.729
 pupil and remove the cataract at the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.610
 ring is removed and the person leaves 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.500
 home on the same day as reducing the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.049
 recovery time from the patient to the 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.750
 main advantage of the developed ring 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.000
 here for holy house is the cost 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.070
 just to get an idea the instrument 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.740
 currently used by physicians to 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.189
 dilate the patient's pupil reaches 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.880
 cost 600 reais while this ring 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.740
 will cost 30 technology for now 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.290
 is only available in the 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.280
 cataract reference of the holy house of 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.439
 Belo Horizonte 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.020
 but according to the doctor within six 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.290
 months, people will have access to the 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.350
 his otacilium was the first patient 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.719
 in the world to use the ring he came back to 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.220
 from the right eye after two 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.770
 years suffering from the very great cataract 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.090
 quiet 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.090
 another thing of life
