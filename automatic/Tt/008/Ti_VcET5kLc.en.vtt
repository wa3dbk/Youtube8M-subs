okay<00:00:42.200> and<00:00:42.440> the<00:00:42.559> buttons<00:00:42.830> are<00:00:42.950> on<00:00:42.980> this<00:00:43.400> side<00:00:43.610> so

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
okay and the buttons are on this side so

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.940 
okay and the buttons are on this side so
you'd<00:00:44.150> under<00:00:44.390> this<00:00:45.080> is<00:00:45.200> what<00:00:45.350> a<00:00:45.379> more<00:00:45.590> budget

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
you'd under this is what a more budget

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.830 
you'd under this is what a more budget
version<00:00:46.430> and<00:00:46.730> this<00:00:46.820> is<00:00:46.879> a<00:00:47.000> higher-end<00:00:47.449> version

directly onto the frame without going

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.960 
directly onto the frame without going
through<00:01:37.270> computer

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
through computer

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.860 
through computer
right<00:01:38.570> so<00:01:38.780> that<00:01:38.930> saves<00:01:39.080> a<00:01:39.260> lot<00:01:39.350> of<00:01:39.410> time<00:01:40.930> sweet

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
right so that saves a lot of time sweet

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.820 
right so that saves a lot of time sweet
and<00:01:43.310> this<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.490> going<00:01:44.820> for<00:01:45.150> about<00:01:45.360> 1<00:01:45.750> 99<00:01:46.050> that's

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
and this is going for about 1 99 that's

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.750 
and this is going for about 1 99 that's
correct<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.730> is<00:01:47.910> 1<00:01:48.210> 60<00:01:48.660> 90<00:01:49.110> *<00:01:49.590> yeah<00:01:49.740> yeah<00:01:50.460> i

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760

think<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.630> internet<00:01:51.960> widgets<00:01:52.290> will<00:01:52.410> be

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
think that the internet widgets will be

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.010 
think that the internet widgets will be
pretty<00:01:52.770> useful<00:01:52.950> as<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.280> third<00:01:53.610> display<00:01:54.060> for<00:01:54.510> for

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
pretty useful as a third display for for

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.530 
pretty useful as a third display for for
even<00:01:55.650> like<00:01:55.860> hardcore<00:01:56.640> computer<00:01:57.180> geeks<00:01:57.390> out

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
even like hardcore computer geeks out

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.020 
even like hardcore computer geeks out
there<00:02:00.320> it's<00:02:01.320> okay<00:02:01.620> but<00:02:02.190> it<00:02:02.550> would<00:02:02.700> be<00:02:02.730> neat<00:02:03.000> for

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
there it's okay but it would be neat for

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.330 
there it's okay but it would be neat for
people<00:02:04.020> who<00:02:04.140> really<00:02:04.470> really<00:02:04.770> have<00:02:05.010> to<00:02:05.040> stay<00:02:05.310> up
