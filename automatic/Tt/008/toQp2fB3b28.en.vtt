version of Android is running right now
so<00:00:45.030> let's<00:00:45.300> see<00:00:45.539> if<00:00:45.660> we<00:00:45.719> can<00:00:45.870> get<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.079> will<00:00:47.039> go

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
so let's see if we can get that will go

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.940 
so let's see if we can get that will go
to<00:00:47.190> our<00:00:47.309> settings<00:00:48.410> one-handed<00:00:49.410> display<00:00:49.770> for

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
to our settings one-handed display for

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.500 
to our settings one-handed display for
the<00:00:49.980> win<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.940> we're<00:00:51.059> going<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.239> go<00:00:51.329> all<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.449> way

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
the win so we're going to go all the way

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.459 
the win so we're going to go all the way
down<00:00:52.010> about<00:00:53.300> right<00:00:54.300> there<00:00:54.360> we<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:54.960> android

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
down about right there we have android

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.950 
down about right there we have android
for<00:00:55.890> four<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.789> one<00:00:57.030> if<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.300> can<00:00:57.390> see<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.809> so

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
for four and one if you can see that so

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.660 
for four and one if you can see that so
that's<00:00:58.140> really<00:00:58.410> running<00:00:58.739> KitKat<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.609> I'm

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
that's really running KitKat so I'm

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.860 
that's really running KitKat so I'm
going<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.820> flip<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.059> over<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.449> back<00:01:00.629> right

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
going to flip it over to the back right

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.450 
going to flip it over to the back right
now<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.170> see<00:01:01.350> what<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.739> always-on<00:01:02.430> display

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
now and see what the always-on display

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.490 
now and see what the always-on display
is<00:01:03.090> being<00:01:03.270> founded<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.110> an<00:01:04.199> e<00:01:04.320> ink

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
is being founded is this is an e ink

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.440 
is being founded is this is an e ink
display<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:05.369> we're<00:01:05.489> going<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.670> go<00:01:05.790> ahead<00:01:06.210> and

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
display so we're going to go ahead and

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.280 
display so we're going to go ahead and
basically<00:01:06.930> say<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:08.070> um<00:01:08.729> hmm<00:01:09.540> actually

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
basically say this is um hmm actually

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.690 
basically say this is um hmm actually
it's<00:01:10.439> eating<00:01:10.860> display<00:01:11.159> but<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.310> think<00:01:11.490> about

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
it's eating display but I think about

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.280 
it's eating display but I think about
four<00:01:11.939> inches<00:01:12.270> we're<00:01:12.420> not<00:01:12.540> too<00:01:12.659> sure<00:01:12.689> them<00:01:13.200> you

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
four inches we're not too sure them you

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.840 
four inches we're not too sure them you

battery
on<00:01:31.010> there<00:01:31.190> the<00:01:31.460> network<00:01:31.820> guns<00:01:32.150> going<00:01:32.360> to<00:01:32.420> be<00:01:32.479> a

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
on there the network guns going to be a

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.810 
on there the network guns going to be a
gsm<00:01:32.930> 815<00:01:33.590> so<00:01:33.799> you<00:01:33.860> should<00:01:34.430> be<00:01:34.460> able<00:01:34.520> to<00:01:34.670> take<00:01:34.790> it

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
gsm 815 so you should be able to take it

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.719 
gsm 815 so you should be able to take it

network so you're looking at you know

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.469 
network so you're looking at you know
using<00:01:39.890> it<00:01:40.100> this<00:01:40.550> as<00:01:40.909> a<00:01:40.940> high-speed

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
using it this as a high-speed

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.810 
using it this as a high-speed

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.880 
here is about 2 gigs of RAM and 32 gigs
of<00:01:46.549> onboard<00:01:47.090> memory<00:01:47.360> I<00:01:47.690> don't<00:01:48.050> see<00:01:48.290> any<00:01:48.560> SD

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
of onboard memory I don't see any SD

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.770 
of onboard memory I don't see any SD
card<00:01:49.310> slots<00:01:49.640> here<00:01:49.970> so<00:01:50.149> I'm<00:01:50.210> going<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:50.420> assume

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
card slots here so I'm going to assume

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.080 
card slots here so I'm going to assume
that<00:01:50.840> we<00:01:51.140> can't<00:01:51.440> expand<00:01:51.860> this<00:01:52.070> with<00:01:52.310> a<00:01:52.340> an<00:01:52.610> SD

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
that we can't expand this with a an SD

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.120 
that we can't expand this with a an SD
card<00:01:53.119> cpu<00:01:54.020> guys<00:01:54.259> this<00:01:54.710> is<00:01:54.830> running<00:01:55.070> a

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
card cpu guys this is running a

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.760 
card cpu guys this is running a
Snapdragon<00:01:55.729> it's<00:01:55.850> a<00:01:55.909> Snapdragon<00:01:56.630> 800<00:01:57.409> so

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
Snapdragon it's a Snapdragon 800 so

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.240 
Snapdragon it's a Snapdragon 800 so
you're<00:01:57.920> looking<00:01:57.979> at<00:01:58.159> a<00:01:58.220> quad-core<00:01:58.580> 2.2<00:01:59.479> gig

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
you're looking at a quad-core 2.2 gig

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.430 
you're looking at a quad-core 2.2 gig
gigahertz<00:02:01.250> device<00:02:01.670> here<00:02:02.000> so<00:02:02.149> that's<00:02:02.330> it<00:02:03.050> packs

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
gigahertz device here so that's it packs

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.249 
gigahertz device here so that's it packs
a<00:02:03.560> punch<00:02:03.759> once<00:02:04.759> again<00:02:04.910> this<00:02:05.539> is<00:02:05.810> the<00:02:05.840> yotaphone

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
a punch once again this is the yotaphone

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.650 
a punch once again this is the yotaphone
on<00:02:06.740> next<00:02:07.429> generation<00:02:07.580> hasn't<00:02:08.209> been<00:02:08.330> given<00:02:08.570> a

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
on next generation hasn't been given a

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.359 
on next generation hasn't been given a
code<00:02:08.810> name<00:02:08.989> I<00:02:09.110> don't<00:02:09.289> think<00:02:09.530> but<00:02:09.950> you<00:02:10.280> know

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
code name I don't think but you know

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:11.320 
code name I don't think but you know
what<00:02:10.399> I'm<00:02:10.640> really<00:02:10.789> looking<00:02:11.060> forward<00:02:11.090> to
