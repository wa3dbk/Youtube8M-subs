00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 about 2,600 we are in minecraft 1.6 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.589
 point 4 we are going to open a mode in which 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.800
 It's pretty cool but it has some 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.610
 little thing that I do not like much but good 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.610
 What do they do 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.900
 because they all left 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.730
 to Earth 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.930
 something very ugly there must be here 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.930
 so they have decided to leave 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:31.520
 it's also that my head is going 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:34.370
 see let's see 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.770
 let's see the little things that bring what 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.710
 I do not like it in this way is that I do not know 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.290
 can create things at least only has 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.060
 I've seen two craft eos and I have not 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.080
 seen because on web pages and that's not 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.790
 they are then I do not know if it's really weird 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.460
 good as you see here look how cool 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.340
 this the super pumpkins for that comes 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.350
 halloween comes very cool here for 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.450
 tanning skins all these are objects of the 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.260
 mod 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.300
 I'm here to go wherever we want 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.130
 how is this brave to the clothes here 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.250
 the clothes that have already attended me you are seeing 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.940
 my students with hearts the taking 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.460
 match with anything and it is very 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.850
 all right 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.790
 here a scarecrow 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.140
 a target to me is also very cool 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.659
 that is said to be like a doll 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.250
 training what I do not like is that 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.960
 the collision box is also very 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.509
 badly done but good is passed on by 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.259
 objects here for a haystack for the 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:35.390
 Pajaritos is very good because he already has 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.710
 many things and they are very cool we are going to 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.670
 see around here so you can see 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.869
 install the loft inof items this one 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.299
 just to see what could be 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.190
 change and what is not but good now 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.690
 after teaching well here we have all 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.180
 these rare 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.420
 every day the bad that's what I say 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.689
 do not 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.790
 does not have any functionality either 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:01.090
 it is not uncommon here that it is like 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:05.979
 typical to see what will put it where 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:08.739
 I put it I put it where I put it there are two 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.500
 trees that are in a straight line there 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:14.480
 so many weird 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.980
 well that's what 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.670
 because I appear in that port to 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.420
 side 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.010
 to place it well here fabric is called 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.360
 a glove the viewfinder 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.610
 These are the typical little signs that 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.830
 now it does not come out and how to put them 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.230
 but hey it's like the flags for 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.910
 decorate 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.890
 but good that 's 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.120
 there are all the many colors seeing 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:42.000
 very cool and ingots here a stuffed animal 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.130
 creep the rhythm and cool it 's like that 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.890
 a bottle of wine 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.780
 super watch what I tell you this does not have 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.450
 no function really a little bit 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.030
 weird because nothing here just about 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.840
 cubes this is a 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.180
 paper airplane does not come to me simply 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.760
 but good for a change is that what 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.030
 I say you could throw it in some way 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.900
 part of iron with the q is a power a 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.560
 airplane from these paper 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.000
 I would molar but good here to make you 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.450
 costumes or clothes with the deschiens to make 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.140
 from here super object of these joke 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:27.660
 really a bunny 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:31.970
 the lead soldier ' r2d2 is a super 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.970
 a super ship everything super here 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.319
 this man is really uncle what 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.939
 says this is mostly to access 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:43.030
 like cinematics and little things like that a 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:45.909
 iron here to sharpen black for not 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.200
 think badly is a piano for example at 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:50.730
 piano molarÃ­a that made some sound 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.530
 related colored crystallites 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.980
 what I liked here in 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.470
 actually this here is what I tell you the 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:03.150
 collision box is very rare where 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.200
 which with this do not get hooked with 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.330
 this seems to be more or less good 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.599
 now it's the simple thing here to take us 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.120
 a tea as a cure this is this is a 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:13.569
 little bit weird but hey there's a clock 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.650
 cuckoo 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.650
 what's cool because you 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.720
 here to start this little detail as the 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:26.120
 a lot and this stay there I want this from 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:30.820
 here it's like the bird comes out of 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.820
 wood and such fashion a lot around here 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.990
 epic supertramp this is a dragon 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.820
 it is also very cool here our 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.250
 wine pantry but as you can see the box 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.639
 this condition came out I can pass 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.499
 around here and I'm in here 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.509
 that's what I want so we do not go to much 

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:51.050
 this same empty one and two stuffed animals 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:52.969
 also superchulo you can add many 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.249
 things to decorate but that's what it says 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:58.159
 uncle is this is rather to do 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:59.930
 like your movies in minecraft and have 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:03.199
 little things to decorate because if it's not a 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.909
 little by little attacks but this one is 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:07.849
 very cool especially for that if you want 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:09.810
 do animations I do not know but what is 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:11.639
 movies and such 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.969
 he is very cool for everything he adds 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.559
 I've loved it so much 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:18.379
 the evils that you do not see your hand when 

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:21.759
 you connect it is very cool apart that what 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:21.759
 we can put in anyway as you see 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.610
 let's make a super circuit we can 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.590
 make a bridge with this 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.199
 a bridge could appear to be seen 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.120
 from above but good what I say 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:36.060
 when you enter here if I give to the 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.719
 sphere not to air to read does not come out as 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.360
 kraft e ar 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:44.659
 this the clipper plush that I alone 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.219
 the ship is green and for now it is that I 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:47.300
 love the 'fluff' flu 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:50.060
 You can also put it everywhere 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.770
 that's what I do like that for 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.080
 make your own movies and little things 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.599
 so your own clips the montage is 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.009
 very cool actually and there is only another 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:00.379
 object that you can see the crafter that 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:01.849
 is this and the rubik cube that he needs 

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:04.159
 three blocks of iron that said hot 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:06.969
 we are crazy how are you going to revisit 39 of 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:10.409
 iron but it is not reached 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:12.239
 try we have said that the war 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:15.809
 that is, I can give all the objects 

00:06:12.239 --> 00:06:18.749
 planes to rubik's cube and kripper and 

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:20.389
 I do not see any craft or that's what 

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:22.589
 that I did not like the mold actually 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:24.869
 but hey it's fine for that to 

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:27.779
 I say them to make kinematics and 

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:29.879
 things like that are very, very cool, so 

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:32.249
 if you want to make your movies in 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:36.559
 minecraft this mode will come very well 

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:36.559
 now and I'm going to put this for all 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:42.520
 and that 's it, this is all that the 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.620
 mode adds a lot of things to for 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.890
 that for the super movies of 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.890
 Minecraft 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.100
 bye
