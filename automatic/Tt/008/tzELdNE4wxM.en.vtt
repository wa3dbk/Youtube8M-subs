believe you don't have to install
anything<00:01:56.189> for<00:01:56.579> ps1<00:01:56.909> games<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.170> can<00:01:58.619> just

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
anything for ps1 games so you can just

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.620 
anything for ps1 games so you can just
prop<00:01:58.979> those<00:01:59.189> things<00:01:59.460> in<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.850> you're

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
prop those things in and you're
