00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
to retake tweet I think most people know

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.740 
to retake tweet I think most people know
is<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.099> have<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.400> do<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.609> whole<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:30.300> know<00:00:30.420> cut

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
is you have to do the whole you know cut

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.690 
is you have to do the whole you know cut
in<00:00:31.080> pay<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:31.560> let's<00:00:31.980> say<00:00:32.099> we<00:00:32.189> want<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.550> do

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
in pay so let's say we want it to do

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.760 
in pay so let's say we want it to do
that<00:00:33.200> then<00:00:34.670> normally<00:00:35.670> you<00:00:35.790> put<00:00:35.820> an<00:00:36.120> RT<00:00:36.770> in

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
that then normally you put an RT in

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.530 
that then normally you put an RT in
front<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.550> then<00:00:38.730> you're<00:00:38.879> good<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.420> go

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
front of it and then you're good to go

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.229 
front of it and then you're good to go
and<00:00:39.870> now<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.170> can<00:00:40.530> retweet<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.730> if<00:00:41.790> it's

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
and now you can retweet this if it's

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.030 
and now you can retweet this if it's
something<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.809> would<00:00:43.230> like<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.410> share
