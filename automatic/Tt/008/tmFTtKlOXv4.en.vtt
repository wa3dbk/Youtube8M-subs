00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.760
 bitter Christmas for the Italians the 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.160
 economic crisis the recession and the 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.380
 increase in the number of unemployed have done 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.750
 of the festivity one of the worst in 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.019
 terms of consumption of recent years 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.449
 super tuto that a sewing box keeps 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:29.599
 one in three families buys in 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.849
 rebates but the crisis also affects the 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.280
 discount period the power of 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.590
 consumption has been drastically reduced and 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.350
 the situation is dramatic in addition 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.780
 we witnessed a lot of speculation by 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.879
 part of who sell millions of 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.210
 Italians have been forced by the 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:49.730
 precariousness to rationalize spending this 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.010
 fact has caused falls of up to 20 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.550
 percent in sectors such as 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.289
 footwear clothing objects or travel goods 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:01.309
 considered superfluous 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:03.980
 I do what I saw, I have not noticed a 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.110
 great reduction in purchases but I have 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.870
 seen the city a little low on tone 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.070
 they have not decorated it as in 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:12.070
 previous Christmases 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.440
 we are two people at home is not that 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.720
 we can reduce much more our 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.420
 food purchases I've spent the same as 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.580
 in other years but in gifts less 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.040
 sectors that seem to have resisted 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.530
 the difficulty of the moment have been the 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.440
 the technological and nutritional 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.619
 forecasts for 2013 are nevertheless 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.780
 equally negative and fear before the 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:41.910
 absence of structural interventions 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.910
 a worsening of the recessive spiral 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.240
 You can not spend as before now 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.880
 is more with family with friends

 traditional things are consumed and 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.369
 homemade strolling you see many people in the 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.340
 street but not in business the worst 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.619
 Christmas of the last ten years so the

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.260
 taxes that Italian families have 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:18.570
