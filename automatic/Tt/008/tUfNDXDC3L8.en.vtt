00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.830 
wouldn't be a ton of style and mentors
the<00:00:32.160> exact<00:00:32.460> same<00:00:32.669> as<00:00:32.850> women's<00:00:33.210> we<00:00:33.480> all<00:00:33.600> want

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
the exact same as women's we all want

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.930 
the exact same as women's we all want
this<00:00:33.989> haircut<00:00:34.440> that's<00:00:34.680> wash<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.280> go<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:35.790> we

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
this haircut that's wash and go and we

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.240 
this haircut that's wash and go and we
can<00:00:36.059> just<00:00:36.210> wash<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:36.899> will<00:00:36.989> look<00:00:37.110> great

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
can just wash it and it will look great

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.979 
can just wash it and it will look great
but<00:00:38.250> just<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.910> same<00:00:39.059> as<00:00:39.210> women's<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.660> actually

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
but just the same as women's it actually

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.350 
but just the same as women's it actually
requires<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.950> bit<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.460> maintenance<00:00:41.760> if<00:00:42.210> you

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
requires a bit of maintenance if you

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.819 
requires a bit of maintenance if you
want<00:00:42.809> it<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.050> look<00:00:43.170> stylish

want it to look stylish

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.810 
want it to look stylish

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820

you're<00:00:48.059> going<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.539> blood<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.050> blow-dry<00:00:49.649> it

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989
