00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
spot in the house with the same scale so

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.589 
spot in the house with the same scale so
that<00:02:35.360> it<00:02:35.480> is<00:02:35.780> you<00:02:36.650> know<00:02:36.940> accurate<00:02:37.940> as<00:02:38.330> a<00:02:38.360> home

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
that it is you know accurate as a home

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.039 
that it is you know accurate as a home
scale<00:02:38.900> can<00:02:39.110> really<00:02:39.319> be<00:02:39.500> honestly<00:02:40.569> then<00:02:41.569> you

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049 
scale can really be honestly then you

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.520 
scale can really be honestly then you
can<00:02:42.290> buy<00:02:42.620> these<00:02:42.680> little<00:02:43.010> urine<00:02:43.400> cups<00:02:43.670> or<00:02:44.530> you

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
can buy these little urine cups or you

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.960 
can buy these little urine cups or you
know<00:02:45.650> not<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:46.400> be<00:02:46.489> gross<00:02:46.610> or<00:02:46.819> anything

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
know not to be gross or anything

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.890 
know not to be gross or anything
designate<00:02:47.630> a<00:02:47.660> cup<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:48.170> use<00:02:48.940> and<00:02:49.940> just<00:02:50.569> you<00:02:50.840> know

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
designate a cup to use and just you know

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.259 
designate a cup to use and just you know
wash<00:02:51.140> it<00:02:51.349> and<00:02:51.440> keep<00:02:51.590> using<00:02:51.769> it<00:02:51.980> so<00:02:52.190> I<00:02:52.430> have<00:02:53.090> some

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
wash it and keep using it so I have some

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.870 
wash it and keep using it so I have some
little<00:02:53.450> cups<00:02:53.690> so<00:02:53.900> anyways<00:02:54.709> because<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:55.610> still

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
little cups so anyways because you still

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.610 
little cups so anyways because you still
are<00:02:55.910> going<00:02:56.269> to<00:02:56.390> be<00:02:56.480> doing<00:02:56.660> ketosis<00:02:57.440> that's

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
are going to be doing ketosis that's

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.660 
are going to be doing ketosis that's
gonna<00:02:57.739> be<00:02:57.829> huge<00:02:58.069> it's<00:02:58.250> gonna<00:02:58.400> be<00:02:58.459> the<00:02:58.549> big

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
gonna be huge it's gonna be the big

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.039 
gonna be huge it's gonna be the big
thing<00:02:58.700> for<00:02:59.060> you<00:02:59.150> right<00:02:59.180> if<00:02:59.480> you're<00:02:59.599> in<00:02:59.630> ketosis

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
thing for you right if you're in ketosis

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:01.120 
thing for you right if you're in ketosis
if<00:03:00.140> you're<00:03:00.230> not<00:03:00.319> in<00:03:00.440> ketosis<00:03:00.709> that's<00:03:01.010> what

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
if you're not in ketosis that's what

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
if you're not in ketosis that's what
everyone's<00:03:01.400> waiting<00:03:01.610> for<00:03:01.700> when<00:03:01.970> you<00:03:02.030> go<00:03:02.090> in

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
everyone's waiting for when you go in

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.880 
everyone's waiting for when you go in
the<00:03:02.239> clinic<00:03:02.630> that's<00:03:03.170> how<00:03:03.349> they're<00:03:03.500> testing

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
the clinic that's how they're testing

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.339 
the clinic that's how they're testing
you<00:03:03.980> so<00:03:04.310> you<00:03:05.090> go<00:03:05.239> to<00:03:05.299> the<00:03:05.510> drugstore<00:03:05.750> for

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
you so you go to the drugstore for

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.680 
you so you go to the drugstore for
probably<00:03:06.680> six<00:03:07.040> dollars<00:03:07.400> I<00:03:07.549> haven't<00:03:07.819> Canada<00:03:08.450> so

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
probably six dollars I haven't Canada so

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.870 
probably six dollars I haven't Canada so
I'm<00:03:08.780> gonna<00:03:08.900> do<00:03:09.019> Canadian<00:03:09.410> prices<00:03:09.769> and<00:03:10.040> you<00:03:10.670> buy

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
I'm gonna do Canadian prices and you buy

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.809 
I'm gonna do Canadian prices and you buy
I<00:03:11.349> bought<00:03:12.349> keto<00:03:12.980> diet<00:03:13.250> sticks<00:03:13.519> these<00:03:13.700> are

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
I bought keto diet sticks these are

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.000 
I bought keto diet sticks these are
glucose<00:03:14.209> and<00:03:14.420> ketones<00:03:14.780> um<00:03:15.019> you<00:03:15.709> don't<00:03:15.799> need<00:03:15.950> to

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
glucose and ketones um you don't need to

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.500 
glucose and ketones um you don't need to
do<00:03:16.100> that<00:03:16.130> you<00:03:16.519> can<00:03:16.670> just<00:03:16.850> buy<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.000> ones<00:03:17.299> that

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
do that you can just buy the ones that

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.199 
do that you can just buy the ones that
say<00:03:17.920> just<00:03:18.920> ketose<00:03:19.730> keto<00:03:20.450> sticks<00:03:20.799> and<00:03:22.209> they're

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
say just ketose keto sticks and they're

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.789 
say just ketose keto sticks and they're
the<00:03:23.359> same<00:03:23.510> deal<00:03:23.750> they've<00:03:24.049> got<00:03:24.200> a<00:03:24.230> gauge<00:03:24.500> on<00:03:24.680> the

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
the same deal they've got a gauge on the

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.470 
the same deal they've got a gauge on the
side<00:03:25.010> to<00:03:25.190> tell<00:03:25.310> you<00:03:25.400> if<00:03:25.489> you're<00:03:25.639> you<00:03:26.120> know<00:03:26.150> in

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
side to tell you if you're you know in

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.949 
side to tell you if you're you know in
or<00:03:26.750> not<00:03:26.930> in<00:03:27.200> ketosis<00:03:28.069> it's<00:03:28.250> very<00:03:28.519> simple

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
or not in ketosis it's very simple

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.140 
or not in ketosis it's very simple
negative<00:03:29.959> or<00:03:30.139> positive<00:03:30.400> so<00:03:31.400> that's<00:03:31.579> one<00:03:31.880> and

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
negative or positive so that's one and

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:33.910 
negative or positive so that's one and
