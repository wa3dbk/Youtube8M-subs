view<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.220> first<00:00:29.550> turn<00:00:29.880> that's<00:00:30.119> turn<00:00:30.330> nine

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
view the first turn that's turn nine

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.910 
view the first turn that's turn nine
it's<00:00:30.929> called<00:00:31.140> ten<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.619> B<00:00:31.740> because

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
it's called ten a and B because

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.680 
it's called ten a and B because
basically<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.369> come<00:00:32.520> in<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.759> turn<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.239> then

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
you leave the turn a and B and then

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.000 
you leave the turn a and B and then

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
angle it is Formula Drift so you want to

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.260 
angle it is Formula Drift so you want to
drift<00:01:40.680> not<00:01:41.070> formula<00:01:41.460> drive<00:01:41.610> straight<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.180> know

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
drift not formula drive straight I know

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.190 
drift not formula drive straight I know
I<00:01:42.390> wasn't<00:01:42.720> gonna<00:01:42.869> say<00:01:43.140> it
