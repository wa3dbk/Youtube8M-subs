00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.490 
as well not now I think that's what I
think<00:06:26.210> that's<00:06:26.480> better<00:06:26.690> do<00:06:26.900> it<00:06:27.050> thinking<00:06:27.410> a

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500 
think that's better do it thinking a

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.460 
think that's better do it thinking a
little<00:06:27.590> bit<00:06:27.740> there<00:06:28.570> further<00:06:29.570> I'd<00:06:30.050> say<00:06:30.320> that's

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:30.470 
little bit there further I'd say that's

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.560 
little bit there further I'd say that's
respectable<00:06:31.070> half<00:06:31.670> a<00:06:31.820> second<00:06:32.180> behind<00:06:32.270> the

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:32.570 
respectable half a second behind the

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:36.070 
respectable half a second behind the
leader<00:06:32.780> future<00:06:33.650> Lorenzo<00:06:34.600> those<00:06:35.600> are<00:06:35.840> there
