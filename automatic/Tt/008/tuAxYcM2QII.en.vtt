detail one thing I got to point out
right<00:00:26.250> off<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.550> bat<00:00:26.699> when<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.029> look<00:00:27.180> at<00:00:27.330> this

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
right off the bat when you look at this

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.720 
right off the bat when you look at this
at<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.660> top<00:00:27.930> it's<00:00:28.380> got<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.560> nice<00:00:28.890> handle<00:00:29.550> so<00:00:29.670> you

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
at the top it's got a nice handle so you

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.130 
at the top it's got a nice handle so you
can<00:00:29.760> carry<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.179> around<00:00:30.269> because<00:00:30.779> these<00:00:30.900> cases

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
can carry it around because these cases

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.260 
can carry it around because these cases
can<00:00:31.710> get<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:31.949> little<00:00:32.070> bit<00:00:32.250> heavy<00:00:32.430> but<00:00:32.969> it<00:00:33.059> makes

with<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.059> have<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.930> low<00:01:01.410> speed<00:01:01.800> medium

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
with that have it that low speed medium

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.369 
with that have it that low speed medium
high<00:01:02.910> this<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.660> what<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:03.870> would<00:01:03.989> look<00:01:04.199> of

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
high this is what it would look of

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.750 
high this is what it would look of
course<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.860> can<00:01:04.890> alternate<00:01:05.430> through<00:01:05.670> the

done before on higher-end cases I'm glad
Coolermaster<00:02:13.319> thought<00:02:13.530> about

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
Coolermaster thought about

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.010 
Coolermaster thought about
the<00:02:14.070> same<00:02:14.250> thing<00:02:14.490> here<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.420> love<00:02:15.720> it<00:02:15.870> so

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
the same thing here and I love it so

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.930 
the same thing here and I love it so
this<00:02:16.470> is<00:02:16.590> an<00:02:16.710> additional<00:02:17.130> bonus<00:02:17.370> which<00:02:17.730> I

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
this is an additional bonus which I

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.530 
this is an additional bonus which I
think<00:02:18.270> ranks<00:02:19.170> this<00:02:19.620> case<00:02:19.920> above<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.850> rest<00:02:21.090> now

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
think ranks this case above the rest now

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.180 
think ranks this case above the rest now
looking<00:02:21.930> at<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.350> top<00:02:22.560> of<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:22.800> case<00:02:22.980> where<00:02:23.130> you

looking at the top of the case where you

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.530 
looking at the top of the case where you
see<00:02:23.220> the<00:02:23.430> grille<00:02:23.670> pattern<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.240> lot<00:02:24.420> of

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
see the grille pattern a lot of

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.140 
see the grille pattern a lot of

ventilation for the air pumped out at

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.030 
ventilation for the air pumped out at
the<00:02:27.330> top<00:02:27.540> for<00:02:27.900> example<00:02:28.380> through<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.590> exhaust

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
the top for example through the exhaust

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.430 
the top for example through the exhaust
and<00:02:29.340> of<00:02:30.180> course<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.510> is<00:02:30.630> dust<00:02:30.840> filters<00:02:31.230> all

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
and of course it is dust filters all

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.750 
and of course it is dust filters all
over<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.740> place<00:02:31.890> which<00:02:32.070> I<00:02:32.160> really<00:02:32.430> like<00:02:32.580> as

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
over the place which I really like as

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.970 
over the place which I really like as
well<00:02:33.000> looking<00:02:33.780> at<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.990> side<00:02:34.230> panel<00:02:34.680> which<00:02:34.830> is

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
well looking at the side panel which is

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.180 
well looking at the side panel which is
obviously<00:02:35.490> going<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.240> be<00:02:36.860> customized<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:38.010> can

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
obviously going to be customized you can

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.860 
obviously going to be customized you can
you<00:02:38.430> can<00:02:38.610> have<00:02:38.760> fans<00:02:39.120> there<00:02:39.390> on<00:02:39.480> that<00:02:39.600> side

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
you can have fans there on that side

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.480 
you can have fans there on that side
panel<00:02:40.260> or<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:40.470> can<00:02:40.740> just<00:02:40.860> leave<00:02:41.040> it<00:02:41.070> open<00:02:41.460> like

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
panel or you can just leave it open like

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.540 
panel or you can just leave it open like
that<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:42.030> on<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.870> opposite<00:02:43.500> side<00:02:43.770> you've<00:02:44.340> got

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
that and on the opposite side you've got

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.580 
that and on the opposite side you've got
some<00:02:44.760> ventilation<00:02:45.390> as<00:02:45.540> well<00:02:45.780> it<00:02:46.260> kind<00:02:46.530> of

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
some ventilation as well it kind of

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.560 
some ventilation as well it kind of
matches<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.130> design<00:02:47.400> on<00:02:47.820> either<00:02:48.000> side<00:02:48.390> of<00:02:48.420> the

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
matches the design on either side of the

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.930 
matches the design on either side of the
case<00:02:48.810> so<00:02:49.170> it<00:02:49.230> looks<00:02:49.410> really<00:02:49.560> cool<00:02:49.890> alright<00:02:50.640> so

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
case so it looks really cool alright so

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.420 
case so it looks really cool alright so
I<00:02:51.210> have<00:02:51.510> no<00:02:51.660> complaints<00:02:52.230> about<00:02:52.320> that<00:02:52.470> inside
