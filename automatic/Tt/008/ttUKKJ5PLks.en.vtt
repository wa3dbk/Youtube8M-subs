00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 and this movie's sponsor is my 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.720
 account incentive 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.080
 here I buy your keys to the suit for 80 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.200
 rubles 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.269
 I sell for 95 rubles there is 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.469
 rules by which I act also 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.260
 there is a huge amount 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.539
 positive comments though 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.090
 I have been doing this relatively recently with 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.119
 the day before yesterday can read and 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.990
 You can of course buy a reference 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.990
 in description 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.210
 hi guys, well, track 22 is not and 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.090
 today we will talk about how 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.160
 holding down flank b on the map de mirage of 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.840
 various interesting positions 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.260
 so let's start the first position 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:59.200
 let us take rush on b this 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:05.590
 position is very complicated about checking and her 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:07.300
 very difficult to predict next 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.040
 position is relatively complex in execution 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.110
 because it needs very good 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.870
 reaction to take it forward 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:16.560
 opponents but can show it 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.560
 be someone it is useful 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.630
 him 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.740
 the next position is one of the easiest 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.540
 and very interesting because you can 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.790
 kill two three opponents who 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.420
 are on the ridge they won't even understand what 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.420
 you killed them 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.120
 thank you very much and burn for help 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.610
 in the preparation of this video 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.090
 thank you for watching everyone good luck everyone 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.090
 until
