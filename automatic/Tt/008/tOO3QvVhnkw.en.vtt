wall plug a 110 and you plug it into the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.209 
wall plug a 110 and you plug it into the
helicopter<00:01:26.719> to<00:01:26.869> charge<00:01:27.109> it<00:01:27.320> it<00:01:27.770> does<00:01:27.950> not

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.219 
helicopter to charge it it does not

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:31.349 
helicopter to charge it it does not
charge<00:01:28.880> off<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:29.479> controller<00:01:29.950> unfortunately

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:31.359 
charge off the controller unfortunately

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:34.330 
charge off the controller unfortunately
and<00:01:32.359> it<00:01:32.539> comes<00:01:32.719> with<00:01:32.780> instructions<00:01:33.649> and<00:01:33.920> they

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
and it comes with instructions and they

actually look pretty nicely detailed so

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.380 
actually look pretty nicely detailed so
how<00:01:39.530> about<00:01:39.590> we<00:01:40.009> get<00:01:40.219> this<00:01:40.429> up<00:01:40.670> in<00:01:40.820> the<00:01:40.880> air<00:01:40.909> and

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
how about we get this up in the air and

00:01:41.390 --> 00:05:13.730 
how about we get this up in the air and
see<00:01:41.539> what<00:01:41.689> I<00:01:41.719> can<00:01:41.960> do

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.129 

so<00:05:14.740> let's<00:05:14.979> conclude<00:05:15.940> on<00:05:16.750> the<00:05:17.790> exploiter

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
so let's conclude on the exploiter

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:22.110 
so let's conclude on the exploiter
helicopter<00:05:20.139> for<00:05:20.530> indoors<00:05:21.009> and<00:05:21.340> outdoors<00:05:21.520> I

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
helicopter for indoors and outdoors I

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.950 
helicopter for indoors and outdoors I
recommend<00:05:22.630> it<00:05:22.810> outdoors<00:05:23.259> and<00:05:24.360> my<00:05:25.360> problem<00:05:25.780> was

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
recommend it outdoors and my problem was

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.360 
recommend it outdoors and my problem was
that<00:05:25.990> I<00:05:26.199> couldn't<00:05:26.590> get<00:05:26.680> it<00:05:26.770> to<00:05:26.800> go<00:05:27.039> forward

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
that I couldn't get it to go forward

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.999 
that I couldn't get it to go forward
very<00:05:27.759> fast<00:05:27.900> but<00:05:28.900> I<00:05:28.930> could<00:05:29.259> get<00:05:29.470> it<00:05:29.590> to<00:05:29.710> go<00:05:29.860> in

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:30.009 
very fast but I could get it to go in

Reverse 25 rather half forward and

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.040 
Reverse 25 rather half forward and
reverse<00:05:34.030> and<00:05:35.100> it<00:05:36.100> was<00:05:36.430> stable<00:05:36.850> for<00:05:37.360> an<00:05:37.870> outdoor

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.110 
controller remaining connected to the
helicopter<00:06:13.720> so<00:06:14.410> when<00:06:14.860> I<00:06:14.889> fly<00:06:15.340> and<00:06:15.400> get<00:06:15.699> to<00:06:15.910> high

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
helicopter so when I fly and get to high

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.450 
helicopter so when I fly and get to high
it<00:06:16.990> would<00:06:17.169> shut<00:06:17.440> off<00:06:17.590> and<00:06:17.860> the<00:06:17.949> helicopter

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
it would shut off and the helicopter

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.430 
it would shut off and the helicopter
fall<00:06:18.699> to<00:06:18.820> the<00:06:18.880> ground<00:06:18.910> and<00:06:19.570> then<00:06:20.080> when<00:06:20.199> I<00:06:20.229> got

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
fall to the ground and then when I got

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.800 
fall to the ground and then when I got
closer<00:06:20.830> if<00:06:21.280> I<00:06:21.430> could<00:06:21.699> throttle<00:06:22.000> off<00:06:22.389> I<00:06:22.570> would

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
closer if I could throttle off I would

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.710 
closer if I could throttle off I would
and<00:06:23.110> it<00:06:23.229> would<00:06:23.440> catch<00:06:24.310> it<00:06:24.580> just<00:06:24.760> enough<00:06:25.419> to<00:06:25.599> not

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 
and it would catch it just enough to not

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.360 
and it would catch it just enough to not
rekt<00:06:26.110> hard<00:06:26.410> and<00:06:28.169> but<00:06:29.169> I<00:06:29.199> like<00:06:29.590> it<00:06:29.830> I<00:06:29.979> think<00:06:30.220> it's

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:30.370 
rekt hard and but I like it I think it's

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.890 
rekt hard and but I like it I think it's
alright<00:06:30.820> it's<00:06:31.260> mediocre<00:06:32.430> but<00:06:33.510> yeah<00:06:34.510> it<00:06:34.720> was

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:34.900 
alright it's mediocre but yeah it was

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:40.290 
alright it's mediocre but yeah it was
$50<00:06:35.710> at<00:06:35.979> Walmart<00:06:36.960> and<00:06:38.490> it<00:06:39.490> flies<00:06:39.760> good<00:06:40.060> enough

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.300 
$50 at Walmart and it flies good enough

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.379 
$50 at Walmart and it flies good enough
for<00:06:40.510> $50<00:06:41.380> I<00:06:41.710> had<00:06:42.400> a<00:06:42.430> good<00:06:42.699> time<00:06:42.909> with<00:06:43.120> it<00:06:43.180> it

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:43.389 
for $50 I had a good time with it it

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:45.510 
for $50 I had a good time with it it
comes<00:06:43.570> with<00:06:43.750> a<00:06:43.870> lot<00:06:44.139> of<00:06:44.289> spare<00:06:44.530> parts<00:06:44.830> compared

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520 
comes with a lot of spare parts compared

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.240 
comes with a lot of spare parts compared
to<00:06:45.639> other<00:06:45.880> helicopters<00:06:46.599> so<00:06:47.260> that's<00:06:47.470> good<00:06:47.800> I

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.250 
to other helicopters so that's good I

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.760 
to other helicopters so that's good I
did<00:06:49.120> have<00:06:49.330> more<00:06:49.570> linkages<00:06:50.229> than<00:06:50.500> I<00:06:50.620> originally

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:50.770 
did have more linkages than I originally

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.899 
did have more linkages than I originally
said<00:06:51.580> I<00:06:51.909> have<00:06:52.479> about<00:06:52.870> 4<00:06:53.320> or<00:06:53.349> 5<00:06:53.530> that<00:06:54.310> it<00:06:54.699> came

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:02.020 
that's like 6 to 7 linkages so that I

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.200 
that's like 6 to 7 linkages so that I
was<00:07:02.229> generous<00:07:02.740> of<00:07:02.979> them<00:07:03.190> plus<00:07:03.580> giving<00:07:03.909> you<00:07:04.180> a
