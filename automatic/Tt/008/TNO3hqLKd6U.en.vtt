the<00:00:05.680> netbook<00:00:06.220> is<00:00:06.600> our<00:00:07.600> most<00:00:07.779> popular<00:00:08.109> Mac<00:00:09.180> but

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:10.180 
the netbook is our most popular Mac but

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.049 
the netbook is our most popular Mac but
what<00:00:10.330> we've<00:00:10.570> what<00:00:11.110> we've<00:00:11.170> done<00:00:11.619> and<00:00:11.949> and<00:00:12.789> we've

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:13.059 
what we've what we've done and and we've

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:14.930 
what we've what we've done and and we've
made<00:00:13.209> a<00:00:13.240> habit<00:00:13.570> of<00:00:13.780> doing<00:00:14.020> this<00:00:14.110> it<00:00:14.289> Apple<00:00:14.650> is

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
made a habit of doing this it Apple is

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.410 
made a habit of doing this it Apple is
is<00:00:15.940> we<00:00:16.330> decided<00:00:16.930> just<00:00:17.500> to<00:00:17.560> start<00:00:17.949> over

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.320 

the<00:00:21.990> new<00:00:22.140> macbook<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.770> a<00:00:22.860> quite<00:00:23.250> remarkable

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
the new macbook is a quite remarkable

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.230 
the new macbook is a quite remarkable
engineering<00:00:24.380> achievement<00:00:25.730> it<00:00:26.730> really

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
engineering achievement it really

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.830 
engineering achievement it really
represents<00:00:28.050> just<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.130> complete<00:00:29.610> revolution<00:00:30.060> in

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
represents just a complete revolution in

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:43.299 
represents just a complete revolution in
the<00:00:31.380> way<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.650> notebooks<00:00:32.040> are<00:00:32.189> made

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.889 

and<00:00:44.309> traditionally<00:00:44.969> notebooks<00:00:45.480> are<00:00:45.659> made

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
and traditionally notebooks are made

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.000 
and traditionally notebooks are made
from<00:00:46.640> multiple<00:00:47.640> parts<00:00:48.440> but<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.559> problem<00:00:49.890> is

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
from multiple parts but the problem is

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.549 
from multiple parts but the problem is
when<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.670> have<00:00:50.909> multiple<00:00:51.359> parts<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.409> add

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
when you have multiple parts you you add

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.969 
when you have multiple parts you you add
size<00:00:52.979> and<00:00:53.370> weight<00:00:53.609> and<00:00:54.079> and<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.199> increase<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:55.979 
size and weight and and you increase the

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:58.340 
size and weight and and you increase the
opportunity<00:00:56.519> for<00:00:56.549> failure<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.299> that<00:00:57.350> the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
opportunity for failure and that the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.920 
opportunity for failure and that the
huge<00:00:59.039> breakthrough<00:00:59.339> that<00:01:00.180> we<00:01:00.390> heard<00:01:00.659> with

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
huge breakthrough that we heard with

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.920 
huge breakthrough that we heard with
with<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.260> macbook<00:01:01.789> was<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:02.969> replace<00:01:03.329> all<00:01:03.570> of

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
with the macbook was to replace all of

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.190 
with the macbook was to replace all of
those<00:01:04.080> parts<00:01:04.559> with<00:01:05.129> just<00:01:05.369> one<00:01:05.700> part<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.420> at

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
those parts with just one part and at

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.460 
those parts with just one part and at
one<00:01:07.380> part<00:01:07.649> we<00:01:07.830> caught<00:01:08.039> the<00:01:08.159> unibody<00:01:09.470> we

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
one part we caught the unibody we

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.399 
one part we caught the unibody we
figured<00:01:10.950> out<00:01:11.039> a<00:01:11.100> way<00:01:11.429> of<00:01:11.970> being<00:01:12.810> able<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.110> make

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
figured out a way of being able to make

that we've we've never even dreamed of
before<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:25.009> the<00:01:26.009> only<00:01:26.220> way<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:27.299> make<00:01:27.539> that<00:01:27.899> one

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
before and the only way to make that one

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.440 
before and the only way to make that one
part<00:01:28.470> was<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.220> machine<00:01:29.580> it<00:01:29.759> from<00:01:29.940> a<00:01:30.060> single

piece of aluminium aluminum was the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.570 
piece of aluminium aluminum was the

solid block of aluminum then we go

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.630 
solid block of aluminum then we go
through<00:01:56.960> an<00:01:57.079> extrusion<00:01:57.469> process<00:01:57.770> which<00:01:58.520> is

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
through an extrusion process which is

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.510 
through an extrusion process which is
kind<00:01:58.850> of<00:01:58.939> like<00:01:59.030> how<00:01:59.180> you<00:01:59.240> make<00:01:59.509> like<00:01:59.869> pasta<00:02:00.320> and

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
kind of like how you make like pasta and
