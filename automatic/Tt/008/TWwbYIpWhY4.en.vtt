 but I could not could vegetables 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.610
 all this goes on and this is all too 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.979
 elk on his recipe so to speak new 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:13.900
 did 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.070
 and also or when it opened only 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.570
 the local ank 2 and such a spread was afraid 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.640
 she because we still have a lot of specifics 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.850
 but he called selected arabia 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.520

 Eastern dish that is 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.330
 on sats vegetables for that we have 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.300
 all this will fight tomato juice 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.289
 naturally mb 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:50.700
 we will cook 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.620
 there is probably 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.660
 stew so to speak than seven 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.360
 cars 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.740
 but for flavor I add a little bit 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.130
 lamb fat that is available 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.910
 me 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.680
 in the freezer 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.910
 start cooking eggplant 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.740
 since eggplants are such 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.999
 slight bitterness 

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:11.639
 and so that she while we cook this 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:13.489
 cut portions of meat 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.129
 other potatoes 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.449
 we are planning eggplants 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:20.449
 So on such Colorado cubes 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.329
 and put them somewhere in the tank 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.449
 some dishes 

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:29.829
 and a little when salt to taste so that they 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:30.929
 given time 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:33.779
 a descendant of a concert when we shall be that 

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:34.989
 ready 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.039
 we are with olegom this juice 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:39.929
 let's wash some water 

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:41.649
 will report 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:44.649
 and all your real and as far as filling 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.929
 pot percentage 

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:49.019
 as far as possible on that big saucepan 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.569
 You can cook FC Alania when 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.279
 more will be stacked layers 

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:56.729
 clear and other vegetables 

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:58.679
 okay, we will lay 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.259
 first napoleon 

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:02.839
 our duty 

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:04.659
 and then we will lay the model 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:07.659
 filling 

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:20.600
 moral damage 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.999
 and the next is not very small 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:26.239
 but on this path 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.239
 translated the revenue from colleagues by courier 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.009
 Kohl family 

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:34.049
 I got one red onion 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.099
 nobody's going to repeat the potatoes 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.099
 large potato lens 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:53.249
 on his account in different ways someone 

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:55.589
 someone loves finely someone would rejoice 

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:57.029
 can easily catch 

00:03:57.029 --> 00:03:58.999
 or large chunks 

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:02.260
 but it is already so to say improvisation on 

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:05.239
 lover dol peg with us 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.069
 anna greta already while we are right there 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.169
 cooked 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:11.799
 all this 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.269
 and lay out 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.639
 we start packings the most 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.939
 start with meat 

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:21.979
 in each pot lay on the bottom 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:23.789
 meat of mud which the ball 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:26.639
 someone laying the middle of a tattoo 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.639
 i prefer snow 

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:32.020
 all this 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.020
 there is such a little work 

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:39.960
 now because she can't 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.699
 very sharp but we are a little bit to sharp 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.280
 I had them a little bit now 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.379
 use 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:48.379
 on the fact that 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.870
 well, a little bit 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.870
 hops ismail 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.800
 now report potatoes 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.800
 each pot has its own potato 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.180
 all this does not represent a little 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.800
 a little bit of me 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.669
 since we have 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:14.979
 process 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:16.729
 tomato juice 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:18.490
 salty pad 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.979
 not just a little hangers 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:23.979
 next milk processing 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:45.669
 so I'm somewhere else another important step 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:48.430
 cut 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.330
 not everyone is doing 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.330
 tomato juice 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.849
 close all this our charm 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:06.580
 lids 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.900
 and put in a preheated oven 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.939
 that's what good is this dish 

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:14.939
 all outfits and accessories 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.599
 up to holding on cnn 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:20.169
 set forgot 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:22.999
 it will be about an hour and a half 

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:24.680
 the capital of the oven 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.910
 first over high heat then marathon 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.210
 many getting a cab with uruguay 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.599
 has passed 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:33.180
 mean a show time 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.319
 stood in the oven 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:37.259
 our officials 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:39.650
 can two hours can only be a low fire 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:40.949
 survived 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:43.150
 so that 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:46.009
 more than tighter 

00:06:46.009 --> 00:06:49.439
 but this opinion is not only mine 

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:51.679
 before they got out of the oven let's see what 

00:06:51.679 --> 00:06:53.849
 we made it 

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:56.830
 so we have 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.979
 canned stewed meat 

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:01.339
 with vegetables turned out 

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:03.589
 officials are ready 

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:04.999
 enjoy the south of china
