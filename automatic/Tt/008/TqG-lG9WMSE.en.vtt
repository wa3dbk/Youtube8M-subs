00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.380 
usually when I let my hair air dry I get
these<00:03:30.630> really<00:03:31.170> really<00:03:31.380> big<00:03:31.820> curls<00:03:32.820> and

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
these really really big curls and

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.390 
these really really big curls and
they're<00:03:33.930> just<00:03:34.049> like<00:03:34.200> really<00:03:34.440> dry<00:03:34.680> like<00:03:34.980> Joan

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
they're just like really dry like Joan

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.789 
they're just like really dry like Joan
from<00:03:35.760> girlfriends<00:03:36.359> but<00:03:37.170> I've<00:03:37.320> tried<00:03:37.500> this<00:03:37.650> and

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
from girlfriends but I've tried this and

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.319 
from girlfriends but I've tried this and
it<00:03:37.890> made<00:03:38.010> it<00:03:38.160> more<00:03:38.280> defined<00:03:38.489> you<00:03:39.060> know<00:03:39.090> it's

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
it made it more defined you know it's

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.030 
it made it more defined you know it's
like<00:03:39.450> sleek<00:03:39.750> and<00:03:39.959> shine<00:03:40.170> you<00:03:40.440> know<00:03:40.530> it's<00:03:40.799> up

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
like sleek and shine you know it's up

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.440 
like sleek and shine you know it's up
and<00:03:41.310> having<00:03:41.519> this<00:03:41.670> in<00:03:41.850> since<00:03:42.120> early<00:03:42.420> this

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
and having this in since early this

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.660 
and having this in since early this
morning<00:03:42.900> and<00:03:43.109> it<00:03:43.739> still<00:03:43.950> it<00:03:44.250> has<00:03:44.370> not<00:03:44.489> gotten

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
morning and it still it has not gotten

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.110 
morning and it still it has not gotten
frizzy<00:03:45.180> or<00:03:45.890> unmanageable<00:03:46.890> or<00:03:47.010> anything<00:03:47.220> so<00:03:47.790> I

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
frizzy or unmanageable or anything so I

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.110 
frizzy or unmanageable or anything so I
like<00:03:48.989> that<00:03:49.410> and<00:03:49.859> I'm<00:03:50.579> gonna<00:03:50.670> continue<00:03:50.970> to

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
like that and I'm gonna continue to

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.819 
like that and I'm gonna continue to
probably<00:03:51.690> use<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.930> only<00:03:52.049> thing<00:03:52.350> with<00:03:52.500> that<00:03:52.650> is

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
probably use the only thing with that is

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.800 
probably use the only thing with that is
I'll<00:03:53.340> probably<00:03:53.489> have<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:53.820> start<00:03:54.209> stepping<00:03:54.540> up

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
I'll probably have to start stepping up

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.900 
I'll probably have to start stepping up
my<00:03:54.959> deep<00:03:55.170> conditioning<00:03:55.739> because<00:03:56.250> it's<00:03:56.820> a

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
my deep conditioning because it's a

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.240 
my deep conditioning because it's a
leave-in<00:03:57.150> but<00:03:57.750> it's<00:03:58.200> moisturizing<00:03:58.859> to<00:03:59.220> a

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
leave-in but it's moisturizing to a

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.090 
leave-in but it's moisturizing to a
certain<00:03:59.549> extent<00:03:59.910> like<00:04:00.540> I<00:04:00.569> can<00:04:00.900> tell<00:04:01.109> that<00:04:01.170> the

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
certain extent like I can tell that the

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.710 
certain extent like I can tell that the
more<00:04:02.280> I<00:04:02.310> use<00:04:02.579> the<00:04:02.609> my<00:04:02.819> hair<00:04:03.000> is<00:04:03.120> getting<00:04:03.390> drier

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
more I use the my hair is getting drier

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.479 
more I use the my hair is getting drier
so<00:04:04.470> I'll<00:04:04.560> probably<00:04:04.739> have<00:04:05.040> to<00:04:05.130> use<00:04:05.280> like<00:04:05.430> a

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
so I'll probably have to use like a

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.940 
so I'll probably have to use like a
conditioning<00:04:06.060> mask<00:04:06.239> or<00:04:06.780> new<00:04:07.410> condition<00:04:07.859> or

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
conditioning mask or new condition or

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.910 
conditioning mask or new condition or
whatever<00:04:08.190> but<00:04:08.870> also<00:04:09.870> I<00:04:10.140> probably<00:04:10.440> could<00:04:10.709> use<00:04:10.739> a

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
whatever but also I probably could use a

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.009 
whatever but also I probably could use a
hot<00:04:11.700> oil<00:04:11.880> treatment<00:04:11.970> from<00:04:12.480> this<00:04:12.660> because<00:04:12.900> this

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
hot oil treatment from this because this

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.750 
hot oil treatment from this because this
is<00:04:13.200> really<00:04:13.410> good<00:04:13.590> hot<00:04:13.739> oil<00:04:13.980> treatment<00:04:14.340> you'll

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 
is really good hot oil treatment you'll

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.120 
is really good hot oil treatment you'll
just<00:04:14.910> have<00:04:15.060> to<00:04:15.209> wash<00:04:15.480> your<00:04:15.810> hair<00:04:16.139> very

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
just have to wash your hair very

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.560 
just have to wash your hair very
thoroughly<00:04:17.519> because<00:04:18.030> this<00:04:18.150> will<00:04:18.329> leave<00:04:18.450> your

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
thoroughly because this will leave your

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
thoroughly because this will leave your
hair<00:04:18.720> and<00:04:19.049> scalp<00:04:19.320> very<00:04:19.709> greasy<00:04:20.299> but<00:04:21.590> other
