on how to get the most potential out of
the<00:02:19.500> car<00:02:19.680> as<00:02:19.800> well<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.820> we<00:02:21.000> thought<00:02:21.180> the

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
the car as well and we thought the

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.750 
the car as well and we thought the
opinion<00:02:21.750> raceway<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.740> really<00:02:23.070> great<00:02:23.520> place

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
opinion raceway is a really great place

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.000 
opinion raceway is a really great place
to<00:02:23.910> do<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.230> because<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.470> track<00:02:25.740> can

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
to do that because the track can

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.310 
to do that because the track can
demonstrate<00:02:26.460> more<00:02:27.180> than<00:02:27.390> just<00:02:27.630> high<00:02:27.960> speeds

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
demonstrate more than just high speeds

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.440 
demonstrate more than just high speeds
it<00:02:28.830> can<00:02:28.980> also<00:02:29.100> show<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.850> various<00:02:30.090> handling

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
it can also show the various handling

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.210 
it can also show the various handling
capabilities<00:02:30.990> a<00:02:31.020> lot<00:02:31.200> of<00:02:31.290> elevation<00:02:31.770> changes

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
capabilities a lot of elevation changes

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.420
