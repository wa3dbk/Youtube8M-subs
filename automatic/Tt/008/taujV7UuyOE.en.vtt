brainstorming<00:01:22.289> a<00:01:22.799> lot<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.100> ideas<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.820> we<00:01:24.479> can

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
brainstorming a lot of ideas that we can

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.410 
brainstorming a lot of ideas that we can
maybe<00:01:24.750> implement<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.740> collect<00:01:26.640> water<00:01:26.820> on<00:01:27.060> site

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
maybe implement to collect water on site

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.440 
maybe implement to collect water on site
purify<00:01:28.140> water<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.680> site<00:01:29.039> and<00:01:29.399> store<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.969> so

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
purify water on site and store it so

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.179 
purify water on site and store it so
they<00:01:30.570> can<00:01:30.750> use<00:01:31.200> water<00:01:31.590> collected<00:01:32.039> during

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
they can use water collected during

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.160 
they can use water collected during
murine<00:01:32.549> ear<00:01:32.579> periods<00:01:33.149> during<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.780> dryer

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
murine ear periods during the dryer

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.700 
murine ear periods during the dryer
periods<00:01:34.680> as<00:01:34.859> well

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.220 

the<00:01:38.710> largest<00:01:39.370> expense<00:01:40.150> after<00:01:40.870> street

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
the largest expense after street

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.960 
put it all back into one big pipe and we
send<00:02:07.090> it<00:02:07.210> back<00:02:07.360> out<00:02:07.600> so<00:02:08.229> now<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:09.340> challenge<00:02:09.850> is

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
send it back out so now the challenge is

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.630 
send it back out so now the challenge is
is<00:02:10.390> like<00:02:10.420> can<00:02:11.110> we<00:02:11.140> rethink<00:02:11.740> that<00:02:11.980> system<00:02:12.459> can

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
is like can we rethink that system can

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.550 
is like can we rethink that system can
we<00:02:12.730> have<00:02:12.820> more<00:02:13.000> decentralized<00:02:13.720> systems<00:02:14.230> and

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
we have more decentralized systems and

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.080 
we have more decentralized systems and
there's<00:02:14.709> been<00:02:14.860> some<00:02:15.010> small<00:02:15.280> experiments<00:02:15.970> and

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
there's been some small experiments and

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.080 
there's been some small experiments and
stuff<00:02:16.300> I'm<00:02:16.720> very<00:02:16.780> passionate<00:02:17.230> about

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
stuff I'm very passionate about

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.550 
stuff I'm very passionate about
sustainable<00:02:19.090> retrofit<00:02:19.750> it's<00:02:20.020> a<00:02:20.230> really

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
sustainable retrofit it's a really

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.220 
sustainable retrofit it's a really
exciting<00:02:21.150> challenge<00:02:22.150> both<00:02:22.720> from<00:02:23.140> the

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
exciting challenge both from the

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.160 
exciting challenge both from the
engineering<00:02:23.650> perspective<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.750> from<00:02:25.750> an

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
engineering perspective and from an

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.960 
engineering perspective and from an
aesthetic<00:02:26.709> perspective<00:02:27.459> and<00:02:27.730> from<00:02:27.850> a

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
aesthetic perspective and from a

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.000 
aesthetic perspective and from a
cultural<00:02:28.390> perspective<00:02:28.510> because<00:02:29.440> our

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
cultural perspective because our

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.640 
cultural perspective because our
architecture<00:02:30.940> is<00:02:31.240> such<00:02:32.050> a<00:02:32.080> big<00:02:32.260> part<00:02:32.410> of<00:02:32.530> our

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
architecture is such a big part of our

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.020 
architecture is such a big part of our
history<00:02:32.830> putting<00:02:33.459> all<00:02:33.580> of<00:02:33.610> these<00:02:33.850> different

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
history putting all of these different

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.420 
history putting all of these different
considerations<00:02:34.480> together<00:02:35.440> and<00:02:35.830> then<00:02:36.130> coming

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
considerations together and then coming

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.100 
considerations together and then coming
up<00:02:36.610> with<00:02:36.790> an<00:02:36.940> integrated<00:02:37.570> system<00:02:37.600> as<00:02:38.080> a

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
up with an integrated system as a

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.040 
up with an integrated system as a
solution<00:02:38.470> for<00:02:38.860> that<00:02:38.890> is<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:40.420> something<00:02:40.900> that

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
solution for that is it something that

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.199 
solution for that is it something that
sounds<00:02:41.410> like<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.560> lot<00:02:41.800> of<00:02:41.830> fun<00:02:42.160> and<00:02:42.459> it's

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
sounds like a lot of fun and it's

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.699 
sounds like a lot of fun and it's
something<00:02:43.390> that<00:02:43.540> it's<00:02:44.170> something<00:02:44.380> that<00:02:44.590> our

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
something that it's something that our

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:53.550 
something that it's something that our
society<00:02:45.130> means

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.620
