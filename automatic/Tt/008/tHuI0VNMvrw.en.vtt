00:00:01.379 --> 00:00:05.939
 and if they come we will define some technical doubts about the steering wheel 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:08.879
 the steering wheel 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:12.299
 I have some doubts in identifying a public equipment 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:14.529
 Why do you have a security? 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:17.189
 here you know you trust 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:18.829
 so come on 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:21.829
 first step we'll take out the cube 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.839
 from inside the steering wheel then to this 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.869
 for this to happen but did not know the flames 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.249
 several areas 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:30.609
 the drum hop 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.450
 we pull what we produce with tomato 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.080
 we pull the audience 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.310
 turning 780 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.310
 a sustainable situation coming from inside the capsule 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.550
 so let's go 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.650
 identify first time 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.700
 What reigns in the document you know well 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.260
 do not blame 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.390
 we have a key in the field 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.440
 We'll call May 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.630
 we have a right atrial port 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.430
 in the thermal building even 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.450
 We still have Carnival 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.450
 on that channel the shock daughter who is a freestyle channel 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.880
 and we still have 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.580
 a channel 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.200
 This phrase 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.950
 that she would be a daughter 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.620
 enthusiasm to understand why it is the municipality enters and leaves the course in this 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.620
 Position with ball entering or leaving Dakar 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.340
 so the capture 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.620
 on the inside okubo 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.090
 we have 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.180
 paris 2006 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.960
 we have the truck driver 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.340
 peters is in the air 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.650
 we can play here inside the cover 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.070
 but how we have the sea 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.510
 here to here we have the fair 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.640
 otherwise we have two holes 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.590
 Of course here we have a team that looked for materials 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.820
 jumar 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.410
 and face to face with cech did the other 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.560
 Are you seeing any problems? 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.310
 and we still have as shown 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.490
 here in cuba 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.490
 we have said campbell we have a pinocchio 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.570
 just that they provide in that position that I like to see me here 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.769
 so let's think the following 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.769
 in the position of directing what may be happening 

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:17.249
 the cult tested historical maxims coupled adop 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:18.929
 to pm 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:20.949
 I'll show you that 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:21.719
 March 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:22.689
 ef 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:26.079
 and of course the two automatic search requests 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.649
 as the cardinal but kaka spared in both eyes said 

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:31.619
 Why are we going to do it? 

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:36.449
 So I'm going to open the team. I'm going to pull. 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:39.299
 when we have 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:40.979
 the channel 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:44.809
 and let's move forward with the pib to italy the pope remembered years 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:47.729
 turn 70 degrees 

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:50.469
 and let's go in 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:53.469
 a little in the correct position 

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:01.849
 at this moment what is happening on time 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.239
 with the defeat for the club what is happening 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:05.230
 at sea 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.259
 in fact 

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:11.299
 katia gardin of the municipalities and thus the open time of the other 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.509
 your total safety to drive 

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:16.809
 and where have I been going to happen? 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:17.749
 It's simple 

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:18.969
 we open 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:20.989
 we pulled the pilot tried to take 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.060
 and as we pull the wheel our mission we're talking we just pay 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.729
 local and what is going to happen 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:30.379
 it will fit longer 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:33.069
 automatically the two red bull pilots 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:34.679
 the two holes 

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:38.009
 and I do not want it to remain free as the terms normally trained 

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.679
 focus here 

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:43.509
 the caviar was already inside the car of one of them 

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:47.089
 then it is possible to thief anyone unauthorized by the body but 

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:48.889
 can not drive normally 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:51.999
 in this way you can only practice large stages 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:54.259
 will not have as king 

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:57.259
 Your capture we'll open one more time. 

00:03:57.899 --> 00:04:02.099
 let's pull the pinocchio here it's open we're looking for 180 degrees 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:05.449
 or the position of sarney 

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:07.719
 And you have to marry him to the kitchen. 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:10.159
 with the carnival 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:11.489
 high heels 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.699
 this you will not need to do are installed and you are not doing 

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:16.370
 How safe is it? 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.250
 in her 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.609
 we installed the cube 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:19.849
 we put the door 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:23.309
 and then the steering wheel that is armored notes well open 

00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:25.729
 that the person does not have access by sea 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.080
 in day care is closed 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.689
 You are wrong 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:33.319
 he is totally unsure that no one will mess in your car will get a goal 

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:34.650
 wanted to drive 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.150
 not even have access 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.939
 for who likes withdrawal why 

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:40.030
 this video 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.259
 will be 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:42.559
 Our site 

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:44.430
 www dot 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.219
 steering wheel the df public cub 

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:49.160
 if you have any questions 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.200
 we are going to spend a year and a half we have great pleasure in responding
