00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.290
 this ura hypothesis that contain transparency 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.749
 by eviction you will see urgent motors as they are with 3 6% of the building c

 titin fortress 2 good wants more moss from the room and 2 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.349
 I will use the roof abuse 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.629
 we upload an image that contains transparency we do not create a 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:36.839
 if we are going to create it it is convenient that the width and the height sam power 

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:37.860
 of 2 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.860
 and also the content of the fund is transparent 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.870
 Photo made the transparency is represented by white and gray squares 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.600
 we created the drawing 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.600
 I'm going to do a spray 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.640
 You can also give details as if this painting find a little 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.240
 good and everything you want and not 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.350
 so 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.350
 In Sana, take a look at layer 1 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.170
 bravo driven control key 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.760
 and we give that image 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.660
 that figure that you have selected 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.660
 we go to the texana channels 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.220
 if we create a new channel 

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:13.889
 the color indicates besides macará 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.439
 with one hundred percent opacity fashion okey 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:22.229
 we show it 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:24.749
 press the delete key 

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:26.509
 so that it will stay 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:28.049
 black 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.049
 that part that will contain up to press 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.849
 now we are going to layers 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.849
 if we create a new stage 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.129
 of selection I love the selected ones 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:46.339
 we painted it gray uru how is he 

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:50.529
 128 128 128 the component resides 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.339
 amos oz bey 

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:56.719
 we paint the letter 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:59.789
 and the layer we put down 

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:03.249
 so that it is the figure 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:06.249
 longing for Cáceres to keep that is maintained 

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:11.809
 recommended that you save it and spur example at zero points 

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:19.249
 because this way it will load easily when in transport and inelectra and 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.809
 in tertiary format 

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:26.809
 canalis alfa has to be selected 

00:03:31.179 --> 00:03:34.179
 that option in old age by default 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:38.029
 well, that 

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:39.659
 but I think it's useful
