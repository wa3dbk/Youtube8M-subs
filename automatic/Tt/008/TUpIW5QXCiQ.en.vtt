mysterious element of the caterpillar

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.660 
mysterious element of the caterpillar
but<00:00:54.060> also<00:00:54.329> make<00:00:54.540> him<00:00:54.720> kind<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.110> sexy<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.550> a

but also make him kind of sexy and a
little<00:00:56.940> slinky<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:59.000> think<00:01:00.000> it's<00:01:00.149> definitely<00:01:00.270> a

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
little slinky I think it's definitely a

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.180 
I guess his purpose is to entice Alice
into<00:01:07.310> a<00:01:08.200> well<00:01:09.200> taking<00:01:09.590> a<00:01:09.680> poisonous<00:01:10.159> mushroom
