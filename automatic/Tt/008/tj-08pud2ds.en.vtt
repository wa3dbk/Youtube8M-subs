around<00:02:56.510> 120<00:02:57.440> ish<00:02:57.590> i'm<00:02:57.860> not<00:02:58.670> completely<00:02:58.910> sure

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
around 120 ish i'm not completely sure

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.870 
around 120 ish i'm not completely sure
but<00:02:59.360> yeah<00:02:59.810> if<00:03:00.110> you<00:03:00.470> want<00:03:00.680> like<00:03:00.830> 100<00:03:01.459> sore<00:03:01.640> floor
