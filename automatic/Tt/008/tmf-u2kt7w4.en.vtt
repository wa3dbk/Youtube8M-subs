00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
came to us and asked if we could make 10

fiberglass and all identical naturally
we<00:00:12.660> said<00:00:12.840> yes<00:00:12.990> we<00:00:13.139> can<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.469> she<00:00:13.920> sent<00:00:14.130> us<00:00:14.280> an

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
we said yes we can and she sent us an

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.099 
we said yes we can and she sent us an
existing<00:00:14.849> model<00:00:15.179> with<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.360> head<00:00:15.540> she<00:00:15.719> had<00:00:15.870> for

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
existing model with the head she had for

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.920 
existing model with the head she had for
a<00:00:16.139> parade<00:00:16.410> that<00:00:16.859> she<00:00:17.010> wanted<00:00:17.279> replicated<00:00:17.930> due

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
a parade that she wanted replicated due

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.359 
a parade that she wanted replicated due
to<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.199> previous<00:00:19.619> use<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.980> this<00:00:20.070> original

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
to the previous use of this original

to the previous use of this original
model<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.180> surface<00:00:21.359> was<00:00:21.689> all<00:00:21.779> scratched<00:00:22.109> up

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
model the surface was all scratched up

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.870 
model the surface was all scratched up
and<00:00:22.529> rough<00:00:22.769> in<00:00:22.920> places<00:00:23.310> where<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.550> paint<00:00:23.760> had

and rough in places where the paint had
come<00:00:24.060> off<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.660> obviously<00:00:24.960> we<00:00:25.170> didn't<00:00:25.350> want<00:00:25.500> to

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
come off and obviously we didn't want to

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.740 
come off and obviously we didn't want to
replicate<00:00:25.769> these<00:00:26.189> imperfections<00:00:26.580> so<00:00:27.480> rather

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
replicate these imperfections so rather

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.089 
replicate these imperfections so rather
than<00:00:27.900> making<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.230> mold<00:00:28.439> straight<00:00:28.800> from<00:00:28.980> this

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
than making a mold straight from this

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.950 
than making a mold straight from this
pattern<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.730> having<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.150> clean<00:00:30.330> up<00:00:30.359> each<00:00:30.599> cast

pattern and having to clean up each cast

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.780 
pattern and having to clean up each cast
every<00:00:31.289> time<00:00:31.500> we<00:00:31.980> decided<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.430> create<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.759> new

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
every time we decided to create a new

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.180 
every time we decided to create a new
master<00:00:33.329> pattern<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.719> work<00:00:33.899> from<00:00:34.140> ada<00:00:34.860> made<00:00:35.160> a

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
master pattern to work from ada made a

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.889 
master pattern to work from ada made a
quick<00:00:35.460> plaster<00:00:35.850> mold<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.450> splits<00:00:36.719> into

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
quick plaster mold that splits into

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.750 
quick plaster mold that splits into
three<00:00:36.989> sections<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.770> this<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.370> what<00:00:38.520> we<00:00:38.610> call

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
three sections and this is what we call

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.940 
three sections and this is what we call
a<00:00:38.790> waste<00:00:39.090> mold<00:00:39.390> it's<00:00:39.840> relatively<00:00:40.290> fragile<00:00:40.559> and

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
a waste mold it's relatively fragile and

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.740 
a waste mold it's relatively fragile and
really<00:00:41.399> only<00:00:41.550> good<00:00:41.760> for<00:00:41.940> creating<00:00:42.270> one<00:00:42.450> cast

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
really only good for creating one cast

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.840 
really only good for creating one cast
from<00:00:43.079> but<00:00:43.590> for<00:00:43.680> this<00:00:43.800> particular<00:00:44.129> job<00:00:44.520> that's

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
from but for this particular job that's

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.119 
from but for this particular job that's
all<00:00:45.000> we<00:00:45.149> need<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.600> fiberglass<00:00:46.469> cast<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.980> then

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
all we need a fiberglass cast is then

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.830 
all we need a fiberglass cast is then
made<00:00:47.340> from<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.210> it's<00:00:48.329> taken<00:00:48.629> from<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
made from this and it's taken from the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.630 
made from this and it's taken from the
mold<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.289> joined<00:00:49.530> it's<00:00:50.100> cleaned<00:00:50.340> up<00:00:50.460> to

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
mold and joined it's cleaned up to

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.459 
mold and joined it's cleaned up to
perfection<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.329> this<00:00:51.750> will<00:00:51.930> form<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.320> new

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
perfection and this will form the new

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.500 
perfection and this will form the new
master<00:00:52.829> pattern<00:00:53.010> ready<00:00:53.550> for<00:00:53.730> replication<00:00:54.149> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
master pattern ready for replication the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.569 
master pattern ready for replication the
same<00:00:55.379> rules<00:00:55.590> apply<00:00:55.680> when<00:00:56.070> creating<00:00:56.280> any

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
same rules apply when creating any

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.970 
same rules apply when creating any
production<00:00:57.030> run<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.329> 10<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.930> 100<00:00:58.109> or<00:00:58.500> even<00:00:58.829> a

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
production run of 10 to 100 or even a

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.860 
production run of 10 to 100 or even a
thousand<00:00:59.399> casts<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.210> better<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.660> get<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
thousand casts is better to get the

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.599 
thousand casts is better to get the
design<00:01:01.170> perfect<00:01:01.590> at<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:01.770> stage<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.280> it

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
design perfect at this stage and it

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:13.900 
design perfect at this stage and it
eliminates<00:01:03.030> any<00:01:03.180> unnecessary<00:01:03.480> work<00:01:04.080> later<00:01:04.379> on

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.370 

from<00:01:14.910> here<00:01:15.150> Aiden<00:01:15.480> then<00:01:15.630> makes<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.990> silicon

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
from here Aiden then makes a silicon

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.440 
from here Aiden then makes a silicon
rubber<00:01:16.530> production<00:01:16.860> mold<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:18.000> means<00:01:18.270> is

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
rubber production mold and this means is

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.030 
rubber production mold and this means is
to<00:01:18.510> allow<00:01:18.720> him<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.020> take<00:01:19.170> more<00:01:19.410> than<00:01:19.560> one<00:01:19.740> cast

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
to allow him to take more than one cast

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.890 
to allow him to take more than one cast
from<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.400> with<00:01:20.910> a<00:01:20.940> fiberglass<00:01:21.300> jacket<00:01:21.810> around

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
from it with a fiberglass jacket around

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.660 
from it with a fiberglass jacket around
the<00:01:22.170> edge<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.440> helps<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.800> keep<00:01:22.920> its<00:01:23.100> form<00:01:23.370> while

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
the edge it helps it keep its form while

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.940 
the edge it helps it keep its form while
it's<00:01:23.790> being<00:01:24.000> laid<00:01:24.180> up<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.600> gel<00:01:25.290> coat<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.650> added

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
it's being laid up a gel coat is added

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.590 
it's being laid up a gel coat is added
as<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.130> first<00:01:26.370> layer<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.150> cast<00:01:27.390> has<00:01:27.570> a

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
as the first layer so the cast has a

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.270 
as the first layer so the cast has a
nice<00:01:27.840> smooth<00:01:28.140> finish<00:01:28.350> when<00:01:28.620> it<00:01:28.710> comes<00:01:28.890> out<00:01:29.100> and

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
nice smooth finish when it comes out and

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.930 
then a layup of four ounces of
fiberglass<00:01:31.380> ensures<00:01:32.070> it's<00:01:32.280> nice<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.700> strong

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
fiberglass ensures it's nice and strong

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.330 
fiberglass ensures it's nice and strong
but<00:01:33.300> relatively<00:01:33.840> lightweight<00:01:34.050> we<00:01:35.040> give<00:01:35.190> the

seam lines on the exterior we refill and

go over these sand them down several

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.190 
go over these sand them down several
times<00:01:59.940> and<00:02:00.390> that's<00:02:00.540> when<00:02:00.720> we<00:02:00.810> give<00:02:00.960> them<00:02:01.080> all

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
times and that's when we give them all

times and that's when we give them all
to<00:02:01.350> spray<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:02.070> we<00:02:02.190> can<00:02:02.310> see<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.610> outcome<00:02:02.940> of
