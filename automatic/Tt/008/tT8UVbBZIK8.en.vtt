 Karenina and this means morning program 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:07.209
 commander 

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:08.700
 it's time cars and 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.769
 motorists 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:12.369
 today she said i am a big mistake 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.369
 21 my scale 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.820
 this car is different from most 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.740
 what we see on the road is not easy 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.609
 the car is not just classical music 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.210
 gas 21 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.640
 beware of this coupe exclude watch 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.710
 reference books such a car ask 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.710
 never go down 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.020
 what is this stop 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.730
 this car was twenty first 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.549
 coupe made by 

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:58.449
 Rostelecom or rather waterfall twenty 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.539
 car's first goal is 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.139
 how to say i and the only one in the world 

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:04.749
 drawn was made but the matter itself 

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:05.460
 tracks 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.950
 and another one which was part I bought 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.050
 first twenty first block aas how 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.430
 Barroso friend who bought a new 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.250
 decided to take it 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.800
 rutube love him but he drove to him and 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.390
 I realized that this car can not be 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.010
 turning into scrap after sixty 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.520
 kilometers to brake or for 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.620
 of this 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.560
 such a movement yes 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.049
 and began to think something is possible with him 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.040
 redo and in the end here 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.170
 loss section 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.770
 was it difficult to make this car 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.770
 how many cars were sawn 3 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.770
 the horror here is part of the 200 tenth mercedes 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.900
 part 220 on the floor percentage and 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.149
 two volga on another relying on the fact that for 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:44.679
 not a single goal on the documents that 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:45.380
 of the year 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.829
 authors there are a whole bunch of not even these 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.050
 I have spare parts and more metal 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.710
 it's just like you say in the garage on 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.410
 knees and gavel 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.390
 the place where you were used to seeing 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.500
 and the chassis air conditioner the whole question was 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.780
 Tom 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.380
 Palestinians this modern stuffing 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.860
 bubble with classic 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.700
 and forms 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.469
 Igor coped brilliantly with this 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.280
 task 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.880
 cars are amazed 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.729
 first of all he 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.049
 even the color of the car was chosen with special 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:13.309
 By thoroughness it is purple by the Kremlin 

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:16.139
 who doesn't know the sun 

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:17.919
 the cabin of this car is also 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:18.799
 exclusive 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.180
 soft leather cozy walls original 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.079
 foreground 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.239
 after the bank 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.519
 no problem in fact it's usually 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.199
 mid session 

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:29.059
 when you drive this car 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:30.889
 awesome you think 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:33.219
 Solovyov such white crimson color he 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:35.039
 insanely uplifting and you 

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:36.679
 it seems that everything is all around 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:39.339
 also everything is very smooth no jerks 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:40.779
 box switches 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:43.749
 perfect and the car accelerates 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:46.749
 400 forces on gas 21 but it seems to me that Shadayev 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:50.019
 the car turned out so bright and 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.530
 unusual what he gives 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.610
 his goal is not only to the one who is driving but also 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.750
 surrounding the way work will continue 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.670
 lasted just over a year she 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.019
 performed at a very high level 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.669
 But leave the exhibition protection 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:03.409
 engineer owner had already on the go 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:05.870
 implementation of the project probably no longer 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.229
 there were payments 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:09.629
 the only flaw in this 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.029
 car lack of belts 

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:13.159
 rather they are there but they don't work 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:15.169
 the master decided to do like the twenty first 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:17.829
 Volga and there they are not at all 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.680
 Well Volga Gas 21 cop deserves the most 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.369
 high marks combination 

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:23.389
 classic and modern 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.920
 technology is the path that power 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.920
 No, the whole automotive world 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.279
 that's all our time is up 

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:34.129
 Azarov government
