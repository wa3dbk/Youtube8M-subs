form so it's not that big of a deal so I

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.550 
form so it's not that big of a deal so I
a<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.650> veteran<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.370> veteran<00:02:45.180> comes<00:02:45.870> in<00:02:46.140> and

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
a the veteran the veteran comes in and

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.920 
the Thunderbolt and I know the fly won't
kill<00:04:21.590> but<00:04:22.550> it<00:04:22.910> will<00:04:23.120> still<00:04:23.330> do<00:04:23.510> a<00:04:23.540> decent

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930

hydro<00:04:52.130> pump<00:04:52.340> on<00:04:52.639> this<00:04:53.389> freaking<00:04:54.139> greninja

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
hydro pump on this freaking greninja

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.430 
hydro pump on this freaking greninja
like<00:04:55.340> I<00:04:55.639> think<00:04:56.150> that<00:04:56.300> Miss<00:04:56.720> greninja<00:04:57.050> was<00:04:57.290> like

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
like I think that Miss greninja was like

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.340 
like I think that Miss greninja was like
level<00:04:57.740> 40<00:04:58.220> at<00:04:58.430> the<00:04:58.729> time<00:04:58.970> so<00:04:59.270> and<00:04:59.840> it<00:04:59.990> learns<00:05:00.110> it

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
level 40 at the time so and it learns it

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.670 
level 40 at the time so and it learns it
at<00:05:00.470> like<00:05:00.590> level<00:05:00.950> 60<00:05:01.400> so<00:05:01.910> I<00:05:02.389> don't<00:05:02.900> have<00:05:03.169> for<00:05:03.500> him

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
at like level 60 so I don't have for him

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.879 
at like level 60 so I don't have for him
I<00:05:04.330> didn't<00:05:05.330> have<00:05:05.479> hydro<00:05:05.870> pump<00:05:06.050> at<00:05:06.229> the<00:05:06.290> time<00:05:06.530> so

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889 
I didn't have hydro pump at the time so

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.010 
I didn't have hydro pump at the time so
I<00:05:07.190> obviously<00:05:07.970> would<00:05:08.270> have<00:05:08.389> gone<00:05:08.510> for<00:05:08.570> that<00:05:08.780> and

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
I obviously would have gone for that and

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.570 
I obviously would have gone for that and
I<00:05:09.080> obviously<00:05:09.380> would<00:05:09.650> have<00:05:09.740> been<00:05:09.830> able<00:05:09.979> to<00:05:10.130> kill

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580
