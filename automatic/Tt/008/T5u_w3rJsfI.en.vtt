 we are at Dynamo Kiev training base 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.170

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.080
 Mask Now we'll talk about that in 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:17.719
 to every person about kindness and happiness about 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.719
 Harmony Give your bass kindness 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:31.189
 what does good in life mean to you 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:34.489
 in fact it is a very loose concept 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.769
 it is probably life itself that is 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.920
 life you have to help people you 

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:41.420
 born god gave you life and basically 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.460
 people who are harder you must 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.970
 need help if you are too hard for you 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.149
 will help 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.129
 that's actually how else to say 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.710
 this is a smile first of all people 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.510
 for some reason, they rarely smile, but 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.759
 people who smile you see right away 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.979
 that he has a soul, you immediately see that 

00:00:55.759 --> 00:01:00.409
 he has a life and a smile means 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:03.610
 please tell me almost everything 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:07.280
 for you soul soul soul for me this 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.470
 inner feeling is inner peace 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.850
 inner life ie life is needed 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.040
 which people live also if 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.750
 everyone inside it is for me a soul what are you 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.840
 what do you think is more important for a person 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:22.460
 his inner life in the name of the soul or 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.930
 life is really the same i probably 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.180
 1000 the next question is what is happiness 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.630
 yes, all together 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.979
 inner world and outer well how are you 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.220
 read every person on earth can 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.240
 be kind yes absolutely and in fact 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.450
 it must all be absolutely 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.820
 disinterestedly and never expect an answer 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.950
 because people unfortunately not often this 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.810
 does but periodically does it 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.180
 nice sage tell me how you think 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.620
 what is missing today 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.720
 society to create 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.049
 atmosphere of peace happiness of harmony around 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.270
 myself 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.270
 because in fact every person is welcome 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:00.200
 what is missing 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:02.210
 good do you think that one can 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.460
 man do here in his environment on 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.320
 his workplace among his 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.119
 environments to change this 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.429
 absurd in all he can by his example 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.010
 show what can be changed for the better 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.720
 how do you think what a 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.299
 the global goal of everyone's existence 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.129
 man separately such generally in 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:22.700
 shared network implementation will not answer this 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:25.280
 Iâ€™m looking for an answer I donâ€™t know the answer, but when 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.870
 sing when you give people the joy that 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.040
 invest what is the main 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.750
 need to man 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.209
 felt all this inner heat and 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.250
 kindness to be able to convey them and 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.900
 infect it all people do not know on 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:44.150
 really positive smile 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:46.610
 and you know that, so to speak, without 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.170
 status communication because everyone 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.209

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.909
