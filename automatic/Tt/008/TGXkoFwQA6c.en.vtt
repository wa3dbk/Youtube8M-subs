hello<00:00:01.800> this<00:00:02.100> is<00:00:02.159> Thomas<00:00:02.610> Applegate<00:00:03.090> with<00:00:03.360> CPU

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
hello this is Thomas Applegate with CPU

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.079 
hello this is Thomas Applegate with CPU
points<00:00:04.200> calm<00:00:04.620> and<00:00:05.009> today<00:00:05.279> we<00:00:05.549> are<00:00:05.640> going<00:00:05.850> to

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
points calm and today we are going to

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.930 
points calm and today we are going to
discuss<00:00:06.620> virtual<00:00:07.620> memory<00:00:07.799> okay<00:00:08.610> I'm<00:00:08.760> your

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
discuss virtual memory okay I'm your

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.039 
discuss virtual memory okay I'm your
virtual<00:00:09.269> memory<00:00:09.389> is<00:00:09.809> basically<00:00:10.610> your

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:12.049 
virtual memory is basically your

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:14.780 
virtual memory is basically your
processor<00:00:13.049> use<00:00:13.440> your<00:00:13.679> hard<00:00:13.920> drive<00:00:14.190> as<00:00:14.429> rayon

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
processor use your hard drive as rayon

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.550 
processor use your hard drive as rayon
because<00:00:15.210> you're<00:00:15.509> you<00:00:15.960> don't<00:00:16.109> have<00:00:16.199> enough<00:00:16.379> for

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
because you're you don't have enough for

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.710 
because you're you don't have enough for
framing<00:00:16.770> your<00:00:16.949> system<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:17.760> goons<00:00:18.150> overhang<00:00:18.570> is

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
framing your system so goons overhang is

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.630 
framing your system so goons overhang is
the<00:00:18.930> hard<00:00:19.109> drive<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:19.890> our<00:00:20.010> virtual<00:00:20.310> memory<00:00:20.460> is

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
the hard drive so our virtual memory is

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.580 
the hard drive so our virtual memory is
slower<00:00:20.910> but<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:21.779> have<00:00:21.930> lots<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.439> will

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
slower but you have lots of it will

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.210 
slower but you have lots of it will
generally<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.760> what<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.029> do<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:25.260> change

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
generally so what you do is to change

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.759 
generally so what you do is to change
your<00:00:26.310> virtual<00:00:26.730> memory<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:27.029> click<00:00:27.210> on<00:00:27.330> start

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
your virtual memory you click on start

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.060 
your virtual memory you click on start
you<00:00:28.769> right<00:00:29.160> click<00:00:29.279> on<00:00:29.490> my<00:00:29.640> computer<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:31.070> left

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
you right click on my computer you left

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.299 
you right click on my computer you left
click<00:00:32.160> on<00:00:32.369> property<00:00:33.469> ok<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.620> take<00:00:34.770> note<00:00:34.980> here

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
click on property ok you take note here

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.860 
click on property ok you take note here
down<00:00:35.940> here<00:00:35.969> at<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.210> bottom<00:00:36.540> where<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.840> says

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
down here at the bottom where it says

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.540 
down here at the bottom where it says
computer<00:00:37.380> gives<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:37.739> all<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:37.920> information

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
computer gives you all this information

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.959 
computer gives you all this information
and<00:00:38.760> that's<00:00:38.910> comma<00:00:39.350> it<00:00:40.350> tells<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.890> how<00:00:41.790> much

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
and that's comma it tells you how much

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.030 
and that's comma it tells you how much
memory<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.600> them<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.680> have<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:43.950> your

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
memory you of them you you have in your

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.450 
memory you of them you you have in your
system

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
system

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.819 
system
ok<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.539> then<00:00:45.690> what<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:45.870> do<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.020> rule<00:00:46.410> thumb<00:00:46.680> as

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
ok and then what you do is rule thumb as

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.580 
ok and then what you do is rule thumb as
you<00:00:46.950> double<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.420> ok<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:48.510> if<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.050> says<00:00:49.170> your<00:00:49.379> 2

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
you double this ok so if it says your 2

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.430 
you double this ok so if it says your 2
gigabytes<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.190> RAM<00:00:50.399> you<00:00:50.670> need<00:00:51.090> 4<00:00:51.809> gigabytes<00:00:52.320> of

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
gigabytes of RAM you need 4 gigabytes of

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.240 
gigabytes of RAM you need 4 gigabytes of
RAM<00:00:52.649> okay<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:53.989> so<00:00:54.989> what<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.320> generally<00:00:55.530> do<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:56.010> um

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
RAM okay so so what I generally do is um

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.340 
RAM okay so so what I generally do is um
I<00:00:56.460> take<00:00:56.730> out<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> calculator<00:00:57.180> at<00:00:57.570> this<00:00:57.750> point<00:00:58.020> so

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
I take out a calculator at this point so

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.790 
I take out a calculator at this point so
I<00:00:58.410> click<00:00:58.590> on<00:00:58.710> start<00:00:59.070> I<00:00:59.280> click<00:01:00.059> on<00:01:00.239> run<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.800> type

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
I click on start I click on run I type

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.950 
I click on start I click on run I type
in<00:01:02.010> CA<00:01:02.430> LC<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.270> click<00:01:04.199> OK<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.420> I<00:01:06.420> type<00:01:06.689> in<00:01:06.840> the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
in CA LC I click OK and I type in the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.710 
in CA LC I click OK and I type in the
numbers<00:01:07.320> ok<00:01:08.159> guy<00:01:08.340> remember<00:01:08.670> here<00:01:08.850> ok<00:01:09.090> um<00:01:09.330> you

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
numbers ok guy remember here ok um you

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.730 
numbers ok guy remember here ok um you
know<00:01:09.840> weird<00:01:09.990> on<00:01:10.260> when<00:01:10.380> I'm<00:01:10.470> talking<00:01:10.710> about

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
know weird on when I'm talking about

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.510 
know weird on when I'm talking about
street<00:01:11.070> 2<00:01:11.280> gigabytes<00:01:11.729> ok<00:01:12.000> 1<00:01:12.210> gigabyte<00:01:12.600> is<00:01:13.520> 1024

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
street 2 gigabytes ok 1 gigabyte is 1024

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.789 
street 2 gigabytes ok 1 gigabyte is 1024
megabytes<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.840> got<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.500> got<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.710> keep

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
megabytes so you got it you got to keep

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:17.480 
megabytes so you got it you got to keep
that<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.100> mind

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
that in mind

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.310 
that in mind
so<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.540> whatever<00:01:18.780> you're<00:01:18.900> doing<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.110> got<00:01:19.229> to

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
so so whatever you're doing you got to

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.929 
so so whatever you're doing you got to
multiply<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.710> by<00:01:19.830> 1024<00:01:20.520> if<00:01:20.640> you're<00:01:20.759> talking

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
multiply it by 1024 if you're talking

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.120 
multiply it by 1024 if you're talking
about<00:01:21.090> gigabytes<00:01:21.479> okay<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.259> am<00:01:22.380> when-when-when

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
about gigabytes okay I am when-when-when

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.850 
about gigabytes okay I am when-when-when
down<00:01:23.729> here<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.030> talks<00:01:24.240> about<00:01:24.360> megabytes<00:01:25.350> it's

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
down here it talks about megabytes it's

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.440 
down here it talks about megabytes it's
going<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.220> tell<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.460> straight<00:01:26.700> up<00:01:26.790> 512

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
going to tell you straight up 512

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.929 
going to tell you straight up 512
megabytes<00:01:28.939> 740<00:01:30.829> 256<00:01:31.829> I'll<00:01:32.009> tie<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.220> but<00:01:32.790> when<00:01:32.909> I

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
megabytes 740 256 I'll tie it but when I

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:33.800 
megabytes 740 256 I'll tie it but when I
gets<00:01:33.119> into<00:01:33.270> gigabytes

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
gets into gigabytes

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.060 
gets into gigabytes
it<00:01:33.990> gives<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.350> flat<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.799> gives<00:01:34.979> you<00:01:35.040> a

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
it gives you a flat it gives you a

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.859 
it gives you a flat it gives you a
straight<00:01:35.340> number<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:36.240> what<00:01:36.420> we're<00:01:36.570> gonna<00:01:36.689> do

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
straight number so what we're gonna do

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:43.310 
straight number so what we're gonna do
is<00:01:37.020> run<00:01:37.259> type<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:38.540> 4<00:01:39.540> gigabytes<00:01:39.990> x<00:01:40.920> 1024<00:01:42.320> and

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
is run type in 4 gigabytes x 1024 and

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.760 
is run type in 4 gigabytes x 1024 and
that<00:01:43.710> comes<00:01:44.009> up<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.930> 4096<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.680> about<00:01:46.799> 4096<00:01:48.770> we

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
that comes up to 4096 so about 4096 we

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.410 
that comes up to 4096 so about 4096 we
know<00:01:49.890> it's<00:01:50.040> 496<00:01:50.579> so<00:01:50.759> now<00:01:50.880> we<00:01:50.939> go<00:01:51.119> back<00:01:51.149> in

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
know it's 496 so now we go back in

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.510 
know it's 496 so now we go back in
system<00:01:51.750> properties<00:01:52.229> we<00:01:52.710> go<00:01:52.829> into<00:01:52.979> advanced

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
system properties we go into advanced

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.120 
system properties we go into advanced
and<00:01:54.210> go<00:01:54.360> into<00:01:54.570> performance<00:01:55.320> box<00:01:55.560> click<00:01:56.009> on

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130
