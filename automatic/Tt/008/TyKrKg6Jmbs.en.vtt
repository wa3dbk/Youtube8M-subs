00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.990
 one more day my channel has been a month 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.940
 since the last video came up and this 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.890
 I went on vacation to Barcelona and it was a 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.890
 decision of we are leaving now 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.220
 but well I'm back and I'll be back 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.820
 start uploading videos 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.470
 and good today I bring you a mix hall is 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.460
 a little game I did before I left 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.460
 there are very few things 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.630
 is the basis for mix shadows 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.780
 that comes with a sponge like that of 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.380
 the hoops 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.170
 the applicator 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.750
 and well the truth is that I like it a lot 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.070
 this test is the shadows neither 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.380
 they hold many hours 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.210
 I dress myself up for the best in the morning 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.520
 and at night I have the shadows 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.290
 practically intact the ones that are going 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.390
 very well I can also tell you that it is 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.880
 the second test 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.140
 It's an old and good we like 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.400
 much more 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.400
 and the truth 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.770
 the pretty barbie nothing discreet 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.830
 good thing the truth is that it is a lip 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.020
 that a mom of attention for 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.330
 time but I did not dare to buy it 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.110
 because our bellini seems to me 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.900
 too pink too light I thought 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:56.520
 that would be the style but nothing 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:56.520
 It is not a discrete color but nice 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:05.000
 I really wanted to try these 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.000
 597 Daisy 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.560
 it's a coral tone 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.620
 with flashes without super super color 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.750
 pretty weird is that I'm delighted with 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.959
 this lip actually looks pretty 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.590
 to the chic coast mans that I do not have it 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:28.970
 but yes I have been 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.970
 the truth I was about to buy 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.890
 let's say I 'm not saying they're clones but 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.870
 yes they are pretty similar colors 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.319
 good just wanted to spend the money 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.510
 in a labial like this 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:47.640
 you see 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:52.760
 It is a super nice coral color 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.760
 I also love and above all this 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.890
 it looks a lot like the ind jumping 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.950
 good the doctor too 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.340
 although most of you know the 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.340
 suffering 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:15.010
 good that pretty similar lipsticks 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.010
 how 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:22.080
 the indian ping pulls more orange than 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:26.260
 this is more used than a girl 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.420
 but they are not pretty coral colors 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.270
 similar not but within the same 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.000
 range let's say coral 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:40.290
 I sincerely like it more 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.290
 lately the margarita a lot 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.600
 two bars to have these colors 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.260
 the daisy here 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.260
 the line 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.920
 that although it seems that the 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.800
 Daisies like more orange for nothing 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.660
 it came out necessary that I buy is the east 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.660
 what he 564 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.910
 or what is a pink color also with a 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:18.130
 coral spot super super nice 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.570
 this has no brightness is rather matte 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:24.530
 you see 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:28.040
 and when you saw life the first time the 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:32.780
 dream came to my mind the live glam and 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:35.180
 others because they are super similar colors 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.910
 I do not know how you're going to see it on the camera 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.980
 but 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.980
 it seems in a lot the truth 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:49.340
 they are not clones they are not identical but 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.340
 but they look a lot like 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:03.200
 is here is the wake of the mix and it will be 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.630
 here is mickey dance others as you see are 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.630
 pretty similar colors and good at 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.860
 the lips also because he barely noticed the 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.960
 difference 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.000
 yes, it is true that the topic that is a 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.879
 little bit higher and much more 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.650
 pigmented but we are say in the 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:19.620
 same range of colors and they look alike 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.960
 very much 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.510
 It is not a clone but if you want I can 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.580
 say that it is a good alternative if you 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:28.350
 like the color of others but not what 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:32.040
 you can get or you do not want to spend 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:36.120
 that good money tell you that they are very very 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:39.350
 similar and finally I bought the 583 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.350
 to a fork 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.190
 what is another pretty coral lip 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.190
 orange 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.150
 also a super super nice heat 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.949
 until life I bought it with a little 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.230
 of fear because I also have the cen 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:10.280
 mix 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:13.689
 and I'm afraid they were too old 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.750
 and yes it is true that they look like 

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:17.640
 Yes Yes 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:22.580
 in fact I think the cameras in equal 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:22.580
 but he sells knicks 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.520
 it's more pigmented, this is the gel 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:38.660
 the subject is more pigmented 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:41.139
 I would say that this one has a little more 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.780
 OK 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:46.659
 it would be a clone yes they look pretty 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:48.849
 to baseball it's better that yes I go 

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:51.749
 right now on the lips 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:51.749
 I'm going to put it here 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.830
 there we have it 

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.190
 and this 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:09.870
 the cem and baseball the truth is that it 

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:12.030
 they look very much they look very much 

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:14.280
 I do not tell you that they are clones because 

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:18.030
 put on the lips the gas ball 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:21.509
 it's a wonder I think it gives you a thousand 

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:26.990
 turns to alx de nix but let's go 

00:07:21.509 --> 00:07:29.690
 that the color does not go so bad is better 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:32.240
 is the container this is the end and I'm 

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:35.240
 here below center tear so it looks 

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:37.640
 that he is a little bit more orange 

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:41.410
 has more goal that was a little bit more 

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.410
 pink but good are 

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.580
 they are colors of a miracle more than anything 

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:47.770
 because good it's always good to have 

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:50.290
 alternatives these expensive lipsticks 

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:52.300
 because good like we can not or do not 

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:54.520
 We want to spend our money in a 

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:57.100
 labial then although they are not clones 

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.190
 so they are pretty similar colors and 

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:01.860
 that can us 

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:03.180
 and this has been all about the sun of 

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:05.370
 mick as you see 

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:07.770
 It is very tiny and nothing I hope you 

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:10.730
 I liked that you put little fingers up 

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:10.730
 and see you next
