that<00:02:08.649> back<00:02:08.799> up<00:02:10.530> open<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.860> other<00:02:12.010> one<00:02:16.590> turn<00:02:17.590> on

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
that back up open the other one turn on

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.360 
that back up open the other one turn on
this<00:02:19.030> pump<00:02:19.330> first<00:02:19.599> which<00:02:19.959> is<00:02:20.110> again<00:02:21.069> it's<00:02:21.280> the

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
this pump first which is again it's the

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.559 
this pump first which is again it's the
top<00:02:21.640> flip<00:02:22.299> it<00:02:22.420> up

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
top flip it up

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.860 
top flip it up
so<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.930> top<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.950> top<00:02:26.459> not<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.030> bottom<00:02:27.180> don't

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
so the top the top not the bottom don't

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.309 
so the top the top not the bottom don't
want<00:02:27.989> to<00:02:28.049> do<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.230> bottom<00:02:28.349> the<00:02:28.799> top<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:31.170> then

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
want to do the bottom the top and then
