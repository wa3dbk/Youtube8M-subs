Jewish anyway this is actually something
we<00:00:25.140> experimentally<00:00:25.619> with<00:00:26.539> years<00:00:27.539> years<00:00:28.170> ago

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
we experimentally with years years ago

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.429 
we experimentally with years years ago
this<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:28.890> plush<00:00:29.220> where<00:00:29.900> we<00:00:30.900> wanted<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.199> run

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
this is plush where we wanted to run

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.670 
this is plush where we wanted to run
these<00:00:32.369> swirl<00:00:32.820> Franken<00:00:33.329> bolts<00:00:33.600> yes<00:00:33.870> yeah<00:00:34.170> yeah

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
these swirl Franken bolts yes yeah yeah

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.049 
these swirl Franken bolts yes yeah yeah
the<00:00:34.800> franken<00:00:35.130> bolts<00:00:35.340> are<00:00:35.430> totally<00:00:35.790> sweet

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
the franken bolts are totally sweet

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.630 
the franken bolts are totally sweet
mm-hmm<00:00:36.690> like<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.530> just<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:38.160> want<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.399> sell

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
mm-hmm like so just I want to sell

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.330 
mm-hmm like so just I want to sell
Franken<00:00:39.059> bolt<00:00:39.270> kits<00:00:39.540> yeah<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.890> only<00:00:41.040> problem

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
Franken bolt kits yeah the only problem

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.910 
Franken bolt kits yeah the only problem
is<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:42.000> get<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.180> lot<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.960> know<00:00:43.110> friction

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
is you get a lot of you know friction

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.060 
is you get a lot of you know friction
over<00:00:44.219> these<00:00:44.340> surfaces<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.320> David<00:00:46.320> had<00:00:47.039> the

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
over these surfaces and David had the

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.940 
over these surfaces and David had the
brilliant<00:00:47.670> concept<00:00:48.480> just<00:00:49.050> putting<00:00:49.379> velcro

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
brilliant concept just putting velcro

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.260 
brilliant concept just putting velcro
all<00:00:50.309> over<00:00:50.820> its<00:00:50.969> loop<00:00:51.300> side<00:00:51.629> not<00:00:52.140> exciting<00:00:53.270> so

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
all over its loop side not exciting so

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.389 
all over its loop side not exciting so
hopefully<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:55.079> will<00:00:55.289> not<00:00:55.530> run<00:00:55.800> into<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.070> patch

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
hopefully you will not run into a patch

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.689 
hopefully you will not run into a patch
of<00:00:56.760> velcro<00:00:57.600> otherwise<00:00:58.469> you're<00:00:59.129> pretty<00:00:59.550> much

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
of velcro otherwise you're pretty much

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.740 
of velcro otherwise you're pretty much
toast<00:00:59.969> yeah<00:01:00.390> but<00:01:00.930> yeah<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.800> mean<00:01:02.000> we<00:01:03.000> are<00:01:03.270> going

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
toast yeah but yeah I mean we are going

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.730 
toast yeah but yeah I mean we are going
to<00:01:03.930> experiment<00:01:04.830> with<00:01:05.280> s'mores<00:01:06.560> you<00:01:07.560> know

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
to experiment with s'mores you know

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.130 
to experiment with s'mores you know
materials<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.939> fact<00:01:09.240> we<00:01:09.420> just<00:01:09.570> picked<00:01:09.780> up<00:01:09.900> some

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
materials in fact we just picked up some

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.539 
materials in fact we just picked up some
of<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:11.119> medical<00:01:12.119> oh<00:01:12.450> yeah<00:01:13.400> it's<00:01:14.400> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
of that medical oh yeah it's the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.140 
of that medical oh yeah it's the
thera-band<00:01:15.290> thera-band<00:01:16.290> black<00:01:18.020> latex<00:01:19.020> tubing

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
thera-band thera-band black latex tubing

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.499 
thera-band thera-band black latex tubing
we're<00:01:21.150> gonna<00:01:22.340> make<00:01:23.340> some<00:01:23.400> balloon<00:01:23.939> animals

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
we're gonna make some balloon animals

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.450 
we're gonna make some balloon animals
and<00:01:24.869> then<00:01:24.990> put<00:01:25.560> them<00:01:25.650> on<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.920> skate<00:01:26.159> proof

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
and then put them on the skate proof

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.289 
and then put them on the skate proof
magic<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.990> then<00:01:28.680> we'll<00:01:28.950> have<00:01:29.640> some<00:01:29.850> wicked

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
magic and then we'll have some wicked

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.359 
magic and then we'll have some wicked
resistant<00:01:30.930> high-performance<00:01:31.770> o-rings<00:01:32.130> Oh

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
resistant high-performance o-rings Oh

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.600 
resistant high-performance o-rings Oh
there'll<00:01:33.240> be<00:01:33.270> latex<00:01:34.040> performance<00:01:35.040> Oh<00:01:35.220> ring

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
there'll be latex performance Oh ring

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.240 
there'll be latex performance Oh ring
it'll<00:01:36.030> be<00:01:36.150> unbelievable<00:01:36.869> so<00:01:37.619> anyway<00:01:37.979> we're

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
it'll be unbelievable so anyway we're

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.010 
it'll be unbelievable so anyway we're
actually<00:01:38.400> just<00:01:38.610> prepping<00:01:39.030> for<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.329> by

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
actually just prepping for that by

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.399 
actually just prepping for that by
getting<00:01:40.290> it<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.770> our<00:01:40.890> prototype<00:01:41.329> version

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
getting it is our prototype version

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.539 
getting it is our prototype version
probably<00:01:43.409> just<00:01:43.680> going<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.860> pull<00:01:44.040> your<00:01:44.220> thing

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
probably just going to pull your thing

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.760 
probably just going to pull your thing
on<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:45.479> one's<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:46.259> know<00:01:46.350> we<00:01:46.500> got<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
on this one's you know we got the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.179 
on this one's you know we got the
bearded<00:01:47.189> rabbi<00:01:47.610> skateboard<00:01:48.299> truck<00:01:48.600> prototype

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.859 

this<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.310> what<00:01:53.490> Rogaine<00:01:53.939> does<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.390> skateboard

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
this is what Rogaine does to skateboard

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.899 
this is what Rogaine does to skateboard
trucks<00:01:55.110> we're<00:01:56.009> going<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.189> be<00:01:56.250> excited<00:01:56.759> because

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
trucks we're going to be excited because

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.920 
trucks we're going to be excited because
we<00:01:57.119> can<00:01:57.780> introduce<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.290> lot<00:01:58.590> more<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.700> know

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
we can introduce a lot more you know

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.980 
we can introduce a lot more you know
elastic<00:02:01.640> resistance<00:02:02.640> on<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.509> skateboard

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
elastic resistance on to the skateboard

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.679 
elastic resistance on to the skateboard
truck<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.649> we<00:02:05.280> can<00:02:05.460> hopefully<00:02:05.700> use<00:02:06.329> that

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
truck and we can hopefully use that

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.550 
truck and we can hopefully use that
resistance<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.979> start<00:02:08.250> tuning<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.899> cam<00:02:10.200> and

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
resistance to start tuning the cam and

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.970 
resistance to start tuning the cam and
actually<00:02:11.220> build<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.150> truck<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.720> be<00:02:12.870> more

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
actually build the truck to be more

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.820 
actually build the truck to be more
you<00:02:14.400> know<00:02:14.659> dependent<00:02:15.659> on<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.260> resistance

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
you know dependent on the resistance

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.890 
you know dependent on the resistance
mm-hmm<00:02:17.489> and<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:18.209> hopefully<00:02:18.420> we<00:02:18.690> can<00:02:18.780> get<00:02:18.840> a

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
mm-hmm and you hopefully we can get a

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.960 
mm-hmm and you hopefully we can get a
little<00:02:19.140> more<00:02:19.620> performance<00:02:20.310> out<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.459> corners

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
little more performance out of corners

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.509 
little more performance out of corners
and<00:02:21.209> have<00:02:21.330> a<00:02:21.390> board<00:02:21.690> that's<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:22.049> little<00:02:22.890> faster

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
and have a board that's a little faster

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.839 
and have a board that's a little faster
edge<00:02:23.760> to<00:02:24.540> edge<00:02:24.720> so<00:02:25.319> that<00:02:25.519> it's<00:02:26.519> a<00:02:26.580> little<00:02:26.610> more

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
edge to edge so that it's a little more

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.119 
edge to edge so that it's a little more
responsive<00:02:27.450> for<00:02:27.480> pumping<00:02:27.989> and<00:02:28.349> carving<00:02:28.860> and

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
responsive for pumping and carving and
