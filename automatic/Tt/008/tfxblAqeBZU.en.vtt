makeup sponges brushes and lipstick what
I<00:00:24.899> like<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.169> do<00:00:25.289> first<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.769> put<00:00:26.729> a<00:00:26.939> hair<00:00:27.329> tie<00:00:27.599> on

00:00:27.889 --> 00:00:27.899 
I like to do first is put a hair tie on

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:29.960 
I like to do first is put a hair tie on
so<00:00:28.649> that<00:00:28.859> we<00:00:28.979> can<00:00:29.220> get<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.550> hair<00:00:29.669> out<00:00:29.789> of<00:00:29.819> the

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
so that we can get the hair out of the

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.250 
so that we can get the hair out of the
way<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.749> we<00:00:30.869> can<00:00:31.019> apply<00:00:31.259> the<00:00:31.349> makeup<00:00:31.619> easily

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
way so we can apply the makeup easily

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.650 
way so we can apply the makeup easily
so<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:35.010> typical<00:00:35.250> grim<00:00:35.699> reaper<00:00:36.030> face<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.449> going

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
so the typical grim reaper face is going

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.959 
so the typical grim reaper face is going
to<00:00:36.750> have<00:00:36.899> indentations<00:00:37.739> typically<00:00:38.640> towards

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
to have indentations typically towards

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.720 
to have indentations typically towards
the<00:00:39.120> temple<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.870> cheekbones<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.920> eye

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
the temple the cheekbones the eye

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.880 
the temple the cheekbones the eye
sockets<00:00:42.449> and<00:00:42.750> what<00:00:43.350> we're<00:00:43.469> going<00:00:43.589> to<00:00:43.620> be<00:00:43.769> doing

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
sockets and what we're going to be doing

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.970 
sockets and what we're going to be doing
first<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.579> making<00:00:45.210> those<00:00:45.359> indentations<00:00:45.800> so<00:00:46.800> I

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
first is making those indentations so I

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.549 
first is making those indentations so I
like<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.280> take<00:00:47.460> my<00:00:47.489> eyeliner<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.410> I'm<00:00:49.410> going

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
like to take my eyeliner and I'm going

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.229 
like to take my eyeliner and I'm going
to<00:00:49.589> make<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.800> sea<00:00:50.070> formation<00:00:50.640> right<00:00:50.850> next<00:00:51.149> to

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
to make a sea formation right next to

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:59.090 
to make a sea formation right next to
the<00:00:51.329> temple<00:00:56.210> and<00:00:57.620> this<00:00:58.620> can<00:00:58.829> really<00:00:58.980> be

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
the temple and this can really be

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.930 
the temple and this can really be
however<00:00:59.819> big<00:01:00.089> you<00:01:00.239> want<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:01.489> typically<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.640> like

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
however big you want it typically I like

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.440 
however big you want it typically I like
to<00:01:03.149> do<00:01:03.359> from<00:01:03.899> about<00:01:04.829> the<00:01:04.949> tip<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.339> ear<00:01:05.450> to

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
to do from about the tip of the ear to

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.480 
to do from about the tip of the ear to
where<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.840> hairline<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.890> going<00:01:08.009> to<00:01:08.070> be<00:01:08.189> going

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
where the hairline is going to be going

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.060 
where the hairline is going to be going
and<00:01:09.450> you<00:01:09.899> do<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.200> on<00:01:10.320> both<00:01:10.470> sides

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
and you do that on both sides

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.980 
and you do that on both sides
the<00:01:11.579> next<00:01:11.880> indentation<00:01:12.240> that<00:01:12.540> we're<00:01:12.840> going<00:01:12.930> to

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
the next indentation that we're going to

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.679 
the next indentation that we're going to
be<00:01:13.140> doing<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:14.280> cheekbones<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.030> sometimes

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
be doing is the cheekbones and sometimes

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.160 
be doing is the cheekbones and sometimes
it<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:15.990> be<00:01:16.020> pretty<00:01:16.110> hard<00:01:16.469> to<00:01:17.040> find<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
it can be pretty hard to find the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.510 
it can be pretty hard to find the
indentations<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.530> if<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.710> make<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.890> fish<00:01:20.219> face

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
indentations so if you make a fish face

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.600 
indentations so if you make a fish face
like<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:22.700> it's<00:01:23.700> easier<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.240> find<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:25.170> lines

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
like this it's easier to find the lines

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.090 
like this it's easier to find the lines
now<00:01:26.610> how<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.820> did<00:01:27.149> this<00:01:27.329> was<00:01:27.719> I<00:01:28.049> started<00:01:28.649> right

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
now how I did this was I started right

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.279 
now how I did this was I started right
in<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.460> middle<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.939> ear<00:01:30.149> kind<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.110> where

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
in the middle of the ear kind of where

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:34.700 
in the middle of the ear kind of where
his<00:01:31.560> sideburn<00:01:32.549> starts<00:01:33.149> and<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:34.049> just<00:01:34.320> made<00:01:34.500> a

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
his sideburn starts and I just made a

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.520 
his sideburn starts and I just made a
line<00:01:35.159> following<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.240> cheekbone<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.930> then

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
line following the cheekbone and then

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.010 
line following the cheekbone and then
once<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.920> get<00:01:38.070> about<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.759> them<00:01:39.000> probably<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
once you get about to them probably the

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.929 
once you get about to them probably the
middle<00:01:40.289> of<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.500> eye<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:41.430> want<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.670> just<00:01:41.789> make

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
middle of the eye you want to just make

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.539 
middle of the eye you want to just make
a<00:01:42.000> straight<00:01:42.390> line<00:01:42.420> going<00:01:42.899> down<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.530> then<00:01:44.280> just

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
a straight line going down and then just

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.060 
a straight line going down and then just
follow<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:45.060> right<00:01:45.539> back<00:01:45.750> up<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.229> then<00:01:46.560> connect

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
follow it right back up and then connect

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.380 
follow it right back up and then connect
it<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:48.799> and<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.490> next<00:01:50.520> lines<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.270> we're

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
it so and the next lines that we're

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.359 
it so and the next lines that we're
going<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.539> be<00:01:51.719> making<00:01:51.930> are<00:01:52.320> around<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.189> eye

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
going to be making are around the eye

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.429 
going to be making are around the eye
and<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:54.270> want<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.539> make<00:01:54.659> sure<00:01:54.689> when<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.200> make

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
and you want to make sure when you make

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.700 
and you want to make sure when you make
this<00:01:56.539> detail<00:01:57.539> you<00:01:57.780> want<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.200> be<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.350> big

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
this detail you want it to be a big

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.510 
this detail you want it to be a big
circular<00:01:59.130> motion<00:01:59.759> so<00:01:59.939> we're<00:02:00.840> going<00:02:00.929> to<00:02:00.990> start

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
circular motion so we're going to start

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.730 
circular motion so we're going to start
probably<00:02:02.520> right<00:02:02.759> here<00:02:02.990> not<00:02:03.990> towards<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.530> tear

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
probably right here not towards the tear

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.039 
probably right here not towards the tear
duct<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.130> little<00:02:05.490> bit<00:02:05.609> outward<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.719> can<00:02:06.869> make<00:02:07.020> a

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
duct a little bit outward you can make a

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.620 
duct a little bit outward you can make a
dot<00:02:07.350> if<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.920> helps<00:02:08.220> you<00:02:08.370> out<00:02:08.400> and<00:02:08.790> then<00:02:09.450> we're

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
dot if that helps you out and then we're

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.880 
dot if that helps you out and then we're
going<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.780> go<00:02:09.960> all<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.200> way<00:02:10.350> up<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.800> the

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
going to go all the way up to the

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.430 
going to go all the way up to the
eyebrow<00:02:11.070> arch<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.970> then<00:02:12.810> probably

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
eyebrow arch and then probably

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.140 
eyebrow arch and then probably
about<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:14.310> half<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.940> about<00:02:16.160> yeah<00:02:17.160> like<00:02:17.970> three

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
about a half and about yeah like three

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.600 
about a half and about yeah like three
centimeters<00:02:18.810> away<00:02:18.960> from<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:20.040> opposite<00:02:20.460> side

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
centimeters away from the opposite side

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.420 
centimeters away from the opposite side
of<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.820> eye<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.150> then<00:02:21.630> we're<00:02:21.810> gonna<00:02:21.900> go<00:02:22.110> down

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
of the eye and then we're gonna go down

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.610 
of the eye and then we're gonna go down
probably<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.700> right<00:02:23.940> here<00:02:24.240> and<00:02:24.480> once<00:02:25.320> you<00:02:25.440> have

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
probably to right here and once you have

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.080 
probably to right here and once you have
those<00:02:25.830> four<00:02:26.070> dots<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:26.520> can<00:02:26.580> just<00:02:26.850> go<00:02:26.940> ahead

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
those four dots you can just go ahead

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.640 
those four dots you can just go ahead
and<00:02:27.360> connect<00:02:27.720> them<00:02:27.900> making<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.410> circular

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
and connect them making a circular

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:39.440 
and connect them making a circular
motion<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.920> then<00:02:38.250> just<00:02:38.520> do<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.790> exact<00:02:39.330> same

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
motion and then just do the exact same

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.560 
motion and then just do the exact same
on<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:40.020> opposite<00:02:40.410> side<00:02:41.390> after<00:02:42.390> you've

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
on the opposite side after you've

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.200 
on the opposite side after you've
completed<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:43.620> facial<00:02:44.430> lines<00:02:44.700> you<00:02:45.000> want<00:02:45.090> to

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
completed the facial lines you want to

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.640 
completed the facial lines you want to
move<00:02:45.390> down<00:02:45.630> towards<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.080> throat<00:02:46.380> and

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
move down towards the throat and

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.340 
move down towards the throat and
complete<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.280> trachea<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:47.940> in<00:02:48.780> order<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.200> do

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
complete the trachea and in order to do

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.110 
complete the trachea and in order to do
this<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.830> just<00:02:50.070> want<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.280> make<00:02:50.430> our<00:02:50.610> u-shape

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
this you just want to make our u-shape

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.870 
this you just want to make our u-shape
and<00:02:51.330> then<00:02:51.750> connect<00:02:52.080> it<00:02:52.200> on<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.410> top<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:53.070> we'll

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
and then connect it on the top and we'll

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:06.860 
and then connect it on the top and we'll
just<00:02:54.060> do<00:02:54.240> two<00:02:54.270> of<00:02:54.600> those

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.360 

and<00:03:07.870> it's<00:03:08.290> okay<00:03:08.650> if<00:03:08.800> you<00:03:08.920> don't<00:03:09.069> fill

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
and it's okay if you don't fill

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.550 
and it's okay if you don't fill
everything<00:03:09.760> in<00:03:10.150> completely<00:03:10.930> black<00:03:11.200> you<00:03:11.380> can

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
everything in completely black you can

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.170 
everything in completely black you can
always<00:03:11.800> go<00:03:12.010> back<00:03:12.040> through<00:03:12.580> and<00:03:12.610> add<00:03:12.940> more

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
always go back through and add more
