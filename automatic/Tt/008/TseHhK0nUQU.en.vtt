00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.300
 hello cgdd i saw well for this sweet 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.300
 of the show under the benevolence of blanket 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.920
 as we have already seen in fact for 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.080
 our tests we always use a 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.060
 software that is called in all or in 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.500
 makes a dog that is unknown but that's the 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.930
 dog that has the particularity of being able 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.020
 give a phone information 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.610
 a little bit here click here 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.080
 we have the phone information so 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.390
 we had seen it already in the previous 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.900
 thesis but also it allows to give a 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.059
 note 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.930
 then this note is not 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.640
 representative but not given a note 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.980
 the device that ensures a 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.879
 device to another to know if the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.010
 average of all these performances 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.079
 give a note that is more or less 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.090
 although one because of other models but 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.040
 that's all or evolving from version to 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.070
 version the scores are quite disparate 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.620
 and we went from a v4 version to a 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.210
 v5 version now and it's true that 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.149
 the scores have changed a little bit because of 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.470
 especially to the rec calculation in fact of gpu 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.910
 that is to say the whole graphic part of 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.160
 phones that is today a 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.320
 big part of the phones that 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.090
 allow to do video games from 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.140
 watch videos in full hd 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.139
 even in 4k so this gpu a site a little 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.270
 little and influences the scores and we're going 

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:18.209
 compare a little bit our version v4 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.799
 with a v5 version to compare these 

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:22.920
 two versions we will use our 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.270
 soft guide g550 why 150 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.009
 and just because he has a 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.289
 hd screen so that's pretty good 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:32.909
 he has a chord host processor is he a 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:34.619
 gpu a mali 450 we attack right away 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.359
 we press the test button we go 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.569
 compare that and above all we will compare the 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:38.569
 score 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.020
 he 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.310
 he 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.310
 e 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.040
 so here is the test done you will see 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.390
 actually on an example model on a 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.370
 comforter a small model 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.590
 in fact one can realize with the 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.349
 accord oak processor our malika 150 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:42.040
 we just have a difference of 234 points 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:44.690
 with a score of 27 1871 against 27 1597 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.060
 so the score has not changed much 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.099
 an equivalent model again one 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.930
 did the test with the same model 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.400
 at the same time with the same ones 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.510
 installed it is obvious that actually if 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.610
 you take a phone you install 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.810
 full sky above and well the score 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.400
 risk is a bit lower if you 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.849
 take a brand new phone with the 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.049
 minimum 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.560
 installed in this case you will have a tea to 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:05.540
 a much higher score so v4 or 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.799
 v5 down it does not change much 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.150
 in fact everything depends on how you 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.530
 go use your device yourself 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.480
 lets see actually that we see well 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.879
 in the video that the graphics part has 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.470
 actually changed in the calculation we have 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:17.450
 a little bit the resolution does not have long 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.000
 francs per second and it allows a small 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.280
 few two differentials surround it v4 or 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.440
 v5 in v5 especially this alpha version 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.720
 for the moment so well if you have to 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.859
 do a test passed to the v5 alpha here 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.049
 that's all for this small a blanket 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.430
 little informative video always has in 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.470
 company of us says we agree 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.849
 said here as always you can 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.230
 subscribe to our youtube channel for 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:38.150
 do not miss the next hot doogie 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.450
 because if you do not subscribe I loose 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.450
