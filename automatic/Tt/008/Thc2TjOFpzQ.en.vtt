dude<00:02:22.350> I<00:02:22.560> can't<00:02:22.950> even<00:02:23.040> remember<00:02:23.370> where<00:02:24.030> I

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
dude I can't even remember where I

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.670 
dude I can't even remember where I
learned<00:02:24.420> how<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.540> do<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.870> I'm<00:02:25.020> again<00:02:25.470> gonna

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
learned how to do it I'm again gonna

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.020 
learned how to do it I'm again gonna
have<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.950> put<00:02:26.100> you<00:02:26.190> down<00:02:26.220> or<00:02:26.580> it's<00:02:26.760> going<00:02:26.970> to

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
have to put you down or it's going to

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.490 
have to put you down or it's going to
drop<00:02:27.209> and<00:02:27.420> I<00:02:27.450> risk<00:02:27.660> breaking<00:02:27.840> stuff<00:02:28.230> so<00:02:28.380> give

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
drop and I risk breaking stuff so give

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:45.460 
drop and I risk breaking stuff so give
me<00:02:28.560> one<00:02:28.590> second<00:02:29.040> I<00:02:36.620> want<00:02:37.620> to<00:02:37.709> break<00:02:37.920> nothing

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:56.120 

more<00:02:46.470> off<00:02:48.530> alright<00:02:52.340> right<00:02:53.340> here<00:02:53.820> oh<00:02:54.950> you<00:02:55.950> can

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
more off alright right here oh you can

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.810 
more off alright right here oh you can
see<00:02:56.340> that<00:02:56.580> right<00:02:57.300> there<00:02:57.330> is<00:02:57.660> a<00:02:57.690> diode<00:02:58.200> that

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
see that right there is a diode that

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.260 
see that right there is a diode that
diode<00:02:59.820> there<00:03:00.750> there's<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.170> resistor<00:03:01.709> there<00:03:02.270> see

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
diode there there's a resistor there see

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.660 
diode there there's a resistor there see
that<00:03:03.300> diode<00:03:03.840> there<00:03:04.440> is<00:03:04.620> a<00:03:04.650> resistor<00:03:05.370> where

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
that diode there is a resistor where

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.160 
that diode there is a resistor where
this<00:03:07.280> dial<00:03:08.280> right<00:03:08.490> here<00:03:08.850> is<00:03:09.030> they<00:03:09.690> used<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:10.020> be

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
this dial right here is they used to be

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.140 
this dial right here is they used to be
a<00:03:10.200> resistor<00:03:10.680> there<00:03:10.860> we<00:03:11.310> took<00:03:11.490> the<00:03:11.670> resistor

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
a resistor there we took the resistor

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.090 
a resistor there we took the resistor
out<00:03:12.330> put<00:03:12.660> a<00:03:12.690> diode<00:03:12.959> in<00:03:13.320> there<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:13.920> TV

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
out put a diode in there and the TV

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.350 
out put a diode in there and the TV
fired<00:03:14.520> up<00:03:14.730> just<00:03:14.760> fine<00:03:15.180> and<00:03:15.480> I<00:03:16.470> actually<00:03:16.680> used

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
fired up just fine and I actually used

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.240 
fired up just fine and I actually used
another<00:03:18.360> I<00:03:18.810> pulled<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.620> boards<00:03:19.950> off<00:03:20.100> of

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
another I pulled the boards off of

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.940 
another I pulled the boards off of
another<00:03:20.450> vizio<00:03:21.450> tv<00:03:21.510> that<00:03:22.290> my<00:03:22.470> brother<00:03:22.680> gave<00:03:22.920> me

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
another vizio tv that my brother gave me

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.110 
another vizio tv that my brother gave me
again

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
again

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.840 
again
I<00:03:24.150> was<00:03:24.570> broken<00:03:25.130> pulled<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.220> resistor<00:03:26.610> or

was<00:03:36.030> no<00:03:36.150> other<00:03:36.239> brain<00:03:36.480> type<00:03:36.660> words<00:03:36.900> I<00:03:37.260> looked

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
was no other brain type words I looked

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.160 
was no other brain type words I looked
up<00:03:37.650> here<00:03:38.070> for<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:38.850> fuses<00:03:39.360> and<00:03:39.630> all<00:03:39.750> that<00:03:39.959> fun

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
up here for the fuses and all that fun

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.810 
up here for the fuses and all that fun
stuff<00:03:40.230> and<00:03:40.739> down<00:03:40.890> here<00:03:41.220> checked<00:03:41.610> all<00:03:41.730> the

now<00:03:44.880> it<00:03:45.030> works<00:03:45.209> your<00:03:46.080> problem<00:03:46.440> with<00:03:46.620> your

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
now it works your problem with your

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.550 
now it works your problem with your
colors<00:03:47.160> it's<00:03:47.790> coming<00:03:48.090> from<00:03:48.180> this<00:03:48.560> this

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
colors it's coming from this this

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.740 
colors it's coming from this this
controllers<00:03:50.100> your<00:03:50.220> colors<00:03:50.489> now<00:03:51.269> when<00:03:51.630> you

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
controllers your colors now when you

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.090 
controllers your colors now when you
take<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.049> board<00:03:52.260> out<00:03:52.410> and<00:03:52.680> you're<00:03:52.799> messing

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
take the board out and you're messing

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.490 
take the board out and you're messing
around<00:03:53.190> with<00:03:53.430> it<00:03:53.489> I<00:03:53.790> mean<00:03:54.600> it<00:03:54.900> looks<00:03:55.140> like<00:03:55.350> it's

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
around with it I mean it looks like it's

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.229 
around with it I mean it looks like it's
going<00:03:55.680> back<00:03:55.920> into<00:03:56.220> place<00:03:56.400> and<00:03:56.580> feels<00:03:57.060> like

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
going back into place and feels like

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:58.940 
going back into place and feels like
it's<00:03:57.390> going<00:03:57.600> back<00:03:57.720> into<00:03:57.900> place<00:03:58.140> it's<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:58.769> pop

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
it's going back into place it's a pop

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.500 
it's going back into place it's a pop
your<00:03:59.100> TV<00:03:59.370> back<00:03:59.549> on<00:03:59.580> and<00:03:59.880> your<00:03:59.970> colours<00:04:00.269> messed

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
your TV back on and your colours messed

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.660 
your TV back on and your colours messed
up<00:04:00.720> you<00:04:01.019> got<00:04:01.290> to<00:04:01.440> take<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:01.709> back<00:04:01.860> apart<00:04:02.010> and

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
up you got to take it back apart and

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.210 
up you got to take it back apart and
finagle<00:04:03.269> with<00:04:03.510> this<00:04:03.660> wire<00:04:03.870> that<00:04:04.620> wire<00:04:04.860> is<00:04:05.040> the

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
finagle with this wire that wire is the

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.740 
finagle with this wire that wire is the
difference<00:04:05.519> between<00:04:05.580> your<00:04:06.000> green<00:04:06.299> nasty

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
difference between your green nasty

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.100 
difference between your green nasty

mess<00:04:10.110> up<00:04:10.290> and<00:04:10.910> it<00:04:11.910> working<00:04:12.269> apparently<00:04:12.739> all

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
mess up and it working apparently all

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.170 
mess up and it working apparently all
right<00:04:13.829> thanks<00:04:14.220> for<00:04:14.310> watching<00:04:14.610> guys<00:04:14.730> and<00:04:14.790> I

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
right thanks for watching guys and I

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.989 
right thanks for watching guys and I
hope<00:04:15.480> I<00:04:16.340> helped<00:04:17.340> someone<00:04:17.989> thanks
