00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.420
 Welcome to parquet living world. My name is David Fuchs. Today we have 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.920
 the theme: old building, wooden floor and kitchen! There are really exciting things and we want to 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.550
 Show you what you can do there and what floors you can lay there. 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.300
 As is the case with an old building, this building also has its time on its shoulders. 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.130
 One also notices that certain years were lived here. Mostly there is some on the floors 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.309
 Rolls. You will probably also find this in your old building. Have here 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:41.080
 we have a linoleum that is glued. We decided to put the old linoleum in it 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.089
 because it is too cumbersome and too cumbersome to pull out the whole floor 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:48.479
 tear. We would most likely take the old planks with us. We must 

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:52.650
 but definitely check the ground and we will do the same. Quite often 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.570
 we also find old baseboards, as here too. I would like to see you soon as well 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.689
 give some tips. Because everything that we are preparing now for the transfer, is 

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:07.080
 make it much easier for the renovation of the new floor. Here you see the 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.690
 baseboards glued to the wall. I'm tearing it out now and you can see that 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:18.690
 certain residues remain on the wall. Just such edges on the wall must with 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:25.480
 A chisel or scraper will be removed, leaving a straight surface 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:31.020
 manage it. In the kitchen area, it's really not easy 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.710
 to make the right decision. Which floor do I want to put in? I would prefer 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.850
 To say yes: I'm going in a tile, because sometimes something may fall down and 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.390
 is very robust. It may spill something or the dishwasher is running out. That holds 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.659
 a tile also wonderful. But, if you have a wooden background, that's not it 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.670
 so easy with a tile. You need a special construction, especially if you have tiles 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.729
 want to process. This must necessarily be a specialist. Our topic today: vinyl floor 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:14.029
 laying on an old wooden floor. Despite the glued linoleum as here with us, which should stay in there. 

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:21.180
 Nevertheless, you should check the surface for evenness. And that's best done with a 2 meters 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.440
 Straightedge. The length is very important to be able to check the flatness perfectly. 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.600
 They can start from the corners or in the middle. If you look under the guideline under it, 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:49.870
 At a distance of one meter no dents or humps larger than 3mm may appear. This is very important. 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.280
 The floor must lie flat and must not move afterwards. Especially when walking should 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:05.840
 he does not give in. If the planks move, something fits loosely and you should use the screw 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.040
 follow suit. If you do not pay attention to this in the first place, you can find out afterwards in the laminate, 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.400
 Vinyl or parquet gaps in the floor form and then the joints would open again. 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.140
 And with this stray you are now going through the room as I do now. 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.060
 If you have already measured the soil, clean the soil again around the soil 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:44.020
 Get rid of pebbles and dust and then we can start with the insulation directly. 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:50.090
 Our customer has decided for this vinyl floor and we would like this here in the 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.700
 Process kitchen area. Here we would like to show you the footfall sound insulation, 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.460
 which is specifically for this vinyl floor show. It's a heavy mat that has the acoustics 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.060
 in the room, but also greatly reduced down. 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:28.720
 Here we have a full vinyl floor with a construction height of 5 mm. As a result, we have an extremely small body, the waterproof, non-slip 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.990
 and robust, and here we want to show you how the installation works in this room. 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.540
 This is now a special impact sound insulation for vinyl floor. These we will be at all 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:47.870
 to use our articles from Parkett-Wohnwelt. Please take these too. She grants 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:55.860
 You have the appropriate warranty from the manufacturer. You see a smooth side here and one 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:00.909
 rough side. In that case, put it just as I do. The rough side comes after 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:07.909
 above. In laminate, most of the insulation is the other way around. But here you use the same way. 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:27.860
 Let me show you briefly that we have two wooden frames in this room. It's nice if you do not go around the wooden rims 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:37.160
 but it would be good if you can place the vinyl under the frame. 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.289
 But you can see that it does not fit. To shorten it, there is a tool - the Multimaster. 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.289
 This will get you there quickly and easily. 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.380
 For laying a few more points. 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:09.379
 We decided to start in this corner. Important: Always work from left to right. That's the connection technique. 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:25.320
 So is the laying direction. To cap or cut simply use a cutter 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:38.439
 Knife. Put on the angle and make a cut. Now take the hallway 

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:42.559
 in the hand and crack it in place. You see, it's just different. 

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:49.559
 Here you can also see wonderfully that a reinforcement is in it. This reinforcement is for it 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:55.139
 because the soil is inherently stable and you have very little work with it. You take 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:59.619
 it now up again and the hallway is falling apart. That was it. 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:34.460
 Dear customers, we have come to the conclusion here with this topic old building; Wooden background; 

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:40.429
 Kitchen! What are we doing on top? The customer here has starclick for a vinyloden 

00:07:40.429 --> 00:07:45.069
 Decide on the project from the series Parkett-Wohnwelt. We want to encourage you with this video 

00:07:45.069 --> 00:07:51.940
 and convince. You can be on a critical underground, or on a wooden floor, where you 

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:58.000
 have no great freedom of choice, relocate vinyl. In a room where a water-resistant 

00:07:58.009 --> 00:08:05.009
 and shockproof floor is needed, where a lot of movement takes place and generally 

00:08:05.059 --> 00:08:09.519
 where, where is the highest frequency, z. B. Kids are running in and out. 

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.300
 So we processed the vinyl here. 

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.960
 I hope the video helped you a little. All the best!
