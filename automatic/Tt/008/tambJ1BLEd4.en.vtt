 Yes Yes 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.090
 hello youtube people welcome to this 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.660

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.810
 have step by step how to install this 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:46.100
 old television effect in their 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:49.430
 phones with android well the truth that 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.370
 it was very good for me it has not given me 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.680
 problems or anything good since mine already what 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.629
 had by default but by those who 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:02.890
 they do not have it because I will teach them how to put 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:02.890
 the many then choose to install it 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.750
 in his phones that he brings but 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.869
 I will teach you to install them in 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.869
 any phone and do some actor or 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.570
 any break you have between 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.120
 phone or any model and others 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.830
 ok we go with the requirements that 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.030
 we need to have to be able to install 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.030
 this effect 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.970
 and 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.380
 very well first the first step 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.520
 we are going to be installing the application 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.840
 x poster install I'll take it out on 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.110
 all you applied, I will leave you in the 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:56.320
 description of the video as we are going to download 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:58.580
 a little bit the river to have the risks 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.810
 we want to install the equipment application 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.369
 set 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.619
 and such crystals is to say so 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:10.009
 work ok 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:14.599
 we open the application and give the 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:16.849
 option that says install ocde ok and let's go 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.890
 to give you we are going to wait for you 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.830
 finish the process that is going to have to 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.110
 do and we're going to give software bots 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.459
 now I would recommend bounce though 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.120
 this time closed systems that 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.370
 software that is fast restart ok 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.100
 once done that and that we have 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:38.840
 rebooted the phone will appear 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:43.430
 what do you see here that says to process 31 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:46.090
 31 teams the bridge point is already two 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.790
 points 1.2 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.580
 ep lasexta activated in which the most 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.640
 recent never 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.380
 in modules 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.330
 because they are the applications that need 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.709
 of these requirements of this application 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.350
 because the application what it does is 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.750
 install some files or packages or 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.540
 drivers as they want to say so that 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:12.170
 the application that needs it to work 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.180
 perfectly this is with a guy are 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.430
 with some types drivers so that some 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.830
 applications work perfectly 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:22.990
 as it is 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:24.970
 greening game game and something like that 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.630
 application that we are going to install and many 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.240
 others more 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.550
 today we are going to palomear here who 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.940
 have planned when and you do not 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:36.820
 it leaves palomeados we are going to palomear it ok 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.220
 once this is done we will restart 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:42.040
 I will not restart or anything will not 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.540
 do together with me because we're going to home 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.380
 and we open a tweet box app 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.510
 previously we had to have it 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.670
 obviously installed 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.879
 after having restarted we install 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.370
 the application that I tell you and we 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:04:00.519
 Colombian box will appear here and 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:05.079
 we restarted again ok until we were going 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:07.980
 well now once rebooted we go to the 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:11.180
 application with box 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.180
 efe let me 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.659
 until 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.880
 here we would have variety of options and 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:19.859
 things we could do to 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.590
 Personalize to personalize our 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:26.130
 phone but what we do 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.820
 matter is the second one that is r that already 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:32.390
 be rt effect 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:36.800
 and here it's good , mine already had it 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:41.780
 by default I had it but it took away and 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:43.940
 it went back to put this ok once here 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:48.170
 come on we will not have anything to eat or 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:52.220
 nothing, we're going to be like that, what are we going to 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:53.700
 activate would be this one and this one we're going to 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.770
 put 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.410
 or if you nothing else this is the one 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.790
 more important this is another effect that is 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:03.090
 put for her 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:07.250
 to unblock but I do not the truth that 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.250
 going to the rancor I do not get the effect 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.020
 d 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.300
 after doing this the only thing we're going 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.520
 to do is speak a home button and 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:22.069
 we go 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:25.759
 to restart because we restart once 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:29.479
 that we have restarted then we are going to 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:32.090
 have already the effect that had 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:35.539
 mentioned above as you can see 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:38.870
 it's something easy, easy, I do not know if 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:41.030
 after putting the effect you can 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.259
 say cut the application but I 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.889
 I recommend that you do not speak from 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:46.590
 install 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:49.680
 to make sure that the effect continues 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.680
 with package to make sure that 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.439
 our diaz phones with this effect 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.900
 ok that has been all you can see is 

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:59.699
 something very simple see you in another 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.819
 video until next time 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:01.819
 bye
