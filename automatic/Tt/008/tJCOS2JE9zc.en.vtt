there's<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.460> rugged<00:00:32.969> solution<00:00:33.690> in<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.380> form<00:00:34.620> of

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
there's a rugged solution in the form of

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.650 
there's a rugged solution in the form of
a<00:00:35.760> brand<00:00:36.420> new<00:00:37.280> mobility<00:00:38.280> scooter<00:00:38.879> which<00:00:39.329> is

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
a brand new mobility scooter which is

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.880 
a brand new mobility scooter which is
being<00:00:40.050> created<00:00:40.770> for<00:00:41.070> off-road<00:00:42.030> use<00:00:42.300> and

being created for off-road use and

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.100 
being created for off-road use and
apparently<00:00:43.890> it's<00:00:44.219> impossible<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.180> tip<00:00:45.450> over

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
apparently it's impossible to tip over

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.069 
apparently it's impossible to tip over
so<00:00:46.739> we<00:00:46.890> said<00:00:47.129> deals<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:47.579> wheels<00:00:47.610> along<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.480> TGA

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079

actually last year we did a BBC top gear
challenge<00:03:08.300> and<00:03:08.840> one<00:03:09.800> of<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:09.950> things<00:03:10.100> we

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
challenge and one of the things we

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.760 
challenge and one of the things we
noticed<00:03:10.550> trying<00:03:10.790> to<00:03:10.850> climb<00:03:11.120> up<00:03:11.300> a<00:03:11.450> hillside<00:03:12.290> in

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
noticed trying to climb up a hillside in

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.490 
noticed trying to climb up a hillside in
Wales<00:03:13.520> was<00:03:14.060> traction<00:03:14.720> was<00:03:15.020> one<00:03:15.200> of<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.350> main

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
Wales was traction was one of the main

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.090 
Wales was traction was one of the main
problems<00:03:15.920> and<00:03:16.420> the<00:03:17.420> the<00:03:17.750> tires<00:03:18.019> is<00:03:18.470> is<00:03:18.739> the

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
problems and the the tires is is the

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.280 
problems and the the tires is is the
predominant<00:03:19.580> factor<00:03:19.730> in<00:03:20.000> that<00:03:20.150> so<00:03:20.480> one<00:03:21.140> of<00:03:21.170> the

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
predominant factor in that so one of the

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.350 
predominant factor in that so one of the
things<00:03:21.440> on<00:03:21.590> this<00:03:21.739> model<00:03:21.920> is<00:03:22.250> some<00:03:22.850> nice<00:03:23.030> chunky

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
things on this model is some nice chunky

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.479 
things on this model is some nice chunky
tyres<00:03:23.570> but<00:03:24.019> they<00:03:24.170> are<00:03:24.350> extremely<00:03:24.860> chunky<00:03:25.310> and

tyres but they are extremely chunky and

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:26.860 
tyres but they are extremely chunky and
I<00:03:25.549> suppose<00:03:25.760> the<00:03:25.910> wonderful<00:03:26.269> thing<00:03:26.390> about<00:03:26.510> this

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
I suppose the wonderful thing about this

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.930 
I suppose the wonderful thing about this
is<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.260> fact<00:03:27.440> that<00:03:27.620> yes<00:03:27.890> you<00:03:28.220> see<00:03:28.459> a<00:03:28.489> lot<00:03:28.820> of

is the fact that yes you see a lot of

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.940 
is the fact that yes you see a lot of
these<00:03:29.090> on<00:03:29.360> the<00:03:29.840> pathways<00:03:30.350> you<00:03:30.590> see<00:03:30.709> quite<00:03:30.830> a

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
these on the pathways you see quite a

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.380 
these on the pathways you see quite a
few<00:03:31.010> of<00:03:31.190> them<00:03:31.310> going<00:03:31.519> around<00:03:31.790> the<00:03:32.209> main
