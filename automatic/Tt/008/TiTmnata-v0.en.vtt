00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.060
 ah 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.520
 and what wave youtube people welcome 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.049
 to this video summary of everything that was 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.320
 revealed in the San Diego comic-con 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:15.059
 this 2013 about halo let's start first 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.039
 that nothing has already revealed more details about 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.869
 a new series of comics developed 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.580
 by dark horse and we got a small 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.200
 advance showing us some pages 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.180
 that are available already in halo 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.220
 waypoint the history of this series we 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.780
 will lead to the origin of the spartan program 4 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.880
 we will know more about the dark side 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.530
 of the project and other UN secrets 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.480
 the main protagonist will be the 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.190
 expert in sara palmer history 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.319
 will start when she was an audience and 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.089
 still something interesting inside the 

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:41.039
 pages shown is the appearance of a 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:42.479
 subject to whom they refer to as muse 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.370
 this subject calls in a meeting to 

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:46.409
 High command staff sideways in s / c 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.879
 where he talks about the spartans and 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:49.859
 that I think more of the chifa is 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.719
 disappeared it is necessary to bring more 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:53.639
 Spartans back to protect the 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.350
 humanity also talks about the spartans 

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:57.030
 as if they were his brothers and how the 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.429
 doctor kidnapped several children for the 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.260
 project condemning them all already 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:03.030
 him to that life full of pain and 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.620
 suffering in the or in that zeal that of 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.659
 understand that he was also part of the 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.549
 spartan project 2 but surely the 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.770
 tests were not so successful in him 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.229
 obviously they will be revealed to all 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.000
 in the spartan project 4 including the 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.920
 mysterious type that comes out the beginning of 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.990
 halo 4 and it may even be the same 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.670
 subject called muse will also look 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.590
 close an assault in which the inquisitor 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.539
 will be forced to end the alliance 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.490
 with the brutes this series of comics 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:28.350
 called jael escalation will come out on 11 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.090
 December this year and may 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.890
 give us clues to the history of the next 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.600
 game also revealed the date of 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.280
 departure of the spartan shot which already 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.530
 came out this Thursday is available in the 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.689
 windows store for 7 dollars and only 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.850
 for pc with windows 8 operating system 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.250
 and mobile devices with windows phone 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.200
 8 regarding the mega surprises is a 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.720
 total disappointment since the only things 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.399
 which are the apparent mega surprises not 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.380
 they are more than tablets that they gave away 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.670
 during the panel some people are 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.259
 tablets new ones and has 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.119
 taking advantage of the spartan release 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.829
 assault and they also showed some new 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.259
 toys for mega blogs that I think that 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.789
 There are 10 in total and they are collectible but 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.560
 they really did not show any trailer 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.479
 halo new one and Xbox series 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.220
 television the rest of the panel was a 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.110
 question session of the community to 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.569
 triplet equipment although in these 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.549
 questions revealed nothing of halo 5 in 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.750
 specific there are some things that speak 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.730
 about the future of history in 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.290
 general and the next games like 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.120
 had said months ago they pulled out a 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.549
 news that cut would not return in 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.560
 halo 5 and during the panel frank confirms 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.450
 once again saying that they cut is a 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.370
 important character for the universe and 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.110
 his legacy will continue to exist 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.360
 saved the galaxy next to master chip 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.980
 but at the moment only for the moment there is no 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.599
 plans will be brought back to the games 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.519
 they also answered a question 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.379
 important and is some day we will see the 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.910
 face of the master boss to what frank 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:43.470
 replied that it is very likely that 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.209
 let's see in the future when it's the 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.799
 right moment and ironically though 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.510
 many do not know their appearance in 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:50.370
 general was revealed in the book of fail 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.110
 of reach so it's no big 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.209
 surprise his face although they already gave a 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.250
 important advance they could realize 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.440
 if they played halo 4 that already practically 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.060
 we know how is frank said that although already 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.859
 they know what the boss's face is like 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.959
 would like to introduce it in a game to 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.970
 to be able to explore how their gestures and 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.709
 expression of his eyes so one day 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.569
 it seems that if we see the face of the boss 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.129
 in the games something that surprised a lot 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.870
 the team was when they were asked if 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.579
 they will take out a world halo game 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.530
 open to which they showed themselves something 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.810
 evasive and uncomfortable so surely 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.549
 It was a very accurate question, though 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.799
 they stated that if they thought about it many 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.389
 times but at the moment there are no plans for 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.569
 make a halo of open world but yes 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.340
 do not 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.079
 in mind let's remember that they have already 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.849
 introduced several things within the 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:31.170
 games and it 's not crazy to think that 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.120
 they want to make a halo of open world 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.709
 I really believe that if it is within the 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.719
 plans of Tripoli but we will have to wait 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.459
 to future statements also spoke 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:40.290
 about the multiplayer of halo 4 with 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.909
 regarding new armors and maps 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.439
 Many already know that new 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:44.909
 armor with the champion pack 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:46.469
 but the question is and we'll see more 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:48.150
 Armor packs after your 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:50.400
 launch and it seems that the 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.900
 answer is one since at the moment it is not 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.819
 they have planned but maybe if the 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.290
 community join to ask for return 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.639
 some armors can bring them from 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.109
 return in a new package 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:59.639
 remember that three for three listen 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.079
 the community so it's not something 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:03.090
 impossible they also talked about the 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.189
 possibility of bringing new maps and 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.530
 some old ones back as guardian 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:09.150
 of halo 3 which frank ensures is one 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.099
 of those favorites if the idea pleases him 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.989
 so pretty sure we 'll see from 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.969
 guardian return of halo 3 together with 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.650
 other classic maps to finalize 

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:18.209
 although spartan salt is a game 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.370
 developed exclusively for 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.470
 mobile devices do not rule out the 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.389
 possibility to launch it in xbox one in 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.460
 a future basically that was all 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.590
 important of the comedian reveals us nothing 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.000
 really good actually but good 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.380
 that has been all for today 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.030
 I hope you liked it 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.740
 leave me a comment your opinion is 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.210
 pretty important to me 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.620
 I certainly wanted to recommend the 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.300
