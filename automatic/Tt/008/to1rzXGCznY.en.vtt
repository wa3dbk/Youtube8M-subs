00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:10.059 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.240 

growing<00:00:11.059> up<00:00:11.120> on<00:00:11.240> the<00:00:11.269> farm<00:00:11.360> I<00:00:11.809> had<00:00:12.049> a<00:00:12.410> backhoe

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
growing up on the farm I had a backhoe

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.999 
growing up on the farm I had a backhoe
but<00:00:13.879> an<00:00:14.090> excavator<00:00:14.990> would<00:00:15.259> have<00:00:15.349> been<00:00:15.529> even

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:16.009 
but an excavator would have been even

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.150 
but an excavator would have been even
more<00:00:16.309> fun<00:00:16.759> and<00:00:17.060> I<00:00:17.779> recently<00:00:18.079> received<00:00:18.439> the

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
more fun and I recently received the

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.150 
more fun and I recently received the

Lego 8043 Technic motorized estimator

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.060 
Lego 8043 Technic motorized estimator
which<00:00:25.160> features<00:00:25.939> a<00:00:26.390> couple<00:00:27.349> of<00:00:27.439> really<00:00:27.740> fun

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
which features a couple of really fun

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.560 
which features a couple of really fun
things<00:00:28.990> one<00:00:29.990> it<00:00:30.349> has<00:00:30.619> not<00:00:31.609> one<00:00:31.939> but<00:00:31.970> two

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
things one it has not one but two

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.049 
things one it has not one but two
remotes<00:00:32.960> to<00:00:33.440> infrared<00:00:34.160> receivers<00:00:34.790> the

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
remotes to infrared receivers the

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.250 
remotes to infrared receivers the
battery<00:00:35.360> pack<00:00:35.449> and<00:00:35.870> four<00:00:37.030> motors<00:00:38.260> the

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
battery pack and four motors the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.470 
battery pack and four motors the
escalator<00:00:39.710> works<00:00:40.640> a<00:00:40.850> couple<00:00:41.150> of<00:00:41.239> different

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
escalator works a couple of different

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.080 
escalator works a couple of different
modes<00:00:41.690> which<00:00:42.020> is<00:00:42.170> kind<00:00:42.350> of<00:00:42.379> cool<00:00:42.469> it<00:00:42.910> works<00:00:43.910> in

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
modes which is kind of cool it works in

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.500 
modes which is kind of cool it works in
a<00:00:44.210> dig<00:00:44.989> mode<00:00:45.320> and<00:00:45.710> then<00:00:46.520> you<00:00:46.789> can<00:00:46.940> flip<00:00:47.239> this

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
a dig mode and then you can flip this

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.180 
a dig mode and then you can flip this
little<00:00:47.690> switch<00:00:47.840> at<00:00:48.710> the<00:00:48.739> back<00:00:49.070> of<00:00:49.100> the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
little switch at the back of the

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.279 
little switch at the back of the
activator<00:00:52.190> and<00:00:52.430> it<00:00:53.120> switches<00:00:53.329> to<00:00:53.510> drive<00:00:53.930> mode

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
activator and it switches to drive mode

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.069 
activator and it switches to drive mode
so<00:00:54.530> you<00:00:54.620> can<00:00:54.769> move<00:00:55.280> between<00:00:55.899> the<00:00:56.899> two

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
so you can move between the two

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.889 
so you can move between the two
functions<00:00:57.680> with<00:00:58.010> the<00:00:58.539> the<00:00:59.539> flip<00:00:59.719> of<00:00:59.840> the

00:00:59.889 --> 00:00:59.899 
functions with the the flip of the

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:01.419 
functions with the the flip of the
switch<00:00:59.960> so<00:01:00.440> that<00:01:00.469> it<00:01:00.620> doesn't<00:01:00.800> need<00:01:01.070> like

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:01.429 
switch so that it doesn't need like

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:03.600 
switch so that it doesn't need like
eight<00:01:01.940> motors<00:01:02.449> to<00:01:02.690> do<00:01:02.809> everything<00:01:03.079> that<00:01:03.379> it

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
eight motors to do everything that it

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.100 
eight motors to do everything that it
does<00:01:04.610> um<00:01:05.030> and<00:01:05.869> it's<00:01:06.050> got<00:01:06.170> the<00:01:06.320> tank<00:01:06.590> treads<00:01:07.039> and

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
does um and it's got the tank treads and

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.960 
does um and it's got the tank treads and
a<00:01:09.110> whole<00:01:09.619> bunch<00:01:09.649> of<00:01:10.220> other<00:01:10.369> stuff<00:01:10.460> and<00:01:10.789> it<00:01:10.850> also

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
a whole bunch of other stuff and it also

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.230 
a whole bunch of other stuff and it also
does<00:01:11.240> this<00:01:11.450> alternate<00:01:12.050> build<00:01:12.789> which<00:01:13.789> I<00:01:14.000> don't

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
does this alternate build which I don't

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.940 
does this alternate build which I don't
remember<00:01:14.360> what<00:01:14.599> is<00:01:14.720> called<00:01:14.990> but<00:01:15.410> it's

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
remember what is called but it's

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.359 
remember what is called but it's
basically<00:01:16.220> just<00:01:16.490> a<00:01:16.759> bulldozer<00:01:17.209> II<00:01:17.979> thing<00:01:18.979> so

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
basically just a bulldozer II thing so

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:25.559 
basically just a bulldozer II thing so
I'm<00:01:19.700> really<00:01:20.119> excited<00:01:20.270> to<00:01:20.750> build<00:01:20.869> this<00:01:21.170> it<00:01:22.149> is

00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:25.569 

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:30.219 

1123<00:01:26.569> pieces<00:01:27.229> and<00:01:28.239> if<00:01:29.239> you've<00:01:29.569> seen<00:01:29.929> the

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
1123 pieces and if you've seen the

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.999 
1123 pieces and if you've seen the
stop-motion<00:01:30.530> builds<00:01:31.340> that<00:01:31.489> I<00:01:31.610> did<00:01:31.849> of<00:01:32.209> the

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
stop-motion builds that I did of the

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.150 
stop-motion builds that I did of the
8066<00:01:34.569> off-roader<00:01:35.569> that<00:01:36.470> was<00:01:36.560> about<00:01:36.709> a<00:01:36.770> hundred

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
8066 off-roader that was about a hundred

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.190 
8066 off-roader that was about a hundred
and<00:01:37.459> fifteen<00:01:37.940> pieces<00:01:38.420> so<00:01:38.569> this<00:01:38.690> is<00:01:38.780> about<00:01:38.840> ten

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
and fifteen pieces so this is about ten

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.830 
and fifteen pieces so this is about ten
times<00:01:39.410> as<00:01:39.709> many<00:01:39.830> pieces<00:01:40.099> and<00:01:40.660> again<00:01:41.660> there

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
times as many pieces and again there

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.839 
times as many pieces and again there
will<00:01:41.929> be<00:01:42.020> a<00:01:42.050> stop-motion<00:01:42.349> video<00:01:42.890> of<00:01:43.429> this

00:01:43.839 --> 00:01:43.849 
will be a stop-motion video of this

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:46.419 
will be a stop-motion video of this
being<00:01:44.179> built<00:01:44.989> and<00:01:45.200> i<00:01:45.440> will<00:01:45.739> probably<00:01:45.920> build

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
being built and i will probably build

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:49.650 
being built and i will probably build
both<00:01:46.759> it<00:01:47.119> and<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:47.569> bulldozer<00:01:48.319> that<00:01:48.979> it<00:01:49.130> builds

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
both it and the bulldozer that it builds

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.419 
both it and the bulldozer that it builds
so<00:01:50.679> that'll<00:01:51.679> take<00:01:51.860> a<00:01:51.890> little<00:01:52.039> bit<00:01:52.160> of<00:01:52.220> time

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
so that'll take a little bit of time

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:54.010 
so that'll take a little bit of time
because<00:01:52.759> that'll<00:01:53.030> be<00:01:53.149> two<00:01:53.420> thousand<00:01:53.869> pieces

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
because that'll be two thousand pieces

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.880 
because that'll be two thousand pieces
worth<00:01:54.349> of<00:01:54.560> builds<00:01:55.129> and<00:01:55.340> it<00:01:56.179> takes<00:01:56.660> about<00:01:56.890> an

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
worth of builds and it takes about an

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.389 
worth of builds and it takes about an
hour<00:01:57.950> per<00:01:58.819> hundred<00:01:59.300> pieces<00:01:59.569> so<00:02:00.289> that<00:02:00.560> we<00:02:01.250> about

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
hour per hundred pieces so that we about

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.059 
hour per hundred pieces so that we about
20<00:02:01.819> hours<00:02:01.849> of<00:02:02.179> shooting<00:02:02.509> to<00:02:02.720> shoot<00:02:02.899> the<00:02:03.110> the

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:04.069 
20 hours of shooting to shoot the the

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:06.070 
20 hours of shooting to shoot the the
assembly<00:02:04.520> video<00:02:04.879> but<00:02:05.270> I<00:02:05.450> thought<00:02:05.539> I'd<00:02:05.929> give

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
assembly video but I thought I'd give

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.350 
assembly video but I thought I'd give
you<00:02:06.110> a<00:02:06.229> quick<00:02:06.590> preview<00:02:06.830> of<00:02:07.399> what<00:02:07.879> was<00:02:08.179> to<00:02:08.330> come

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
you a quick preview of what was to come

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.500 
you a quick preview of what was to come
cuz<00:02:08.899> I'm<00:02:09.830> pretty<00:02:10.099> excited<00:02:10.220> because<00:02:10.670> this<00:02:11.330> is<00:02:11.480> a

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
cuz I'm pretty excited because this is a

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.500 
cuz I'm pretty excited because this is a
really<00:02:12.110> cool<00:02:12.349> set<00:02:13.190> up<00:02:13.310> with<00:02:13.489> the<00:02:13.610> pistons<00:02:14.090> and

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
really cool set up with the pistons and

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.870 
really cool set up with the pistons and
the<00:02:15.160> yes<00:02:16.160> yeah<00:02:16.849> I'm<00:02:17.209> excited
