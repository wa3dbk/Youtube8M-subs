okay just a quick video here today I'll
show<00:00:03.419> you<00:00:03.480> how<00:00:03.659> to<00:00:03.720> check<00:00:03.990> to<00:00:04.170> see<00:00:04.200> if<00:00:04.410> your<00:00:04.529> car

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
show you how to check to see if your car

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.059 
show you how to check to see if your car
has<00:00:04.890> an<00:00:05.009> LSD<00:00:05.279> limited<00:00:06.000> slip<00:00:06.210> differential

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:07.069 
has an LSD limited slip differential

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:09.259 
has an LSD limited slip differential
sometimes<00:00:08.069> you<00:00:08.189> can't<00:00:08.370> tell<00:00:08.460> by<00:00:08.730> driving<00:00:09.030> them

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
sometimes you can't tell by driving them

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.110 
sometimes you can't tell by driving them
you<00:00:10.200> can't<00:00:10.469> tell<00:00:10.740> by<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.040> part<00:00:11.519> number<00:00:11.820> on<00:00:11.849> the

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
you can't tell by the part number on the

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.089 
you can't tell by the part number on the
diff<00:00:12.540> if<00:00:12.719> you<00:00:12.809> can't<00:00:13.049> read<00:00:13.290> it

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
diff if you can't read it

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.680 
diff if you can't read it
and<00:00:14.490> if<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:14.759> really<00:00:15.059> want<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.269> buy<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.420> car

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
and if you really want to buy the car

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.240 
and if you really want to buy the car
that<00:00:15.900> has<00:00:16.020> an<00:00:16.139> LSD<00:00:16.410> or<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:16.800> want<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.010> make<00:00:17.100> sure

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
that has an LSD or you want to make sure

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.160 
that has an LSD or you want to make sure
yours<00:00:17.460> does<00:00:17.760> have<00:00:17.910> an<00:00:18.060> LSD<00:00:18.420> or<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.690> doesn't

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
yours does have an LSD or a doesn't

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.980 
yours does have an LSD or a doesn't
either<00:00:19.439> way<00:00:19.619> this<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.490> easy<00:00:20.820> way<00:00:21.119> if<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.869> car

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
either way this is a easy way if the car

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.570 
either way this is a easy way if the car
is<00:00:22.109> not<00:00:22.199> running<00:00:22.410> anything<00:00:23.039> like<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.310> you

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
is not running anything like that you

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.750 
is not running anything like that you
can<00:00:23.699> check<00:00:23.910> this<00:00:24.119> way<00:00:25.369> first<00:00:26.369> thing<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.609> want

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
can check this way first thing you want

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.189 
can check this way first thing you want
to<00:00:26.789> do<00:00:26.970> and<00:00:27.210> this<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.539> same<00:00:27.720> for<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.050> as<00:00:28.170> a

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
to do and this is the same for this as a

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.810 
to do and this is the same for this as a
rear-wheel<00:00:28.529> drive<00:00:28.560> same<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.400> rules<00:00:29.640> would

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
rear-wheel drive same the rules would

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.460 
rear-wheel drive same the rules would
apply<00:00:29.880> for<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.300> front-wheel<00:00:30.660> drive<00:00:30.689> want<00:00:31.410> to

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
apply for a front-wheel drive want to

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.709 
apply for a front-wheel drive want to
jack<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.710> up<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.130> we'll<00:00:33.030> start<00:00:33.120> with<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.480> so

for<00:00:49.110> an<00:00:49.320> accident<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.710> happen<00:00:49.879> essentially

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
for an accident to happen essentially

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.189 
for an accident to happen essentially
what<00:00:51.000> we<00:00:51.090> want<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.300> do<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.600> we<00:00:51.719> want<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.930> turn

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
what we want to do is we want to turn

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.010 
what we want to do is we want to turn
one<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.770> wheels<00:00:52.980> either<00:00:53.940> way<00:00:54.210> I'm<00:00:54.719> going

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
one of the wheels either way I'm going

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.459 
one of the wheels either way I'm going
to<00:00:55.110> turn<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.940> forward<00:00:56.940> as<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.539> car<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.780> going

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
to turn it forward as the car is going

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.529 
to turn it forward as the car is going
forward<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.100> other<00:00:59.940> wheel<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.359> going<00:01:00.480> to

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
forward and the other wheel is going to

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.389 
forward and the other wheel is going to
have<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.719> spend<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.989> other<00:01:01.170> way<00:01:01.379> if<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:02.190> did

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
have to spend the other way if it did

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.640 
have to spend the other way if it did
not<00:01:02.430> have<00:01:02.579> an<00:01:02.850> LSD<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.930> wheel<00:01:04.290> would<00:01:04.439> spin<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
not have an LSD the wheel would spin the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.960 
not have an LSD the wheel would spin the
opposite<00:01:05.100> way<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.309> I'm<00:01:05.549> going<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.729> go<00:01:05.790> on<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
opposite way so I'm going to go on the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.969 
opposite way so I'm going to go on the
other<00:01:06.060> side<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.510> car<00:01:06.720> I'm<00:01:07.380> going<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.650> turn

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
other side of the car I'm going to turn

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.560 
other side of the car I'm going to turn
the<00:01:08.070> wheel<00:01:08.189> forward<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:09.090> wheel<00:01:09.299> should

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
the wheel forward and this wheel should

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.170 
the wheel forward and this wheel should
go<00:01:09.750> forward<00:01:10.140> as<00:01:10.260> well<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:10.710> here<00:01:11.580> we<00:01:11.670> go<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:11.850> stay

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
go forward as well so here we go so stay

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:29.030 
go forward as well so here we go so stay
tuned<00:01:26.689> and<00:01:27.689> essentially<00:01:28.380> officers<00:01:28.799> turning

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
tuned and essentially officers turning

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.219 
tuned and essentially officers turning
me<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.490> other<00:01:29.640> wheel<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.720> same<00:01:30.930> exact

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
me the other wheel the the same exact

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:31.700 
me the other wheel the the same exact
way

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
way

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.310 
way
so<00:01:32.220> which<00:01:32.909> allowed<00:01:33.210> this<00:01:33.420> wheel<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.780> turn<00:01:34.049> that

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
so which allowed this wheel to turn that

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.950 
so which allowed this wheel to turn that
way<00:01:34.500> now<00:01:35.070> if<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.430> didn't<00:01:35.670> have<00:01:35.759> an<00:01:35.850> LSD<00:01:36.150> it

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
way now if it didn't have an LSD it

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.140 
way now if it didn't have an LSD it
would<00:01:37.200> again<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.310> would<00:01:38.430> spin<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.670> opposite

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
would again it would spin the opposite

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.770 
would again it would spin the opposite
way<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:40.400> bet<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.670> that's<00:01:42.210> pretty<00:01:42.360> much<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.540> in<00:01:42.750> a

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
way I bet so that's pretty much it in a

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.929 
way I bet so that's pretty much it in a
nutshell<00:01:42.810> just<00:01:43.409> two<00:01:43.649> real<00:01:44.460> quick<00:01:44.549> video<00:01:44.880> on
