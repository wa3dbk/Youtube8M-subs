00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 good prisoners welcome a new 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.040
 tutorial some of you had the 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.990
 opportunity to see the behind the scenes 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.429
 of how this tutorial says and for 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.929
 that have not seen it, I want to tell you 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.700
 that I was broadcasting live from 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.290
 you now so if they have no contention 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.030
 to popayÃ¡n and connect I made so that 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.410
 continue and to be aware of the 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.020
 live broadcasts deals with 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.119
 connect at least once or twice to the 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.740
 week in the 4 to 5 hours of the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.390
 late hour downtown Mexico is for 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.310
 be practicing with you and without more 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.609
 for the moment we start with this 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.609
 tutorial 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.620
 let's make two little balls one blue and one 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.780
 green let's take one and we're going to 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.640
 split in half this way to 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.379
 have two equal parts we also take 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.100
 the blue one and we also start it by the 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:49.780
 half and we're going to join one half of 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.449
 each color so that they have something like 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.280
 this now let's take a little bit of 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.829
 green color let's make a kind of 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.280
 rectangle or sausage rather and you 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.530
 let's place in this part 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.269
 now let's merge it with the rest of the 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.890
 body that we are creating 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.850
 with the help of our little fingers 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.860
 obviously 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.110
 since we have something like this 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.520
 now with a very very short pink we are going to 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.470
 make a strip and we're going to start 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.110
 half to create the legs 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.170
 we are also going to create two balls or two 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.300
 ovals of a blue color and a band-aid in 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.830
 blue color we're also going to take the 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:32.159
 shiver first and we're going to put you in 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:33.990
 bottom of the rose in this way 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.030
 and we repeat the procedure with the other 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.520
 leg and since we have two the same 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.429
 now let's take one of the ovals and 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.100
 we will place it in the bottom 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:46.369
 in this way 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.320
 and we 're going to merge it with the rest of the 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.939
 leg and it makes you look a little 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.549
 long but now we are going to cut it 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:55.070
 since we have the two dogs equal 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:58.270
 now we are going to cut them because then 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.270
 they are very long obviously 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.030
 now let's take the other blue color and 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.810
 let's put it on top 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.810
 of the little leg 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.140
 and we repeat the procedure with the other 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:21.450
 leg now we're just going to 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.450
 place in this way 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.540
 and we will melt it with the rest of the sun 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.190
 since they have something like this we are going to 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.740
 take again short pink 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.450
 let's do an oval like this and 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.450
 let's cut down the middle 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.900
 and we 're going to put it this way 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.640
 Now we are going to create little balls in 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.710
 pink color too and we're going to put them 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.840
 one on each side with this one we're going to 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.700
 create the cachitos 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.489
 because then this character is fine that 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.319
 titon as well as me 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.740
 we were going to melt only the part 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:05.060
 exterior of the cheeks 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.060
 in this way 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.069
 since they have something like that we are going to mark you 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:12.069
 the smile 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.080
 and we're going to take some of the 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.370
 clay 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.370
 to create an egg 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.670
 and now let's take a pink color 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.180
 let's create a little ball and we're going to 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.180
 put like this 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.420
 and we are going to add a small ball 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.950
 on one side and another on the other side in the 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.690
 top to put teeth 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.020
 Now let's create the holes for 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.570
 the eyes 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.800
 let's put a white ball in 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.960
 each 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.440
 and then a little black dot in 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.440
 each 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.020
 we lack the nose to create the lips 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.920
 let's make a nice chubby droplet and 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.920
 we are going to place it 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.890
 that is a little raised and we are going to 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.890
 take two lines at the bottom 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.419
 now let's take the coffee color 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.320
 clarito and we're going to crush him and we're going 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.320
 to put on the head 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.889
 Now we are going to create many little balls 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.460
 little girls and we are going to put around 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.460
 of his head 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.930
 we melted it with the rest of the hair since 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.030
 have something like it is let's cut two 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.510
 Band-aids to create in the arms 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.970
 and let's get a little bit of the tip 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:47.570
 crushing it in this way to create 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.570
 the little hand 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.210
 and with the help of some scissors we are going to 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.210
 cut his fingers 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:04.639
 and we add a piece of plasticine 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.650
 more to create your thumb 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.330
 now with purple plasticine we are going to 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:13.449
 place it on top of the 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.449
 little arm to create the sleeve of your flyer 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.449
 this way we already have a little arm and 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.920
 finished we repeat the procedure and 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:23.580
 we created the two 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:25.590
 now all that's left is to put the 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.310
 and there I can put the position that 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.310
 you want 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:37.310
 and that's it, and that's how we're left 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.290
 clearly finished I hope that I have 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.330
 I really liked this video and I remember them 

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:42.680
