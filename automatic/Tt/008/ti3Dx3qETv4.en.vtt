because of it um when I was in high

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.330 
because of it um when I was in high
school<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.670> didn't<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.720> much<00:01:54.750> get<00:01:55.259> picked<00:01:56.100> on

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
school I didn't so much get picked on

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.050 
school I didn't so much get picked on
and<00:01:57.000> was<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.659> really<00:01:57.990> small<00:01:58.290> town<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:59.060> don't

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
he's waiting he participates too much

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.190 
he's waiting he participates too much
but<00:03:10.650> we<00:03:10.770> had<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.010> we<00:03:11.280> had<00:03:11.459> our<00:03:11.840> first<00:03:12.840> date<00:03:13.050> at

the movies after we connected on
Friendster<00:03:16.769> after<00:03:17.760> graduation<00:03:18.739> so<00:03:20.269> you<00:03:21.269> know

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930

so I thought it was worth another try I
had<00:03:30.930> this<00:03:31.290> hat<00:03:31.620> that<00:03:31.830> I<00:03:31.920> really<00:03:32.160> liked<00:03:32.400> it<00:03:32.760> was
