00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
bottom when the bikes are in the cradles

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.680 
bottom when the bikes are in the cradles
the<00:00:31.890> weight<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.250> pushed<00:00:32.579> down<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.360> actually

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
the weight is pushed down and actually

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.549

push<00:00:33.899> down<00:00:34.140> on<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.980> legs<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.450> stand<00:00:36.719> which

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
push down on the legs of the stand which

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.560 
push down on the legs of the stand which
actually<00:00:37.980> makes<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.370> stand<00:00:38.640> hug<00:00:39.030> against<00:00:39.510> the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
actually makes the stand hug against the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.290 
actually makes the stand hug against the
wall<00:00:40.280> which<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.309> pretty<00:00:41.700> nice<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.149> don't

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
wall which is pretty nice so you don't

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.389 
wall which is pretty nice so you don't
have<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.510> put<00:00:42.660> any<00:00:42.780> holes<00:00:42.989> or<00:00:43.379> any<00:00:43.950> drilling<00:00:44.309> or

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
have to put any holes or any drilling or

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.740 
have to put any holes or any drilling or
anything<00:00:44.520> like<00:00:44.700> that<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:45.120> secure<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.719> your

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
anything like that to secure it to your

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.410 
anything like that to secure it to your
wall<00:00:46.340> but<00:00:47.340> if<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.550> would<00:00:47.670> like<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.000> install<00:00:48.239> it

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
wall but if you would like to install it

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.970 
wall but if you would like to install it
on<00:00:48.480> your<00:00:48.690> wall<00:00:48.870> there<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.170> hardware<00:00:49.739> kit

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
on your wall there is a hardware kit

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.150 
on your wall there is a hardware kit
that<00:00:50.129> comes<00:00:50.309> with<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.000> how<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:52.020> works<00:00:52.350> is

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
that comes with it and how this works is

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.029 
that comes with it and how this works is
that<00:00:53.219> these<00:00:53.520> actually<00:00:53.850> go<00:00:54.239> around<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:55.199> rail

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
that these actually go around the rail

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.479 
that these actually go around the rail
up<00:00:56.430> at<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.820> top<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.390> bike<00:00:57.570> stand<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.489> so

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
up at the top of the bike stand and so

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.680 
up at the top of the bike stand and so
the<00:00:59.609> rail<00:00:59.760> will<00:00:59.940> go<00:01:00.030> through<00:01:00.300> here<00:01:00.539> you'll

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
the rail will go through here you'll

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.750 
the rail will go through here you'll
pinch<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.020> together<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:02.280> will<00:01:02.430> go<00:01:02.579> into

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
pinch that together this will go into

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.969 
pinch that together this will go into
your<00:01:02.940> drywall<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:04.140> screw<00:01:04.409> will<00:01:04.589> go<00:01:04.710> through

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
your drywall the screw will go through

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.210 
your drywall the screw will go through
here<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.220> basically<00:01:05.729> give<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.030> more<00:01:06.330> fixed

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:07.220 
here and basically give you a more fixed

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.270 
here and basically give you a more fixed
bike<00:01:08.220> stand<00:01:08.720> so<00:01:09.720> again<00:01:10.140> what<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.770> would<00:01:10.890> do<00:01:11.040> is

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
bike stand so again what you would do is

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.280 
bike stand so again what you would do is
basically<00:01:11.490> just<00:01:11.939> kind<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.479> pry<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.720> open<00:01:12.930> and

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
basically just kind of pry it open and

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.190 
basically just kind of pry it open and
get<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.830> around<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.250> bar<00:01:17.570> and<00:01:18.570> you'll<00:01:18.720> go<00:01:18.930> back

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
get it around the bar and you'll go back

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.490 
get it around the bar and you'll go back
up<00:01:19.439> towards<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.920> top<00:01:20.159> like<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:21.350> so<00:01:22.350> then

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
up towards the top like that so then

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.870 
up towards the top like that so then
this<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:22.740> what<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.130> would<00:01:23.220> go<00:01:23.400> actually

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
this is what you would go actually

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.670 
this is what you would go actually
through<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.270> drywall<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:25.140> then<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.530> would

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
through the drywall and then you would

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.380 
through the drywall and then you would
take<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.070> screw<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.700> go<00:01:26.790> through<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.180> holes

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
take this screw to go through the holes

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.499 
take this screw to go through the holes
and<00:01:27.659> actually<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:29.090> plastic<00:01:30.090> piece<00:01:30.270> is

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
and actually this plastic piece is

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.590 
and actually this plastic piece is
what's<00:01:30.900> going<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.200> actually<00:01:31.259> anchor<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.340> into

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
what's going to actually anchor it into

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.899 
what's going to actually anchor it into
you<00:01:33.600> know<00:01:33.720> your<00:01:33.900> drywall<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:35.130> again<00:01:35.430> another

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
you know your drywall so again another

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.399 
you know your drywall so again another
cool<00:01:36.210> option<00:01:36.600> if<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.810> decided<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.229> you

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
cool option if you decided that you

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.760 
cool option if you decided that you
wanted<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.740> make<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.250> fixed<00:01:38.909> stand<00:01:39.270> and

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
wanted to make it a fixed stand and

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.050 
wanted to make it a fixed stand and
instead<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.310> know<00:01:41.400> having<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.700> ability

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
instead of you know having the ability

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.840 
instead of you know having the ability
to<00:01:42.090> move<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.420> around<00:01:43.130> now<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.189> cradle<00:01:44.549> arms<00:01:44.610> of

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
to move it around now the cradle arms of

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:45.889 
to move it around now the cradle arms of
this<00:01:44.939> bike<00:01:45.149> staying<00:01:45.390> are<00:01:45.509> pretty<00:01:45.720> neat

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
this bike staying are pretty neat

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.960 
this bike staying are pretty neat
they're<00:01:46.350> easily<00:01:46.770> adjustable<00:01:47.250> by<00:01:47.490> just<00:01:47.729> simply

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
they're easily adjustable by just simply

another<00:02:21.240> neat<00:02:21.510> thing<00:02:21.720> about<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:22.140> cradle<00:02:22.590> arms

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
another neat thing about the cradle arms

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.860 
another neat thing about the cradle arms
being<00:02:23.160> able<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.460> adjust<00:02:23.850> independently<00:02:24.690> is

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
being able to adjust independently is

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.020 
being able to adjust independently is
that<00:02:25.410> again<00:02:25.800> just<00:02:26.250> gives<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:26.520> another<00:02:26.760> way<00:02:26.970> to

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
that again just gives you another way to

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.810 
that again just gives you another way to
accommodate<00:02:27.450> those<00:02:27.780> varying<00:02:28.470> bike<00:02:28.680> styles<00:02:29.190> so

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
accommodate those varying bike styles so

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.610 
accommodate those varying bike styles so
for<00:02:30.030> example<00:02:30.450> if<00:02:30.570> if<00:02:30.780> your<00:02:31.020> bike<00:02:31.230> frame<00:02:31.440> maybe

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
for example if if your bike frame maybe

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.950 
for example if if your bike frame maybe
has<00:02:31.800> a<00:02:31.830> slanted<00:02:32.430> top<00:02:32.670> tube<00:02:32.970> you<00:02:33.390> can<00:02:33.420> adjust

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
has a slanted top tube you can adjust

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.920 
has a slanted top tube you can adjust
these<00:02:34.110> cradles<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:35.130> basically<00:02:35.820> make<00:02:36.210> your<00:02:36.630> two

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
these cradles to basically make your two

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.470 
these cradles to basically make your two
tires<00:02:37.290> level<00:02:38.040> so<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.460> way<00:02:38.820> if<00:02:39.120> you're

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
tires level so that way if you're

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.150 
tires level so that way if you're
loading<00:02:39.840> maybe<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.350> bike<00:02:40.500> with<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.710> slanted

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
loading maybe the bike with a slanted

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.460 
loading maybe the bike with a slanted
tube<00:02:41.340> on<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.790> top<00:02:42.000> set<00:02:42.270> of<00:02:42.360> bars<00:02:42.570> or<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.200> top

that<00:02:45.300> both<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.570> your<00:02:45.780> tires<00:02:46.050> are<00:02:46.320> level<00:02:46.680> so

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
that both of your tires are level so

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.650 
that both of your tires are level so
that<00:02:47.220> way<00:02:47.340> they're<00:02:47.550> not<00:02:47.580> resting<00:02:48.180> on<00:02:48.270> the<00:02:48.420> seed

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
that way they're not resting on the seed

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.660
