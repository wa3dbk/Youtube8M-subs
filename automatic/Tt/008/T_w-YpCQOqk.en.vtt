00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
I have to say that this engine which is

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.800 
I have to say that this engine which is
at<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.730> heart<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.060> matter<00:00:21.240> here<00:00:21.510> liquid

is<00:00:25.439> using<00:00:25.830> 3<00:00:26.160> spark<00:00:26.490> plugs<00:00:26.760> which<00:00:27.029> seems<00:00:27.930> a<00:00:28.080> bit

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
is using 3 spark plugs which seems a bit

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.380 
is using 3 spark plugs which seems a bit
much<00:00:28.500> maybe<00:00:28.830> but<00:00:29.160> it's<00:00:29.730> performing<00:00:30.240> really

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
much maybe but it's performing really

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.550 
much maybe but it's performing really
well<00:00:30.510> out<00:00:30.660> on<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.019> track
