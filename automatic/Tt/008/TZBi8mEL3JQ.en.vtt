00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
trading system just because I think it'd

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.130

be<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.990> lot<00:01:34.350> more<00:01:34.549> like<00:01:35.549> better<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.600> think<00:01:37.049> would

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
be a lot more like better I think would

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.359 
be a lot more like better I think would
be<00:01:37.350> better<00:01:37.530> i<00:01:37.679> don't<00:01:37.890> really<00:01:38.009> know<00:01:38.130> how<00:01:38.280> to

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
be better i don't really know how to

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.590 
be better i don't really know how to
explain<00:01:38.490> i<00:01:38.819> think<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.149> would<00:01:39.210> be<00:01:39.270> much<00:01:39.539> better

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
explain i think it would be much better

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.510 
explain i think it would be much better
because<00:01:40.049> like<00:01:40.289> one<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:40.920> my<00:01:41.069> friends<00:01:41.429> actually

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
because like one of my friends actually

have to get 100 head shots like I said
we<00:02:39.600> would<00:02:39.720> have<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.900> get<00:02:40.020> 10<00:02:40.260> double<00:02:40.530> kills

something<00:02:41.070> like<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.490> I<00:02:41.520> think<00:02:41.730> they're

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
something like that I think they're

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.030

definitely<00:02:42.180> have<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.570> kind<00:02:42.959> of<00:02:43.110> thing<00:02:43.860> of

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
definitely have that kind of thing of

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.340 
definitely have that kind of thing of
anything<00:02:44.430> but<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:45.570> trading<00:02:45.840> system<00:02:46.200> might

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
just be a little bit harder because I

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.220 
just be a little bit harder because I
feel<00:02:47.760> like<00:02:47.790> people<00:02:48.000> are<00:02:48.090> going<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.300> hack<00:02:48.510> or

that pissed me off if I was that like
900<00:04:22.500> head<00:04:22.560> shots<00:04:22.800> out<00:04:22.979> of<00:04:23.070> a<00:04:23.160> thousand<00:04:23.580> and<00:04:23.640> get

900 head shots out of a thousand and get

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:26.360 
900 head shots out of a thousand and get
the<00:04:23.880> speakeasy<00:04:24.270> and<00:04:25.140> all<00:04:25.320> of<00:04:25.410> a<00:04:25.470> sudden<00:04:25.500> I<00:04:25.979> get

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
the speakeasy and all of a sudden I get

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:28.129 
the speakeasy and all of a sudden I get
it<00:04:26.640> out<00:04:26.760> of<00:04:26.789> that<00:04:26.910> package<00:04:27.180> I<00:04:27.479> would<00:04:27.599> be<00:04:27.690> like

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 
it out of that package I would be like

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:29.450 
it out of that package I would be like
god<00:04:28.349> I<00:04:28.379> just<00:04:28.469> worked<00:04:28.710> all<00:04:28.889> that<00:04:29.009> time<00:04:29.219> for<00:04:29.370> no

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
god I just worked all that time for no

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.100 
god I just worked all that time for no
reason<00:04:29.699> so<00:04:29.879> they're<00:04:30.479> gonna<00:04:30.599> have<00:04:30.719> to<00:04:30.749> work<00:04:30.960> out

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
reason so they're gonna have to work out

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.270 
reason so they're gonna have to work out
something<00:04:31.259> like<00:04:31.379> that<00:04:31.590> that's<00:04:31.770> why<00:04:31.949> I<00:04:31.979> think

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
something like that that's why I think

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.760 
something like that that's why I think
the<00:04:32.370> trading<00:04:32.669> system<00:04:32.999> would<00:04:33.150> be<00:04:33.330> better<00:04:33.770> but

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
the trading system would be better but

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.529 
the trading system would be better but
the<00:04:35.340> trains<00:04:35.580> are<00:04:35.699> also<00:04:35.939> going<00:04:36.120> to<00:04:36.180> be<00:04:36.300> hard

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
the trains are also going to be hard

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:39.559 
the trains are also going to be hard
just<00:04:36.719> because<00:04:37.460> like<00:04:38.460> people<00:04:39.240> are<00:04:39.330> going<00:04:39.419> to<00:04:39.509> be

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:39.569 
just because like people are going to be

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:41.059 
just because like people are going to be
spamming<00:04:39.900> I<00:04:40.229> feel<00:04:40.379> like<00:04:40.439> there's<00:04:40.620> any<00:04:40.830> spam

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:41.069

pretty sure you can buy like major God

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:47.689 
pretty sure you can buy like major God
accounts<00:04:46.800> where<00:04:46.919> another<00:04:47.159> college<00:04:47.520> and

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
accounts where another college and

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.040

they're<00:04:48.120> gonna<00:04:48.180> have<00:04:48.419> all<00:04:48.539> the<00:04:48.659> stuff<00:04:48.840> so

they're gonna have all the stuff so

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.999 
they're gonna have all the stuff so
there's<00:04:49.229> going<00:04:49.379> to<00:04:49.439> be<00:04:49.469> trading<00:04:49.800> them<00:04:49.889> and

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009 
there's going to be trading them and

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:51.559 
there's going to be trading them and
making<00:04:50.129> people<00:04:50.340> paying<00:04:50.639> real<00:04:50.969> money<00:04:50.999> which<00:04:51.389> i

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:51.569 
making people paying real money which i

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:52.820 
making people paying real money which i
think<00:04:51.870> is<00:04:51.990> just<00:04:52.080> going<00:04:52.259> to<00:04:52.319> ruin<00:04:52.469> the<00:04:52.650> cod

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
think is just going to ruin the cod

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.279 
think is just going to ruin the cod
community<00:04:53.099> more<00:04:53.759> than<00:04:53.969> it's<00:04:54.120> already<00:04:54.270> hurt<00:04:54.629> so

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
community more than it's already hurt so

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:56.689 
community more than it's already hurt so
I<00:04:55.319> don't<00:04:55.590> know<00:04:55.710> what<00:04:55.949> they're<00:04:56.099> definitely<00:04:56.279> do

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:57.920 
I don't know what they're definitely do

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
or if they even going to do this but

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.360 
or if they even going to do this but
hopefully<00:04:58.259> they<00:04:58.409> will<00:04:58.590> and<00:04:58.889> they'll<00:04:59.129> make<00:04:59.249> it

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
hopefully they will and they'll make it

pretty good you guys but as of this
weekend<00:05:01.500> i<00:05:01.590> recommend<00:05:01.979> just<00:05:02.219> grind<00:05:02.669> it<00:05:02.819> out

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:02.909 
weekend i recommend just grind it out

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:04.429 
weekend i recommend just grind it out
and<00:05:02.969> try<00:05:03.150> to<00:05:03.180> get<00:05:03.389> as<00:05:03.449> many<00:05:03.569> packages<00:05:04.080> you<00:05:04.409> can

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:04.439 
and try to get as many packages you can

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:06.260 
and try to get as many packages you can
try<00:05:05.009> to<00:05:05.069> get<00:05:05.219> as<00:05:05.310> many<00:05:05.430> elite<00:05:05.759> weapons<00:05:06.090> and

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
try to get as many elite weapons and

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.399 
try to get as many elite weapons and
professional<00:05:06.719> weapons<00:05:06.960> and<00:05:07.080> stuff<00:05:07.199> like<00:05:07.349> that

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:07.409 
professional weapons and stuff like that

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:09.589 
professional weapons and stuff like that
just<00:05:07.800> because<00:05:08.279> it's<00:05:08.400> double<00:05:08.639> XP<00:05:08.699> and<00:05:09.300> you<00:05:09.449> get

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599 
just because it's double XP and you get

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:11.719 
just because it's double XP and you get
more<00:05:09.900> packages<00:05:10.439> i'm<00:05:10.590> guessing<00:05:11.069> when<00:05:11.610> it's

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729 
more packages i'm guessing when it's

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:13.939 
more packages i'm guessing when it's
double<00:05:11.879> XP<00:05:11.909> so<00:05:12.750> i<00:05:12.779> recommend<00:05:13.139> just<00:05:13.409> trying<00:05:13.800> to

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
double XP so i recommend just trying to

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:16.070 
double XP so i recommend just trying to
get<00:05:14.099> those<00:05:14.250> elite<00:05:14.580> weapons<00:05:14.969> and<00:05:15.270> stuff<00:05:15.840> and

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
get those elite weapons and stuff and

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.869 
get those elite weapons and stuff and
even<00:05:16.800> if<00:05:16.860> you<00:05:16.949> don't<00:05:17.159> want<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:17.430> only<00:05:17.580> weapons

00:05:17.869 --> 00:05:17.879 
even if you don't want the only weapons

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:19.790 
even if you don't want the only weapons
do<00:05:18.029> not<00:05:18.060> sell<00:05:18.629> them<00:05:18.810> because<00:05:19.139> of<00:05:19.319> the<00:05:19.469> trading

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
do not sell them because of the trading

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.070 
do not sell them because of the trading
system<00:05:20.129> happens<00:05:20.550> to<00:05:20.849> come<00:05:21.089> out<00:05:21.270> soon<00:05:21.990> enough

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
system happens to come out soon enough

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.929 
system happens to come out soon enough
you<00:05:22.800> will<00:05:22.830> be<00:05:23.009> able<00:05:23.069> to<00:05:23.159> trade<00:05:23.400> those<00:05:23.550> elite

00:05:23.929 --> 00:05:23.939 
you will be able to trade those elite

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:25.219 
you will be able to trade those elite
weapons<00:05:24.210> that<00:05:24.330> you<00:05:24.449> do<00:05:24.599> not<00:05:24.750> want<00:05:25.050> and
