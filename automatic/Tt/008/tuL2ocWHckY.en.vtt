transmitter from Nerys now the way this

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.509 
transmitter from Nerys now the way this
is<00:00:07.259> set<00:00:07.440> up<00:00:07.470> to<00:00:07.740> work<00:00:07.890> is<00:00:08.189> you're<00:00:08.370> going<00:00:08.460> to

then this end plugs into your TV and

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.640 
then this end plugs into your TV and
therefore<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:15.509> could<00:00:15.660> transmit<00:00:16.049> wirelessly

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
therefore you could transmit wirelessly

coming out there that do some more
things<00:00:23.850> but<00:00:24.090> I've<00:00:24.240> used<00:00:24.660> Nereus<00:00:25.019> for<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.199> while

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
things but I've used Nereus for a while

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.769 
things but I've used Nereus for a while
and<00:00:25.560> I'm<00:00:25.680> finding<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.460> works<00:00:26.880> pretty

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
and I'm finding that it works pretty

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.269 
and I'm finding that it works pretty
well<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.230> they've<00:00:28.410> got<00:00:28.560> a<00:00:28.590> lot<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:28.800> these<00:00:28.920> bugs

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
well and they've got a lot of these bugs

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.510 
well and they've got a lot of these bugs
already<00:00:29.640> worked<00:00:29.849> out<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:30.900> supports<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.710> 3d

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
already worked out so this supports a 3d

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.630 
already worked out so this supports a 3d
and<00:00:32.759> full<00:00:33.690> 1080p<00:00:34.410> high<00:00:34.860> definition<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.550> this

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
and full 1080p high definition so this

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.760 
and full 1080p high definition so this
is<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.850> setup<00:00:36.809> that<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.079> can<00:00:37.290> actually<00:00:37.410> use<00:00:37.739> a

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
is a setup that you can actually use a

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.630 
is a setup that you can actually use a
3d<00:00:38.160> televisions<00:00:38.899> so<00:00:40.160> again<00:00:41.160> how<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.520> is

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
3d televisions so again how it is

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.860 
3d televisions so again how it is
supposed<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:41.969> work<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.300> you're<00:00:42.510> going<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.690> set

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
supposed to work is you're going to set

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.900 
supposed to work is you're going to set
this<00:00:42.989> into<00:00:43.290> your<00:00:43.410> laptop<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.700> comes<00:00:44.850> with

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
this into your laptop and it comes with

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.389 
this into your laptop and it comes with
this<00:00:45.090> actually<00:00:45.390> pretty<00:00:45.600> handy<00:00:45.750> little<00:00:46.399> HDMI

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
this actually pretty handy little HDMI

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.000 
this actually pretty handy little HDMI
elbow<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.539> can<00:00:48.660> put<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.710> do<00:00:49.860> have

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
elbow so you can put it in you do have

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.430 
elbow so you can put it in you do have
to<00:00:50.160> supply<00:00:50.430> power<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.090> then<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.230> would

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
to supply power and then this would

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.770 
to supply power and then this would
transmit<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.550> this<00:00:53.699> box<00:00:54.000> right<00:00:54.270> here<00:00:54.570> that

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
transmit to this box right here that

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.880 
transmit to this box right here that
will<00:00:55.469> be<00:00:55.620> mounted<00:00:55.829> behind<00:00:56.430> your<00:00:57.239> TV

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
will be mounted behind your TV

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.689 
will be mounted behind your TV
potentially<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.070> wall<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.520> is

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
potentially on the wall so it is

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.069 
potentially on the wall so it is
designed<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.149> mount<00:01:00.270> on<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.629> wall<00:01:00.660> if<00:01:00.899> you'd

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
designed to mount on the wall if you'd

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.640 
designed to mount on the wall if you'd
like<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.910> then<00:01:02.910> this<00:01:03.030> will<00:01:03.210> actually

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
like and then this will actually

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.539 
like and then this will actually
transmit<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.710> signal<00:01:05.010> back<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.189> your<00:01:05.400> TV

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
included you can put into your iPad

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.340 
included you can put into your iPad
again<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.070> 30<00:01:47.310> pin<00:01:47.520> adapter<00:01:48.229> so<00:01:49.229> we'll

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
again this is a 30 pin adapter so we'll

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.710 
again this is a 30 pin adapter so we'll
put<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.590> in<00:01:50.810> like<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:53.360> try<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.420> put<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.659> in

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
put it in like so try to put it in

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.540 
put it in like so try to put it in
upside<00:01:54.869> down<00:01:56.509> there<00:01:57.509> we<00:01:57.600> go

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
upside down there we go

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.410 
upside down there we go
then<00:01:59.030> we<00:01:59.120> can<00:01:59.270> put<00:01:59.480> the<00:02:01.660> Aries<00:02:02.660> Prime<00:02:02.990> into<00:02:03.350> it

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
then we can put the Aries Prime into it

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.730 
then we can put the Aries Prime into it
like<00:02:06.580> so<00:02:07.580> now<00:02:07.790> you<00:02:07.850> can<00:02:08.060> use<00:02:08.180> the<00:02:08.300> elbow<00:02:08.630> or<00:02:09.530> you

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
like so now you can use the elbow or you

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.800 
like so now you can use the elbow or you
can<00:02:09.860> use<00:02:09.950> the<00:02:10.040> directing<00:02:10.630> probably<00:02:11.630> actually

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
can use the directing probably actually

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.210 
can use the directing probably actually
works<00:02:12.110> best<00:02:12.350> if<00:02:12.530> we<00:02:12.620> just<00:02:12.650> go<00:02:12.830> ahead<00:02:12.920> and<00:02:13.070> put

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
works best if we just go ahead and put

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.830 
works best if we just go ahead and put
in<00:02:13.310> directly<00:02:14.080> all<00:02:15.080> right<00:02:15.260> that<00:02:15.800> and<00:02:16.790> so<00:02:17.720> now

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
in directly all right that and so now

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.260 
in directly all right that and so now
you've<00:02:18.050> got<00:02:18.380> it

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
you've got it

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.640 
you've got it
so<00:02:20.270> you<00:02:20.330> are<00:02:20.660> able<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:21.020> transmit<00:02:21.380> but<00:02:21.560> you

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
so you are able to transmit but you

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.680 
so you are able to transmit but you
still<00:02:21.860> need<00:02:21.980> power<00:02:22.250> I'm<00:02:23.120> going<00:02:23.210> to<00:02:23.360> solve<00:02:23.540> that

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
still need power I'm going to solve that

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.450 
still need power I'm going to solve that
by<00:02:23.870> using<00:02:24.110> this<00:02:24.290> little<00:02:24.380> external<00:02:24.890> hard<00:02:25.250> drive

television okay so here's the narrowest
of<00:03:10.520> ice<00:03:11.230> I'm<00:03:12.230> going<00:03:12.380> to<00:03:12.440> put<00:03:12.530> it<00:03:12.590> on<00:03:12.680> top<00:03:12.830> of<00:03:12.950> an

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
of ice I'm going to put it on top of an

of ice I'm going to put it on top of an
Apple<00:03:13.280> TV<00:03:13.430> and<00:03:14.120> then<00:03:14.510> it<00:03:14.660> just<00:03:14.840> connects

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
Apple TV and then it just connects

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.010 
Apple TV and then it just connects
directly<00:03:15.380> into<00:03:15.980> my<00:03:16.160> HDMI<00:03:16.910> input<00:03:17.540> onto<00:03:17.840> my

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
directly into my HDMI input onto my

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.900 
directly into my HDMI input onto my
