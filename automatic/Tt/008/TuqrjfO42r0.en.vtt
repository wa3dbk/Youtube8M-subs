00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.710
 Hi guys how are you? I came here to bring a 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.839
 Tip for you quickly and how to clean 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.970
 deodorized a microwave knows when 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.730
 microwave is very dirty so why? 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.980
 Someone warmed up and forgot to 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.510
 place on top of the food a 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.359
 paper towels or paper towels 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.210
 if there is that explosion there the food 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:37.370
 It's not going all the way to the microwave walls. 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:42.000
 so it stays inside the paper is the sheet 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:44.969
 so the tip is you will put in a 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.930
 glass container a glass of vinegar 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.629
 white and two glasses of water will 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.030
 micro waves for five minutes in the 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.850
 maximum power 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.530
 It's been 15 minutes now. 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.730
 A little is coming out and I'm open to 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.500
 show you guys but you do not need 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.750
 nor open what you're going to do later 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.470
 that if you spend the five minutes you will 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.740
 leave in there closed microwave for 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:13.320
 plus 5 minutes now microwave 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.189
 off and the steam working there for 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.920
 five minutes 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.979
 Ok kisses and spend the five minutes. 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:24.000
 of resting here that coercing apophis 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:29.369
 You're going to take it carefully, that's fine. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.009
 warm and you will see with a 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.250
 will clean now with microwave or you 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:39.090
 you can also use some sheets of paper 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.850
 towel and loose people all very much 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:48.180
 all the food that was 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:52.079
 black given by the crust looks the only you 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:56.040
 Turns to 5 the cloth or paper towel and 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:59.369
 everything comes out easily and the smell goes 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.149
 although also at the end of the day 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.149
 food in the microwave 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.530
 it goes away 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.470
 This is great to do when you do type 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.569
 bacon things that have super strong smell 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.240
 and then the microwave stays with that 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.270
 smell 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.490
 do so only to devalue 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.320
 So that was the tip if you liked it.
