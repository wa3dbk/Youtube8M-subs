let's just put it down like so okay so
then<00:01:04.739> we<00:01:04.890> basically<00:01:05.759> want<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.090> make<00:01:06.240> like<00:01:06.450> a

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
then we basically want to make like a

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.760 
then we basically want to make like a
platform<00:01:07.170> here<00:01:07.470> as<00:01:07.649> if<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:08.070> was<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.280> road<00:01:08.909> so

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
platform here as if it was a road so

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.580 
platform here as if it was a road so
here<00:01:10.770> we<00:01:10.890> have<00:01:10.920> our<00:01:11.100> little<00:01:11.430> platform<00:01:12.350> we<00:01:13.350> go

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
here we have our little platform we go

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.090 
here we have our little platform we go
back<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.799> check<00:01:14.280> points<00:01:14.700> here<00:01:14.940> and<00:01:15.830> we<00:01:16.830> want<00:01:17.009> to

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
back to check points here and we want to

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.520 
back to check points here and we want to
kind<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.430> mess<00:01:17.610> with<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.810> get<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.200> show

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
kind of mess with it to get it to show

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.289 
kind of mess with it to get it to show
up<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.770> purple<00:01:20.070> color<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.789> we<00:01:20.970> have<00:01:21.090> at

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
up this purple color and we have at

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.639 
up this purple color and we have at
least<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.810> bike<00:01:22.049> or<00:01:22.320> two<00:01:23.960> that<00:01:24.960> can<00:01:25.170> be<00:01:25.289> able<00:01:25.560> to

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
least a bike or two that can be able to

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.630 
least a bike or two that can be able to
spawn<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:26.190> there<00:01:26.750> and<00:01:27.750> once<00:01:28.110> we<00:01:28.229> get<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.740> like

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
spawn in there and once we get that like

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.639 
spawn in there and once we get that like
that<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.179> just<00:01:30.330> place<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.630> checkpoint<00:01:31.170> down

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
that you just place that checkpoint down

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.700 
that you just place that checkpoint down
so<00:01:32.460> there's<00:01:32.640> our<00:01:32.789> checkpoint<00:01:33.590> next<00:01:34.590> we're

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
so there's our checkpoint next we're

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.300 
so there's our checkpoint next we're
going<00:01:34.800> to<00:01:34.860> go<00:01:34.979> back<00:01:35.190> to<00:01:35.220> props

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.319

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
going and just delete these ramps up our

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.480 
going and just delete these ramps up our
