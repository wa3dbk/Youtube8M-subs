 hello everyone with you mikhail mowers and this 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:11.280
 regular review on exclusive games on 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.000
 theaters coming to an end showing 7 movies 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.799
 about the fast and the furious 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.500
 I went to him got my portion 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.270
 nostalgia and disappointment and now 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.520
 ready to talk about the presentation of this 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.800
 movie in the famous forza series only 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.840
 On the x-box one in general, I first see 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.180
 similar advertising solution of course me 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.490
 very interested in this topic so 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.859
 more from the company turn 10 and even more 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.469
 completely free and at the time of revizor 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:41.160
 and so what is forza horizon present 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:43.829
 of facts uses and this is nothing more than 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.789
 common trick demo recent 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.219
 horizon 2 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.350
 the very beginning you are shown supplemented 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.750
 trailer of the famous movie Fast and the Furious 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.149
 and after the outset they throw in the most powerful charger 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.610
 diesel wines and begin to explain some 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.559
 snowstorm about what you have chosen drove and 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.539
 you have to win 10 points for 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.609
 some unknown guy want 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.480
 note that the whole plot or like this 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.309
 generally can be called 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.890
 the meaning of the game is not supported in any way 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.260
 cutscenes do not appear and the main character 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.049
 from an afterburner here except those 10 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.030
 machines to win them you need 10 times 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.759
 win special races they are all 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.680
 appeared before rally street racing and 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.259
 a couple of demonstration type competitions 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.930
 catch up the helicopter break 100 banners and 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.009
 This end of the presentation as I said 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.960
 just deme 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.200
 these 10 cars you just can not 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.600
 tune world map stripped no 4 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.700
 or more plots stopping outside you 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.829
 just unwind back there 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.409
 just two radio stations soundtracks with 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.570
 movie subway which appeared for the first time in 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.119
 forza series are used by the way like that 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.610
 not very much like a shake 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.220
 cameras turn on and available but only in 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.380
 time racing but there are very simple 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.200
 Achievements that can literally knock out 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.930
 in an hour so if you are lungs seekers g 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.119
 the incident is such a fast sleplena I 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.250
 the game maybe you wonder why 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.409
 the turn companies simply did not do special 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.540
 dil se to the film so they did 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.789
 declare to shop x risen package machines 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.580
 absolutely free truth not herbs 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.010
 main game 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.840
 no added haze in general now paid 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.730
 I urge you to think a hundred times before 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.130
 what is the story at an attractive price 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.440
 This is not a full-fledged forza all pass 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.270
 competition for half an hour after which 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.790
 you can replay them again and again 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.800
 but don't get any more foreshadowing 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.990
 that microsoft surely shove this 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.180
 magnificent stub in free games 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.240
 for gold users though of course 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:38.340
 do not look a gift horse in the mouth 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.340
 all thanks for watching see you soon
