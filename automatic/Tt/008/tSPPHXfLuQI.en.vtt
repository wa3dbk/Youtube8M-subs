the<00:02:52.710> squad<00:02:52.980> well<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.430> think<00:02:53.550> that's<00:02:53.820> for<00:02:54.030> our

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
the squad well I think that's for our

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.960 
the squad well I think that's for our
something<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.660> decide<00:02:54.990> but<00:02:55.250> personally<00:02:56.250> if<00:02:56.370> he

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
something to decide but personally if he

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.690 
something to decide but personally if he
doesn't<00:02:57.300> sign<00:02:57.450> anyone<00:02:57.810> I<00:02:58.020> think<00:02:58.290> as<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:59.550> old

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
doesn't sign anyone I think as the old

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.400 
doesn't sign anyone I think as the old
saying<00:03:00.000> goes<00:03:00.240> if<00:03:00.570> it's<00:03:00.720> not<00:03:00.900> broke<00:03:01.140> don't<00:03:01.170> fix

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
saying goes if it's not broke don't fix

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.910 
saying goes if it's not broke don't fix
it<00:03:01.740> and<00:03:01.890> at<00:03:02.220> the<00:03:02.280> moment<00:03:02.460> nothing's<00:03:02.970> broke<00:03:03.210> but

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
it and at the moment nothing's broke but

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.830 
it and at the moment nothing's broke but
there's<00:03:04.920> always<00:03:05.070> players<00:03:06.060> out<00:03:06.330> there<00:03:06.360> that<00:03:06.720> we

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
there's always players out there that we

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.170 
there's always players out there that we
can<00:03:07.080> improve<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:08.040> squad<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.550> if<00:03:08.790> he<00:03:08.880> wants<00:03:09.120> to

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
can improve the squad and if he wants to

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.960 
can improve the squad and if he wants to
go<00:03:09.360> out<00:03:09.390> I<00:03:10.080> wouldn't<00:03:10.680> see<00:03:10.800> why<00:03:10.830> not<00:03:11.160> but<00:03:11.370> we've

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
go out I wouldn't see why not but we've

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.040 
go out I wouldn't see why not but we've
been<00:03:12.120> doing<00:03:12.330> really<00:03:12.450> well<00:03:12.600> with<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.810> players

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
been doing really well with the players

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.360 
been doing really well with the players
we've<00:03:13.200> gotten<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:13.860> I<00:03:13.950> think<00:03:14.160> at<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.340> moment

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
we've gotten and I think at the moment

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.010 
we've gotten and I think at the moment
he's<00:03:14.700> just<00:03:14.850> concentrating<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.510> players<00:03:15.750> that

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
he's just concentrating the players that

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.080 
he's just concentrating the players that
I've<00:03:16.740> been<00:03:16.860> doing<00:03:17.010> well<00:03:17.250> so<00:03:17.520> far<00:03:17.730> this<00:03:17.880> season

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
I've been doing well so far this season

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.800 
I've been doing well so far this season
because<00:03:18.540> they<00:03:18.630> meant<00:03:18.780> that<00:03:18.900> much<00:03:19.020> wrong

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.870
