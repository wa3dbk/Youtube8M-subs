00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
opportunities the first one is the stats

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.719 
opportunities the first one is the stats
exactly<00:01:46.079> match<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.530> ones<00:01:46.740> i<00:01:46.979> wrote<00:01:47.189> down<00:01:47.369> for

exactly match the ones i wrote down for
you<00:01:47.880> or<00:01:48.299> are<00:01:48.540> even<00:01:48.570> better<00:01:49.130> by<00:01:50.130> at<00:01:50.280> least<00:01:50.430> 20<00:01:51.030> of

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
you or are even better by at least 20 of

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.929 
you or are even better by at least 20 of
them<00:01:51.329> they're<00:01:52.110> gonna<00:01:52.439> sell<00:01:52.740> very<00:01:53.070> fast<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.820> it

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
them they're gonna sell very fast and it

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.109 
them they're gonna sell very fast and it
takes<00:01:54.180> much<00:01:54.479> more<00:01:54.509> time<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:55.259> find<00:01:55.439> these<00:01:55.680> again

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
takes much more time to find these again

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.690 
takes much more time to find these again
the<00:01:57.119> other<00:01:57.329> possibility<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:59.009> studs<00:01:59.340> don't

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
the other possibility is the studs don't

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.120 
the other possibility is the studs don't
