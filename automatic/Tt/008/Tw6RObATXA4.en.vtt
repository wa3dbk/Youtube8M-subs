00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
executive actions and making a real

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
difference for ordinary families whether

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.510 
difference for ordinary families whether
it's<00:01:10.290> on<00:01:10.670> minimum<00:01:11.670> wage<00:01:11.750> for<00:01:12.750> federal<00:01:12.780> workers

contractors equal pay the terrific work
that's<00:01:20.970> being<00:01:21.119> done<00:01:21.240> around<00:01:22.110> climate<00:01:22.290> change

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
that's being done around climate change

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.620 
that's being done around climate change
so<00:01:22.890> we're<00:01:23.070> transitioning<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.210> clean<00:01:24.270> energy

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
it comes to infrastructure we'll be

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.050 
it comes to infrastructure we'll be
talking<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.319> little<00:02:13.440> bit<00:02:13.590> about<00:02:13.700> how<00:02:14.700> we<00:02:14.760> need

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
talking a little bit about how we need

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.559 
talking a little bit about how we need
to<00:02:15.239> renew<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.290> Highway<00:02:17.129> Trust<00:02:17.340> Fund<00:02:17.489> but<00:02:18.330> more

to renew the Highway Trust Fund but more

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.860 
to renew the Highway Trust Fund but more
importantly<00:02:18.989> we<00:02:19.230> could<00:02:19.440> potentially<00:02:20.870> put

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
importantly we could potentially put

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.120 
importantly we could potentially put
people<00:02:22.140> who<00:02:22.230> work<00:02:22.380> all<00:02:22.560> across<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.980> country

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
people who work all across the country

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.479 
people who work all across the country
we<00:02:23.459> were<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.760> roads<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.330> bridges<00:02:25.489> putting

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
we were the roads and bridges putting

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.059 
we were the roads and bridges putting
construction<00:02:26.849> workers<00:02:27.060> back<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.840> work<00:02:28.069> that

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
construction workers back to work that

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.460 
construction workers back to work that
could<00:02:29.849> boost<00:02:30.060> our<00:02:30.330> economy<00:02:30.420> enormous<00:02:31.170> Lee<00:02:31.290> and

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
could boost our economy enormous Lee and

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.800 
could boost our economy enormous Lee and
now<00:02:31.620> is<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.920> time<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.280> do<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:32.750> but<00:02:33.750> that

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
now is the time to do it but that

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.509 
now is the time to do it but that
requires<00:02:34.290> congressional<00:02:34.530> action<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:36.319> so

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
requires congressional action and so

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.970 
requires congressional action and so
we're<00:02:38.519> always<00:02:38.730> going<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.090> prefer<00:02:39.829> working<00:02:40.829> on

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
we're always going to prefer working on

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.460 
we're always going to prefer working on
a<00:02:41.010> bipartisan<00:02:41.670> basis<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.329> get<00:02:43.079> things<00:02:43.290> done

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
a bipartisan basis to get things done
