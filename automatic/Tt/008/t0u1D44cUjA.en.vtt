00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:57.149
 deal with the width of the band 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:05.210
 must make a length of oblivion delusions 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:05.210
 or casually a force effect 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:18.230

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.230
 band around

 gold when you see that slips I'm going 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:50.799
 try the trick of normal scotch then 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:18.760
 now I had to choose tome you 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.760
 precisely for more than 5 10 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:04:04.610
 not huge enough it had subscribed 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.610
 who slipped from rolling 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:05:02.030
 so please excuse me his joys 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.030
 his sorrows 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:32.280
 everything had forgotten to cut sorry we 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:41.280
 take my time for other for a 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:45.150
 other longer this time well to 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:49.050
 people for them to do the competition of 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.160
 tied weight for this concert so far 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:56.640
 ranked first 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:06:04.650
 actually a bit outdated from the edge on 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:06.360
 enlisting look everywhere promises to 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.450
 find a better way to 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:13.680
 stabilize this camera into the 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:15.390
 next video these people had a good 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.720
 there is missing a little bit but it's 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.720
 not serious 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.840
 in the forest surely one from elsewhere for 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:30.760
 aiming high 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:35.860
 after that one I think I 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:38.830
 French in the East Plain of video games 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:42.660
 I do not know yet which one but I 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:07:19.870
 look for lego star wars 3 on wii 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:07:28.510
 So here it is and I make a pure 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:29.110
 time to wrap everything up with 5 4 3 2 and 

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:34.180
 here 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:35.860
 I'm pretty proud of the result because 

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.490
 that I would not be judged in relief 

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.490
 the choice of men 

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:45.580
 good grip 

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:50.170
 here we can come back when their fingers 

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:53.560
 start or like that even when he the 

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:58.630
 Holds dual or totally normal 

00:07:53.560 --> 00:08:01.120
 like that or that's how we want 

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:03.490
 we can say how I know a very 

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.260
 good grip and I'm also looking for 

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:07.150
 the way to make the elderberry stick 

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.020
 black if you had if you have any 

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:10.210
 ideas on it 

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:13.140
 do not hesitate to put them on 

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:13.140
