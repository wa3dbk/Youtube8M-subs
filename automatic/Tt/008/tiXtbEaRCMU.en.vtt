00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.440 

sometimes<00:01:59.409> I<00:01:59.680> repeat<00:02:00.250> have<00:02:00.610> decided<00:02:01.000> by<00:02:01.390> the

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
sometimes I repeat have decided by the

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.330 
sometimes I repeat have decided by the
length<00:02:01.930> the<00:02:02.110> material<00:02:02.650> you<00:02:02.860> have<00:02:02.890> this

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
length the material you have this

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.539 
length the material you have this
oddball<00:02:03.549> short<00:02:04.060> slightly<00:02:04.540> so<00:02:04.720> as<00:02:04.840> I<00:02:04.960> pull<00:02:05.200> up

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
oddball short slightly so as I pull up

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.240 
oddball short slightly so as I pull up
I'm<00:02:06.549> gonna<00:02:06.759> adjust<00:02:07.000> it<00:02:07.330> and<00:02:08.200> just<00:02:08.470> take<00:02:08.740> it<00:02:09.039> to

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
I'm gonna adjust it and just take it to

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.240 
I'm gonna adjust it and just take it to
about<00:02:09.369> stop<00:02:10.330> top<00:02:10.690> start<00:02:11.050> adjusting<00:02:11.260> it<00:02:11.860> taking

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
about stop top start adjusting it taking

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.160 
about stop top start adjusting it taking
in<00:02:12.520> where<00:02:12.819> you<00:02:12.970> feel<00:02:13.270> you're<00:02:13.660> going<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:13.930> pin<00:02:14.140> it

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
in where you feel you're going to pin it

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.340 
in where you feel you're going to pin it
over<00:02:14.470> your<00:02:14.590> shoulder<00:02:15.130> so<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:16.780> think<00:02:16.900> I'm<00:02:17.200> going

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
over your shoulder so I think I'm going

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.720 
over your shoulder so I think I'm going
to<00:02:17.440> probably<00:02:17.560> let<00:02:17.830> it<00:02:17.860> hang<00:02:18.220> down<00:02:18.400> by<00:02:18.670> about

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
to probably let it hang down by about

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.699 
to probably let it hang down by about
this<00:02:19.060> much<00:02:21.840> so<00:02:22.840> you<00:02:22.930> can<00:02:23.080> think<00:02:23.290> more<00:02:23.410> or<00:02:23.590> less

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
this much so you can think more or less

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.620 
this much so you can think more or less
the<00:02:23.890> whole<00:02:24.040> trip<00:02:24.250> but<00:02:24.400> don't<00:02:24.580> matter<00:02:25.090> how<00:02:25.390> and

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
the whole trip but don't matter how and

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.199 
the whole trip but don't matter how and
where<00:02:25.810> you<00:02:26.110> start<00:02:27.010> folding<00:02:27.280> it's<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.790> same<00:02:28.030> on

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
where you start folding it's the same on

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.479 
where you start folding it's the same on
either<00:02:28.330> side<00:02:28.870> we're<00:02:29.830> going<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.130> put<00:02:30.310> that<00:02:30.430> over

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
either side we're going to put that over

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.650 
either side we're going to put that over
my<00:02:30.850> left<00:02:31.030> shoulder<00:02:32.220> pull<00:02:33.220> out<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.700> top<00:02:34.180> cleat

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
my left shoulder pull out the top cleat

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.509 
my left shoulder pull out the top cleat
here<00:02:34.959> too<00:02:35.320> so<00:02:35.530> that<00:02:35.739> all<00:02:35.920> the<00:02:36.070> other<00:02:36.100> pleats

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
here too so that all the other pleats

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.960 
here too so that all the other pleats
are<00:02:36.700> covered<00:02:37.090> and<00:02:37.500> pin<00:02:38.500> that<00:02:38.580> go<00:02:39.580> check<00:02:39.820> it

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
are covered and pin that go check it

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.259 
are covered and pin that go check it
first<00:02:40.209> to<00:02:40.390> make<00:02:40.570> sure<00:02:40.840> that<00:02:41.019> it's<00:02:41.170> hanging<00:02:42.269> at

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
first to make sure that it's hanging at

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.059 
first to make sure that it's hanging at
the<00:02:43.390> right<00:02:43.600> length<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:44.050> I<00:02:44.170> want<00:02:44.500> might<00:02:44.680> as<00:02:44.920> well

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
the right length so I want might as well

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.949 
the right length so I want might as well
just<00:02:45.310> being<00:02:45.610> it<00:02:45.760> behind<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.450> back<00:02:46.630> of<00:02:46.660> my<00:02:46.900> knee

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
just being it behind the back of my knee

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.770 
just being it behind the back of my knee
or<00:02:47.470> in<00:02:48.190> it<00:02:48.310> or<00:02:48.489> slightly<00:02:48.910> no<00:02:49.180> I<00:02:49.209> think<00:02:49.420> this<00:02:49.690> is

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
or in it or slightly no I think this is

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.970 
or in it or slightly no I think this is
just<00:02:49.810> slightly<00:02:50.110> knowing<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.590> back<00:02:50.800> of<00:02:50.920> my

just slightly knowing the back of my

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.430 
just slightly knowing the back of my
knee<00:02:51.130> but<00:02:51.340> I<00:02:51.400> don't<00:02:51.730> like<00:02:51.910> mine<00:02:52.090> too<00:02:52.930> high<00:02:53.260> I

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
knee but I don't like mine too high I

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.340 
knee but I don't like mine too high I
like<00:02:53.680> mine<00:02:53.860> to<00:02:53.890> fall<00:02:54.280> quite<00:02:55.209> short<00:02:55.569> and<00:02:56.170> just

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350
