and<00:00:05.850> welcome<00:00:06.150> back<00:00:06.330> to<00:00:06.690> that<00:00:06.960> paradox

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
and welcome back to that paradox

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.190 
and welcome back to that paradox
computing<00:00:08.370> I'm<00:00:08.639> here<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.150> give<00:00:09.330> an<00:00:09.450> update<00:00:09.510> on

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
computing I'm here to give an update on

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.060 
computing I'm here to give an update on
the<00:00:10.590> enderchest<00:00:11.460> cracker<00:00:12.500> it's<00:00:13.500> been<00:00:13.799> updated

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
the enderchest cracker it's been updated

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.840 
the enderchest cracker it's been updated
so<00:00:14.519> now<00:00:14.790> no<00:00:14.969> longer<00:00:15.330> needs<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:16.850> BuildCraft

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
so now no longer needs the BuildCraft

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.170 
so now no longer needs the BuildCraft
gate<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:19.230> now<00:00:19.650> just<00:00:20.130> runs<00:00:20.369> purely<00:00:20.970> off

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
gate it now just runs purely off

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.359 
gate it now just runs purely off
computer<00:00:21.630> craft<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.140> also<00:00:22.289> doesn't<00:00:22.769> even<00:00:23.070> need

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
computer craft it also doesn't even need

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.519 
computer craft it also doesn't even need
a<00:00:23.670> transfer<00:00:24.480> node<00:00:24.750> or<00:00:24.930> any<00:00:25.109> way<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.500> getting

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
a transfer node or any way of getting

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.519 
a transfer node or any way of getting
items<00:00:26.039> out<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.730> chest<00:00:27.060> it's<00:00:27.750> all<00:00:28.050> managed

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
items out of the chest it's all managed

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.650 
items out of the chest it's all managed
by<00:00:28.859> computer<00:00:29.279> craft<00:00:29.460> now<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:29.849> that's<00:00:30.060> kind<00:00:30.420> of

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
by computer craft now so that's kind of

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.580 
by computer craft now so that's kind of
cool<00:00:31.669> shall<00:00:32.669> we<00:00:32.850> see<00:00:33.059> how<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.390> works<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.380> here

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
cool shall we see how it works so here

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.530 
cool shall we see how it works so here
we've<00:00:34.710> got<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.190> couple<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.670> chests<00:00:36.210> they've<00:00:36.480> got

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
we've got a couple of chests they've got

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.959 
we've got a couple of chests they've got
a<00:00:36.660> whole<00:00:36.809> bunch<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.140> items<00:00:37.530> in<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.860> now<00:00:38.520> observe

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
a whole bunch of items in it now observe

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.670 
a whole bunch of items in it now observe
the<00:00:39.270> speed<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:39.870> guy<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.140> running<00:00:40.379> at

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
the speed that this guy is running at

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.520 
the speed that this guy is running at
and<00:00:40.950> once<00:00:41.700> we<00:00:41.879> start<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.480> one<00:00:42.690> up<00:00:42.870> it's<00:00:43.290> gonna

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
and once we start this one up it's gonna

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.520 
and once we start this one up it's gonna
not<00:00:44.160> only<00:00:44.190> empty<00:00:44.910> these<00:00:45.030> chests<00:00:45.600> very<00:00:46.200> quickly

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
not only empty these chests very quickly

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.560 
not only empty these chests very quickly
it's<00:00:46.829> also<00:00:46.980> going<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.280> speed<00:00:48.030> through<00:00:48.480> all<00:00:48.539> of

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
it's also going to speed through all of

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.500 
it's also going to speed through all of
the<00:00:48.930> combinations<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:50.039> let's<00:00:50.910> see<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.239> in

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
the combinations so let's see it in

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.490 
the combinations so let's see it in
action<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:52.879> it's<00:00:53.879> found<00:00:54.239> there<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.870> go<00:00:55.079> and

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
action and it's found there you go and

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.369 
action and it's found there you go and
that<00:00:55.550> literally<00:00:56.550> just<00:00:57.000> emptied<00:00:57.449> those<00:00:57.930> two

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
that literally just emptied those two

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.599 
that literally just emptied those two
basically<00:00:59.010> full<00:00:59.280> ender<00:00:59.670> chests<00:01:00.590> and<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:02.370> moved

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
basically full ender chests and it moved

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.880 
basically full ender chests and it moved
the<00:01:02.940> entire<00:01:03.030> contents<00:01:03.899> down<00:01:04.080> into<00:01:04.439> this<00:01:04.530> chest

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
the entire contents down into this chest

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.969 
the entire contents down into this chest
underneath<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.460> so<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.700> can<00:01:05.820> put<00:01:05.970> whatever

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
underneath it so you can put whatever

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.830 
underneath it so you can put whatever
inventory<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.159> want<00:01:08.460> underneath<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.570> ender

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
inventory you want underneath the ender

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.539 
inventory you want underneath the ender
chest<00:01:10.110> for<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.530> put<00:01:10.740> items<00:01:11.070> into<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.490> the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
chest for it to put items into and the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.920 
chest for it to put items into and the
whole<00:01:11.700> things<00:01:11.970> just<00:01:12.119> managed<00:01:12.720> by<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
whole things just managed by the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.499 
whole things just managed by the
computer<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:14.189> literally<00:01:14.760> all<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:15.119> need<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.420> do

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
computer so literally all you need to do

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.570 
computer so literally all you need to do
is<00:01:15.689> put<00:01:15.840> down<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.049> computer<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.979> ender<00:01:17.250> chest

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
is put down a computer and ender chest

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.899 
is put down a computer and ender chest
and<00:01:17.880> well<00:01:18.600> actually<00:01:18.950> I'll<00:01:19.950> show<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.430> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
and well actually I'll show you the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.120 
and well actually I'll show you the
system<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.509> action<00:01:21.930> let's<00:01:22.500> put<00:01:22.650> chest<00:01:22.950> down

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
system in action let's put chest down

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.039 
system in action let's put chest down
there<00:01:23.400> we'll<00:01:23.820> put<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> computer<00:01:24.420> here<00:01:24.840> we'll

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
there we'll put a computer here we'll

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.679 
there we'll put a computer here we'll
put<00:01:25.229> an<00:01:25.439> ender<00:01:25.710> chest<00:01:25.950> there<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:27.560> paste<00:01:28.560> being

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689

link<00:01:34.530> will<00:01:34.710> be<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.070> description<00:01:36.229> BAM

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
link will be in the description BAM

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.740 
link will be in the description BAM
sounds<00:01:38.159> got<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:38.850> can<00:01:38.970> reboot<00:01:39.360> or<00:01:39.570> type

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
sounds got it and you can reboot or type

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.620 
sounds got it and you can reboot or type
startup<00:01:40.259> either<00:01:40.560> or<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.329> it'll<00:01:42.329> start<00:01:42.509> going

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
startup either or and it'll start going

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.840 
startup either or and it'll start going
and<00:01:42.990> that's<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.549> it's<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:45.000> very<00:01:45.540> very<00:01:46.350> simple

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
and that's it so it's a very very simple

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.969 
and that's it so it's a very very simple
quite<00:01:47.850> easy<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.540> set<00:01:48.840> up<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.500> now<00:01:49.649> we'll<00:01:49.799> put

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
quite easy to set up and now we'll put

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.730 
quite easy to set up and now we'll put
any<00:01:50.130> items<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.270> know<00:01:51.420> into<00:01:51.869> here<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.500> can't

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
any items you know into here I can't

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.929 
any items you know into here I can't
open<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.009> chest<00:01:53.250> because<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.610> think<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.790> put<00:01:53.909> a

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
open that chest because I think I put a

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.399 
open that chest because I think I put a
computer<00:01:54.149> on<00:01:54.360> top<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.720> so<00:01:54.840> don't<00:01:54.990> set<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.200> up

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
computer on top of it so don't set it up

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.469 
computer on top of it so don't set it up
that<00:01:55.590> way<00:01:55.649> but<00:01:55.979> yeah<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.850> can<00:01:56.939> put<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.420> can

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
that way but yeah you can put you can

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.149 
that way but yeah you can put you can
have<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.780> set<00:01:57.960> up<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.590> connects<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.979> an

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
have it set up so it connects to an

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.889 
have it set up so it connects to an
applied<00:01:59.430> energistics<00:01:59.820> network<00:02:00.479> or<00:02:00.719> whatever

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
applied energistics network or whatever

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.679 
applied energistics network or whatever
now<00:02:01.290> let's<00:02:01.649> have<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:02.219> quick<00:02:02.430> look<00:02:02.820> at<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.390> code

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
now let's have a quick look at the code

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.229 
now let's have a quick look at the code
shall<00:02:04.320> we<00:02:05.509> and<00:02:06.509> it's<00:02:07.399> so<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.550> codes<00:02:08.759> basically

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
shall we and it's so the codes basically

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.999 
shall we and it's so the codes basically
the<00:02:09.330> same<00:02:09.479> as<00:02:09.660> this<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.869> be<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.080> change<00:02:10.349> if

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
the same as this to be of a change if

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.559 
the same as this to be of a change if
you<00:02:11.129> want<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.370> see<00:02:11.459> explanation<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.209> all<00:02:12.330> this

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
you want to see explanation of all this

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.400 
you want to see explanation of all this
goes<00:02:12.840> back<00:02:13.080> to

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
goes back to

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.730 
goes back to
the<00:02:13.590> demonstration<00:02:14.280> of<00:02:14.490> version<00:02:14.940> 1<00:02:15.240> but<00:02:16.020> so

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
the demonstration of version 1 but so

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.550 
the demonstration of version 1 but so
we've<00:02:16.920> got<00:02:17.220> it's<00:02:17.670> detecting<00:02:18.450> well<00:02:19.110> it's<00:02:19.350> very

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
we've got it's detecting well it's very

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.130 
we've got it's detecting well it's very
quickly<00:02:19.830> say<00:02:20.250> it's<00:02:20.850> detecting<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.870> end<00:02:21.990> of

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
quickly say it's detecting the end of

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.450 
quickly say it's detecting the end of
chest<00:02:22.350> automatically<00:02:22.860> so<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.040> end<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:23.280> chest

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
chest automatically so the end of chest

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.490 
chest automatically so the end of chest
can<00:02:23.670> be<00:02:23.700> on<00:02:23.970> whatever<00:02:24.330> side<00:02:24.570> of<00:02:24.840> this<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.290> like

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
can be on whatever side of this you like

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.320 
can be on whatever side of this you like
the<00:02:26.190> inventory<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.640> end<00:02:26.850> of<00:02:26.970> chest<00:02:27.180> is

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
the inventory the end of chest is

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.820 
the inventory the end of chest is
pushing<00:02:27.630> into<00:02:27.840> though<00:02:27.990> has<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.290> be<00:02:28.500> down

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
pushing into though has to be down

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.350 
pushing into though has to be down
unless<00:02:29.340> you're<00:02:29.490> gonna<00:02:29.610> change<00:02:29.880> one<00:02:30.090> thing

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
unless you're gonna change one thing

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.580 
unless you're gonna change one thing
which<00:02:30.570> I'll<00:02:30.720> show<00:02:30.870> in<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:31.050> second

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
which I'll show in a second

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.270 
which I'll show in a second
so<00:02:32.430> that's<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.210> automatic<00:02:33.300> detection<00:02:34.280> here's

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
so that's the automatic detection here's

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.190 
so that's the automatic detection here's
where<00:02:35.490> we<00:02:35.610> set<00:02:35.850> all<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.180> buttons<00:02:36.780> all<00:02:37.110> the

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
where we set all the buttons all the

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.840 
where we set all the buttons all the
colors<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:37.560> can<00:02:37.770> see<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.040> might<00:02:38.160> get<00:02:38.670> worse

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
colors you can see it might get worse

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.100 
colors you can see it might get worse
that's<00:02:39.030> not<00:02:39.210> flashing<00:02:39.600> in<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.750> background

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
that's not flashing in the background

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.930 
that's not flashing in the background
but<00:02:40.560> this<00:02:40.770> is<00:02:41.040> what<00:02:41.220> cycles<00:02:41.640> are<00:02:41.760> all<00:02:41.850> the

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
but this is what cycles are all the

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.870 
but this is what cycles are all the
various<00:02:42.300> colors<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:42.930> here<00:02:43.830> we<00:02:44.010> get<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.700> bit

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
various colors and here we get the bit

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.110 
various colors and here we get the bit
where<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.120> just<00:02:45.360> uses<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.530> inventory<00:02:47.250> so<00:02:47.820> what

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
where it just uses the inventory so what

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.600 
where it just uses the inventory so what
it's<00:02:48.300> doing<00:02:48.420> is<00:02:49.010> we're<00:02:50.010> using<00:02:50.160> open

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
it's doing is we're using open

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.120 
it's doing is we're using open
peripherals<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.330> do<00:02:51.480> this<00:02:51.660> chest<00:02:52.080> get<00:02:52.890> all

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
peripherals to do this chest get all

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.340 
peripherals to do this chest get all
stacks<00:02:53.550> which<00:02:53.850> returns<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.960> table

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
stacks which returns the table

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.050 
stacks which returns the table
containing<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.700> contents<00:02:57.270> of<00:02:57.620> of<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:59.790> ender

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
containing the contents of of the ender

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.230 
containing the contents of of the ender
chest<00:03:00.330> then<00:03:01.200> we<00:03:01.740> do<00:03:01.920> push<00:03:02.370> items<00:03:02.730> down<00:03:02.970> for

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
chest then we do push items down for

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.440 
chest then we do push items down for
slots<00:03:03.480> so<00:03:03.630> we're<00:03:03.750> getting<00:03:03.870> slot<00:03:04.320> from<00:03:05.450> slot

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
slots so we're getting slot from slot

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.850 
slots so we're getting slot from slot
this<00:03:06.600> variable<00:03:06.990> slot<00:03:07.230> we're<00:03:07.380> getting<00:03:07.620> from

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
this variable slot we're getting from

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.690 
this variable slot we're getting from
the<00:03:07.890> get<00:03:08.400> all<00:03:08.550> stacks<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.740> it's<00:03:10.740> going<00:03:11.250> to

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
the get all stacks and it's going to

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.220 
the get all stacks and it's going to
yeah<00:03:12.300> try<00:03:12.600> and<00:03:12.780> push<00:03:12.990> down<00:03:13.250> everything<00:03:14.250> that

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
yeah try and push down everything that

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.690 
yeah try and push down everything that
every<00:03:16.230> slot<00:03:16.470> that<00:03:16.650> has<00:03:16.830> night<00:03:17.100> a<00:03:17.130> minute<00:03:17.490> so<00:03:17.610> if

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
every slot that has night a minute so if

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.160 
every slot that has night a minute so if
there's<00:03:17.880> no<00:03:17.970> items<00:03:18.330> and<00:03:18.600> then<00:03:18.690> just<00:03:18.900> won't<00:03:19.050> do

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
there's no items and then just won't do

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.430 
there's no items and then just won't do
anything<00:03:19.440> now<00:03:20.090> we're<00:03:21.090> also<00:03:21.209> getting<00:03:21.480> if<00:03:21.900> chest

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
anything now we're also getting if chest

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.160 
anything now we're also getting if chest
stop<00:03:23.160> push<00:03:23.400> item<00:03:23.670> down<00:03:23.880> is<00:03:24.180> greater<00:03:24.810> or<00:03:25.140> equal

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
stop push item down is greater or equal

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.250 
stop push item down is greater or equal
to<00:03:25.590> one<00:03:25.860> so<00:03:26.760> if<00:03:27.060> there's<00:03:27.360> at<00:03:27.600> least<00:03:27.630> one<00:03:28.080> item

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
to one so if there's at least one item

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.040 
to one so if there's at least one item
that's<00:03:29.160> been<00:03:29.340> moved<00:03:29.760> it's<00:03:30.390> going<00:03:30.600> to<00:03:30.690> set

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
that's been moved it's going to set

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.840 
that's been moved it's going to set
items<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:31.620> true<00:03:31.890> so<00:03:32.100> if<00:03:32.160> it<00:03:32.250> was<00:03:32.340> able<00:03:32.550> to<00:03:32.610> push

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
items to true so if it was able to push

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.310 
items to true so if it was able to push
an<00:03:32.970> item<00:03:33.209> out<00:03:33.330> of<00:03:33.360> the<00:03:33.480> chest<00:03:33.750> it's<00:03:33.990> gonna<00:03:34.140> say

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
an item out of the chest it's gonna say

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.300 
an item out of the chest it's gonna say
true<00:03:34.620> and<00:03:34.830> if<00:03:35.660> items<00:03:36.660> is<00:03:36.840> true<00:03:37.140> then<00:03:37.800> it's

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
true and if items is true then it's

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.920 
true and if items is true then it's
gonna<00:03:38.550> go<00:03:38.670> ahead<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:38.910> print<00:03:39.300> all<00:03:39.450> of<00:03:39.660> this

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
gonna go ahead and print all of this

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.350 
gonna go ahead and print all of this
stuff<00:03:40.290> here<00:03:41.040> now<00:03:41.520> I<00:03:41.550> didn't<00:03:41.760> have<00:03:41.880> all<00:03:42.060> of<00:03:42.180> this

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
stuff here now I didn't have all of this

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.940 
stuff here now I didn't have all of this
in<00:03:42.600> this<00:03:42.720> full<00:03:42.959> loop<00:03:43.170> or<00:03:43.410> it<00:03:43.470> would<00:03:43.620> do<00:03:43.800> it

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
in this full loop or it would do it

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.710 
in this full loop or it would do it
every<00:03:44.100> time<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:44.459> of<00:03:44.790> course<00:03:44.880> every<00:03:45.540> time<00:03:45.570> I

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
every time and of course every time I

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.870 
every time and of course every time I
pushed<00:03:46.560> an<00:03:46.709> item<00:03:46.950> down<00:03:47.100> we<00:03:47.370> just<00:03:47.520> want<00:03:47.670> to<00:03:47.760> do

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
pushed an item down we just want to do

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.910 
pushed an item down we just want to do
it<00:03:47.970> once<00:03:48.180> per<00:03:48.300> chest<00:03:48.780> so<00:03:49.590> that's<00:03:49.709> why<00:03:49.830> I'm

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
it once per chest so that's why I'm

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.500 
it once per chest so that's why I'm
doing<00:03:50.160> items<00:03:50.400> equals<00:03:50.730> true<00:03:50.940> and<00:03:51.150> then<00:03:51.239> doing

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
doing items equals true and then doing

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.560 
doing items equals true and then doing
this<00:03:51.600> outside<00:03:51.870> of<00:03:52.140> that<00:03:52.290> for<00:03:52.500> loop<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:53.570> yeah

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
this outside of that for loop and yeah

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.330 
this outside of that for loop and yeah
then<00:03:54.989> this<00:03:55.200> is<00:03:55.350> just<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.680> same<00:03:55.860> this<00:03:56.100> is<00:03:56.190> what

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
then this is just the same this is what

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.699 
then this is just the same this is what
prints<00:03:56.670> up<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:57.090> colors<00:03:57.959> that<00:03:58.140> found<00:03:58.410> on<00:03:58.590> the

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
prints up the colors that found on the

prints up the colors that found on the
screen<00:03:59.070> which<00:03:59.700> look<00:04:00.420> like<00:04:00.800> wait<00:04:01.800> I'm<00:04:01.980> going<00:04:02.160> on

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
screen which look like wait I'm going on

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.830
