white<00:00:33.899> which<00:00:34.110> obviously<00:00:34.380> matches<00:00:34.829> the

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
white which obviously matches the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.069 
white which obviously matches the
exterior<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.550> we<00:00:35.640> have<00:00:35.820> here<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.630> it<00:00:36.899> really

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
exterior that we have here and it really

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.540
