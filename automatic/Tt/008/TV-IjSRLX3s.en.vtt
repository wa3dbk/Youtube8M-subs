did<00:00:10.059> you<00:00:10.150> ever<00:00:10.269> think<00:00:10.540> of<00:00:10.660> your<00:00:10.809> spark<00:00:11.200> plugs

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:11.500 
did you ever think of your spark plugs

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.009 
did you ever think of your spark plugs
as<00:00:11.740> the<00:00:11.889> heart<00:00:12.160> of<00:00:12.250> your<00:00:12.339> engine<00:00:12.730> the<00:00:13.570> primary

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:14.019 
as the heart of your engine the primary

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:16.049 
as the heart of your engine the primary
purpose<00:00:14.530> of<00:00:14.650> the<00:00:14.799> spark<00:00:15.129> plug<00:00:15.400> is<00:00:15.429> to<00:00:15.759> ignite

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.059 
purpose of the spark plug is to ignite

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.360 
purpose of the spark plug is to ignite
the<00:00:16.240> air<00:00:16.270> fuel<00:00:16.690> mixture<00:00:16.870> inside<00:00:17.410> the<00:00:17.890> cylinder
