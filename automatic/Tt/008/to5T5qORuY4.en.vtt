00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.200
 helmets love girlfriend to welcome 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.110
 a little more video this time 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.700
 no pvp video should be more serious 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.520
 video to an info video to a 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.500
 server that will be coming soon 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.770
 background you see an end games 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.840
 Round which went relatively well until the 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.849
 specific time until the semi-final 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.680
 because I was like strange 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.980
 killed though the much worse 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.570
 so i do not care what i know 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.130
 Not at all that takes five minutes 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.200
 So six minutes I just wanted 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.969
 not if I say something for so long 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.820
 but many will catch them anyway 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:50.179
 It's all about the video in the video 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.670
 that this channel is therefore contento of 

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:55.339
 We are both being led soon 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.800
 own server has a server 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:00.739
 called mainz pvp now i think 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.780
 maybe some where you had you 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.610
 not even have a server of the same 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.280
 means yes we had a server of the times 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.100
 on weinhaus bvg we said that 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.240
 stop after some time 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.750
 could or 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.890
 did not manage to keep up 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.180
 Therefore, we do a time 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:23.030
 reboot and only we both first 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.130
 in administration without any 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.490
 other people do not care about us 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.909
 know or as it was last time 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.610
 That's why I wish for you to do that 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.290
 ye are the following day in your 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.380
 calendar is marked and that is the 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:42.469
 seventh second 2005 these are two weeks 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:46.090
 Saturday will be the big one 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:51.170
 Opening on the server instead and indeed 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:53.149
 at exactly 13:00 that ye have the 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.020
 a track somehow come here now 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:02:00.049
 also many many what we the 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.670
 hints that so do not be surprised 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.229
 now if a lot of advertising to the server 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.810
 come because that's us just very 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.820
 important that there is a relatively large 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:13.040
 community is there for us and then too 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:16.410
 on the server fun and with splitt halt 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.680
 I have one more for that 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.090
 vote made so you can 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.660
 This one I do not know how it has 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.850
 now this definitely where you are 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.970
 can tick and then she sees 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.390
 Table 8 is probably what I am 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.860
 my 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.500
 In any case look down in the 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.840
 description is at the top here 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.250
 vote 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.830
 and click on the link on it is 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.540
 stop there you can check yes if 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.020
 you want to dream on the server 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.670
 and with 782 and of course on it 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.160
 So all in all, you're looking forward to playing 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.670
 the concert ev has two servers or 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.790
 were interested in doing so or 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.830
 hold objection if not there 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.660
 we stop to see how much interest 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.830
 could and therefore can the slots too 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.380
 adjust a bit 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.120
 that's exactly what we hoped we would do 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.890
 of course a lot because I think 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.480
 all of you who subscribed to us and 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.600
 active spectators like a game 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:16.340
 minecraft and why not one too 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.840
 try new minecraft server 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.400
 Of course, that is still completely new and 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.770
 therefore probably also some 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.170
 bugs on it we already have a lot 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.030
 worked on it for a long time 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.130
 we are almost done 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.250
 want to use the remaining two weeks 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:36.360
 you for all the bugs and everything to fix something 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.010
 of course it is possible to fix somehow 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.960
 it is that over and over again 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.030
 Something appears but there you can 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.310
 yes you has really very nice to us 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.160
 speak and then will improve for 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.630
 So I do not know if I can do that 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:53.970
 in any case, he will do it 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:57.810
 itself pvp server normal pvp echoes 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.550
 there is a nice spawn now what 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.240
 is called normal so we have that 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.230
 already trying to keep so very fair 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.180
 I do not really want it yet 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.980
 betrayed too much because you should 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.270
 really experience yourself then on 17 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.070
 2 In any case , I pretty much have that 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:12.990
 or do we do it fairly well? 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.900
 that's not fair if one does 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.340
 new joint then has 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.620
 no chance to do anything 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.850
 so if you're right from the start 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.950
 beg volt with the other players 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.770
 So you want to be number one right away 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.410
 you want to conquer this server for 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.330
 you or for yours clearly small 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.710
 By the way, you can also do that with us 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.680
 friends or with any people 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.340
 which also got to know on the server 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:46.830
 such a community server such a small one 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:48.300
 then of course you can do that with us 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.450
 also have such statistics 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.010
 I will be far too much again 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.410
 but then in any case 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.210
 can you create plans with friends 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.830
 with whatever 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.500
 and then it has the server, so to speak 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.630
 Of course there will be conquest for you 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.070
 competing little ones and everything so 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.290
 that we now have really funny 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:12.290
 really cool that's why I would you 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:16.290
 I'm glad if you on 17 23 10 o'clock 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:18.810
 At the server opening I hope 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.490
 13 o'clock suitable for everyone I know 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.030
 Of course Saturday 13 or would have 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.890

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.410
 not even at least and can be on everyone 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:30.210
 case the server fence if not her 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.340
 Of course you can also join us three weeks later 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.530
 or two days later the server stays 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.850
 he now online the ics for 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.160
 always there I say 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:41.160
 That's why I would definitely 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.020
 happy if he would come 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.460
 Barns would especially in the 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.010

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.460

 and yes, I only have about 30 left 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:58.470
 Seconds after the fight here I die 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.610
 at the moment so now finished so completely 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.030
 In any case, I would be quiet 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:02.490
