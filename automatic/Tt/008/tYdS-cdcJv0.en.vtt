00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.790
 for the tutorial of how to recover the 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.230
 2g starters on skin quebec 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.719
 so yes for two days we can 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.940
 recover the starters they are but 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.850
 wins men tiff losio and iga killer 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.500
 on the skin of the banks 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.000
 I was asked to show how to do 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.640
 to recover because apparently there is 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.230
 who could not get it back then 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.630
 I will try to see because I have 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.580
 not recovered for the moment a small and 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.580
 bangkok and ben here 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:42.210
 connect course 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.210
 connects to the east 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.860
 ah that's how you used so much 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.560
 pokemon that I can not hold back from 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:56.520
 make a present 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:59.350
 So here are yeah 127 combat points 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.910
 actually yes so we could not 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.750
 to get them back 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.210
 finally you can not recover them 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.270
 if your quellian skin is filled for 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.210
 do this you have to go out of his voice the 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.860
 save you have to end up in 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.760
 your game then noting that its saving 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.560
 here we go empty the poké links 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.640
 because otherwise we can not 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.060
 offer the gifts also the place is 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.990
 already taken 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.220
 which is a bit logical here are some 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.550
 internet connections 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:31.240
