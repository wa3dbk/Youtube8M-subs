00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
hi this is Ryan with front-end audio and

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.790 
hi this is Ryan with front-end audio and
today<00:00:09.420> I<00:00:09.450> want<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.719> talk<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:10.019> you<00:00:10.110> about<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.440> AR

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
today I want to talk to you about the AR

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.870 
today I want to talk to you about the AR
T<00:00:11.010> Pro<00:00:11.820> MPA<00:00:12.360> -<00:00:12.509> it's<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.500> dual<00:00:13.740> channel<00:00:13.830> tube<00:00:14.549> mic

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
T Pro MPA - it's a dual channel tube mic

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.140 
T Pro MPA - it's a dual channel tube mic
free<00:00:15.269> so<00:00:15.929> actually<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.770> very<00:00:17.130> great<00:00:17.490> valued

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
free so actually a very great valued

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.570 
free so actually a very great valued
unit<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.720> has<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.900> ton<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.260> features<00:00:19.560> if<00:00:19.949> we

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
unit that has a ton of features if we

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.609 
unit that has a ton of features if we
look<00:00:21.150> over<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.480> front<00:00:21.689> panel<00:00:22.020> here<00:00:22.230> we<00:00:22.500> can

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
look over the front panel here we can

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:23.990 
look over the front panel here we can
actually<00:00:22.769> see<00:00:23.070> what<00:00:23.340> this<00:00:23.460> thing<00:00:23.670> has<00:00:23.820> to

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
actually see what this thing has to

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.540 
actually see what this thing has to
offer<00:00:24.650> looking<00:00:25.650> at<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.859> face<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.279> unit

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
offer looking at the face of the unit

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.970 
offer looking at the face of the unit
you<00:00:26.670> can<00:00:26.789> tell<00:00:26.910> it's<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.300> two<00:00:27.990> rack<00:00:28.230> space<00:00:28.560> unit

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
you can tell it's a two rack space unit

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.099 
you can tell it's a two rack space unit
so<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.460> will<00:00:29.670> need<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.939> little<00:00:30.240> extra<00:00:30.630> room<00:00:30.810> if

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
so it will need a little extra room if

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.470 
so it will need a little extra room if
taken<00:00:32.099> consideration<00:00:32.790> when<00:00:32.969> you're<00:00:33.120> looking

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
taken consideration when you're looking

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.819 
taken consideration when you're looking
into<00:00:34.410> this

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
into this

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.979 
into this
you<00:00:35.370> have<00:00:35.520> your<00:00:35.670> power<00:00:35.850> switch<00:00:36.420> right<00:00:36.719> here

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
you have your power switch right here

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.709 
you have your power switch right here
for<00:00:37.260> cutting<00:00:37.950> on<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.250> off<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.489> unit<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:39.570> have

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
for cutting on and off the unit you have

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.319 
for cutting on and off the unit you have
your<00:00:39.930> gain<00:00:40.170> stage<00:00:40.559> here<00:00:40.950> for<00:00:40.980> your<00:00:41.370> mic<00:00:41.910> level

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
your gain stage here for your mic level

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.170 
your gain stage here for your mic level
and<00:00:42.480> instrument<00:00:42.930> level<00:00:43.260> input<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.920> it's<00:00:44.910> not

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
and instrument level input and it's not

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.479 
and instrument level input and it's not
de<00:00:45.390> tinted<00:00:45.809> but<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.079> does<00:00:46.320> have<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.890> clicking

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
de tinted but it does have a clicking

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.420 
de tinted but it does have a clicking
feel<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:49.230> can<00:00:49.410> make<00:00:49.590> reference<00:00:50.190> a

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
feel to it so you can make reference a

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.430 
feel to it so you can make reference a
mental<00:00:50.940> reference<00:00:51.270> or<00:00:51.449> actually<00:00:52.110> just<00:00:52.289> write

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
mental reference or actually just write

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.069 
mental reference or actually just write
it<00:00:52.559> down<00:00:52.730> how<00:00:53.730> many<00:00:53.789> clicks<00:00:54.149> up<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.719> down<00:00:54.870> you

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
it down how many clicks up and down you

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.020 
it down how many clicks up and down you
were<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.469> when<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.129> were<00:00:56.250> setting<00:00:56.489> up<00:00:56.730> it's<00:00:56.969> a

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
were on when you were setting up it's a

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.990 
were on when you were setting up it's a
nice<00:00:57.180> recall<00:00:57.629> feature<00:00:58.340> here<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.489> have<00:00:59.730> your

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
nice recall feature here you have your

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.330 
nice recall feature here you have your
impedance<00:01:00.600> which<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.590> can<00:01:01.739> adjust<00:01:01.829> from<00:01:02.190> a

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
impedance which you can adjust from a

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.130 
impedance which you can adjust from a
lower<00:01:02.489> impedance<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.149> higher<00:01:03.359> impedance<00:01:03.750> and

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
lower impedance to higher impedance and

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.230 
lower impedance to higher impedance and
of<00:01:04.860> course<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.400> more<00:01:05.580> you<00:01:05.610> crank<00:01:05.939> up<00:01:06.090> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
of course the more you crank up the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.350 
of course the more you crank up the
impedance<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.080> more<00:01:07.320> tames<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.830> high-end<00:01:08.729> so

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
impedance the more tames the high-end so

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.510 
impedance the more tames the high-end so
if<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.689> really<00:01:09.960> need<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.140> work<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.830> maybe

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
if you really need to work on maybe

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.340 
if you really need to work on maybe
smoothing<00:01:12.000> out<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.150> high<00:01:12.420> end<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.810> specific

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
smoothing out the high end of a specific

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.320 
smoothing out the high end of a specific
instrument<00:01:13.830> or<00:01:13.920> vocalist<00:01:14.369> that<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.060> great

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
instrument or vocalist that is a great

direct guitars or even a bass guitar on
this<00:02:02.250> side<00:02:02.880> right<00:02:03.149> here<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.600> have<00:02:03.750> your<00:02:03.899> vu

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
this side right here you have your vu

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.260 
this side right here you have your vu
meter<00:02:04.560> for<00:02:05.070> each<00:02:05.189> individual<00:02:05.759> channel<00:02:06.119> and

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
meter for each individual channel and

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.300 
meter for each individual channel and
you<00:02:06.689> have<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.869> trim<00:02:07.290> here<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.829> can<00:02:08.039> run<00:02:08.190> your

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
you have a trim here so you can run your

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.669 
you have a trim here so you can run your
test<00:02:08.580> tones<00:02:08.819> through<00:02:09.149> it<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.420> calibrate<00:02:10.050> your

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
test tones through it and calibrate your

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.350 
test tones through it and calibrate your
vu<00:02:11.160> meter<00:02:11.400> for<00:02:11.879> more<00:02:12.060> accuracy<00:02:12.540> but

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
vu meter for more accuracy but

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.130 
vu meter for more accuracy but
the<00:02:13.570> vu<00:02:13.900> meter<00:02:14.170> you<00:02:14.590> have<00:02:14.800> your<00:02:15.180> 20<00:02:16.180> DB<00:02:16.600> gain

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
the vu meter you have your 20 DB gain

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.070 
the vu meter you have your 20 DB gain
what<00:02:18.070> this<00:02:18.250> does<00:02:18.490> is<00:02:18.700> adds<00:02:18.970> an<00:02:19.210> additional<00:02:19.330> 20

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
what this does is adds an additional 20

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.670 
what this does is adds an additional 20
DB<00:02:20.440> of<00:02:20.470> gain<00:02:20.710> to<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.840> gain<00:02:23.020> stage<00:02:23.350> of<00:02:23.590> the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
DB of gain to the the gain stage of the

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.220 
DB of gain to the the gain stage of the
mic<00:02:23.860> pre<00:02:24.190> so<00:02:24.760> I<00:02:24.790> kind<00:02:25.300> of<00:02:25.360> look<00:02:25.510> at<00:02:25.660> it<00:02:25.720> as<00:02:25.960> it

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
mic pre so I kind of look at it as it

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.970 
mic pre so I kind of look at it as it
comes<00:02:26.440> with<00:02:26.830> a<00:02:27.100> 20<00:02:27.610> DB<00:02:28.030> pad<00:02:28.470> already<00:02:29.470> engaged

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
comes with a 20 DB pad already engaged

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.300 
comes with a 20 DB pad already engaged
so<00:02:30.700> when<00:02:31.480> you're<00:02:31.630> say<00:02:32.080> doing<00:02:32.440> drum<00:02:32.920> overheads

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
so when you're say doing drum overheads

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.280 
so when you're say doing drum overheads
you<00:02:34.150> don't<00:02:34.330> need<00:02:34.480> to<00:02:34.600> worry<00:02:34.810> about<00:02:34.960> that<00:02:35.230> you

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
you don't need to worry about that you

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.830 
you don't need to worry about that you
got<00:02:35.560> plenty<00:02:35.830> of<00:02:35.980> gain<00:02:36.280> here<00:02:36.610> but<00:02:37.390> if<00:02:37.540> you<00:02:37.660> need

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
got plenty of gain here but if you need

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.210 
got plenty of gain here but if you need
a<00:02:37.870> little<00:02:38.050> extra<00:02:38.290> gain<00:02:38.500> say<00:02:38.740> on<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:38.980> acoustic

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
a little extra gain say on the acoustic

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.760 
a little extra gain say on the acoustic
guitar<00:02:39.760> or<00:02:39.970> maybe<00:02:40.420> a<00:02:40.510> vocalist<00:02:41.020> you<00:02:41.590> can

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
guitar or maybe a vocalist you can

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.400 
guitar or maybe a vocalist you can
engage<00:02:42.010> in<00:02:42.070> extra<00:02:42.580> 20<00:02:42.880> DB<00:02:43.240> that<00:02:43.810> will<00:02:44.080> give<00:02:44.260> you

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
engage in extra 20 DB that will give you

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.710 
engage in extra 20 DB that will give you
that<00:02:44.440> extra<00:02:45.040> volume<00:02:45.730> boost<00:02:46.180> that<00:02:46.420> you<00:02:46.450> would

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
that extra volume boost that you would

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.880 
that extra volume boost that you would
need<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:47.080> get<00:02:47.200> a<00:02:47.580> real<00:02:48.580> good<00:02:48.610> take<00:02:49.650> next<00:02:50.650> of

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
need to get a real good take next of

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.190 
need to get a real good take next of
that<00:02:51.040> you<00:02:51.250> have<00:02:51.520> your<00:02:51.760> phantom<00:02:52.330> power<00:02:52.510> so<00:02:52.990> when

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
that you have your phantom power so when

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.380 
that you have your phantom power so when
engaged<00:02:53.350> of<00:02:53.740> course<00:02:53.920> you<00:02:54.130> can<00:02:54.280> power<00:02:54.520> any

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
engaged of course you can power any

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.070 
engaged of course you can power any
condenser<00:02:55.959> microphone<00:02:57.240> next<00:02:58.240> to<00:02:58.420> that<00:02:58.660> you

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
condenser microphone next to that you

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.530 
condenser microphone next to that you
have<00:02:59.350> your<00:02:59.620> high<00:02:59.980> voltage<00:03:00.490> plate<00:03:00.880> and<00:03:01.330> what

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
have your high voltage plate and what

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.380 
have your high voltage plate and what
this<00:03:01.720> does<00:03:01.959> is<00:03:02.200> it<00:03:02.560> boosts<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:03.670> voltage<00:03:04.120> going

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
this does is it boosts the voltage going

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.690 
this does is it boosts the voltage going
to<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:04.810> tubes<00:03:05.080> to<00:03:05.440> get<00:03:05.590> a<00:03:05.890> little<00:03:06.490> extra

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
to the tubes to get a little extra

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.180 
to the tubes to get a little extra
saturation<00:03:07.540> going<00:03:07.900> it<00:03:08.110> does<00:03:08.650> take<00:03:09.010> about

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
saturation going it does take about

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.870 
saturation going it does take about
15-20<00:03:09.940> seconds<00:03:10.870> for<00:03:11.290> it<00:03:11.320> to<00:03:11.410> ramp<00:03:11.800> up<00:03:12.040> or<00:03:12.190> cool

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
15-20 seconds for it to ramp up or cool

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.090 
15-20 seconds for it to ramp up or cool
down<00:03:12.910> so<00:03:13.510> you<00:03:14.290> want<00:03:14.470> to<00:03:14.560> make<00:03:14.650> sure<00:03:14.680> that<00:03:14.950> you

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
down so you want to make sure that you

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.100 
down so you want to make sure that you
if<00:03:15.430> you're<00:03:15.640> engaging<00:03:16.000> this<00:03:16.300> for<00:03:16.690> you<00:03:17.020> know

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
if you're engaging this for you know

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.860 
if you're engaging this for you know
adding<00:03:17.410> a<00:03:17.440> little<00:03:17.590> extra<00:03:18.090> some<00:03:19.090> little<00:03:19.630> extra

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
adding a little extra some little extra

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.690 
adding a little extra some little extra
body<00:03:20.080> to<00:03:20.410> say<00:03:20.590> an<00:03:20.769> acoustic<00:03:21.280> guitar<00:03:21.310> or

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
body to say an acoustic guitar or

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.640 
body to say an acoustic guitar or
something<00:03:22.030> like<00:03:22.120> that<00:03:22.180> you<00:03:22.959> give<00:03:23.140> it<00:03:23.260> time<00:03:23.440> to

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
something like that you give it time to

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.979 
something like that you give it time to
warm<00:03:23.860> up<00:03:24.070> and<00:03:24.280> when<00:03:24.790> disengaged<00:03:25.390> give<00:03:25.750> it<00:03:25.870> time

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
warm up and when disengaged give it time

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.350 
warm up and when disengaged give it time
to<00:03:26.050> cool<00:03:26.350> down<00:03:26.700> next<00:03:27.700> to<00:03:27.760> that<00:03:27.880> you<00:03:28.090> have<00:03:28.120> your

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
to cool down next to that you have your

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.360 
to cool down next to that you have your
phase<00:03:28.570> invert<00:03:29.019> which<00:03:29.470> is<00:03:29.709> pretty

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
phase invert which is pretty

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.370 
phase invert which is pretty
self-explanatory<00:03:30.760> if<00:03:31.450> you<00:03:31.570> need<00:03:31.720> to<00:03:31.870> invert

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
self-explanatory if you need to invert

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.610 
self-explanatory if you need to invert
the<00:03:32.560> phase<00:03:32.709> of<00:03:33.010> a<00:03:33.070> microphone<00:03:34.080> next<00:03:35.080> that<00:03:35.320> you

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
the phase of a microphone next that you

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.790 
the phase of a microphone next that you
have<00:03:35.830> your<00:03:36.040> mid<00:03:36.310> side<00:03:36.900> now<00:03:37.900> what<00:03:38.110> this<00:03:38.260> does<00:03:38.500> is

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
have your mid side now what this does is

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.780 
have your mid side now what this does is
it<00:03:39.070> aligns<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.390> output<00:03:40.930> of<00:03:41.110> the<00:03:41.500> unit<00:03:41.890> so<00:03:42.519> that

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
it aligns the output of the unit so that

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.210 
it aligns the output of the unit so that
you<00:03:42.910> can<00:03:43.060> actually<00:03:43.209> do<00:03:43.570> mid<00:03:44.470> side<00:03:44.739> stereo

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
you can actually do mid side stereo

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.820 
you can actually do mid side stereo
recording<00:03:45.850> so<00:03:46.360> if<00:03:46.510> you<00:03:46.630> have<00:03:46.840> say<00:03:47.200> you're

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
recording so if you have say you're

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.070 
recording so if you have say you're
doing<00:03:47.950> drum<00:03:48.519> overheads<00:03:48.850> or<00:03:49.239> acoustic<00:03:49.810> guitar

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
doing drum overheads or acoustic guitar

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.009 
doing drum overheads or acoustic guitar
and<00:03:50.320> you<00:03:50.980> have<00:03:51.190> your<00:03:51.940> main<00:03:52.180> mic<00:03:52.420> pointing<00:03:52.870> down

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
and you have your main mic pointing down

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.440 
and you have your main mic pointing down
in<00:03:53.350> a<00:03:53.530> near<00:03:54.190> cardioid<00:03:54.730> and<00:03:55.000> then<00:03:55.120> you<00:03:55.239> have

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
in a near cardioid and then you have

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.530 
in a near cardioid and then you have
your<00:03:55.660> 90<00:03:56.019> degree<00:03:56.730> off-center<00:03:57.730> microphone<00:03:58.269> and

for getting a little hot and you're
ready<00:04:20.470> for<00:04:20.680> clipping<00:04:21.390> this<00:04:22.390> is<00:04:22.630> a<00:04:22.660> great

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
ready for clipping this is a great

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.620 
ready for clipping this is a great
visual<00:04:23.610> kind<00:04:24.610> of<00:04:24.669> representation<00:04:25.390> of<00:04:25.479> your

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
meters so if you're a little

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.250 
meters so if you're a little
ways<00:04:27.550> away<00:04:27.729> from<00:04:27.880> the<00:04:28.150> unit<00:04:28.449> and<00:04:28.570> you<00:04:28.630> can't

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
ways away from the unit and you can't

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.200 
ways away from the unit and you can't
quite<00:04:29.500> make<00:04:29.710> out<00:04:29.919> the<00:04:30.040> vu<00:04:30.340> meters<00:04:30.639> you<00:04:31.180> have

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
quite make out the vu meters you have

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.860 
quite make out the vu meters you have
your<00:04:31.570> led<00:04:31.990> meters<00:04:32.290> for<00:04:32.530> reference<00:04:33.010> on<00:04:33.870> channel

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.290 
your led meters for reference on channel
two<00:04:35.050> of<00:04:35.199> the<00:04:35.320> unit<00:04:35.590> you'll<00:04:35.740> notice<00:04:36.010> the

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
two of the unit you'll notice the

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.000 
two of the unit you'll notice the
controls<00:04:37.300> are<00:04:37.479> virtually<00:04:38.020> the<00:04:38.050> same<00:04:38.199> the<00:04:38.590> only

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
controls are virtually the same the only

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.189 
controls are virtually the same the only
difference<00:04:39.430> here<00:04:39.490> is<00:04:39.699> your<00:04:40.120> stereo<00:04:40.780> button

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
difference here is your stereo button

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.189 
difference here is your stereo button
what<00:04:41.949> this<00:04:42.190> does<00:04:42.490> is<00:04:42.790> when<00:04:43.030> engaged<00:04:43.600> if<00:04:43.930> you're

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
what this does is when engaged if you're

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.430 
what this does is when engaged if you're
recording<00:04:44.470> a<00:04:44.680> stereo<00:04:45.100> guitar<00:04:45.669> or<00:04:45.970> maybe<00:04:46.960> drum

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
recording a stereo guitar or maybe drum

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.810 
recording a stereo guitar or maybe drum
overheads<00:04:47.740> or<00:04:48.040> something<00:04:48.310> like<00:04:48.430> that<00:04:48.610> that

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
overheads or something like that that

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.210 
overheads or something like that that
you<00:04:48.970> would<00:04:49.240> want<00:04:49.449> to<00:04:49.510> stereo<00:04:49.840> signal<00:04:50.110> on<00:04:50.410> once

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
you would want to stereo signal on once

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.210 
you would want to stereo signal on once
engaged<00:04:51.460> the<00:04:52.360> output<00:04:53.020> control<00:04:53.410> of<00:04:53.590> channel<00:04:54.010> 1

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
engaged the output control of channel 1

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.000 
engaged the output control of channel 1
then<00:04:55.030> controls<00:04:55.540> the<00:04:55.750> output<00:04:55.930> of<00:04:56.260> channel<00:04:56.590> 2<00:04:56.740> so

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
then controls the output of channel 2 so

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:58.500 
then controls the output of channel 2 so
you<00:04:57.070> don't<00:04:57.310> have<00:04:57.460> to<00:04:57.639> worry<00:04:57.850> about<00:04:57.940> any

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
you don't have to worry about any

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.469 
you don't have to worry about any

it's a very simplistic setup you have

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:08.640 
it's a very simplistic setup you have

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
this all balanced even the quarter-inch

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.370 
this all balanced even the quarter-inch
output<00:05:14.729> next<00:05:15.729> to<00:05:16.000> that<00:05:16.150> you<00:05:16.600> have<00:05:16.900> a<00:05:17.910> +4

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:28.690 
signal to kind of thicken up the overall

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:09.949 
really like about it is if I want to get

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:12.399 
really like about it is if I want to get
a<00:07:10.009> little<00:07:10.159> edge<00:07:10.490> I<00:07:10.819> can<00:07:11.300> crank<00:07:11.689> up<00:07:11.870> the<00:07:11.990> input

00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:12.409 
a little edge I can crank up the input

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:15.279 
a little edge I can crank up the input
but<00:07:12.860> leave<00:07:13.039> the<00:07:13.189> output<00:07:13.669> down<00:07:13.939> and<00:07:14.330> start<00:07:15.110> to

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:15.289 
but leave the output down and start to

00:07:15.289 --> 00:07:16.659 
but leave the output down and start to
break<00:07:15.590> up<00:07:15.620> and<00:07:16.099> get<00:07:16.159> a<00:07:16.219> little<00:07:16.400> bit<00:07:16.580> of

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:16.669 
break up and get a little bit of

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:18.490 
break up and get a little bit of
distortion<00:07:16.849> out<00:07:17.389> of<00:07:17.509> that<00:07:17.629> tube<00:07:17.900> and<00:07:18.110> really

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:18.500 
distortion out of that tube and really

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.659 
distortion out of that tube and really
kind<00:07:18.710> of<00:07:18.800> just<00:07:18.949> add<00:07:19.159> a<00:07:19.189> little<00:07:19.460> extra

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:19.669 
kind of just add a little extra

00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:22.510 
kind of just add a little extra
dimension<00:07:20.449> to<00:07:20.479> the<00:07:20.659> a<00:07:21.110> little<00:07:21.770> extra<00:07:21.979> dirt<00:07:22.250> to

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:22.520 
dimension to the a little extra dirt to

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.029 
dimension to the a little extra dirt to
the<00:07:22.639> signal<00:07:23.029> so<00:07:23.419> it's<00:07:23.629> a<00:07:23.750> great<00:07:24.229> value<00:07:24.529> in<00:07:24.889> that

00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:25.039 
the signal so it's a great value in that

00:07:25.039 --> 00:07:27.399 
the signal so it's a great value in that
fact<00:07:25.370> highly<00:07:25.879> versatile<00:07:26.270> will<00:07:26.870> not<00:07:27.020> break<00:07:27.259> the

00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:27.409 
fact highly versatile will not break the

00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:30.129 
fact highly versatile will not break the
