00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.710 
know I don't understand why the staying
power<00:03:15.890> is<00:03:16.160> none<00:03:16.579> enough<00:03:17.269> for<00:03:17.630> me<00:03:17.840> and<00:03:18.139> I<00:03:19.720> kinda

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
power is none enough for me and I kinda

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.309 
power is none enough for me and I kinda
hate<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.170> formula<00:03:22.069> because<00:03:22.959> it's<00:03:23.959> really

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 
hate the formula because it's really

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.629 
hate the formula because it's really
drying<00:03:24.920> and<00:03:25.670> it<00:03:26.209> gives<00:03:26.690> me<00:03:27.049> a<00:03:27.319> cracked<00:03:27.769> lips<00:03:28.069> at

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639 
drying and it gives me a cracked lips at

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:30.789 
drying and it gives me a cracked lips at
the<00:03:29.030> end<00:03:29.209> of<00:03:29.389> the<00:03:29.569> day<00:03:29.780> I<00:03:29.810> just<00:03:30.019> want<00:03:30.470> to<00:03:30.620> keep

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
the end of the day I just want to keep

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.449 
the end of the day I just want to keep
peeling<00:03:31.130> my<00:03:31.519> lips<00:03:31.850> I<00:03:32.180> also<00:03:33.139> tried<00:03:33.620> putting<00:03:34.069> a

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
peeling my lips I also tried putting a

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.990 
peeling my lips I also tried putting a
lip<00:03:34.880> balm<00:03:35.150> or<00:03:35.480> lip<00:03:35.600> gloss<00:03:36.319> on<00:03:36.650> top<00:03:36.709> of<00:03:37.160> it<00:03:37.310> but

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
lip balm or lip gloss on top of it but

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.360 
lip balm or lip gloss on top of it but
it's<00:03:38.239> still<00:03:38.660> drying<00:03:41.500> this<00:03:42.500> is<00:03:42.709> not<00:03:42.920> something

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
it's still drying this is not something

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.870 
it's still drying this is not something
that<00:03:43.639> you<00:03:44.000> can<00:03:44.030> use<00:03:44.480> every<00:03:45.019> day<00:03:45.049> and<00:03:45.650> I<00:03:45.980> think

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
that you can use every day and I think

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.270 
that you can use every day and I think
that<00:03:47.090> it's<00:03:47.359> not<00:03:47.870> worth<00:03:48.319> spending<00:03:48.620> your<00:03:49.250> money

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
that it's not worth spending your money

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.050 
that it's not worth spending your money
if<00:03:49.880> you're<00:03:50.060> really<00:03:50.359> concerned<00:03:50.660> to<00:03:51.170> your<00:03:51.350> lips

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060
