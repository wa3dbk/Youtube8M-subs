00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
for free on the computer so it's almost

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.200 
for free on the computer so it's almost
guaranteed<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.340> already<00:00:26.519> have<00:00:26.939> that

one<00:00:31.550> it's<00:00:32.550> also<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.270> least<00:00:33.540> stable<00:00:34.340> it<00:00:35.340> is

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
one it's also the least stable it is

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.240 
one it's also the least stable it is
also<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.910> one<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.420> will<00:00:36.899> crash<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.680> most<00:00:37.920> it

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
also the one that will crash the most it

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.860 
also the one that will crash the most it
is<00:00:38.399> also<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.879> one<00:00:39.170> which<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.649> least<00:00:41.870> able

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870

do and it's the one that most hackers or

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.200 
do and it's the one that most hackers or
people<00:00:49.320> with<00:00:49.440> viruses<00:00:49.949> attack<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.059> has

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
people with viruses attack so it has

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.760 
people with viruses attack so it has
some<00:00:51.420> loopholes<00:00:51.920> no<00:00:53.719> it's<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.440> browser

on the internet so basically this is
just<00:04:22.840> an<00:04:22.960> introduction<00:04:23.650> to<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:26.110> three

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
just an introduction to the three

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.220 
just an introduction to the three
browsers<00:04:29.310> again<00:04:30.310> Internet<00:04:30.730> Explorer<00:04:31.150> is<00:04:31.570> the

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
browsers again Internet Explorer is the

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.550 
browsers again Internet Explorer is the
most<00:04:32.680> popular<00:04:33.280> browser<00:04:34.150> at<00:04:34.630> the<00:04:34.930> moment<00:04:35.320> but

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
most popular browser at the moment but

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.840 
most popular browser at the moment but
it's<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:35.830> one<00:04:35.950> that<00:04:36.100> I<00:04:36.160> would<00:04:36.220> recommend<00:04:36.730> at

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
it's the one that I would recommend at

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.530 
it's the one that I would recommend at
least<00:04:37.150> what<00:04:38.110> I<00:04:38.140> recommend<00:04:38.920> is<00:04:39.310> for<00:04:39.760> you<00:04:39.880> to<00:04:40.330> get

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
least what I recommend is for you to get

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.200 
least what I recommend is for you to get
into<00:04:40.810> Internet<00:04:41.350> Explorer<00:04:41.770> and<00:04:42.070> you<00:04:42.130> would<00:04:43.030> go

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
into Internet Explorer and you would go

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.620 
into Internet Explorer and you would go
and<00:04:43.510> you<00:04:43.600> would<00:04:43.660> search<00:04:44.020> for<00:04:44.320> Google<00:04:45.100> Chrome

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
and you would search for Google Chrome

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.210 
and you would search for Google Chrome
once<00:04:46.630> you<00:04:46.810> once<00:04:47.110> you<00:04:47.200> find<00:04:47.470> Google<00:04:47.770> Chrome<00:04:48.040> on

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
once you once you find Google Chrome on

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.890 
once you once you find Google Chrome on
the<00:04:48.250> Internet<00:04:48.670> you're<00:04:49.180> gonna<00:04:49.300> download<00:04:49.630> that

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
the Internet you're gonna download that

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.530 
the Internet you're gonna download that
and<00:04:50.550> that's<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.820> one<00:04:52.000> then<00:04:52.270> that<00:04:52.450> would

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
and that's the one then that would

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.750 
and that's the one then that would
become<00:04:52.840> your<00:04:52.960> default<00:04:53.350> browser<00:04:53.440> from<00:04:54.370> then<00:04:54.610> on

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
become your default browser from then on

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.880 
become your default browser from then on
so<00:04:55.030> you'd<00:04:55.180> be<00:04:55.330> able<00:04:55.510> to<00:04:55.600> use<00:04:55.810> Google<00:04:56.710> Chrome

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
so you'd be able to use Google Chrome

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.830 
so you'd be able to use Google Chrome
