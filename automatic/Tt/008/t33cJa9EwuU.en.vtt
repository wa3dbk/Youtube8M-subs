one of that we have one of the

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.380 
one of that we have one of the
advantages<00:03:48.160> about<00:03:48.250> this<00:03:48.580> helicopter<00:03:49.090> that's

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
advantages about this helicopter that's

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.810 
advantages about this helicopter that's

have our RC remote as you can see it's

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.850 
have our RC remote as you can see it's
mentioned<00:04:37.700> over<00:04:38.000> here<00:04:38.090> that<00:04:39.080> there's<00:04:39.770> a

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
mentioned over here that there's a

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.030 
mentioned over here that there's a
infrared<00:04:40.550> control<00:04:41.240> and<00:04:41.650> there<00:04:42.650> we<00:04:42.770> have<00:04:43.010> our

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
infrared control and there we have our

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.750 
infrared control and there we have our
lifting<00:04:44.000> and<00:04:44.710> landing<00:04:45.710> stick<00:04:46.490> or<00:04:46.670> whatever

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
lifting and landing stick or whatever

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.760 
lifting and landing stick or whatever
you<00:04:47.090> want<00:04:47.240> to<00:04:47.270> call<00:04:47.420> it<00:04:47.600> there's<00:04:48.230> a<00:04:48.290> left-right

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
you want to call it there's a left-right

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.950 
you want to call it there's a left-right
control<00:04:49.370> there<00:04:49.700> here<00:04:49.940> we<00:04:50.120> have<00:04:50.300> our<00:04:50.480> trimmers

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
control there here we have our trimmers

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.900 
control there here we have our trimmers
it's<00:04:51.860> kind<00:04:52.130> of<00:04:52.190> like<00:04:52.370> a<00:04:52.750> ps2<00:04:53.750> controller<00:04:54.080> hood

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
it's kind of like a ps2 controller hood

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.610 
it's kind of like a ps2 controller hood
pretty<00:04:55.910> nice<00:04:57.520> yeah<00:04:58.520> so<00:04:59.210> and<00:04:59.570> there<00:05:00.350> we<00:05:00.470> have

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
pretty nice yeah so and there we have

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.960 
pretty nice yeah so and there we have
our<00:05:00.650> switch<00:05:01.660> so<00:05:02.660> um<00:05:03.340> when<00:05:04.340> you<00:05:04.430> oh<00:05:04.460> there's<00:05:04.850> a

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
our switch so um when you oh there's a

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.690 
our switch so um when you oh there's a
slot<00:05:05.210> over<00:05:05.390> here<00:05:05.630> when<00:05:06.230> you<00:05:06.320> open<00:05:06.740> it<00:05:06.860> a<00:05:07.070> wire

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
slot over here when you open it a wire

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.570 
slot over here when you open it a wire
type<00:05:07.940> of<00:05:08.060> things<00:05:08.240> thing<00:05:08.900> comes<00:05:09.140> out<00:05:09.380> to<00:05:10.310> charge

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
type of things thing comes out to charge

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.240 
type of things thing comes out to charge
the<00:05:10.760> helicopter<00:05:11.330> so<00:05:11.720> you<00:05:12.320> can<00:05:12.530> just<00:05:12.890> take<00:05:13.220> your

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
the helicopter so you can just take your

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.700 
the helicopter so you can just take your
helicopter<00:05:14.120> and<00:05:14.630> place<00:05:14.960> the<00:05:15.260> wire<00:05:15.470> and<00:05:15.770> the

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
helicopter and place the wire and the

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.640 
helicopter and place the wire and the
space<00:05:18.710> over<00:05:18.950> here<00:05:19.010> to<00:05:19.729> charge<00:05:20.000> it<00:05:20.180> like<00:05:20.900> that

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
space over here to charge it like that

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.370 
space over here to charge it like that
and<00:05:21.890> when<00:05:22.760> you<00:05:22.880> turn<00:05:23.120> on<00:05:23.240> the<00:05:23.419> remote<00:05:23.690> you<00:05:24.320> can

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
and when you turn on the remote you can

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.190 
and when you turn on the remote you can
see<00:05:24.620> a<00:05:24.650> green<00:05:24.890> light<00:05:25.070> turn<00:05:25.280> on<00:05:25.510> so<00:05:26.510> it<00:05:26.990> means

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
see a green light turn on so it means

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.380 
see a green light turn on so it means
that<00:05:27.350> it's<00:05:27.590> charging<00:05:27.830> so<00:05:28.550> when<00:05:29.090> the

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
that it's charging so when the

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.780 
that it's charging so when the
helicopter<00:05:30.050> is<00:05:30.169> fully<00:05:30.380> charged<00:05:30.890> the<00:05:31.610> green

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790 
helicopter is fully charged the green

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.000 
helicopter is fully charged the green
light<00:05:32.000> turns<00:05:32.300> to<00:05:32.479> red<00:05:32.630> so<00:05:33.380> that's<00:05:33.830> our

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
light turns to red so that's our

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.800 
light turns to red so that's our
indicator<00:05:34.430> so<00:05:35.150> let's<00:05:35.330> just<00:05:35.450> turn<00:05:35.630> that<00:05:35.660> off

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
indicator so let's just turn that off

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:41.520 
indicator so let's just turn that off
now<00:05:35.979> and<00:05:38.440> let's<00:05:39.440> just<00:05:39.650> put<00:05:39.830> this<00:05:39.979> aside<00:05:40.130> um

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
now and let's just put this aside um

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.320 
now and let's just put this aside um
we'll<00:05:42.530> just<00:05:42.710> uh<00:05:42.890> don't<00:05:43.700> really<00:05:43.940> need<00:05:44.060> to<00:05:44.180> put

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
we'll just uh don't really need to put

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:50.950 
we'll just uh don't really need to put
that<00:05:44.510> back<00:05:45.820> there<00:05:46.820> we<00:05:46.970> go<00:05:47.180> and<00:05:47.390> open<00:05:47.600> up<00:05:48.169> or<00:05:49.960> bad

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
that back there we go and open up or bad

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.240 
that back there we go and open up or bad
nice<00:05:51.229> lob<00:05:51.560> so<00:05:52.180> there<00:05:53.180> are<00:05:53.330> six<00:05:54.160> double<00:05:55.160> A

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
nice lob so there are six double A

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.820 
nice lob so there are six double A
batteries<00:05:55.280> required<00:05:56.110> one<00:05:57.110> two<00:05:57.320> three<00:05:57.590> four

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
batteries required one two three four

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.230 
batteries required one two three four
five<00:05:58.040> six<00:05:58.280> as<00:05:58.490> you<00:05:58.580> can<00:05:58.729> see<00:05:58.910> I<00:05:58.940> already

00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 
five six as you can see I already

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.600 
five six as you can see I already
installed<00:05:59.780> the<00:05:59.900> batteries<00:06:00.020> so<00:06:00.500> let's<00:06:01.490> just

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
installed the batteries so let's just

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.920 
installed the batteries so let's just
close<00:06:01.820> that<00:06:01.850> up<00:06:03.550> and<00:06:04.550> that's<00:06:05.000> about<00:06:05.120> it

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
close that up and that's about it

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.890 
close that up and that's about it
yeah<00:06:07.530> um<00:06:07.919> the<00:06:08.820> bars<00:06:09.030> coming<00:06:09.389> out<00:06:09.570> let's<00:06:09.720> just

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
yeah um the bars coming out let's just

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.080 
yeah um the bars coming out let's just
put<00:06:10.080> it<00:06:10.169> on<00:06:10.229> charge<00:06:10.650> too<00:06:11.220> so<00:06:11.880> that<00:06:12.030> the

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
put it on charge too so that the

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.939 
put it on charge too so that the
helicopter<00:06:12.570> can<00:06:12.750> be<00:06:12.780> charged<00:06:13.290> a<00:06:13.380> bit<00:06:13.560> let's

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:13.949 
helicopter can be charged a bit let's

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:16.279 
helicopter can be charged a bit let's
just<00:06:14.070> turn<00:06:14.220> that<00:06:14.280> on<00:06:14.460> and<00:06:15.020> that's<00:06:16.020> about<00:06:16.139> it
