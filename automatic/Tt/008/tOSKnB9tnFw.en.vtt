how you turn it on and you just keep

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.549 
how you turn it on and you just keep
turning<00:00:44.789> it<00:00:45.059> until<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.629> comes<00:00:45.809> off<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.350> you'll

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
turning it until it comes off and you'll

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.040 
turning it until it comes off and you'll
see<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.950> module<00:00:47.370> with<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.850> focusing<00:00:48.329> knob<00:00:48.750> in

make sure the laser diode pins don't get

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.149 
make sure the laser diode pins don't get
distorted<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.930> mag<00:01:07.110> light<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.950> means

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
distorted in the mag light that means

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.280 
distorted in the mag light that means
hold<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.729> base<00:01:08.909> here<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.540> twist<00:01:10.320> up<00:01:10.619> here

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
twist counterclockwise to make to being

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.899 
twist counterclockwise to make to being
larger<00:01:15.060> or<00:01:15.540> clockwise<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.320> make<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.590> smaller

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
larger or clockwise to make it smaller

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.550 
larger or clockwise to make it smaller
set<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.030> focus<00:01:18.240> but<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.810> batteries<00:01:19.140> back<00:01:19.320> in

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
set the focus but the batteries back in

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.100 
set the focus but the batteries back in
and<00:01:19.860> test<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.460> against<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.970> wall<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.900> this

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
and test it against the wall in this

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.109 
and test it against the wall in this
case<00:01:22.290> I'll<00:01:22.619> use<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.920> piece<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.250> paper<00:01:23.400> to

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
case I'll use this piece of paper to

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.609 
case I'll use this piece of paper to
test<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.479> on<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:25.280> so<00:01:26.689> you<00:01:27.689> just<00:01:27.869> adjust<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.439> a

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
test it on and so you just adjust it a

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.550 
test it on and so you just adjust it a
little<00:01:28.650> bit<00:01:29.240> to<00:01:30.240> whatever<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.659> think<00:01:30.900> might

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
little bit to whatever you think might

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.320 
little bit to whatever you think might
be<00:01:31.680> good<00:01:32.630> put<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.960> batteries<00:01:34.650> back<00:01:34.920> in

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.080 

and<00:01:38.630> you<00:01:39.140> can<00:01:39.260> see<00:01:39.410> the<00:01:39.440> beam<00:01:39.680> right<00:01:39.950> there<00:01:40.190> so

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
and you can see the beam right there so

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.900 
and you can see the beam right there so
it's<00:01:42.080> going<00:01:42.200> to<00:01:42.260> be<00:01:42.410> about<00:01:43.330> six<00:01:44.330> inches<00:01:45.700> so<00:01:46.700> we

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
it's going to be about six inches so we

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:47.830 
it's going to be about six inches so we
want<00:01:47.060> it<00:01:47.150> to<00:01:47.180> be<00:01:47.330> a<00:01:47.360> little<00:01:47.420> bit<00:01:47.600> further

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
want it to be a little bit further

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.060 
want it to be a little bit further
because<00:01:48.170> we're<00:01:48.410> going<00:01:48.500> to<00:01:48.590> light<00:01:48.710> this<00:01:48.740> fire

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
because we're going to light this fire

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:56.580 
because we're going to light this fire
work<00:01:49.900> so<00:01:50.900> you<00:01:50.990> adjust<00:01:51.500> it<00:01:51.620> again

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.419 

see<00:01:57.250> now<00:01:57.429> it's<00:01:57.640> about<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.840> foot<00:01:59.200> so<00:02:00.159> that's

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
see now it's about the foot so that's

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:01.950 
see now it's about the foot so that's
that's<00:02:00.850> probably<00:02:01.210> pretty<00:02:01.329> good<00:02:01.600> for<00:02:01.869> this

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
that's probably pretty good for this

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.709 
that's probably pretty good for this
firework<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:05.909> I'm<00:02:06.909> going<00:02:07.090> to<00:02:07.119> put<00:02:07.299> this<00:02:07.329> top

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
firework and I'm going to put this top
