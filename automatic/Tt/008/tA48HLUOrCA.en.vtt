00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.420
 SM-Drifting future is ruined. 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.420
 Here is a building kit to one seat fastening. 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.140
 Drilled these plates last time, 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.640
 and, 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.280
 Nut will be welded to other side. 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.660
 Did i even put this to the right side. 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:49.630
 I guess so. 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.580
 So, little bit something like this it should be. 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.140
 Then here, too 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.254
 rectangular pipes. 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.880
 and, 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.700
 these plates should be welded to the top of these pipes. 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.560
 Then this whole set will go between skirt and drive shaft tunnel. 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.780
 I need to drill ferrule to these pipes so i can get bolts trough and 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.300
 there i'll bolt seats on. 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.840
 Let's see what we can do here. 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.860
 Well, i think they are all welded. 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.240
 Ok, now it fits good. 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.240
 Car building sucks ass sometimes, 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.680
 so lets go to see how winter cars handle snow! 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.480
 Here you see! 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.580
 Driving slowly front of me and Braking. 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.600
 This happends. 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:03.520
 That's the end. 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.500
 SM-Drifting future is ruined! 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.540
 How about two layers? 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.160
 Or just .. Something ... 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.580
 Woops. 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
 Luisu is in ditch somewhere. 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.160
 Who has my Molding? 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 I came to that corner there, 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.940
 then i relized it wont make it! 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.900
 But i still gotta try, because if i push brake it just go straight to pushes. 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.800
 Pedal to metal, turns turns, and then it went to the ditch. 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.200
 Oh, well!
