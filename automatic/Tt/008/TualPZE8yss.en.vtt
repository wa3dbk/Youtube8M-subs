00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
thing I want to show is what's called

post<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:20.820> mental<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.750> actually<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.170> Greek

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
post and mental this is actually a Greek

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.060 
post and mental this is actually a Greek
style<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.220> architecture<00:00:24.000> that<00:00:24.930> has<00:00:25.830> two

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
style of architecture that has two

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.130 
style of architecture that has two
pillars<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.820> has<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:26.970> beam<00:00:27.300> going<00:00:27.990> across

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
pillars and it has a beam going across

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.650 
pillars and it has a beam going across
the<00:00:28.590> top<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:29.279> reason<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.730> Romans<00:00:30.060> the

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
the top the reason is the Romans the

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.939 
the top the reason is the Romans the
reason<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.050> Romans<00:00:31.260> didn't<00:00:31.470> care<00:00:31.710> for<00:00:31.740> that

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
reason the Romans didn't care for that

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.060 
reason the Romans didn't care for that
as<00:00:32.099> much<00:00:32.279> was<00:00:33.199> the<00:00:34.199> too<00:00:34.350> much<00:00:34.500> stress<00:00:34.800> the

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
as much was the too much stress the

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.549 
as much was the too much stress the
middle<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.519> the<00:00:35.640> beam<00:00:35.850> would<00:00:36.120> break<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:37.410> they

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
middle of the beam would break so they

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.819 
middle of the beam would break so they
tried<00:00:37.950> doing<00:00:38.190> arches<00:00:39.469> arches<00:00:40.469> were<00:00:40.590> great

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
tried doing arches arches were great

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.410 
tried doing arches arches were great
because<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.280> takes<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.670> stress<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.270> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
because it takes the stress and the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.420 
because it takes the stress and the
weight<00:00:42.660> from<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.989> top<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.530> root<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.860> it

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
weight from the top of the root and it

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.130 
weight from the top of the root and it
pulls<00:00:44.790> it<00:00:44.940> down<00:00:44.969> all<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.570> way<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.930> bottom

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
pulls it down all the way to the bottom

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.139 
pulls it down all the way to the bottom
of<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.649> foundation<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.850> evenly

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
of the foundation so it evenly

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.970 
of the foundation so it evenly
distributes<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.840> stress<00:00:49.170> throughout<00:00:49.680> any

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
distributes the stress throughout any

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.360 
distributes the stress throughout any
cracking<00:00:50.340> or<00:00:50.640> breaking<00:00:51.680> they<00:00:52.680> used<00:00:52.950> it<00:00:53.219> in

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
cracking or breaking they used it in

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.889 
cracking or breaking they used it in
different<00:00:53.670> designs<00:00:53.910> so<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.329> have<00:00:54.510> arches

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
different designs so you have arches

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.619 
different designs so you have arches
that<00:00:55.020> are<00:00:55.250> put<00:00:56.250> one<00:00:56.460> after<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.789> other<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.420> are

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
that are put one after the other and are

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.450 
that are put one after the other and are
wrong<00:00:57.750> roads<00:00:58.050> make<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.649> called<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:59.010> barrel

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
wrong roads make this is called a barrel

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.939 
wrong roads make this is called a barrel
or<00:00:59.699> a<00:01:00.059> tunnel<00:01:00.840> vault<00:01:02.660> you<00:01:03.660> will<00:01:03.780> see<00:01:03.989> has<00:01:04.559> extra

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
or a tunnel vault you will see has extra

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.170 
or a tunnel vault you will see has extra
thick<00:01:05.129> walls<00:01:05.399> in<00:01:05.550> societies<00:01:05.940> we<00:01:06.030> call

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
thick walls in societies we call

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.320 
thick walls in societies we call
buttresses<00:01:07.009> this<00:01:08.009> helps<00:01:08.430> prevent<00:01:08.729> any

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
buttresses this helps prevent any

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.800 
buttresses this helps prevent any
structure<00:01:11.299> problems<00:01:12.299> like<00:01:12.479> cracking

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
structure problems like cracking

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.870 
structure problems like cracking
breaking<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.799> just<00:01:14.070> adds<00:01:14.310> more<00:01:14.610> stability

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
breaking that just adds more stability

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.510 
breaking that just adds more stability
to<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.560> over<00:01:16.560> here<00:01:16.680> we<00:01:16.770> have<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.920> groin<00:01:17.189> vault

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
to it over here we have a groin vault

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.539 
to it over here we have a groin vault
and<00:01:18.020> here<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.110> have<00:01:19.320> arches<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.159> quarter

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
and here you have arches and a quarter

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.130 
and here you have arches and a quarter
right<00:01:20.670> angles<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.090> each<00:01:21.210> other<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.720> it

right angles to each other and it

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.539 
right angles to each other and it
creates<00:01:22.380> almost<00:01:22.500> like<00:01:22.680> an<00:01:22.920> intersection<00:01:23.280> of

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
never used before the Romans they

never used before the Romans they
invented<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:33.509> was<00:01:33.720> cheaper<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.110> produce

much easier to set in place they used

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.380 
much easier to set in place they used
all<00:01:40.890> these<00:01:41.070> to<00:01:41.250> protect<00:01:41.579> meats<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.119> many

all these to protect meats and many

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.539 
all these to protect meats and many
different<00:01:42.600> on<00:01:42.960> buildings<00:01:43.530> but<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.100> think<00:01:44.430> one

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
different on buildings but I think one

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.830 
different on buildings but I think one
of<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.700> most<00:01:44.790> famous<00:01:45.119> buildings<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.689> ever

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
of the most famous buildings to ever

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.960 
of the most famous buildings to ever
built<00:01:46.170> using<00:01:46.770> these<00:01:47.070> techniques<00:01:47.460> was<00:01:47.790> the

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
built using these techniques was the

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:56.550 
built using these techniques was the
Pantheon

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.590 

the<00:01:57.040> Pantheon<00:01:57.430> shows<00:01:57.760> many<00:01:58.119> different<00:01:58.450> types

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
the Pantheon shows many different types

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.830 
the Pantheon shows many different types
of<00:01:58.780> techniques<00:01:59.460> they<00:02:00.460> did<00:02:00.790> use<00:02:01.060> post<00:02:01.690> and

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
of techniques they did use post and

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.600 
of techniques they did use post and
lintel<00:02:02.080> for<00:02:02.260> different<00:02:02.500> parts<00:02:02.680> of<00:02:02.770> it<00:02:02.920> as<00:02:03.430> you

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
lintel for different parts of it as you

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.100 
lintel for different parts of it as you
can<00:02:03.729> see<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:03.970> front<00:02:04.210> foyer<00:02:04.510> area<00:02:04.720> used<00:02:05.049> to

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
can see the front foyer area used to

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.870 
can see the front foyer area used to
poke<00:02:05.320> some<00:02:05.350> lentil<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:06.250> reason<00:02:06.610> they<00:02:06.729> could

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
poke some lentil the reason they could

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.520 
poke some lentil the reason they could
do<00:02:07.000> this<00:02:07.180> is<00:02:07.360> because<00:02:07.600> it<00:02:07.720> only<00:02:07.869> supports<00:02:08.440> the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
do this is because it only supports the

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.199 
do this is because it only supports the
roof<00:02:08.800> it<00:02:09.009> actually<00:02:09.340> does<00:02:09.490> not<00:02:09.520> support<00:02:10.030> the

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
roof it actually does not support the

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.570 
roof it actually does not support the
dome<00:02:10.390> at<00:02:10.539> all<00:02:10.690> so<00:02:11.440> if<00:02:11.800> you<00:02:11.950> use<00:02:12.100> it<00:02:12.250> using

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
dome at all so if you use it using

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.190 
dome at all so if you use it using
pillars<00:02:12.910> and<00:02:13.120> makes<00:02:13.450> it<00:02:13.600> look<00:02:13.660> very<00:02:13.930> pretty

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
pillars and makes it look very pretty

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.250 
pillars and makes it look very pretty
and<00:02:14.950> so<00:02:15.850> I<00:02:15.910> will<00:02:16.120> go<00:02:16.270> through<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:17.140> other

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
and so I will go through the other

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.210 
and so I will go through the other
techniques<00:02:17.739> used

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.230 

if<00:02:21.220> you<00:02:21.310> look<00:02:21.460> around<00:02:21.550> you<00:02:21.700> can<00:02:21.819> see<00:02:21.970> some<00:02:22.120> more

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
if you look around you can see some more

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.170 
if you look around you can see some more
pillars<00:02:22.800> this<00:02:23.800> is<00:02:23.950> more<00:02:24.190> emotional<00:02:24.430> until<00:02:24.940> use

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
pillars this is more emotional until use

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.880 
pillars this is more emotional until use
on<00:02:25.450> parts<00:02:25.840> of<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.110> wall<00:02:26.319> but<00:02:26.560> it<00:02:26.650> does<00:02:26.770> not

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
on parts of the wall but it does not

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.320 
on parts of the wall but it does not
support<00:02:27.069> the<00:02:27.370> entire<00:02:27.610> wall<00:02:27.819> itself<00:02:28.180> it<00:02:28.300> just

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
support the entire wall itself it just

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.110 
support the entire wall itself it just
adds<00:02:28.630> to<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:29.020> support<00:02:29.410> if<00:02:30.400> you<00:02:30.550> look<00:02:30.790> straight

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
adds to the support if you look straight

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.960 
adds to the support if you look straight
up<00:02:31.150> we<00:02:31.930> have<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.230> dome<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:33.459> dome<00:02:33.490> is<00:02:33.790> actually

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
up we have the dome the dome is actually

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
up we have the dome the dome is actually
a<00:02:34.860> 360<00:02:35.860> degree<00:02:36.160> arch<00:02:36.430> which<00:02:37.209> adds<00:02:37.540> much

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
a 360 degree arch which adds much

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.260 
a 360 degree arch which adds much
stability<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:39.190> it's<00:02:39.400> also<00:02:39.580> made<00:02:39.940> out<00:02:40.240> of

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
stability and it's also made out of

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.880 
stability and it's also made out of
concrete<00:02:40.800> so<00:02:41.800> they're<00:02:41.950> able<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.400> make<00:02:43.360> it<00:02:43.890> more

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
concrete so they're able to make it more

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.199 
concrete so they're able to make it more
cheaper<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:45.520> more<00:02:45.820> efficiently<00:02:47.100> the<00:02:48.209> style

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
cheaper and more efficiently the style

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.960 
cheaper and more efficiently the style
of<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.480> dome<00:02:49.660> because<00:02:50.020> it's<00:02:50.459> 360<00:02:51.459> degree<00:02:51.790> arch

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
of the dome because it's 360 degree arch

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.240 
of the dome because it's 360 degree arch
actually<00:02:52.930> takes<00:02:53.140> all<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.650> stress<00:02:53.680> and

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
actually takes all the stress and

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.770 
actually takes all the stress and
distributes<00:02:54.730> it<00:02:54.850> all<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.209> way<00:02:55.300> down<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.690> the

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
distributes it all the way down to the

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.470 
distributes it all the way down to the
foundations<00:02:56.440> of<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.680> Pantheon<00:02:57.160> which<00:02:57.760> one<00:02:58.420> of

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
foundations of the Pantheon which one of

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.090 
foundations of the Pantheon which one of
the<00:02:58.570> reasons<00:02:58.840> why<00:02:58.959> it<00:02:59.110> still<00:02:59.440> survives<00:02:59.860> it

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
the reasons why it still survives it

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.420 
the reasons why it still survives it
still<00:03:00.340> lasts<00:03:00.550> and<00:03:00.820> right<00:03:01.060> now<00:03:02.220> if<00:03:03.220> you<00:03:03.310> look

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
still lasts and right now if you look

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.330 
still lasts and right now if you look
closer<00:03:03.640> at<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.000> sides<00:03:04.239> you<00:03:04.390> could<00:03:04.480> see<00:03:04.660> the

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
closer at the sides you could see the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.759 
closer at the sides you could see the
arches<00:03:06.340> of<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:07.170> developers<00:03:08.170> that<00:03:08.260> comes<00:03:08.470> from

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
arches of the developers that comes from

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.940 
arches of the developers that comes from
Cornero<00:03:09.450> arches<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:10.690> little<00:03:10.900> own<00:03:11.080> inventions

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
Cornero arches and little own inventions

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.800 
Cornero arches and little own inventions
in<00:03:12.040> here<00:03:12.250> the<00:03:12.850> Pantheon<00:03:13.360> was<00:03:13.390> actually

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
in here the Pantheon was actually

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.509 
in here the Pantheon was actually
decorated<00:03:14.320> multiple<00:03:15.100> different<00:03:15.250> times

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
decorated multiple different times

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.729 
decorated multiple different times
depending<00:03:15.760> on<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.290> timeframe

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
depending on the timeframe

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.040 
depending on the timeframe
I<00:03:17.800> think<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.610> Renaissance<00:03:19.090> age<00:03:19.360> actually<00:03:19.930> had

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
I think the Renaissance age actually had

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.710 
I think the Renaissance age actually had
the<00:03:20.140> most<00:03:20.350> decorated<00:03:20.739> the<00:03:21.280> most<00:03:21.580> art<00:03:21.850> and<00:03:22.150> then

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
the most decorated the most art and then

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.250 
the most decorated the most art and then
had<00:03:22.870> many<00:03:23.110> statues<00:03:23.709> and<00:03:24.010> tombs<00:03:24.459> and<00:03:24.700> what<00:03:24.820> not

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
had many statues and tombs and what not

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.660 
had many statues and tombs and what not
couldn't<00:03:26.260> actually<00:03:26.350> build<00:03:26.739> statues<00:03:27.040> a<00:03:27.310> little

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
couldn't actually build statues a little

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.640 
couldn't actually build statues a little
bit<00:03:27.790> bad<00:03:28.030> in<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.269> platform<00:03:28.780> but<00:03:29.290> this<00:03:29.500> is

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
bit bad in the platform but this is

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.160 
bit bad in the platform but this is
where<00:03:29.860> these<00:03:30.070> statues<00:03:30.459> will<00:03:30.730> be<00:03:30.850> located<00:03:31.180> you

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
where these statues will be located you

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.020 
where these statues will be located you
have<00:03:32.350> some<00:03:32.650> of<00:03:32.769> different<00:03:33.070> Caesars<00:03:33.400> different

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
have some of different Caesars different

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.680 
have some of different Caesars different
Romans<00:03:34.360> emperors<00:03:35.170> and<00:03:35.290> things<00:03:35.470> like<00:03:35.590> that

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
Romans emperors and things like that

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.720 
Romans emperors and things like that
it's<00:03:37.690> a<00:03:37.750> great<00:03:38.019> place<00:03:38.350> I'd<00:03:38.560> say<00:03:39.220> one<00:03:39.549> of<00:03:39.579> the

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
it's a great place I'd say one of the

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.759 
it's a great place I'd say one of the
only<00:03:40.480> problems<00:03:40.900> with<00:03:41.049> the<00:03:41.170> Pantheon<00:03:41.620> is

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
only problems with the Pantheon is

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.340 
only problems with the Pantheon is
you'll<00:03:42.310> notice<00:03:42.459> it<00:03:42.670> does<00:03:42.880> have<00:03:42.910> a<00:03:43.329> sky<00:03:43.900> open

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
you'll notice it does have a sky open

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.340 
you'll notice it does have a sky open
and<00:03:44.500> at<00:03:44.799> the<00:03:44.950> top<00:03:45.130> of<00:03:45.400> the<00:03:45.519> dome<00:03:45.959> that<00:03:46.959> lets<00:03:47.170> in

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
and at the top of the dome that lets in

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.460 
and at the top of the dome that lets in
air<00:03:47.650> it<00:03:48.070> lets<00:03:48.310> in<00:03:48.430> sunlight<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:49.750> only<00:03:50.049> problem

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
air it lets in sunlight the only problem

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.990 
air it lets in sunlight the only problem
is<00:03:50.620> when<00:03:51.040> it<00:03:51.400> rains<00:03:52.200> not<00:03:53.200> good<00:03:53.790> but<00:03:54.790> this<00:03:54.880> is

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
is when it rains not good but this is

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.340 
is when it rains not good but this is
the<00:03:55.060> only<00:03:55.150> downfall<00:03:55.360> I<00:03:55.600> can<00:03:55.750> really<00:03:55.900> see<00:03:56.110> about

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
the only downfall I can really see about

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.150 
the only downfall I can really see about
the<00:03:56.530> Pentagon<00:03:56.980> otherwise<00:03:57.840> it<00:03:58.840> is<00:03:59.019> a<00:03:59.049> truly<00:04:00.040> a

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
the Pentagon otherwise it is a truly a

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.930 
the Pentagon otherwise it is a truly a
marvel<00:04:00.489> of<00:04:00.850> the<00:04:00.880> ancient<00:04:01.299> world<00:04:02.010> so<00:04:03.010> I<00:04:03.040> hope

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
marvel of the ancient world so I hope

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.670 
marvel of the ancient world so I hope
this<00:04:04.150> helps<00:04:04.690> demonstrate<00:04:04.930> some<00:04:05.560> of<00:04:05.590> the

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
this helps demonstrate some of the

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.740 
this helps demonstrate some of the
different<00:04:06.010> techniques<00:04:06.190> used<00:04:07.060> by<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:07.299> Romans

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
different techniques used by the Romans

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.750 
different techniques used by the Romans
from<00:04:07.870> opposing<00:04:08.230> mental<00:04:08.799> with<00:04:09.340> many<00:04:09.549> different

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
from opposing mental with many different

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.740 
from opposing mental with many different
varying<00:04:10.480> degrees<00:04:11.489> arches<00:04:12.489> they<00:04:13.299> also<00:04:13.450> have

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
varying degrees arches they also have

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.550 
varying degrees arches they also have
concrete<00:04:14.880> and<00:04:15.880> these<00:04:16.660> are<00:04:16.750> all<00:04:16.870> used<00:04:17.109> very

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
concrete and these are all used very

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.440 
concrete and these are all used very
very<00:04:17.829> well<00:04:18.010> a<00:04:18.310> lot<00:04:18.880> of<00:04:18.910> times<00:04:19.060> people<00:04:19.419> think

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
very well a lot of times people think

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.950 
very well a lot of times people think
that<00:04:19.890> we're<00:04:20.890> much<00:04:21.070> more<00:04:21.310> advanced<00:04:21.910> than<00:04:22.150> other

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
that we're much more advanced than other

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.340 
that we're much more advanced than other
civilizations<00:04:23.620> in<00:04:23.770> some<00:04:23.979> extent<00:04:24.190> that's<00:04:24.340> true

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
civilizations in some extent that's true

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.220 
civilizations in some extent that's true
but<00:04:26.350> they<00:04:26.770> were<00:04:26.830> very<00:04:26.950> advanced<00:04:27.610> for<00:04:27.640> the<00:04:27.820> time

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
but they were very advanced for the time

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.530 
but they were very advanced for the time
as<00:04:28.290> well<00:04:28.560> so<00:04:29.550> I<00:04:29.580> think<00:04:29.760> we<00:04:29.970> can<00:04:30.120> learn<00:04:30.240> a<00:04:30.300> lot

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
as well so I think we can learn a lot

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.480 
as well so I think we can learn a lot
