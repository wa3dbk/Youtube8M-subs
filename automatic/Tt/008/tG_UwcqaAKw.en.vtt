hands or small hands or unlimited reach
with<00:00:24.330> your<00:00:24.359> fingers<00:00:25.310> which<00:00:26.310> means<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:27.300> when

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
with your fingers which means that when

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.070 
with your fingers which means that when
it<00:00:27.960> comes<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.500> actually<00:00:28.800> reaching<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:30.080> rear

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
it comes to actually reaching the rear

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.889 
it comes to actually reaching the rear
cleavers<00:00:31.590> when<00:00:32.160> you're<00:00:32.309> on<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.430> drops<00:00:32.899> you

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
cleavers when you're on the drops you

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.840 
cleavers when you're on the drops you
struggle<00:00:34.350> basic<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.309> only<00:00:35.399> can<00:00:35.550> reach<00:00:35.670> them

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
struggle basic you only can reach them

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.000 
struggle basic you only can reach them
with<00:00:35.940> your<00:00:36.090> tips<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.600> it's<00:00:37.350> not<00:00:37.530> very<00:00:37.739> safe

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
with your tips and it's not very safe

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.260 
with your tips and it's not very safe
basically<00:00:39.410> so<00:00:40.610> what<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.700> can<00:00:41.820> do<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.210> can

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
which is just for either eight degrees

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.750 
which is just for either eight degrees
of<00:00:54.120> reach<00:00:54.329> or<00:00:54.629> four<00:00:55.110> degrees<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.500> reach<00:00:55.760> when

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
of reach or four degrees of reach when

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
sets of spacers you'll actually get the

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.320 
sets of spacers you'll actually get the
four<00:01:04.260> degrees<00:01:04.589> spaces<00:01:05.070> which<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.939> one<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.210> them

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
four degrees spaces which is one of them

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.690 
four degrees spaces which is one of them
here<00:01:07.010> you<00:01:08.010> can<00:01:08.220> see<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.950> actual<00:01:11.189> size<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.640> the

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
on the four degree spacer compared to

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:18.289 
on the four degree spacer compared to
the<00:01:16.799> actual<00:01:17.100> eight<00:01:17.280> degrees<00:01:17.640> space<00:01:17.909> rep<00:01:18.150> which

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
the actual eight degrees space rep which

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.929 
the actual eight degrees space rep which
I've<00:01:18.450> actually<00:01:18.630> installed<00:01:19.700> so<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.759> actually

need to line up with the actual shifter

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.209 
need to line up with the actual shifter
inside<00:01:54.350> what<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.380> need<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.649> do<00:01:55.740> first<00:01:55.979> of<00:01:56.130> all

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
inside what you need to do first of all

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.429 
inside what you need to do first of all
though<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:57.509> before<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.320> actually

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
install the shifter so I install the

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.069 
install the shifter so I install the
spacer<00:02:00.920> you<00:02:01.920> need<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.790> remove<00:02:03.390> these<00:02:03.659> little

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
spacer you need to remove these little

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.979 
spacer you need to remove these little
kind<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.920> tiny<00:02:05.450> bump<00:02:06.450> rubbers<00:02:07.280> which<00:02:08.280> are

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
kind of tiny bump rubbers which are

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.850 
kind of tiny bump rubbers which are
already<00:02:11.180> fitted

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
already fitted

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.210 
already fitted
just<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.310> smooth<00:02:13.610> off<00:02:14.620> just<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.770> smooth<00:02:16.040> off

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
just to smooth off just to smooth off

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.760 
just to smooth off just to smooth off
the<00:02:17.020> response<00:02:18.020> when<00:02:18.260> you're<00:02:18.380> letting<00:02:18.530> go<00:02:18.620> of

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
the response when you're letting go of

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.030 
the response when you're letting go of
the<00:02:18.950> brake<00:02:19.160> levers<00:02:19.610> so<00:02:20.740> what<00:02:21.740> you<00:02:21.800> need<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:21.980> do

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
the brake levers so what you need to do

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.110 
the brake levers so what you need to do
first<00:02:22.190> of<00:02:22.310> all<00:02:22.400> is<00:02:23.800> basically<00:02:24.970> release<00:02:25.970> your

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
first of all is basically release your

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.380 
first of all is basically release your
brakes<00:02:26.320> on<00:02:27.320> the<00:02:27.410> calipers<00:02:28.180> so<00:02:29.180> you<00:02:29.270> can

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
brakes on the calipers so you can

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.420 
brakes on the calipers so you can
actually<00:02:29.540> get<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:30.470> handle<00:02:30.800> as<00:02:30.890> far<00:02:31.100> back<00:02:31.280> as

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
actually get the handle as far back as

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.400 
actually get the handle as far back as
you<00:02:31.460> can<00:02:32.050> is<00:02:33.050> it<00:02:33.260> touching<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.650> handlebar<00:02:34.160> and

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
you can is it touching the handlebar and

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.050 
you can is it touching the handlebar and
you'll<00:02:36.410> see<00:02:36.680> inside<00:02:37.070> there<00:02:37.370> where<00:02:37.550> the<00:02:37.640> ridges
