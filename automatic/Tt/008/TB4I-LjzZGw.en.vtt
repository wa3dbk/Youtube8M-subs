in<00:02:12.410> my<00:02:12.530> case<00:02:12.590> I<00:02:12.980> needed<00:02:13.190> a<00:02:14.710> 24<00:02:15.710> volt<00:02:15.740> power

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
in my case I needed a 24 volt power

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.550 
in my case I needed a 24 volt power
supply

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
thing together from the air inlet end

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.890 
thing together from the air inlet end
we're<00:02:58.820> just<00:02:59.000> gonna<00:02:59.090> work<00:02:59.390> our<00:02:59.660> way<00:02:59.810> down

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.070 

remember<00:03:02.900> to<00:03:03.080> use<00:03:03.200> teflon<00:03:03.650> tape<00:03:04.840> got<00:03:05.840> to<00:03:05.990> use

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
remember to use teflon tape got to use

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.660 
remember to use teflon tape got to use
teflon<00:03:06.440> tape<00:03:06.620> if<00:03:06.830> not<00:03:06.980> your<00:03:07.190> stuff<00:03:07.370> is<00:03:07.490> gonna

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
teflon tape if not your stuff is gonna

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.460 
teflon tape if not your stuff is gonna
leak

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
leak

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.260 
leak
there's<00:03:09.470> our<00:03:09.620> nipple<00:03:10.010> with<00:03:10.430> our<00:03:10.580> arrow<00:03:10.760> facing

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
there's our nipple with our arrow facing

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:17.740 
there's our nipple with our arrow facing
that<00:03:11.510> way<00:03:15.670> go<00:03:16.670> screw<00:03:16.940> it<00:03:17.000> into<00:03:17.120> our<00:03:17.270> regulator

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
that way go screw it into our regulator

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.630 
that way go screw it into our regulator
and<00:03:18.110> we<00:03:18.470> got<00:03:18.620> to<00:03:18.710> make<00:03:18.800> sure<00:03:18.980> our<00:03:19.010> arrow<00:03:19.370> is

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
and we got to make sure our arrow is

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.000 
and we got to make sure our arrow is
facing<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.780> direction<00:03:20.900> of<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.350> air<00:03:21.440> flow<00:03:21.470> and

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
facing the direction of the air flow and

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.480 
facing the direction of the air flow and
it<00:03:22.370> is<00:03:25.390> we'll<00:03:26.390> go<00:03:26.540> with<00:03:26.720> our<00:03:27.490> quarter-inch

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
it is we'll go with our quarter-inch

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:40.030 
it is we'll go with our quarter-inch
nipple<00:03:31.960> gotta<00:03:32.960> go<00:03:33.170> into<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:33.650> bushing

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:51.370 

now<00:03:40.849> to<00:03:40.909> go<00:03:41.120> into<00:03:41.330> our<00:03:41.540> tea

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:57.370 

now<00:03:52.380> to<00:03:52.440> go<00:03:52.620> into<00:03:52.950> our<00:03:53.130> half<00:03:53.610> inch<00:03:53.790> nipple

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:19.110 

which<00:03:58.380> will<00:03:58.620> go<00:03:58.800> into<00:03:59.130> our<00:03:59.220> solenoid

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.090 

and<00:04:20.120> we'll<00:04:20.240> put<00:04:20.420> our<00:04:20.540> exhaust<00:04:20.870> which<00:04:21.680> is<00:04:21.770> also

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
and we'll put our exhaust which is also

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:31.290 
and we'll put our exhaust which is also
a<00:04:22.130> half<00:04:22.430> inch<00:04:22.670> pipe

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.800 

juster<00:04:31.990> on<00:04:32.140> the<00:04:32.290> final<00:04:32.650> piece<00:04:33.400> of<00:04:33.460> the<00:04:33.670> puzzle

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
juster on the final piece of the puzzle

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.630 
juster on the final piece of the puzzle
that's<00:04:34.810> what<00:04:35.020> goes<00:04:35.140> on<00:04:35.350> to<00:04:35.530> our<00:04:35.620> tank<00:04:38.310> okay<00:04:39.310> as

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:39.640 
that's what goes on to our tank okay as

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.040 
that's what goes on to our tank okay as
you<00:04:39.760> can<00:04:39.790> see<00:04:39.910> we've<00:04:40.210> already<00:04:40.890> built<00:04:41.890> our

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
you can see we've already built our

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.540 
you can see we've already built our
whole<00:04:44.050> assembly<00:04:44.530> and<00:04:44.650> this<00:04:45.070> thing<00:04:45.310> just

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
whole assembly and this thing just

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.030 
whole assembly and this thing just
basically<00:04:46.090> just<00:04:46.360> goes<00:04:46.560> screwed<00:04:47.560> on<00:04:47.710> to<00:04:47.950> the

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
basically just goes screwed on to the

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:54.250 
basically just goes screwed on to the
tank

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.100 

I<00:04:54.290> mean<00:04:54.920> this<00:04:55.010> is<00:04:55.160> a<00:04:55.190> 10<00:04:55.460> gallon<00:04:55.610> tank<00:04:55.820> I<00:04:56.300> have

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
I mean this is a 10 gallon tank I have

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.810 
I mean this is a 10 gallon tank I have
one<00:04:57.410> with<00:04:57.530> a<00:04:57.560> 5<00:04:57.770> gallon<00:04:57.980> I've<00:04:58.280> also<00:04:58.430> made<00:04:58.700> one

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
one with a 5 gallon I've also made one

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.650 
one with a 5 gallon I've also made one
with<00:04:58.940> a<00:04:59.000> 7<00:04:59.900> gallon

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
with a 7 gallon

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.990 
with a 7 gallon
there's<00:05:02.660> your<00:05:02.810> cannon<00:05:03.290> and<00:05:03.590> the<00:05:04.580> next<00:05:04.850> step

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
there's your cannon and the next step

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.030 
there's your cannon and the next step
now<00:05:05.180> I'm<00:05:05.660> gonna<00:05:05.900> show<00:05:06.110> you<00:05:06.170> guys<00:05:06.320> how<00:05:06.650> to<00:05:06.710> wire

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.040 
now I'm gonna show you guys how to wire

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.030 
now I'm gonna show you guys how to wire
it<00:05:07.250> up<00:05:07.900> so<00:05:08.900> you<00:05:09.020> guys<00:05:09.140> can<00:05:09.200> hook<00:05:09.530> it<00:05:09.650> up<00:05:09.740> to<00:05:09.800> like

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
it up so you guys can hook it up to like

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.910 
it up so you guys can hook it up to like
a<00:05:10.070> hand<00:05:10.370> trigger<00:05:10.640> or<00:05:10.910> something<00:05:11.240> like<00:05:11.360> that

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:11.920 
a hand trigger or something like that

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:19.110 
a hand trigger or something like that
okay<00:05:16.000> we<00:05:17.000> have<00:05:17.150> our<00:05:17.180> 24<00:05:17.690> volt<00:05:17.870> power<00:05:18.050> supply

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
okay we have our 24 volt power supply
