00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.520
 Oman is a quiet and wealthy country 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.640
 There is a vast desert, boundless beaches. 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.400
 Luxury homes, palm trees and shopping centers 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.960
 The ancient Arabian hospitality of this country 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.960
 Naturally blends with the most fashionable life 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.800
 Because of the expensive oil and gas industry here. 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.920
 And the government’s massive investment in new infrastructure 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.320
 Oman’s economy is growing steadily 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.080
 Volvo dealer Joseph 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.840
 Is the leader among construction equipment suppliers 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.240
 It is also one of the companies that profit from the booming construction industry here. 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.720
 Volvo started to enter in 1998 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.120
 For us 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.040
 The work here is very challenging 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.800
 Because everyone knows that Volvo is doing cars and trucks. 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.640
 But about construction equipment 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.320
 Oman, no one knows 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.240
 So when we started doing it in 1998 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.200
 It is very difficult to sell a set of devices 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.600
 And now in 2010, we will sell 300 sets of equipment a year. 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.600
 Yusuf is committed to meeting customer needs 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.200
 Thus establishing their position 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.560
 (foreign language) 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.440
 We will tell the customer 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.320
 We sell you Volvo's machine but it is shared by us. 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.520
 Shared baby 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.680
 We will take care of it 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.360
 From now to the next ten years 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.520
 Six hundred kilometers outside the busy capital of Muscat 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.200
 Oman Desert Hinterland 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.920
 A Yusef customer is here 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.960
 Deeply understand their value 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.720
 International Construction Company STFA 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.400
 Is in the small village of Dakom 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.600
 One of the contractors who built the port and dry dock 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.840
 This is one of the largest infrastructure projects in the entire Middle East 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.240
 They help us a lot 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.800
 Once we need something 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.880
 Or want to repair 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.040
 They will remind us that it is very good to follow us. 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.280
 The strategy behind strong customer relationships is 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.520
 Provide the best service and after-sales service on the market 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.800
 In addition to this, Joseph 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.880
 Also introduced a free service call 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.120
 Customers can call back or complain 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.000
 First we will receive a complaint 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.640
 Any complaint from any customer 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.160
 He can call the toll-free number directly 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.240
 Have a person 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.560
 He will be responsible for answering complaints 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.000
 Write down the necessary and basic information 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.480
 our target is 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.920
 Get in touch with customers within 30 minutes 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.520
 Every time we can do it 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.000
 By providing free inspections to customers 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.360
 Joseph can guarantee their machines 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.600
 Maintain optimal performance even after long-distance transportation 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.480
 We will take care of these equipment for free inspection 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.560
 Free return visit 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.680
 After you bought the machine 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.320
 Will receive an email, fax 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.960
 And phone to make sure the machine is working properly 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.720
 Will get the corresponding service 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.200
 So as a customer 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.720
 You will be satisfied 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.680
 We will sell the machine to you later. 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.200
 Will take care of them for you 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.960
 According to Volvo's partner evaluation mechanism 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.440
 Recently, Joseph became its distributor 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.440
 This is the only one that passes various tests 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.600
 And no company that disappoints Volvo 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.080
 But back to a few years 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.160
 The global financial crisis has given the operation of Joseph 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.960
 Bringing huge challenges 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.440
 Everyone wanted to save money during that time. 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.760
 So we tell the customer 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.880
 Save money with Volvo's machines 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.120
 You won’t waste money anymore 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.880
 You can save fuel and save maintenance costs 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.600
 It is a very durable machine 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.520
 We tell the customer 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.920
 Using Volvo is saving money 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.000
 With the recovery of the global economy 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.480
 Yusuf is more optimistic about the future 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.160
 And hope to develop rapidly in the next few years. 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.640
 The government has announced the next five years 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.080
 Oman’s development plan is very promising 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.560
 Many projects still have to be launched 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.560
 We want to use the Volvo machine here. 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.320
 To help the country's development 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.720
