00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
up a lot of new lines while you're

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.950 
up a lot of new lines while you're
skating<00:00:27.279> a<00:00:27.430> pool<00:00:27.640> like<00:00:27.910> if<00:00:28.359> you<00:00:28.480> go<00:00:28.599> to<00:00:28.660> a<00:00:28.779> new

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
skating a pool like if you go to a new

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.560 
skating a pool like if you go to a new
pool<00:00:29.259> and<00:00:29.849> you're<00:00:30.849> just<00:00:31.090> starting<00:00:31.239> to<00:00:31.419> figure

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
pool and you're just starting to figure

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.540 
pool and you're just starting to figure
out<00:00:31.810> lines<00:00:32.050> and<00:00:32.529> you<00:00:32.739> can't<00:00:33.010> make<00:00:33.129> it<00:00:33.190> over<00:00:33.399> the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
out lines and you can't make it over the

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.060 
out lines and you can't make it over the
stairs<00:00:33.870> then<00:00:34.870> you're<00:00:35.110> constantly<00:00:35.290> having<00:00:35.829> to

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
stairs then you're constantly having to

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.329 
stairs then you're constantly having to
avoid<00:00:37.059> it<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:38.620> that<00:00:38.800> will<00:00:38.920> slow<00:00:39.190> you<00:00:39.250> down

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:39.339

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
sometimes so it's good to know how to do

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.920 
sometimes so it's good to know how to do
it<00:00:42.339> so<00:00:42.579> you<00:00:42.699> can<00:00:42.879> keep<00:00:43.030> your<00:00:43.180> speed<00:00:43.510> up<00:00:43.690> and

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
keep your lines fast some things to

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.410 
keep your lines fast some things to
watch<00:00:51.040> out<00:00:51.280> for<00:00:51.339> that<00:00:51.550> can<00:00:51.820> go<00:00:51.939> wrong<00:00:52.180> while

watch out for that can go wrong while

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.869 
watch out for that can go wrong while
doing<00:00:52.780> this<00:00:52.900> is<00:00:53.170> what<00:00:54.070> a<00:00:54.100> lot<00:00:54.400> of<00:00:54.430> people<00:00:54.699> do

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.130 
doing this is what a lot of people do
including<00:00:55.390> myself<00:00:55.510> is<00:00:56.460> sometimes<00:00:58.140> misjudge

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
including myself is sometimes misjudge

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.810 
including myself is sometimes misjudge
where<00:00:59.439> the<00:00:59.530> stairs<00:00:59.830> are<00:01:00.129> so<00:01:00.369> you<00:01:00.430> go<00:01:00.640> a<00:01:00.670> little

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
where the stairs are so you go a little

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.869 
where the stairs are so you go a little
bit<00:01:00.970> early<00:01:01.479> and<00:01:01.769> you<00:01:02.769> end<00:01:02.920> up<00:01:03.040> clipping<00:01:03.670> the

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
bit early and you end up clipping the

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.910 
bit early and you end up clipping the
bottom<00:01:04.239> stair<00:01:04.570> and<00:01:04.809> that<00:01:05.259> just<00:01:05.500> sends<00:01:05.860> you

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
bottom stair and that just sends you

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.520 
bottom stair and that just sends you
straight<00:01:06.310> at<00:01:06.430> the<00:01:06.520> coping<00:01:06.970> or<00:01:07.380> tumbling<00:01:08.380> over

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
straight at the coping or tumbling over

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.530 
straight at the coping or tumbling over
the<00:01:08.770> other<00:01:08.920> side<00:01:09.250> so<00:01:09.580> you<00:01:10.180> want<00:01:10.330> to<00:01:10.390> make<00:01:10.509> sure

ride<00:01:56.440> it<00:01:57.040> out<00:01:57.190> with<00:01:57.940> the<00:01:58.090> tranny<00:01:58.390> kind<00:01:59.260> of<00:01:59.350> just

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
ride it out with the tranny kind of just

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.890 
ride it out with the tranny kind of just
use<00:02:00.100> it<00:02:00.250> like<00:02:00.370> a<00:02:00.400> berm<00:02:00.790> and<00:02:00.820> just<00:02:01.210> ride<00:02:01.630> it<00:02:01.780> all

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
use it like a berm and just ride it all

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.520 
use it like a berm and just ride it all
the<00:02:02.170> way<00:02:02.290> as<00:02:02.440> far<00:02:02.619> as<00:02:02.680> you<00:02:02.799> can<00:02:03.040> and<00:02:03.400> that

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
should make coming off the stairs really

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.619 
should make coming off the stairs really
smooth<00:02:08.049> and<00:02:08.229> easy

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.210 

so<00:02:12.629> once<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:12.989> figured<00:02:13.349> all<00:02:13.470> that<00:02:13.530> out<00:02:13.739> and

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
so once you figured all that out and

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.979 
so once you figured all that out and
you're<00:02:14.700> mopping<00:02:14.910> over<00:02:15.269> the<00:02:15.330> stairs<00:02:15.629> and

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
you're mopping over the stairs and

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.900 
you're mopping over the stairs and
you're<00:02:16.080> coming<00:02:16.349> out<00:02:16.410> with<00:02:16.470> lots<00:02:16.739> of<00:02:16.890> speed<00:02:17.220> you

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
you're coming out with lots of speed you

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.640 
you're coming out with lots of speed you
can<00:02:18.030> carve<00:02:18.360> back<00:02:18.660> into<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.019> deep<00:02:19.140> end<00:02:19.349> and

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
can carve back into the deep end and

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:28.820 
can carve back into the deep end and
start<00:02:20.190> doing<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.849> bunch<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:21.120> more<00:02:21.300> tricks<00:02:27.830> that

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
start doing a bunch of more tricks that

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.759 
start doing a bunch of more tricks that
in<00:02:29.640> just<00:02:29.849> a<00:02:29.910> normal<00:02:30.209> heel<00:02:30.390> foot<00:02:30.569> position<00:02:31.019> in

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
in just a normal heel foot position in

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.540 
in just a normal heel foot position in
the<00:02:31.920> back<00:02:32.130> foot<00:02:32.430> almost<00:02:33.209> kind<00:02:33.450> of
