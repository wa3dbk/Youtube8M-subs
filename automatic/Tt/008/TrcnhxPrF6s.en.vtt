00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
it down I didn't get it in the patent

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.410 
it down I didn't get it in the patent
because<00:01:34.689> I<00:01:34.929> didn't<00:01:35.439> really<00:01:35.649> like<00:01:35.829> the

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
because I didn't really like the

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.880 
because I didn't really like the
shininess<00:01:38.099> but<00:01:39.099> this<00:01:39.520> leather<00:01:39.729> is<00:01:40.030> just

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
shininess but this leather is just

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.779 
shininess but this leather is just
amazing<00:01:43.920> one<00:01:44.920> thing<00:01:45.159> when<00:01:45.340> I<00:01:45.369> was<00:01:45.520> trying

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
amazing one thing when I was trying

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:47.520 
amazing one thing when I was trying
these<00:01:46.030> on<00:01:46.090> I<00:01:46.270> was<00:01:46.599> trying<00:01:46.869> to<00:01:46.929> decide<00:01:47.259> if<00:01:47.439> I

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
these on I was trying to decide if I

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.569 
these on I was trying to decide if I
should<00:01:47.560> get<00:01:47.829> the<00:01:47.979> 38<00:01:48.280> and<00:01:48.520> a<00:01:48.549> half<00:01:48.759> or<00:01:49.090> the<00:01:49.959> 39

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
should get the 38 and a half or the 39

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.219 
should get the 38 and a half or the 39
but<00:01:51.579> the<00:01:51.849> thing<00:01:52.060> is<00:01:52.209> that<00:01:52.569> you<00:01:52.869> should<00:01:52.899> always

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
but the thing is that you should always

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.350 
but the thing is that you should always
go<00:01:53.799> for<00:01:54.129> one<00:01:54.340> that's<00:01:54.579> like<00:01:54.729> a<00:01:54.759> little<00:01:54.939> bit<00:01:55.090> more

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
go for one that's like a little bit more

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.869 
go for one that's like a little bit more
snug<00:01:55.659> not<00:01:55.989> extremely<00:01:56.979> tight<00:01:57.399> with<00:01:57.640> just<00:01:57.789> a

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:57.879 
snug not extremely tight with just a

00:01:57.879 --> 00:01:59.760 
snug not extremely tight with just a
little<00:01:58.090> bit<00:01:58.329> snug<00:01:58.539> because<00:01:59.020> you<00:01:59.560> know<00:01:59.649> the

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
little bit snug because you know the

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.139 
little bit snug because you know the
leather<00:01:59.950> will<00:02:00.340> stretch<00:02:00.789> and<00:02:02.310> what<00:02:03.310> I<00:02:03.340> do<00:02:03.489> is<00:02:03.879> I

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
leather will stretch and what I do is I

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:05.910 
leather will stretch and what I do is I
just<00:02:04.209> put<00:02:04.599> lotion<00:02:04.959> on<00:02:05.170> my<00:02:05.319> foot<00:02:05.530> before

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
just put lotion on my foot before

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.749 
just put lotion on my foot before
putting<00:02:06.369> on<00:02:06.489> the<00:02:06.640> shoe<00:02:06.879> and<00:02:07.239> ready<00:02:07.899> to<00:02:07.989> go<00:02:08.759> the

shoe is not comfortable by any means so

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.809 
shoe is not comfortable by any means so

looks amazing on because the heel is
just<00:02:33.130> so<00:02:33.519> high<00:02:34.889> it<00:02:35.889> makes<00:02:36.130> your<00:02:36.280> legs<00:02:36.519> look

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
just so high it makes your legs look

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:42.030 
just so high it makes your legs look
phenomenal<00:02:38.130> it<00:02:39.239> feels<00:02:40.239> awkward<00:02:40.599> and<00:02:41.319> it's<00:02:41.859> so

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
phenomenal it feels awkward and it's so

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.270 
phenomenal it feels awkward and it's so
weird<00:02:42.190> because<00:02:42.430> I<00:02:42.549> have<00:02:42.790> so<00:02:43.150> many<00:02:43.329> high<00:02:43.660> heels

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
weird because I have so many high heels

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.580 
weird because I have so many high heels
and<00:02:45.280> really<00:02:45.730> high<00:02:45.910> heels<00:02:46.180> but<00:02:46.510> this<00:02:46.810> one<00:02:47.109> I

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
and really high heels but this one I

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.870 
and really high heels but this one I
don't<00:02:47.829> know<00:02:47.950> if<00:02:48.040> it's<00:02:48.190> because<00:02:48.310> of<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.549> pitch

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
don't know if it's because of the pitch

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.860 
don't know if it's because of the pitch
but<00:02:49.269> it<00:02:49.780> just<00:02:50.470> feels<00:02:50.650> a<00:02:51.040> little<00:02:51.940> awkward<00:02:52.269> to

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
but it just feels a little awkward to

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.879 
but it just feels a little awkward to
walk<00:02:53.079> in<00:02:53.319> but<00:02:53.940> you'll<00:02:54.940> get<00:02:55.090> used<00:02:55.150> to<00:02:55.480> it<00:02:55.889> these

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:56.889 
walk in but you'll get used to it these

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:01.890 
walk in but you'll get used to it these
I<00:02:56.950> haven't<00:02:57.459> worn<00:02:59.069> outside<00:03:00.299> that<00:03:01.299> much<00:03:01.540> because

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
I haven't worn outside that much because

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.960 
I haven't worn outside that much because
I<00:03:02.319> haven't<00:03:02.530> protected<00:03:02.769> the<00:03:03.160> bottom<00:03:03.489> of<00:03:03.669> it<00:03:03.819> and
