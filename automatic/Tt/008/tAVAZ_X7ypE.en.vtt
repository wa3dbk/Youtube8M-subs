00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:29.090

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.579
 channel the bell plays there as it had already 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.710
 promised to make a video detailing the 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.059
 three dinosaur games that I think 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.250
 They are today's best for 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.260
 computer and also there talking in the 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.150
 end of the game that can leave 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.390
 next month, it looks like it's going to 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:47.030
 To be very good I had done a live and 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.809
 of the three games is that they will be 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.149
 in this video 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.100
 however he rented it is due to some problem of 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.900
 software any problem then with the 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.299
 and youtube not to leave you 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.250
 on hand so I decided to record this video 

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:00.739
 talking about the three main games 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.509
 the icon containing the dinosaurs 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.729
 Expects like it leaves its like 

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:06.530
 share video write channel for 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.009
 always be within the news 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.420
 so let's go the first game I 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.610
 I'll show you, it's breaking. 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.350
 primon for those who already know the series d 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.299
 rangers who are hunting games with 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.159
 normal animals that of ranier bragon 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.570
 follows the same pattern 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.950
 it is a game that requires a little more than 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.140
 strategy it has a level of 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.189
 much greater difficulty than others who 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.960
 I will show're 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.759
 however it is a great game and if you want 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.369
 joining the friends there are the 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.170
 dinosaurs because of their difficulty 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.299
 the bigger you end up being forced to 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.259
 join with other friends to kill ot 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.240
 rex there 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.039
 or other types of dinosaur or 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.770
 The game is still about a year and 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:44.119
 so it came out of his alpha now open it 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.729
 it's ready right 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.130
 it costs around 40 reais in steam 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.689
 and it's a very cool game so young 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.929
 from the beginning was one of the first to 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.579
 make video of him is direct play with the 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.740
 friends will leave until the link below 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.789
 for anyone who wants to play and advice to 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.369
 who likes a game that has a 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.380
 greater difficulty is a little more in 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.060
 reality in the sense that you can not 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.340
 stay running all the time because 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.069
 you tire really easy you can not be 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.530
 throwing at the dinosaurs and finding that 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.640
 will leave alive kill little jackson with 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.260
 little gun 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.959
 you require a level of strategy 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.790
 much larger and also a bit of 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.380
 futility you can not come straight 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.040
 in the daytime that's not how it goes 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.380
 to function 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.510
 he does not have many dinosaur species 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.760
 but those that have already leaves a game well 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.680
 well a very legal difficulty 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.060
 besides that they have already made flying is that I 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.220
 I think it 's the main thing now all of a sudden 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.870
 without questioning the aquatic and 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.640
 to revise the issue of guns a little 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.020
 and you can not base your 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.970
 you just go out in the middle of the map 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.910
 You have nothing to sing today, you have nothing to do. 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.470
 boxes and kill the dinosaurs and 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.240
 earning points and money is going up 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.590
 level to ever get 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.450
 best weapons 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.100
 so there is one of the games that the board and 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.320
 remembering that these games are not in 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.510
 order of quality station the three 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.070
 better without charging with the 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.270
 better because it goes from your taste 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:04.190
 great game strategy is even hunting 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.110
 and if you want a little more game 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.290
 difficult and have beautiful graphics 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.270
 This is the game of your choice the second 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.670
 dinosaur game that went there I heard one 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.200
 prelude this game I won from friend to 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.020
 inesting and it was about a week 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.300
 and I went to play him as much as the idol I knew 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.400
 that it was a game here of fps without 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.810
 to know if it was really good right? 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.090
 but playing it I realized it's a game 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.770
 great fun is a simple game is 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.720
 moral that you leave an arena with a 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.970
 with other players and you have to 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.800
 to return several dinosaur waves that 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.270
 been trying to attack his base 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.030
 as you evolve it goes 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.280
 appearing some cars ships inside 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.930
 the map for you to use and you will 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.739
 able to buy weapons and skills for the 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.690
 your character 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.760
 of course every time the new arena goes 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.769
 changing these skills and you 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.420
 buy everything again but has a level 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.430
 fixed of the player he earns some 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.489
 skills that will always be with 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.650
 you are a great game, very fun is the 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.510
 course or sometimes even for $ 2 of this 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.180
 then it is a game that always gives promotion and 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.340
 value is very easy to access 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.140
 so it is a game that advice to 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.820
 Who likes it is a shooting game a game that 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.190
 Be more action without much strategy 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.769
 really the wings will see attacking 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.360
 You're going to have to detonate them and that's it. 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.609
 there is not much else to do there 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.130
 other players in some ways 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.320
 different but this is the way 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.510
 is that it will really keep a 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.090
 good time stopped a great game a value 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.919
 very good, if you like a fps and want 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.570
 Kill some dinosaurs this is the game to 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.120
 your choice among the three but it 's a game 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.220
 with the fastest action of them and with 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:38.660
 sure it will take less time like this 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:41.690
 for you to evolve right then and ours 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:43.400
 third and last game is the press view 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.920
 this game already has a mix of 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.390
 strategy and hunting 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.370
 difference of the great differential is 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.650
 he has many crafts is a game 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.930
 already based on survival then you 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.910
 Are you going to have to get the 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.720
 ore will make all that system of 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.040
 lighthouse 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.600
 You'll have to go evolving your 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.760
 buildings to get a table for 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.790
 be able to do and have the best you do 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.530
 the house makes a bed and of course you will 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.850
 doing the guns and then you can 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.710
 cassar the dinosaurs 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.330
 it is great game on the part of the craft 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.490
 part of construction is with the graphics 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.710
 of legal deferral 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.690
 So it 's a game as well. 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.670
 fun to play with more people too, huh? 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.800
 alone it can make a little more Iivo 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:24.230
 For the delay sometimes to stay things. 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.880
 and his house is so still the 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.310
 dinosaurs do not have a hygiene 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.370
 very good then it is a game that 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.260
 dinosaur can lock in some place 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.300
 can some errors happen so jade 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.850
 it is in alpha some errors that you 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.320
 suddenly I end up liking says 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.760
 game though if you want a game that 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.550
 Have credit game you can build 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.440
 Your base build a tower is you can 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.780
 make huge f buildings with your 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.550
 friends and protect himself from dinosaurs he 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.620
 It is the game of your choice for those who like 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.320
 really craft survival and not 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.570
 minecraft style serve study or 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.930
 seven games in this style of cedar box in 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:01.880
 truth not being box with dinosaurs 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.250
 so this tip for those who enjoy games 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.710
 more in this style is a great game too 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:08.960
 beautiful graphics very crafts still 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:11.570
 a little on the part of the hygiene of the 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.280
 dinosaurs and na and theirs however is a game 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.850
 it's a county a lot there for everyone 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.590
 Alright then let's go the launch that I 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.380
 I want to tell everyone, so it's the 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:23.690
 survival game involves a game that 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.880
 also with dinosaurs in the epic world there 

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.010
 which looks extremely giant the game 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.080
 has not yet left is only one 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:32.900
 brief preview of the release video 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.880
 of him that if the game follow what the son 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.130
 is showing will be a play and I 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.170
 I will advise very clearly as soon as 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:41.510
 I left the game, I 'm recording the video 

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:44.030
 here at first hand and on the same day as 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.870
 the game comes out it's June 2 if I 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.490
 I'm not mistaken 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.160
 So it's going to be a game with dinosaurs. 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:51.050
 dragon where you will have huge sites 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.640
 much crafts by cv 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.440
 It seems like a magic thing. 

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.300
 also the characters of a stone in the 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.010
 arm there you wake up in the middle of a 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.370
 island without knowing anything and that old 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.139
 story you have to run 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.970
 Dinosaur, you're going to go there. 

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:05.729
 ride the animals too you go 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:07.410
 their power common as their pets right 

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:09.389
 so it's going to be a game there that will bring 

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:11.070
 a novelty will bring a mixture well 

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:13.350
 cool i believe it's good 

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:14.880
 done there will be very top and of course the 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.820
 People are going to have a mega series. 

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:19.979
 Well, that's it, so I hope. 

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:21.510
