00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.519
 Hello everyone, and today I want to tell 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.370
 I will show you my face care 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.940
 all your funds for today 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.529
 which I use and let's get started 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.949
 Let's start with washing makeup I usually take off 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.590
 either bioderma or using these 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.439
 here are the discs from Jason 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.060
 remove eye makeup arrows mascara first 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.990
 of course they have not tasted them 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.850
 liked 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.450
 but then I realized that it was great 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.280
 alternative excellent bioderma replacement 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.890
 the only of course minus here these 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.230
 disks if that liquid gets 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.090
 which eyes on them will be very strong 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.450
 tweak so it is very necessary with them 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.360
 gently wash your face usually with 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.969
 using such a wash here 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.649
 origins i buy probably already 1 5 i 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.199
 showed a year ago when I only 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.039
 started shooting a video called checks 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.559
 and balances 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.439
 washed off all makeup smells good 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.450
 mint does not dry it does not just fat 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.670
 great tool here is a swap honest 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.590
 I can’t find and wash off I usually either 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.830
 using clarisonics or using 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.020
 my favorite sponge rest body shop like 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.430
 I think the result is the same 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.270
 so if you do not have the opportunity 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.750
 buy 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.670
 clarisonic then be sure to try this 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.100
 the blouse is served on absolutely everywhere 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.930
 so rolls I wash my face exclusively 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.729
 in the evening when we need to wash it off 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.710
 makeup hard in the morning i wash my face using 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:38.460
 Here is such a remedy from the company we are from 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.930
 happy is a cream washbasin she is a bowl 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.500
 this is absolutely no makeup for you 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.100
 our face will loosen I use it 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.399
 it is in the morning to wash off the evening cream 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.860
 some oils like it very well 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.960
 moisturizes the skin really like the effect 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.729
 after using this washbasin for 5 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.670
 as she said to you absolutely nothing 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.619
 wash it so that morning remedies 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.850
 my 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:07.619
 that on our evening in the evening I put 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.910
 first here is such a serum again 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.979
 from matt happy 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.720
 this is vitamin c gray face after 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.230
 using this serum becomes 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.780
 so toned elastic really like 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.640
 and awesome just the smell of orange and 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.129
 after using this serum i 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.700
 I put the cream from the company again the mother is happy 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:29.670
 This cream for all skin types is very 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.799
 like and smell the effect while doing you 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.290
 can be used during the day as a basis for 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.299
 makeup because it seems to me 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.519
 slightly even mats the skin but by no means 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.019
 case does not dry, I specifically bought 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.120
 a whole series to understand how they are 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.970
 act exactly together they are very me 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.280
 liked and just absolutely not 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.280
 no claims to them under the eyes I 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.900
 usually wear cream from arefeva 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.079
 awesome cream nourishes perfectly moisturizes 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.209
 skin in this area skin becomes 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.220
 such more nourished again more 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.620
 Elastic really do not like and just 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.750
 I am sure one hundred percent that I will order more 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.849
 once this cream is over and 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.650
 I'll show you my morning cream now 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.180
 This is a cream from the company and license which 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.150
 called ginseng 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.569
 he is such an orange pack and he has 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.400
 again the awesome smell of oranges 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.739
 of course there are silicones in the composition 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.299
 it is not completely natural therefore 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.269
 after using it, the skin becomes 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.160
 smooth and so silky but i think 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.139
 after using any silicones cake 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.359
 so stop so I have it 

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:33.060
 I use under make-up and it is excellent on 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:35.669
 this cream holds and under the eyes and again 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.519
 same cream origin of the same 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:41.220
 the very series of gin zeng he know such 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.930
 such micro glitter also like 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.030
 but again I use the foundation in the morning 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.370
 exclusively makeup and now let's 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.519
 I'll show you my favorite mask and I'll start 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.050
 with wetting first favorite 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:56.110
 which buying probably 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:59.110
 the third time she acari jeans called 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.240
 Move as intensiv this night mask 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.920
 which you put as an ordinary 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.650
 night cream that is if i feel like 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.320
 my face is so tight 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.390
 that somewhere there are some flakings then I 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.890
 I usually use this mask and the next morning 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:18.190
 just perfect she is exactly on wet 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:20.970
 the next mask is already cleansing is mine 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:26.140
 new Moscow from the company andalou naturals 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:28.300
 she is from clay of blue geranium here 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.100
 only 50 3 milliliters and I really 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.590
 I liked this mask, of course she did not 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.690
 rid you of eels about black dots with 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.180
 they need to fight but you will 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.770
 using all of it here and written two 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.620
 times a week the face will be 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.710
 really clean much smaller than you 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.080
 there will be pimples and petite flakes become 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.260
 so lighter therefore very 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:53.200
 I liked it as for the masks 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:56.740
 firm origins it is very famous and everything 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.480
 love me very much again in the little 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.590
 such in size 50 milliliters 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:05.890
 it is called below it is again from black 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:08.140
 clay honestly I did not notice the difference 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:11.080
 in fact , even I liked it 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.900
 more precisely this mask for me to dry 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.240
 a little skin I have not noticed that as it is not 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.100
 I know the face has become cleaner 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.320
 I buy the second time I will not I even 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.240
 not finished yet do n't understand universal 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.680
 I put a delight on this mask like 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.060
 here it’s already said that wet face 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.890
 steamed but the effect I honestly do not 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.880
 noticed the last mask of me from the firm 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.630
 andalou in the evening 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.010
 this is a glycol mask with pumpkin and honey 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:39.100
 when you put her face becomes 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:41.470
 so red, it hisses very much 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.660
 To be honest, I did not understand the effect of 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:47.250
 this mask yes of course the face becomes 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:49.900
 so a little refreshed that only but 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.510
 I haven't noticed any super effects 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.850
 somewhere twice a week I used 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.810
 such a scrub he is intimate from the company both 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.660
 I like nerd 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.860
 the effect itself is very much the same as from 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.500
 touch this mask if you are slightly 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.510
 pererabite scrub on the face it will 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.970
 so few threats therefore 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:10.160
 neater use this scrub here 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.919
 not many scrubbing particles 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.620
 so who is looking for some strong such 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:17.840
 cleansing scrub, then of course you don’t 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.540
 come and forget to show you your 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:23.240
 favorite tonics are always after washing and i 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:25.940
 I use tonic from the company tires 1 tonic 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:29.210
 I give a word without alcohol, he is very 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:31.280
 it smells good it refreshes your face well 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.860
 I love him madly buying too 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.600
 first time and 2 tonic me with a peach 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.639
 he is already with alcohol so i have him 

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.020
 I use it only when it is 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:40.490
 some rashes on the face 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.370
 using it only when needed 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.680
 because I think this tonic 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.479
 maybe that is considered here, in principle, I 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.840

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:53.150
