this<00:00:12.660> line<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:13.139> primarily<00:00:13.950> designed<00:00:14.190> for<00:00:14.519> low

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
this line is primarily designed for low

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.390 
this line is primarily designed for low
either<00:00:15.389> low-light<00:00:16.110> condition<00:00:16.590> or<00:00:16.770> portraits

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
either low-light condition or portraits

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.780 
either low-light condition or portraits
because<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:18.630> can<00:00:18.840> go<00:00:19.050> up<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.939> 1.4<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.349> also

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:22.790 
because you can go up to 1.4 and also

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.609 
because you can go up to 1.4 and also
you<00:00:23.790> can<00:00:24.000> create<00:00:24.419> a<00:00:24.509> shallow<00:00:25.050> depth<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.560> field

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
you can create a shallow depth of field

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.240 
you can create a shallow depth of field
with<00:00:26.099> this<00:00:26.250> aperture<00:00:27.649> this<00:00:28.649> lens<00:00:28.950> actually

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
with this aperture this lens actually

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.560 
with this aperture this lens actually
designed<00:00:29.910> for<00:00:30.200> full<00:00:31.200> frame<00:00:31.380> in<00:00:31.739> the<00:00:31.860> film<00:00:32.250> era

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
designed for full frame in the film era

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.420 
designed for full frame in the film era
it's<00:00:33.570> design<00:00:33.989> pretty<00:00:34.649> old<00:00:34.860> now

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
it's design pretty old now

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.040 
it's design pretty old now
around<00:00:36.390> like<00:00:36.600> 13<00:00:37.230> years<00:00:37.700> 13<00:00:38.700> years<00:00:38.970> old<00:00:39.240> but

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
around like 13 years 13 years old but

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.270 
around like 13 years 13 years old but
the<00:00:41.630> quality<00:00:42.630> is<00:00:42.660> still<00:00:43.110> up<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.680> date<00:00:44.100> to

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
the quality is still up to date to

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.370 
the quality is still up to date to
current<00:00:44.870> situation<00:00:46.580> so<00:00:47.810> these<00:00:48.810> lands<00:00:49.079> are

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.380 
current situation so these lands are

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.920 
current situation so these lands are
really<00:00:49.800> good<00:00:50.120> for<00:00:51.120> either<00:00:51.800> F<00:00:52.800> F<00:00:53.760> X<00:00:54.090> or<00:00:54.329> DX<00:00:54.570> mode

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
really good for either F F X or DX mode

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.250 
really good for either F F X or DX mode
the<00:00:55.380> X<00:00:55.560> camera<00:00:55.890> such<00:00:56.579> as<00:00:56.660> D<00:00:57.660> 90<00:00:58.110> or<00:00:59.150> D<00:01:00.150> 700<00:01:00.780> or<00:01:00.840> d3

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
the X camera such as D 90 or D 700 or d3

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.340 
the X camera such as D 90 or D 700 or d3
but<00:01:01.980> because<00:01:02.640> this<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.030> like<00:01:03.270> AF<00:01:03.690> lens<00:01:03.960> it

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
but because this is like AF lens it

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.520 
but because this is like AF lens it
doesn't<00:01:04.710> have<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:05.540> built-in<00:01:06.540> autofocus<00:01:07.350> motor

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
doesn't have a built-in autofocus motor

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.730 
doesn't have a built-in autofocus motor
you<00:01:08.220> cannot<00:01:08.550> use<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.180> there<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:10.260> can<00:01:10.470> use

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
you cannot use it in there you can use

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.940 
you cannot use it in there you can use
it<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.190> the<00:01:11.370> D<00:01:11.760> 6<00:01:12.090> D<00:01:12.150> or<00:01:12.420> D<00:01:12.659> 40<00:01:13.050> but<00:01:13.229> you'll<00:01:13.710> lose

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
it in the D 6 D or D 40 but you'll lose

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.560 
it in the D 6 D or D 40 but you'll lose
the<00:01:14.880> ability<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.870> autofocus<00:01:16.740> so<00:01:17.729> generally

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
the ability to autofocus so generally

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.260 
the ability to autofocus so generally
the<00:01:18.780> build<00:01:19.020> quality<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.370> lens<00:01:20.610> very<00:01:20.790> good

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
the build quality of this lens very good

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.649 
the build quality of this lens very good
it's<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:22.070> kind<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.159> metal<00:01:23.750> metal<00:01:24.750> built<00:01:25.350> and

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
manually if you like the lens will come

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.040 
manually if you like the lens will come
with<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.420> lens<00:02:12.990> hood<00:02:13.110> which<00:02:13.620> is<00:02:13.770> also<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.250> metal

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
with a lens hood which is also the metal

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.620 
with a lens hood which is also the metal
construction<00:02:17.240> but<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.720> downside<00:02:19.530> of<00:02:19.740> this

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
construction but the downside of this

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.520 
construction but the downside of this
lens<00:02:21.630> hood<00:02:21.870> is<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:23.070> cannot<00:02:24.110> prefers<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:25.140> like

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
lens hood is you cannot prefers it like

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.660 
lens hood is you cannot prefers it like
other<00:02:26.150> modern<00:02:27.150> type<00:02:27.600> lens<00:02:27.930> hood<00:02:28.340> because<00:02:29.340> it

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
other modern type lens hood because it

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:42.300 
other modern type lens hood because it
used<00:02:29.970> like<00:02:30.240> the<00:02:30.450> filter<00:02:30.810> track<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.260> get<00:02:31.440> in

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
here's the Lancet with the lens so about

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.610 
here's the Lancet with the lens so about
the<00:02:46.870> performance<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.890> lens<00:02:48.100> really<00:02:49.620> really

feel<00:03:11.320> is<00:03:11.470> more<00:03:11.830> say<00:03:12.070> lower<00:03:12.250> so<00:03:12.580> you<00:03:12.640> need<00:03:12.880> to<00:03:13.000> be

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
feel is more say lower so you need to be

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.140 
feel is more say lower so you need to be
careful<00:03:13.390> in<00:03:13.720> 1.4<00:03:14.470> you<00:03:14.980> need<00:03:15.130> to<00:03:15.250> really<00:03:15.550> focus

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
careful in 1.4 you need to really focus

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.310 
careful in 1.4 you need to really focus
in<00:03:16.450> precise<00:03:16.840> spot<00:03:17.140> or<00:03:17.640> if<00:03:18.640> you<00:03:18.910> focus<00:03:19.720> you<00:03:20.080> miss

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
in precise spot or if you focus you miss

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.670 
in precise spot or if you focus you miss
the<00:03:20.530> focus<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.160> then<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:22.000> entire<00:03:22.470> image<00:03:23.470> will

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
the focus and then the entire image will

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.940 
the focus and then the entire image will
be<00:03:23.860> soft<00:03:24.160> and<00:03:25.110> then<00:03:27.150> for<00:03:28.150> sports<00:03:28.630> or<00:03:28.950> action

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
be soft and then for sports or action

be soft and then for sports or action
photography<00:03:30.209> this<00:03:31.209> land<00:03:31.480> is<00:03:31.630> pretty<00:03:32.130> lousy<00:03:33.130> at

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
photography this land is pretty lousy at

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.680 
photography this land is pretty lousy at
that<00:03:33.700> because<00:03:34.209> it<00:03:35.080> it<00:03:36.010> cannot<00:03:36.420> it<00:03:37.420> cannot

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
that because it it cannot it cannot

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.960 
that because it it cannot it cannot
effectively<00:03:38.410> track<00:03:38.860> the<00:03:39.220> movement<00:03:39.700> it's

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
effectively track the movement it's

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.180 
effectively track the movement it's
really<00:03:40.570> slow<00:03:40.840> compared<00:03:41.470> to<00:03:41.560> other<00:03:41.890> lands<00:03:43.110> so
