00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.029
 scratches not very deep besides 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.610
 scratching there is a scuff this jacket is still 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.349
 not sold she entered the store on 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.900
 sale already with such a defect 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:30.740
 This is quite often on jackets 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.119
 on the bags the new all the more often and so 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.860
 for work required 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:40.820
 black skin 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:46.120
 homemade spatula for applying liquid 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.120
 skin a little liquid skin 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:53.030
 extrude on any surface with 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:56.420
 which then we will take it on paper 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:59.719
 or something like that is not on the table 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.730
 of course a small amount of liquid skin 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.789
 neatly applied to damaged 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.789
 plots 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.150
 there are a lot of scuffs and liquid skin 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.280
 Will eliminate them well deep scratches 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.890
 eliminate harder surface and 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.100
 scuffing is much easier 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.100
 way 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.159
 after drawing we press 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:56.829
 dry hair dryer and press again on 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.899
 hands before pressing 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:02.270
 must be dressed 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:06.200
 polyethylene gloves because if 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:09.200
 start pressing you without gloves 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.030
 stick to polyethylene not 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.220
 glued this liquid skin now 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.950
 it can be seen that it has become much smoother though 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:21.739
 still have now will eliminate them 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:28.310
 then put here such a thicker layer 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:31.640
 warmed up with a hair dryer 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:37.370
 finish dry slightly and again 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:45.250
 presses presses as much as possible 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:45.250
 until cooled inflict more at layer 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.609
 we heat and press 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.940
 Now let's get to this scratch 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.280
 put a layer 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:36.040
 warm up slightly pressed down 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:36.040
 you can immediately apply another layer 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.319
 reheat slightly because layer 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:50.299
 very thin quick 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:53.840
 heating and removed the hair dryer and press it again 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.840
 look here 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.120
 Now you need a little trim the very 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.330
 fine sandpaper 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:07.040
 here and there bumps here 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:10.860
 here here from scratches and 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.080
 somewhere liquid skin fell with an influx of 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:17.130
 here it is on a bra 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:19.020
 slightly need to polish it multiply 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.020
 sandpaper is taken very fine 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:24.450
 for this not to scratch the skin 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:32.000
 we work only and now I'm cleaning up 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:34.230
 in the place where the influx slightly tidy it up 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.640
 We must try to not flow 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:41.300
 formed here it formed 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.300
 so you need to remove it 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:54.030
 then the liquid skin dries out very much 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:54.030
 well processed sandpaper 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:03.650
 but the skin should be small fine 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.650
 so as not to leave scratches on the skin 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:21.490
 also deep scratches that are still 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:24.150
 visible slightly need to be polished here 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.150
 there is a path 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.419
 I'll sand a little bit to 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.810
 the surface has become more even 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:37.520
 of course formed places scuff 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.099
 sandpaper marks nothing 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.590
 terrible with the next processing liquid 

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:44.800
 skin they will remove the main thing so that 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.969
 there were no deep scratches 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.250
 small scuffs then no 

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:52.300
 problems but none of them are on black 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:56.870
 products can do it calmly 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:06:00.409
 because black liquid skin is all this 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:02.419
 will close if the product is colored you must 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:05.690
 be sure 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:06.139
 before you grind what you can 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.940
 then 

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:12.349
 it is close the liquid skin that is she 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.379
 should liquid skin be perfect 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:19.990
 do not approach the color of the product otherwise 

00:06:15.379 --> 00:06:19.990
 risk and sandpaper 

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:26.900
 so well, that's what happened 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:29.659
 the surface has become more even no such 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.550
 deep scratches which were first well 

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:34.340
 there is a scuff that did now 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.409
 sandpaper now again 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.150
 we process all this liquid skin by 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:43.960
 slightly apply it on damaged 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:46.330
 places without 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:57.370
 what is to run down lightly 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:07:00.610
 dry and quickly press down pretty 

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:06.009
 exactly above us it turns out we go further 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:08.020
 and so that's what happened here 

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:10.240
 there were scratches scratched now 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:11.979
 almost invisible of course if 

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.740
 take a closer look especially if you know what 

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:17.349
 here they were then some trace leftovers 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.520
 scratches are disguised can be seen but 

00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:20.979
 do you not know 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:23.199
 it was almost impossible to see 

00:07:20.979 --> 00:07:25.530
 suspect they were here too 

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:25.530
 is impossible
