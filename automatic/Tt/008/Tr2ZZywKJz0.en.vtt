double-double HDMI and DVI there you put
the<00:05:16.539> DVI<00:05:17.169> here<00:05:17.650> and<00:05:17.949> then<00:05:18.400> the<00:05:19.060> HDMI<00:05:19.599> IN<00:05:19.780> Elgato

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
the DVI here and then the HDMI IN Elgato

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.620 
the DVI here and then the HDMI IN Elgato
output<00:05:21.430> that<00:05:21.550> hey<00:05:21.729> Jeff<00:05:22.000> I'm<00:05:22.150> back<00:05:22.389> to<00:05:22.509> the

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.230 
rerouting Elgato to my laptop because L
got<00:05:35.979> the<00:05:36.220> uses<00:05:37.740> CPU<00:05:38.740> said<00:05:38.949> so<00:05:39.190> but<00:05:39.520> since<00:05:40.120> I

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
got the uses CPU said so but since I

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.120 
got the uses CPU said so but since I
don't<00:05:40.300> want<00:05:40.599> to<00:05:41.520> disrupt<00:05:42.520> my<00:05:43.800> gameplay<00:05:44.800> videos

influence<00:05:49.840> on<00:05:50.259> my<00:05:50.349> performance<00:05:50.889> so<00:05:51.039> you<00:05:51.159> can

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
influence on my performance so you can

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:56.010 
influence on my performance so you can
see<00:05:51.520> here<00:05:51.699> CPU<00:05:52.659> that's<00:05:53.620> being<00:05:55.020> used

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
see here CPU that's being used

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.870 
see here CPU that's being used
bellegarde<00:05:56.590> it<00:05:56.949> sells<00:05:57.190> hope<00:05:57.550> you<00:05:57.729> go<00:05:57.849> to

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 
bellegarde it sells hope you go to

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.409 
bellegarde it sells hope you go to
process<00:05:58.509> then<00:05:59.380> view<00:06:00.190> so<00:06:00.789> you<00:06:00.820> can<00:06:00.940> see<00:06:01.270> the

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
process then view so you can see the

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:03.899 
process then view so you can see the
elgato<00:06:01.840> there<00:06:02.050> is<00:06:02.139> the<00:06:02.229> first<00:06:02.500> one<00:06:02.680> 16<00:06:03.490> percent

00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:03.909 
elgato there is the first one 16 percent

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:08.330 
elgato there is the first one 16 percent
and<00:06:04.440> that's<00:06:05.440> all<00:06:05.710> in<00:06:05.889> eight<00:06:06.159> cores<00:06:07.150> I<00:06:07.360> think

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
and that's all in eight cores I think

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.529 
and that's all in eight cores I think
but<00:06:09.340> doesn't<00:06:09.759> your<00:06:09.880> eighth<00:06:10.000> course<00:06:10.240> so

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:10.539 
but doesn't your eighth course so

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:12.749 
but doesn't your eighth course so
anyways<00:06:10.949> thanks<00:06:11.949> for<00:06:11.979> watching<00:06:12.340> guys<00:06:12.460> I'm

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580 
gonna show you my end of in comparison

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.560 
gonna show you my end of in comparison
video<00:06:15.849> for<00:06:16.000> every<00:06:16.180> game<00:06:16.330> okay<00:06:16.750> bye
