darker color with empty kind of firm but

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.130 
darker color with empty kind of firm but
otherwise<00:02:32.000> they<00:02:32.330> were<00:02:32.420> just<00:02:32.570> look<00:02:32.780> too<00:02:32.990> bright

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
otherwise they were just look too bright

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.860 
otherwise they were just look too bright
so<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:34.520> gray<00:02:34.700> hair<00:02:34.910> kind<00:02:35.150> of<00:02:35.210> break<00:02:35.540> off<00:02:35.720> the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870
