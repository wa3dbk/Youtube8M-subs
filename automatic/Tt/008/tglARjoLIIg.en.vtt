00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.769
 I think many of you should already have 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.859
 bought that shoe that comes with 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:19.920
 few holes and gets super season until 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:22.890

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.810

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:31.519
 what we will need we will 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.519
 need a pen in the kitchen 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:39.020
 to mark where we will do the 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:42.020
 cururu we will need those who do not 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:46.640

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:49.300

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:05.509
 I do not know if you're going to focus but I do not think so. 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.220
 but I think looking like that is no longer to 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:15.590
 You'll see what I'm talking about. 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:18.080

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.380

 How can you see the son? 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.720

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.540
 time 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.840

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.730

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.560
