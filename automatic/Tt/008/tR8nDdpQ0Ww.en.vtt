down depending on your height and of
course<00:01:32.390> I<00:01:32.540> love<00:01:32.780> how<00:01:32.960> you<00:01:33.020> can<00:01:33.260> do<00:01:33.440> just

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
course I love how you can do just

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.540 
course I love how you can do just
one-handed<00:01:34.700> pushing<00:01:35.090> and<00:01:35.300> it<00:01:35.780> just<00:01:35.960> glides

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
one-handed pushing and it just glides

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.190 
one-handed pushing and it just glides
over<00:01:37.550> all<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:37.850> surfaces<00:01:38.390> because<00:01:38.780> of<00:01:38.810> all<00:01:39.050> the

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
over all the surfaces because of all the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.880 
over all the surfaces because of all the
big<00:01:39.410> wheels

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
big wheels

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.080 
big wheels
but<00:01:40.010> the<00:01:40.100> biggest<00:01:40.310> function<00:01:40.760> you're<00:01:40.880> probably

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
but the biggest function you're probably

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.520 
but the biggest function you're probably
thinking<00:01:41.300> about<00:01:41.540> is<00:01:41.810> does<00:01:42.050> it<00:01:42.230> fit<00:01:42.380> through

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
thinking about is does it fit through

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.320 
thinking about is does it fit through
doorways<00:01:42.830> now<00:01:43.310> this<00:01:43.550> is<00:01:43.670> a<00:01:43.730> double<00:01:44.060> stroller

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
doorways now this is a double stroller

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.540 
doorways now this is a double stroller
so<00:01:44.690> go<00:01:44.840> side<00:01:45.110> by<00:01:45.140> side<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:45.920> it<00:01:46.010> really<00:01:46.280> is

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
so go side by side and it really is

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.399 
so go side by side and it really is
revolutionary<00:01:46.730> because<00:01:47.600> it<00:01:47.750> does<00:01:48.140> fit

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
revolutionary because it does fit

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.520 
revolutionary because it does fit
through<00:01:48.710> a<00:01:48.740> doorway<00:01:49.190> and<00:01:49.720> its<00:01:50.720> side<00:01:51.020> by<00:01:51.230> side

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
through a doorway and its side by side

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.410 
through a doorway and its side by side
so<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:52.010> footprint<00:01:52.460> is<00:01:52.550> not<00:01:52.760> actually<00:01:53.060> smaller

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
so the footprint is not actually smaller

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.020 
so the footprint is not actually smaller
