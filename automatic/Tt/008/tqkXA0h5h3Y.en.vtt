00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:26.270 
think carefully made a good signing
running<00:04:25.199> on<00:04:25.320> so<00:04:25.500> I<00:04:25.560> think<00:04:25.740> he's<00:04:25.830> an<00:04:25.919> excellence

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.839 
I think his experience he's going to be
frightful<00:04:28.650> to<00:04:28.680> Germany<00:04:29.250> why<00:04:29.550> he<00:04:29.610> showed<00:04:29.820> that

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:29.849 
frightful to Germany why he showed that

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:31.159 
frightful to Germany why he showed that
