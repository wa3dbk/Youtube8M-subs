00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
of this staff uh no idea how that's even

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.550 
of this staff uh no idea how that's even
possible<00:01:04.739> i'm<00:01:05.280> not<00:01:05.489> sure<00:01:05.780> never<00:01:06.780> seen<00:01:07.200> someone

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560

shoot<00:01:07.860> arrows<00:01:08.100> out<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.610> slap<00:01:08.880> for<00:01:09.150> i<00:01:09.240> know<00:01:09.299> it

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
shoot arrows out of a slap for i know it

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.740 
shoot arrows out of a slap for i know it
might<00:01:10.110> be<00:01:10.140> possible<00:01:10.490> but<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.729> some<00:01:12.420> reason<00:01:12.659> I

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
might be possible but I some reason I

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.750 
might be possible but I some reason I
doubt<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.650> it's<00:01:13.890> possible<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.340> shoot<00:01:14.549> arrows

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
doubt that it's possible to shoot arrows

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.499 
doubt that it's possible to shoot arrows
at<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.030> staff<00:01:15.500> so<00:01:16.500> yeah<00:01:17.490> I'm<00:01:17.820> not<00:01:18.090> just<00:01:18.299> kind<00:01:18.479> of

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
at a staff so yeah I'm not just kind of

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.130 
at a staff so yeah I'm not just kind of
ecology<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:18.990> guess<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.590> mean<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.600> they<00:01:21.600> just

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
ecology I guess I mean it is they just

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.640 
ecology I guess I mean it is they just
released<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.740> path<00:01:22.979> so<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.640> guess<00:01:23.960> kind<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.110> to

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
released the path so I guess kind of to

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.380 
released the path so I guess kind of to
be<00:01:25.770> expected<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:26.400> have<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.580> few<00:01:26.850> glitches<00:01:27.060> here

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
be expected to have a few glitches here

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.260 
be expected to have a few glitches here
and<00:01:27.420> there<00:01:27.540> but<00:01:27.659> just<00:01:28.350> kind<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.619> weird<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:29.310> found

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270
