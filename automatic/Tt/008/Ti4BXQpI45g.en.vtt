00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
this kind of came into the picture

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.870 
this kind of came into the picture
towards<00:01:06.149> the<00:01:06.270> end<00:01:06.420> originally<00:01:07.259> it<00:01:07.350> was<00:01:07.880> axial

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
towards the end originally it was axial

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.230 
towards the end originally it was axial
Wraith<00:01:09.500> which<00:01:10.500> can<00:01:10.740> be<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:11.399> build<00:01:11.640> one<00:01:11.850> up<00:01:12.060> it

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
Wraith which can be to build one up it

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.419 
Wraith which can be to build one up it
would<00:01:12.360> be<00:01:12.390> really<00:01:12.690> expensive<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.619> for<00:01:14.280> what<00:01:14.399> I

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:14.429 
would be really expensive and for what I

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:15.499 
would be really expensive and for what I
needed<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.970> do

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
needed to do

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.109 
needed to do
the<00:01:16.320> Wraith<00:01:16.530> actually<00:01:16.950> does<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.160> lot<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.429> it<00:01:17.670> but

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
the Wraith actually does a lot of it but

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.169 
the Wraith actually does a lot of it but
I<00:01:18.149> also<00:01:18.240> have<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.600> summit<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.200> I'm<00:01:19.289> gonna<00:01:19.410> do<00:01:19.530> a

00:01:20.169 --> 00:01:20.179 
I also have a summit that I'm gonna do a

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:23.330 
I also have a summit that I'm gonna do a
LT<00:01:21.179> conversion<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.440> so<00:01:22.800> I<00:01:22.890> decided<00:01:23.039> I'm

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
LT conversion to and so I decided I'm

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.800 
LT conversion to and so I decided I'm
gonna<00:01:23.429> go<00:01:23.490> ahead<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.759> do<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.940> LT<00:01:24.240> conversion

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
gonna go ahead and do the LT conversion

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.359 
gonna go ahead and do the LT conversion
the<00:01:25.170> Wraith<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.590> gonna<00:01:25.770> cost<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.100> lot<00:01:26.190> of<00:01:26.250> money

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
the Wraith is gonna cost a lot of money

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.969 
the Wraith is gonna cost a lot of money
so<00:01:26.640> I<00:01:26.700> kind<00:01:26.910> of<00:01:26.970> X<00:01:27.149> innate<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.740> but<00:01:28.740> still

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
so I kind of X innate that but still

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:29.630 
so I kind of X innate that but still
want<00:01:29.250> one

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
want one

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.850 
want one
and<00:01:29.729> then<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.659> already<00:01:30.900> have<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.079> Yeti<00:01:31.380> XL

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
and then I I already have a Yeti XL

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.710 
and then I I already have a Yeti XL
ready<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.220> run<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:33.000> seriously<00:01:33.270> thought

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
ready to run and I seriously thought

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.410 
ready to run and I seriously thought
about<00:01:33.960> getting<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.350> Yeti<00:01:34.530> XL<00:01:34.979> kit<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.670> can't

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
about getting a Yeti XL kit and I can't

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.359 
about getting a Yeti XL kit and I can't
tell<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.689> how<00:01:36.840> close<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.560> came<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.070> this

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
tell you how close it came to you this

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.190 
tell you how close it came to you this
was<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.700> ad<00:01:38.850> XL<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.600> then<00:01:39.689> there<00:01:39.900> was<00:01:40.049> the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
was the ad XL and then there was the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.620 
was the ad XL and then there was the
terrorist<00:01:40.979> sender<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.579> now<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.390> came

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
terrorist sender and now that came

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.690 
terrorist sender and now that came
really<00:01:42.780> close<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.110> getting<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.549> then

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
really close to getting that and then

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.060 
really close to getting that and then
I've<00:01:44.880> forgotten<00:01:45.420> about<00:01:45.540> this<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.890> just

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
I've forgotten about this and I just

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.649 
I've forgotten about this and I just
happened<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.369> be<00:01:47.460> do<00:01:47.610> cruising<00:01:48.090> YouTube<00:01:48.420> and

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
happened to be do cruising YouTube and

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.100 
happened to be do cruising YouTube and
saw<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.869> real<00:01:49.140> cool<00:01:49.380> video<00:01:49.770> of<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:51.110> just

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
saw a real cool video of this and just

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.899 
saw a real cool video of this and just
like<00:01:52.350> that's<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.920> know<00:01:53.040> this<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.430> what<00:01:53.610> I<00:01:53.670> want

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
like that's you know this is what I want

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.660 
like that's you know this is what I want
so<00:01:54.689> this<00:01:55.259> is<00:01:55.409> what<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.560> got<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:56.310> doesn't<00:01:56.579> really

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
so this is what I got it doesn't really

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.219 
so this is what I got it doesn't really
fit<00:01:57.000> what<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.360> originally<00:01:57.420> wanted<00:01:57.899> what

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
fit what I originally wanted what

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
first look it looks like a pretty well

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:04.110 
first look it looks like a pretty well
laid<00:03:57.099> out<00:04:02.220> like<00:04:03.220> I<00:04:03.340> might<00:04:03.549> be<00:04:03.670> seeing<00:04:03.880> some

laid out like I might be seeing some

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:19.469 
laid out like I might be seeing some
Phillips<00:04:04.420> head<00:04:04.599> screws<00:04:18.299> there's<00:04:19.299> the

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
Phillips head screws there's the

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:24.210 
Phillips head screws there's the

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
transmission with the the chain chain

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.000 
transmission with the the chain chain
right<00:04:24.430> there<00:04:24.720> I'm<00:04:25.720> very<00:04:26.200> unfamiliar<00:04:26.830> with

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
right there I'm very unfamiliar with

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:33.300 
right there I'm very unfamiliar with
that<00:04:27.070> so<00:04:29.850> that's<00:04:30.850> the<00:04:31.120> whole<00:04:31.860> the<00:04:32.860> whole<00:04:33.010> chain

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
that so that's the whole the whole chain

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:44.240 
that so that's the whole the whole chain
drive<00:04:33.639> system<00:04:34.150> right<00:04:34.270> there<00:04:37.080> and<00:04:38.080> the<00:04:38.830> wonky

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:54.770 

the<00:04:45.250> wonky<00:04:45.669> steering<00:04:46.210> system<00:04:46.720> here<00:04:46.960> I<00:04:47.169> think

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.000 

everything's<00:04:55.780> well<00:04:56.020> laid<00:04:56.200> out<00:04:56.410> is<00:04:56.590> really

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
everything's well laid out is really

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.339 
everything's well laid out is really
simple<00:04:57.370> Falls<00:04:57.700> and<00:04:58.030> well<00:04:58.120> nothing<00:04:58.930> appears<00:04:59.200> to

00:04:59.339 --> 00:04:59.349 
simple Falls and well nothing appears to

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:05.850 
simple Falls and well nothing appears to
be<00:04:59.440> all<00:04:59.590> that<00:04:59.800> confusing<00:05:00.400> I<00:05:04.349> mean<00:05:05.349> everything

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
be all that confusing I mean everything

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.760 
be all that confusing I mean everything
is<00:05:05.979> just<00:05:06.660> gonna<00:05:07.660> be<00:05:07.780> pretty<00:05:08.020> obvious<00:05:08.229> that<00:05:08.680> you

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
is just gonna be pretty obvious that you

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.140 
is just gonna be pretty obvious that you
can<00:05:08.889> tell<00:05:09.070> when<00:05:09.340> the<00:05:09.400> screws<00:05:09.760> go<00:05:09.849> but<00:05:10.090> I'm

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
can tell when the screws go but I'm

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.550 
can tell when the screws go but I'm
seeing<00:05:10.570> what<00:05:10.720> I've<00:05:10.780> seen<00:05:10.810> it<00:05:11.169> looks<00:05:11.320> like

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
seeing what I've seen it looks like

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.279 
seeing what I've seen it looks like
they're<00:05:11.740> using<00:05:11.770> some<00:05:12.840> possibly<00:05:13.840> some<00:05:14.020> films

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
they're using some possibly some films

they're using some possibly some films
head<00:05:14.440> screws<00:05:14.740> throughout<00:05:15.130> it

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:22.379 

all<00:05:18.979> right<00:05:19.069> this<00:05:19.219> is<00:05:19.599> this<00:05:20.599> is<00:05:20.779> that<00:05:20.899> battery

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
all right this is this is that battery

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:26.529 
all right this is this is that battery
right<00:05:23.389> here<00:05:24.369> and<00:05:25.369> I<00:05:25.459> do<00:05:25.519> not<00:05:25.669> know<00:05:26.029> why<00:05:26.239> but

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539 
right here and I do not know why but

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:28.809 
right here and I do not know why but
anyway<00:05:26.869> if<00:05:27.499> you<00:05:27.679> have<00:05:27.860> that<00:05:28.039> type<00:05:28.279> of<00:05:28.459> battery

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:28.819 
anyway if you have that type of battery

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:32.290 
anyway if you have that type of battery
that<00:05:29.059> takes<00:05:29.509> this<00:05:29.659> kind<00:05:29.839> of<00:05:29.959> plug<00:05:31.059> this<00:05:32.059> end

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
that takes this kind of plug this end

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.429 
that takes this kind of plug this end
plugs<00:05:32.689> into<00:05:32.929> the<00:05:33.080> battery<00:05:33.409> these<00:05:33.619> two<00:05:33.800> things

00:05:35.429 --> 00:05:35.439 
plugs into the battery these two things

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:39.589 
plugs into the battery these two things
you<00:05:36.439> grab

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:39.599 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:45.399 

so<00:05:40.349> if<00:05:40.469> you<00:05:40.619> have<00:05:40.770> this<00:05:40.949> style<00:05:41.219> of<00:05:41.369> battery

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:53.749 

plug-in<00:05:46.409> like<00:05:46.589> this<00:05:52.069> the<00:05:53.069> chills<00:05:53.369> that<00:05:53.610> this

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 
plug-in like this the chills that this

00:05:53.759 --> 00:06:01.510 
plug-in like this the chills that this
car<00:05:54.059> can<00:05:54.089> take<00:05:54.479> it<00:05:59.479> that<00:06:00.479> stall<00:06:00.809> the<00:06:00.959> battery
