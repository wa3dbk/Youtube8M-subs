broke me out but this one it has clear

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.100 
broke me out but this one it has clear
face<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.820> name<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.420> supposed<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.930> just

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
face in the name and supposed to just

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.749 
face in the name and supposed to just
and<00:01:22.350> then<00:01:22.500> supposed<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.130> clear<00:01:23.400> your<00:01:23.549> face

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
and then supposed to clear your face

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.560 
and then supposed to clear your face
brush<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.150> supposed<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.830> prevent<00:01:25.830> or<00:01:26.570> not

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
brush is supposed to prevent or not

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.899 
brush is supposed to prevent or not
cause<00:01:27.930> breakouts<00:01:28.500> so<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:28.950> find<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.400> this<00:01:29.610> has

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
cause breakouts so I find that this has

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.609 
cause breakouts so I find that this has
done<00:01:30.390> a<00:01:30.570> good<00:01:30.720> job<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.960> doing<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.320> not

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
done a good job of doing that not

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.289 
done a good job of doing that not
