 after the installation also you 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.279
 I remember that when installing this type of 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:23.869
 Rom, you will not have what the 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.159
 functions of the s &amp; p since they are only 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.199
 included in the rom with the 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:29.119
 personalization of those or are all 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:41.030
 welcome among solution in windows and 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:42.739
 we started with the video well in this case 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.329
 we'll start doing what the review is 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.340
 of the rom and we will finish with the 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.019
 installation now we are going to move 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.969
 until the adjustments to show what it is 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:51.500
 the android version that is based on 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:52.910
 this round very information from the phone 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.120
 and as you can see we have what is the 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.280
 latest version of android 5.1.1 lollipop 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.390
 for this device also learn what 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.460
 what is the date information and 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.829
 compilation and some other details of the 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.479
 device in this android version 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.040
 if the world has improved what is the 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.690
 battery management and what it is 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.160
 ram memory so I can get it for you 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.080
 personally recommend me and the 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.180
 installed time a week and it works 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.680
 correctly I have it personalized 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.450
 with the issues that gives us what is 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.500
 there is no longer there since it is one of the rom 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.720
 which can be customized to our 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.270
 taste depending on the topics that 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.560
 let's have the rom us available 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.000
 provides what are the adjustments 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.740
 common we can find in these 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.420
 Android versions I remind you that 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.460
 this rom is based on the account code 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.380
 or sf of google so that it appears to me 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.940
 what they are to gestures but very 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.100
 customizable we can observe that 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.150
 we have here the section of the device 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.800
 where we can change what is the 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.780
 sound what are the functions of the 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.220
 screen what are the topics what are 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.170
 notifications and some other 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.330
 Lock screen functions 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.070
 we also see this function that are 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.420
 the buttons that we can enable it if 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.800
 we want and we are enabled 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.540
 here the navigation buttons as 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.160
 they could observe but in my case 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.050
 I disable it because I do not need it 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.750
 we see it back here we can also 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.190
 establish what the users are 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.600
 we can enable additional accounts 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.880
 to be able to be used by the 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.649
 another user device and can we 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.880
 have access to our files too 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.009
 we can enter what are the 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.290
 applications I will show what it is 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.439
 of resources available to the device 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.780
 here in execution here we can observe 

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:19.970
 that we have a gigabyte of memory run 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.680
 free I have on this device that 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.900
 is 14 as everyone already knows 3 gigas of 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.730
 ram but if I have many 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.159
 installed applications giving around 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.900
 of about 40 or 50 to which I am 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.370
 testing and in most I do not use them 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.500
 simply install them to test it to 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.879
 see how they go and then in these 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.560
 Android versions as above 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.760
 they were told that they have improved what 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.650
 the battery management so you get the 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.239
 You can comment to warm up leds in your 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.579
 good device if you have a samsung 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.370
 galaxy 14 wants to use what are the 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.870
 roma esp on your device too 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.430
 you will notice what is the change at the time 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.560
 run applications and the time of 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.150
 move on the device will be a 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.950
 little faster than usual 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.480
 is with the personalized rom of sancho 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.400
 we go back there now let's go into the 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.840
 away from the camera the camera works 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.840
 correctly and a section that has 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.090
 improved or not and since previously 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.329
 the cameras I used from moadbus 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.310
 were this usp source code in what 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.810
 are the samsungs were very very bad at 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.299
 this case has improved as they can 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.799
 see the liquidity is excellent also that 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.850
 The hardware of the 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.950
 Device as 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.420
 we have 16 megapixels in which the 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.710
 back camera and it works without any 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.090
 problem when we get what 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.080
 is the application drawer we can 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.030
 notice that they come with some 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.730
 applications that are active from the rom 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.350
 usp additional bad that bring those who 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.150
 Google services are 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.800
 we now move to play 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.150
 the status bar we can see that 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.010
 the bar has been in the same as kika 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.960
 I have it personalized I have a 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.610
 additional topic well we enter the section 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.050
 of wifi here we can visualize the 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.240
 networks that we can connect through 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.950
 of the wifi and if we have any connection 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:48.600
 aerial in this section we can 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.250
 visualize what the devices are 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.720
 that we will have connected to our 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.790
 disposition of what is here where it says 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.020
 power we can visualize what is the 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.150
 amount of data we have consumed 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.320
 until the time now to enter what 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.090
 are the desktop settings 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.350
 we keep pressed and here we are 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.330
 unfold what are some adjustments 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.970
 to be able to customize even more what 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.100
 is the transitions some effects to the 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.930
 time to tell some application here 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.990
 here we can enter what are the 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.760
 wallpapers we can observe that 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.090
 are those commonly are being 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.090
 tithes 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.690
 well the truth is very good 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.100
 back and what the widgets are 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.330
 They know that the footprint depends on what they are 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.880
 the applications that we will have 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.620
 installed on our device well and 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.380
 this is the quick review of the rom now 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.760
 will happen what the installation method 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.930
 Now what you are going to do is download from 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.300
 the description of the video what is the 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.950
 rom and google services and we're going to 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.540
 Restart our device in mode 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.820
 recovery if your terminal allows you 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.410
 restart directly from the ronald 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.970
 You can do it again if you do not 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.070
 You pay if you hold down the volume 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.250
 top simultaneously in at 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.540
 three seconds 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.550
 to accept 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.350
 I will show how we will do what 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.820
 it's the installation process but I 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.500
 I really am not going to do it because 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.470
 I have configured and personalized to me 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.760
 but I will show you step by step 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.480
 how are you going to do the installation in your 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.640
 device 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.110
 taking into account that you have done the 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.610
 backup of your fs folder like 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.840
 also in android backup we are going to 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.030
 proceed with the installation of the 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:14.550
 let's break and where it says which one we're going to pass 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.380
 it does not tell you advance we're going to select 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.450
 white antich h we are going to select data 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.070
 and we're going to select cache once 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.660
 selected this translations we give you 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.070
 ship myself depending on what is the 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.510
 recovery that has in my case if 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.330
 I had the if you have people just 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.560
 we move what this function here and 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.180
 we will be given what the format of the 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.160
 device now we're going backwards 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.140
 we are going to tell you such if we are going to 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.940
 direct the other microsd memory and I 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.320
 I have a folder where I have the ones 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.730
 are the roms that I'm trying on this 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.010
 device as you can see first 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.990
 we installed what are rice and 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.190
 then installing the cap once 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.840
 finished the installation process 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.580
 we just have to restart the 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.350
 device and make the configurations 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.390
 relevant when we install 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.740
 a new rom and be able to configure it and 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.500
 to be able to use this way in our 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.180
 device well with this we finalized the 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.010
 today's video if you have questions or doubts 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.960
