00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.249
 batista70phone friends today I present to you 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:18.010
 the nature cover of the milk in original 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:22.810
 for samsung galaxy note quattro are 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:24.820
 some very thin tpu covers that 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.590
 leave the aesthetics of the 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.320
 terminal and still have a good one 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.660
 protection as you can see are 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.820
 really very thin they are very 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.890
 flexible have below the 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.820
 possibility of going to close for not 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:43.329
 let dust enter the micro inlet 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.649
 usb and idem in the upper part 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.559
 wait until he tried to focus it 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.499
 for the jack of three and a half we see how 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.629
 see you see that they are practically 

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:54.729
 invisible except for the dwarf writings 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.339
 kim ok the cam 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:58.839
 however it remains a bit elevated now 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.449
 let's focus on are some 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:04.050
 messed up with lights and is that the cam 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:07.509
 however it remains in any case 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:12.189
 elevated as I told you possibilities 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:14.409
 to close the various holes because 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.930
 let's try to put some fire 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.240
 here the nib remains well accessible 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.500
 with no problem whatsoever 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.500
 true that now it has turned me on 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.469
 frontally leaves that minimum of 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:31.920
 protection 

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:31.920
 you can see 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.759
 very nice the grip increases obviously 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.509
 because they are like more covers 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.560
 therefore they are moved and the hold remains 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.220
 better in terms of thickness 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.049
 as you can see it does not increase by per 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.049
 however, nothing remains very much anyway 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:55.030
 very fine and with this concluded greeting 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.360
 from them and sales batista70 for batiste 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.360
 always
