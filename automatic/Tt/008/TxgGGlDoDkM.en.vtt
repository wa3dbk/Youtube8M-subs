00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 welcome to the techno tuto ssppc channel 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.519
 this time we will learn to 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:11.219
 update windows 8.1 to windows 8.1 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.769
 Gates first'll give them some 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.920
 windows 8.1 and why had not been 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.750
 talking about this simple update 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.310
 because there are many people many of you 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.890
 I have been asked in private messages 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.949
 are comments have told me hey and you do not 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.599
 you will talk about windows 8.1 blade for me not 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.970
 I think it is necessary to talk about this 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.279
 update because because as I have 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.110
 said is an update we are not 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.079
 talking about a new operating system with 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.210
 many handled that good 8.2 between 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.489
 other kind of things is not simply the 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.500
 first great update that microsoft 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.989
 incorporates to your operating system more 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.930
 current that is windows 8.1 and good 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.640
 simply add update 1 as 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.680
 at the time in windows 7 were the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.980
 service pack 1 pack them two venues 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.960
 pack 3 so well now let 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.640
 talk a little about this and why 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.739
 he did not make a video before as 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.359
 many other eaves tours that said 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.710
 You can download it through this 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.240
 method and left in the update 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.280
 available for download 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.590
 I just did not want to risk 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.869
 many times those updates are 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.119
 pirates or just are not well 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.729
 designed or are betas are not even 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.830
 the final updates I wanted 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.509
 wait because finally microsoft was going 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.399
 to launch these updates through 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.470
 of windows update then I decided 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.299
 wait and at this time they are already 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.520
 available on any computer 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.470
 those updates to install on 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.689
 our computer without any problem and 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.909
 are the official updates of 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.649
 microsoft that's why I waited up 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.560
 this moment and we are going to learn to 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.759
 update them in the easiest way 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.640
 later on he will be doing 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.770
 a review of willis 8.1 plate and the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.899
 differences that I have noticed regarding the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.330
 previous version that is windows 8.1 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.709
 normal and good I do not bore you anymore 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:59.360
 let's start well first thing we're going to 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:02:01.760
 do here is going to be entering the search engine 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.290
 in this case I have here my search engine and 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.290
 let's write windows 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.370
 date in this way let's open that 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.440
 here it looks blue with the 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.900
 green arrows and let's wait for a 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.239
 moment how can we realize that 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.349
 llama appear to my two updates 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.420
 but you do not know how to go directly 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.360
 here but we 're going to click where 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.430
 says look for updates here we're going to 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.130
 wait a bit simply to that 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.989
 finish looking for those updates 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.800
 so we can update to windows 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.690
 8.1 perfect rate to me since I determined 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.510
 of looking for my updates and she 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.180
 has detected three updates now 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.130
 if we come here to the center or 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.510
 updates then we're going to have to 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.910
 I have here for example this 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.130
 security update for internet 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:53.100
 explorer and the one that interests me that is 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.799
 down here that is windows 8.1 law for 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.720
 operating systems in 64 bits 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.340
 obviously if you have a system 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.709
 32-bit operating 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.650
 here I would be showing you 86 in 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.080
 place of by 64 in this case I have 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.239
 a 64 bit operating system so 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.450
 so much appears to me the updating of 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:14.220
 the key 29 19 35 5 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.750
 all other derivations that are 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.819
 they find this inside this 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.500
 update and that once we have 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.780
 updated this update that weighs 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.269
 almost a gig we are talking about almost 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.150
 900 megabytes because we are going to be able to 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.739
 install this update now here 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.269
 let's unmark what we do not want 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.980
 install in this case I do not want 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.470
 update internet security 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.780
 explorer 11 would have to mark this 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.000
 checkbox so we can install the 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.879
 update that in this case is this 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.260
 which is windows 8.1 update and simply 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.569
 we will have to click where it says 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.569
 install now will start to download 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.849
 my update later goes to 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.739
 start automatically to install this 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.930
 update and good then when 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:58.769
 learn my computer I'm going to have 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.599
 installed windows 8.1 or blade I hope them 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:04.079
 have liked this video and later 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:07.049
 we will be analyzing the new windows 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:09.989
 8.1 update this was all and see you in 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:12.590
