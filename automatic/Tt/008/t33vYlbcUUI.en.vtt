00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:16.890
 and then God here and today I will make a video 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.660
 especially since there is no video day today 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.699
 I play this match I found it interesting 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.170
 I wanted to say something about it. 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.900
 betting first thing as the 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.849
 Vale bear from our team started in blue 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.470
 enemy I decided to start on the frog 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.360
 direct in total I do what I 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.399
 start in django and atp top but until 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.620
 Okay, well, what I want to show 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.290
 tell you the truth that the video 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.539
 it's going to be about is what to do when 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.690
 the disadvantage when I make a 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.270
 bobeada usually in the last video you 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.760
 saw that when the game started badly for 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.250
 one team or another team removed the other 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.949
 face that tried and stopped playing and did not 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.680
 could see something like that and threw himself 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.140
 make a stupid mess 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.240
 Too dumb for you, I have no idea. 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.159
 explain to you what went wrong 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.780
 first was my first match of the 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.990
 Day you can see that I'm going to cancel 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.360
 an attack I canceled the attack and from there 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.030
 I closed and I could not kill 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.140
 the guy because of the dollar attack with 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.060
 goose lei 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.140
 if he had got flashblood he 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.000
 would have died 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.640
 it would still have been bad because 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.990
 He realized that he had given you betray tower 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.549
 1 watt had atp 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.650
 so now I would have given you baby 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.960
 would have gone back but would still have 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.490
 been better than I will only die one 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.530
 band 2 black 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.700
 well what I want to explain starts here 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.619
 The first thing I did when I did it 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.210
 It was the hell that I set up my 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.790
 game because he did not do anything wrong 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.979
 I was the answer but the question is that 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.220
 if he said some shit he could stay 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.960
 Angry and that's upsetting my 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.299
 performance in the rest of the game then you 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.329
 have to fine the guy stay focused not 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.500
 have to do now realize that the ex a 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.909
 invading django 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.280
 I enjoyed that I was coming back to 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.560
 besides and Alex in a very good rotation she 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.879
 go up 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:13.560
 and here is where I'm going to get the 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.390
 best thing that was for me in this game 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.310
 I was bad at law can not stay me 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.110
 pressing and I end up picking macchio 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.050
 next to 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.330
 so matthew ew bush but still 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.190
 I'm far behind but you have 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.450
 that having too much for me to return it 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.670
 will get my vote just 5 nearly 30 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.080
 still mounted and you will see the 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.230
 I played that bottle. 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.970
 as I was behind in the top farm 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.800
 mostly I stayed a while alone 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.390
 forming and trying to recover you light 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.620
 can see that I have already recovered in the form of 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.780
 tous meireles the pump and not a 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.430
 gang that releases him 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.510
 I realized he's from Tikuca then I 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.220
 It kind of scared me because I did not 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.600
 I wanted to do shit again but this 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.459
 time is not from the mouth throw in that part was 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.400
 where I disputed him because now if he 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.690
 he was not going to say anything about 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.700
 daivison I gave 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.580
 so I did not stress and that's where the 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.560
 game could improve for me it 's good power 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.890
 see the tps I gave to help the team 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.080
 how it influenced the game like me 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.900
 I'm a dear person and Alex gave me 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.070
 that one here in the top 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.329
 exact location 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.340
 be sure to take the time to help 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.799
 She that you can take good ends. 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:35.069
 I got one more for free and I got 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:36.840
 save her even more right now in the 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.500
 disadvantage started the game is already equal in 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.420
 farm with a blog and geek 3 that the positive 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.280
 I could stop the video here but I want 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.700
 show me another time I gave 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.049
 How long has this game ended and how? 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.970
 You can see back to the top 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:54.650
 I was much admired until the 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.650
 point that I can score on top of it 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:07.700
 even this flash being stupid the 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.430
 The next time I gave it went to 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.220
 help my team because it's good when the boat 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.720
 he just an aggressive party up the 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.430
 GrÃªmio said 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.230
 I've seen this because very fast because 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.280
 When he started from the levada it was not 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:23.600
 when I'm going to take time out from there 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:32.180
 adins the week and will end up being more 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:33.770
 Cold for me is a personal I hope 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.750
 did you realize that moving to 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.670
 You guys this video like I said do not 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.260
 it was a video that I planned to bet on 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.720
 I just play the game, you decide to post. 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.690
 just tell you a little bit that everything 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.210
 world does not have bad move 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.040
 I'm not so direct only bad 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.360
 I never played with her very much so I'm 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.320
 accustomed to the champion I ended up doing 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.180
 dude it was more is the same mechanic but 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.380
 if I had been shaken I see 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.120
 A lot of people are coming to talk to me. 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.010
 very shaken when it happens 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.630
 something like that and game is over 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.880
 influencing the rest of the game 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.740
 you can see the only one the team has taken 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.020
 It was that one here the rest of the team stayed 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.480
 Very well, I was able to help Alex too. 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.950
 at first it ended up getting very strong 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.960
 also 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.780
 and you can see that I ended 10/11 that 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:21.100
 only death was the one that was stupid 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:24.620
 I will emphasize this word prison 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.970
 So that's it, besides working at 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.040
 The mechanics of you work in the 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:32.750
 psychological and thank you
