00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.200 
would be a flat flat let's just write

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.350 
would be a flat flat let's just write
that<00:00:35.230> in<00:00:36.420> B<00:00:37.420> flat<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:39.370> going<00:00:39.700> down<00:00:39.850> one<00:00:40.150> note

sharp<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:55.809> note<00:00:56.050> gets<00:00:56.260> two<00:00:56.410> beats<00:00:56.559> and<00:00:57.129> this

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
sharp this note gets two beats and this

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.990 
sharp this note gets two beats and this
one<00:00:57.850> gets<00:00:58.059> two<00:00:58.300> beats<00:00:58.330> because<00:00:59.080> it<00:00:59.230> is<00:00:59.350> tied<00:01:00.000> to

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
one gets two beats because it is tied to

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.619 
one gets two beats because it is tied to
the<00:01:01.120> same<00:01:01.480> note<00:01:01.960> or<00:01:02.769> the<00:01:02.800> next<00:01:03.159> measure

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
the same note or the next measure

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.490 
the same note or the next measure
probably<00:01:04.629> say<00:01:04.750> well<00:01:04.989> why<00:01:05.140> didn't<00:01:05.409> they<00:01:05.470> just

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
probably say well why didn't they just

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.470 
probably say well why didn't they just
put<00:01:05.830> a<00:01:05.860> half<00:01:06.159> note<00:01:06.460> here<00:01:06.700> because<00:01:07.000> a<00:01:07.030> half<00:01:07.240> note

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:07.480 
put a half note here because a half note

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.920 
put a half note here because a half note
won't<00:01:07.659> fit<00:01:08.140> in<00:01:08.409> 3/4<00:01:08.950> 3/4<00:01:09.670> time<00:01:09.909> we've<00:01:10.450> got<00:01:10.630> one

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.560 
won't fit in 3/4 3/4 time we've got one
two<00:01:11.500> three<00:01:11.860> if<00:01:12.580> you<00:01:12.670> want<00:01:12.880> to<00:01:13.030> beats<00:01:13.240> on<00:01:13.450> this

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
two three if you want to beats on this

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.930 
two three if you want to beats on this
note<00:01:13.780> you've<00:01:13.960> got<00:01:14.140> to<00:01:14.260> tie<00:01:14.500> it<00:01:14.560> to<00:01:14.980> a<00:01:15.159> beaten<00:01:15.880> in

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
note you've got to tie it to a beaten in

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.310 
note you've got to tie it to a beaten in
the<00:01:15.970> next<00:01:16.300> measure<00:01:16.479> because<00:01:16.870> you<00:01:16.990> can't<00:01:17.200> have

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
the next measure because you can't have

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.770 
the next measure because you can't have
more<00:01:17.470> than<00:01:17.590> three<00:01:17.860> beats<00:01:18.100> in<00:01:18.280> this<00:01:18.490> measure<00:01:18.790> so

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
more than three beats in this measure so

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:23.480 

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.140 

and<00:07:24.620> that<00:07:25.620> is<00:07:26.010> all<00:07:26.190> you<00:07:26.310> have<00:07:26.460> to<00:07:26.580> learn<00:07:26.700> of<00:07:26.970> the

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:27.150 
and that is all you have to learn of the

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:28.940 
and that is all you have to learn of the
song<00:07:27.390> because<00:07:27.600> this<00:07:27.900> is<00:07:28.020> just<00:07:28.230> the<00:07:28.320> a<00:07:28.350> section

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:28.950 
song because this is just the a section

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:30.800 
song because this is just the a section
again<00:07:29.190> the<00:07:29.370> a<00:07:29.400> section<00:07:29.910> simply<00:07:30.240> repeats<00:07:30.630> at

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:30.810 
again the a section simply repeats at

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.390 
again the a section simply repeats at
the<00:07:30.960> end<00:07:31.080> so<00:07:31.530> there's<00:07:31.710> really<00:07:31.830> only<00:07:31.950> eight

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 
the end so there's really only eight

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.670 
the end so there's really only eight
measures<00:07:32.820> for<00:07:33.180> the<00:07:33.270> a<00:07:33.300> section<00:07:33.870> and<00:07:34.080> eight

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:34.680 
measures for the a section and eight

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.070 
measures for the a section and eight
measures<00:07:34.920> for<00:07:35.280> the<00:07:35.370> B<00:07:35.520> section<00:07:35.790> and<00:07:36.210> you<00:07:36.930> know

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.080 
measures for the B section and you know

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.220 
measures for the B section and you know
the<00:07:37.230> left<00:07:37.410> hand<00:07:37.650> of<00:07:37.860> this<00:07:37.980> piece
