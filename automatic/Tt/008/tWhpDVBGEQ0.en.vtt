00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.970
 and so difficult and panorama 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.970
 well first 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.240
 but 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.710
 3 we are looking for here it is besides the peace bridge we 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.210
 we will not load it into programs 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.580
 the case is initially that is, we already have 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:27.619
 panorama with these difficulties in assembling 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:30.800
 these difficulties arose because of parallax 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.910
 we have only three files in the period they are estimated 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.280
 17 millimeters 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.950
 they look like this 1 inside 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.490
 fight room probably they were withdrawn from the deadline 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:44.270
 tripod and just the same with the slope 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.830
 tilted exactly vertical orientation 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.550
 because of what in general type lived serious 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.460
 pro wax error 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.860
 but not the point here we have three frames we 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:56.180
 we start to collect them we open on a tag and 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.210
 push and war if we all 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.690
 the program has collected well we have this thing 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.910
 respectively 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.970
 continue to work with it if the program 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.799
 the dog is not collected at all we can 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.460
 do not press the line we can try 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.930
 manually set checkpoints 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.830
 go to the most important thing open 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.830
 panorama editor 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.420
 somehow turn off 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.079
 it was visible we have a lip window and 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.329
 exhibit show since 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:29.439
 and respectively between 1 and 2 pictures 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:31.909
 he can see such lovely here 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.920
 it's strong enough pro wax on 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:39.479
 distortion it turns out that 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:42.430
 there is a break of these lines here 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.310
 rather ugly and in general then if 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.140
 run it through the blending but 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.020
 you about the same cant and get 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.800
 it will be photos do not lose time 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.770
 go to the menu so not here now find 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.729
 hryvnia and programs do not lose time go 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.729
 in the checkpoint menu 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.380
 walk the same area between the first and 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:10.330
 second files yes we see that 1 2 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.100
 control. we are already affixed to 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.620
 basically can just so I do not watch 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.270
 looked to this error error vatu to 16 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.640
 I come I will not deal with the removal 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.430
 some values i just don't think that 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.100
 in this case it will help exactly 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.890
 there really can be such a mistake and 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.160
 So 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.730
 we see that here these areas if 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.350
 look at the magnifying glass window she us 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.390
 shows that here here we 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.040
 an error occurs, the joint is my dust we 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.490
 we see that there are not enough control 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.510
 points 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.040
 let us not hand them 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.930
 put down and ask for the program 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.750
 hold shift and you click 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.530
 select the right mouse button general 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.990
 control points 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.910
 so here we put down yes you can still 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.100
 pro vyzalyatsya put still in a couple of places 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.950
 and do not check how it delivers them 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.870
 I hope that she is not too strong 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.470
 tupit and for example a couple of points 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.470
 affixed 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:10.110
 on the boards below I donâ€™t close these windows 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.060
 they help me look in the close 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:16.260
 we see I come to an optimizer window 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.370
 so that you can enable the optimizer and 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.980
 set the program accordingly 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.080
 read these control points i press 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.150
 she blinks that not bad 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.830
 the fact that we still have a mistake 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.740
 we see that the error became a little less 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.220
 but still bad well let's do it one more time 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.200
 let's continue 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.310
 the same procedure is chosen 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.629
 any for example 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:42.040
 plot here with these bigger lines 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:44.019
 than angina right control points he 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.690
 says what he sees control 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:49.390
 points to take it one more time ask here 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.860
 he put a couple there okay we will 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.730
 consider that it is enough well 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:57.430
 a couple of points for example on the fence is fine 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:01.569
 now a lot with the new optimizer again 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.310
 we run it again and well, well 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.430
 we see that almost did not get away 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.980
 error fine okay then we can 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.900
 try for example to let the area 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.200
 masking is not in a straight line like this 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.670
 done by us by default on some 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.780
 random trajectory that we ourselves 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.850
 we indicate we arrive ved mask 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.600
 we find the average image in which 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:28.970
 Peter and Paul Fortress is depicted 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:30.530
 most goal no I in 14 minutes I go 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.040
 I'll speak my own very quickly 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.300
 slow motion replay will look 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.820
 accordingly we took the first picture 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:41.240
 brought it closer to be more convenient 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.300
 work and take speak program then 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.950
 what we want to see 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.410
 Peter and Paul Fortress 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:52.010
 we blur the first frame accordingly 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.140
 in green and and gloss over and see on 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.270
 miniature 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:05:00.200
 about and how is this the border 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:03.490
 goes to the other edge respectively 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:06.860
 Shifts to the right can also be on the window 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.990
 find select numbers so we can on 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.790
 window panorama editor will see that we have 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.500
 already border masking slightly 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.480
 shifted however edits anyway 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.350
 remained an example quite strongly 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.440
 swept up on the fence 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.690
 not a problem we spend a little by 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.130
 fence but of course it's all in this 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.170
 there is a separate case here 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.370
 notice that 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:28.100
 masking by tag i we will execute none 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.420
 In no case are you just in Photoshop 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.160
 prioritize meaning you don't 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.500
 draw clearly the border in any 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.610
 case, you can put it here 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.890
 much larger area 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.890
 that is, you do it all very, very 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:45.360
 roughly but here respectively I 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.110
 roughly put down well and in general, here it is 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.020
 already 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.310
 the junction of the images is here we see 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.640
 what he gave them is still clumsy 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:55.710
 enough but its sloppy she's 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:58.190
 limits of permissible in principle with this 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.570
 most likely heating how it will cope 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:04.920
 also we can see what is 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:07.680
 bug a little wolf here here we can 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:10.080
 go to about 1 photogram zero 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.009
 photograph and ask for example to take 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.610
 information from 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:15.190
 not and 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:19.350
 well from 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.350
 the price we come to is that 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.700
 we have 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.170
 it looks pretty nice already 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:29.000
 with a minimum of settings 

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:29.000
 here you can look at this case 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:33.979
 tool magnifier and you see what she 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:36.870
 it was pretty good 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:39.089
 after that we naturally go to 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:41.969
 create menu on frame and so on there 

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:44.849
 run the assembly we can see how 

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:51.430
 she looks like I honestly aren't like any 

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:53.080
 did not make manual adjustments 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.300
 well here you see what after of the 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.820
 blending this violent she in general then this 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.590
 file you have the word gathered 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.430
 okay, no such ones 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:04.870
 kia did not notice serious visible jambs 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:08.350
 look at this picture most likely 

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:10.960
 at home I can open the second figure this 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:12.760
 already such a later progress that is 

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.750
 I was sitting at home alone all things neatly 

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:18.730
 collected and that's how my mask looks 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:23.610
 the advice is not completely petropavlovka and 

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:25.810
 took a piece of butter from the first frame and 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:29.760
 a piece here of trees here I 

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:33.490
 painted red that is said not to take 

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.870
 0 frames here respectively these files of you 

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:38.080
 have you can collect them also you 

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:40.360
 You can draw masks as possible 

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.950
 in a lighter version but in principle 

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.390
 In this case, I can not say that I 

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.580
 spent a lot of time 

00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:49.020
 less result as you can see may not 

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.020
 perfect but not bad
