00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:11.630
 Since there was no r sim at last 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:13.550
 If you want to use the docomo version of this iPhone 5 c to unlock the sim 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.680
 I'm sorry 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.680
 First remove the docomo sim card 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.670
 4 It is your Lord card 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:32.970
 Here it is the main body of rc 6 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:35.449
 It is a software bank version in the body I want to put a sim card of the soft bump version 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.449
 I think 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.270
 I think I want to put in 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.130
 It is a little large Kashii in the little pink tray 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.550
 I'm in search here 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.140
 Hmm 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.010
 I'm buying gold 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.300
 I 'm searching again 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:50.130
 You have selected this top so 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:53.729
 There was jp docomo 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.320
 This is docomo version of iphone 5 c 7 de 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:02:00.909
 jp docomo selection 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:05.040
 Then this is iphone 5 c so iphone 5 s &amp; 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.040
 Select iphone 5 c 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.619
 I am searching for 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:24.030
 It is not good 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.030
 It will be out of range 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.860
 I would like to go into airplane mode once 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.590
 It is out of service no matter how many times 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.790
 I think that I want to restart again once off the power 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:24.860
 So here it is purchased with amazon this time 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:26.920
 It's about 1500 yen in red, so it's thin from Hong Kong and it takes quite some time 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.920
 The 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:34.130
 I think this seal is probably genuine 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.940
 shot 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.940
 It is suspicious 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.980
 And west start 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.189
 Search is in progress 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:24.490
 It was out of service soon again 

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.490
 eh 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:36.990
 This time before p where why this column will try Sancho once 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.780
 I do not react anymore 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:54.150
 tap Where is it already selected 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.150
 5 c 7 de 5 c selection 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:57.149
 Oops 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.380
 And the ne little understanding was a whoa Kathe over character 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.760
 I think you want to launch it in- flight mode 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.160
 This it will be in another breath outside the prefecture 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.180
 It is no good 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.350
 The phone number is also unknown 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.039
 I will try at 55 once 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.289
 The same thing is happening with 5 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.400
 After all it is out of range 

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.680
 Once a little bit sim card 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.410
 I would like to put it in once 

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:44.830
 No sim is in search 

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:59.160
 After all it will become a gold buy back again during the search 

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:17.479
 It's no good, I'm out of range 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.479
 The 

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:27.849
 It is here this time, but I introduced rc 6 line 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:29.670
 It has been repeated during the search and outside the prefecture 

00:07:27.849 --> 00:07:31.860
 In addition Oh 

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:36.409
 A little 

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.409
 I would like to review it again if successful
