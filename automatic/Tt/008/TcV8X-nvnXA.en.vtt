now obviously all the players have to
you<00:01:07.950> know<00:01:08.040> get<00:01:08.369> together<00:01:08.549> again<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.240> gel

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
together again how difficult is it as a

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.760 
together again how difficult is it as a
captain<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.840> know<00:01:12.960> encourage<00:01:13.170> star<00:01:13.680> to

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
captain to you know encourage star to

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.830 
captain to you know encourage star to
bring<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.100> about<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.670> think<00:01:15.119> it's<00:01:15.360> tough<00:01:15.540> you

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
bring it about I think it's tough you

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.240 
bring it about I think it's tough you
know<00:01:15.869> when<00:01:16.140> when<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.590> don't<00:01:16.770> have<00:01:16.890> much<00:01:17.040> time

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
know when when you don't have much time

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.700 
know when when you don't have much time
and<00:01:17.610> deem<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.180> joining<00:01:18.420> together<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.869> players

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
and deem the joining together of players

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.350 
and deem the joining together of players
are<00:01:19.830> gelling<00:01:20.070> together<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:20.880> think<00:01:21.210> our

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
are gelling together but I think our

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.170 
are gelling together but I think our
players<00:01:21.570> had<00:01:21.720> a<00:01:21.750> fair<00:01:22.200> bit<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.439> time<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:23.460> since

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
players had a fair bit of time and since

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.490 
players had a fair bit of time and since
I<00:01:24.299> have<00:01:24.390> come<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:24.720> just<00:01:24.990> getting<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.350> another

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
I have come in just getting to another

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.950 
I have come in just getting to another
place<00:01:25.710> better<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.250> whatever<00:01:26.850> plans<00:01:27.180> we<00:01:27.720> had

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
place better and whatever plans we had

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.380 
place better and whatever plans we had
with<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.799> coach<00:01:29.009> coaching<00:01:29.790> staff<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.360> think

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
with the coach coaching staff I think

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.429 
with the coach coaching staff I think
went<00:01:31.350> really<00:01:31.560> well<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.829> game<00:01:32.150> so<00:01:33.439> it's

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
went really well in the game so it's

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.050 
went really well in the game so it's
gone<00:01:34.710> it's<00:01:35.070> been<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.430> good<00:01:35.579> start<00:01:35.820> it's

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
gone it's been a good start it's

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.780 
gone it's been a good start it's
important<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.509> get<00:01:36.630> points<00:01:36.840> on<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.110> board<00:01:37.350> and
