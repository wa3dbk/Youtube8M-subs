00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.410 
t truck body and those those fit nicely
in<00:01:18.750> here<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.500> we<00:01:20.100> also<00:01:20.280> have<00:01:20.780> another<00:01:21.780> option

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
in here and we also have another option

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.950 
in here and we also have another option
to<00:01:24.420> three<00:01:25.049> LED<00:01:25.560> boards<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.180> can<00:01:27.540> use

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
to three LED boards so that you can use

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.359 
to three LED boards so that you can use
the<00:01:28.320> killer<00:01:29.280> RC<00:01:29.880> light<00:01:30.420> controller<00:01:31.340> and<00:01:32.340> have

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
the killer RC light controller and have

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.410 
the killer RC light controller and have
a<00:01:33.060> headlight<00:01:33.479> control<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.520> also<00:01:35.520> brake<00:01:35.970> and

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
a headlight control and also brake and

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.789 
a headlight control and also brake and
turn<00:01:37.409> signal<00:01:37.909> so<00:01:39.110> you<00:01:40.110> could<00:01:40.259> have<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.439> left

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
turn signal so you could have a left

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.240 
turn signal so you could have a left
turn<00:01:40.979> signal<00:01:41.570> and<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.780> right<00:01:42.990> turn<00:01:43.229> signal<00:01:43.259> like

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
turn signal and a right turn signal like

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.800 
turn signal and a right turn signal like
so<00:01:45.409> how<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:47.340> mount<00:01:47.549> these<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:48.689> pretty

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
so how to to mount these it's pretty

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.450 
so how to to mount these it's pretty
simple<00:01:49.380> they<00:01:49.610> just<00:01:50.610> fit<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.030> there<00:01:52.430> with<00:01:53.430> a

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
simple they just fit in there with a

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.030 
simple they just fit in there with a
good<00:01:53.729> press<00:01:54.350> of<00:01:55.350> your<00:01:55.409> fingers<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:57.619> they<00:01:58.619> they

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
good press of your fingers and they they

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.340 
good press of your fingers and they they
fit<00:01:59.219> in<00:01:59.369> there<00:01:59.520> pretty<00:01:59.759> tight<00:01:59.850> but<00:02:00.750> it's<00:02:01.049> a

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
fit in there pretty tight but it's a

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.870 
fit in there pretty tight but it's a
good<00:02:01.590> idea<00:02:02.030> for<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:04.640> and<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.729> add<00:02:05.850> a

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
good idea for you to and you add a

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.059 
good idea for you to and you add a
little<00:02:06.119> bit<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.390> shoe<00:02:07.110> goo<00:02:07.380> around<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.829> wires

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
little bit of shoe goo around the wires

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.670 
little bit of shoe goo around the wires
just<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:09.270> keep<00:02:09.450> them<00:02:09.660> from<00:02:09.840> flopping<00:02:10.470> around

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
just to keep them from flopping around

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.770 
just to keep them from flopping around
to<00:02:12.370> keep<00:02:12.519> the<00:02:12.670> wires<00:02:12.879> from<00:02:13.150> breaking<00:02:13.569> loose

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
to keep the wires from breaking loose

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.380 
to keep the wires from breaking loose
from<00:02:13.989> the<00:02:14.109> circuit<00:02:14.500> board<00:02:14.909> now<00:02:15.909> if<00:02:16.060> you<00:02:16.180> do

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
from the circuit board now if you do

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.280

go ahead and show you how I put this
around<00:02:48.579> these<00:02:48.790> wires<00:02:49.480> here<00:02:49.900> and<00:02:50.139> if<00:02:50.769> you're<00:02:51.010> if

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
around these wires here and if you're if

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.220 
around these wires here and if you're if
you're<00:02:51.849> gonna<00:02:52.030> run<00:02:52.239> your<00:02:52.299> Baha<00:02:52.750> in<00:02:52.900> the<00:02:52.989> water

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
you're gonna run your Baha in the water

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.879 
you're gonna run your Baha in the water
and<00:02:53.590> snow<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:54.730> stuff<00:02:54.970> like<00:02:55.180> that<00:02:55.620> it<00:02:56.620> might<00:02:56.769> be

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:56.889 
and snow and stuff like that it might be

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:59.610 
and snow and stuff like that it might be
a<00:02:56.919> good<00:02:57.099> idea<00:02:57.129> to<00:02:57.519> just<00:02:57.700> go<00:02:57.760> ahead<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.329> seal<00:02:59.319> up

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
a good idea to just go ahead and seal up

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.559 
a good idea to just go ahead and seal up
the<00:02:59.889> whole<00:03:00.069> back<00:03:00.459> of<00:03:00.669> the<00:03:00.730> circuit<00:03:01.150> board<00:03:01.329> just

the whole back of the circuit board just

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.770 
the whole back of the circuit board just
give<00:03:02.200> it<00:03:02.319> a<00:03:02.409> thin<00:03:02.680> coat<00:03:03.010> of<00:03:03.480> some<00:03:04.480> kind<00:03:04.719> of
