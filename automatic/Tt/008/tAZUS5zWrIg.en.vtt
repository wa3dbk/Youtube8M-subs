00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
except that you can see a little bit

00:01:00.550 --> 00:02:19.440 
except that you can see a little bit
more

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.440 

there<00:02:20.450> here's<00:02:20.810> just<00:02:21.049> a<00:02:21.200> shot<00:02:21.440> right<00:02:21.709> down

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
there here's just a shot right down

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:29.990 
there here's just a shot right down
Michigan<00:02:23.450> Avenue

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.490 

okay<00:02:31.000> most<00:02:31.300> of<00:02:31.390> this<00:02:31.510> place<00:02:31.600> has<00:02:31.990> been<00:02:32.200> cleared

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
okay most of this place has been cleared

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.110 
okay most of this place has been cleared
out<00:02:32.680> this<00:02:32.950> is<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.280> piece<00:02:33.490> that<00:02:33.520> I<00:02:33.820> believe

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
out this is the piece that I believe

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.860 
out this is the piece that I believe
that<00:02:34.410> remains<00:02:35.410> as<00:02:35.650> being<00:02:35.920> talked<00:02:36.190> about<00:02:36.870> the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
that remains as being talked about the

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.260 
that remains as being talked about the
team<00:02:38.650> that<00:02:38.890> team<00:02:39.310> of<00:02:39.430> people<00:02:39.550> that<00:02:39.730> want<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.150> to

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
team that team of people that want it to

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.330 
team that team of people that want it to
conserve<00:02:40.690> it<00:02:40.870> turn<00:02:41.290> it<00:02:41.410> into<00:02:41.560> something<00:02:41.950> I

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
conserve it turn it into something I

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.780 
conserve it turn it into something I
think<00:02:43.300> this<00:02:43.390> is<00:02:43.450> about<00:02:43.720> all<00:02:43.990> that's<00:02:44.230> left

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
think this is about all that's left

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:50.000 
think this is about all that's left
we'll<00:02:45.790> see<00:02:45.970> what<00:02:46.090> happens

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.410 

right<00:02:51.010> back<00:02:51.310> in<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:51.549> stadium<00:02:51.849> right<00:02:52.150> across

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
right back in the stadium right across

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.850 
right back in the stadium right across
the<00:02:52.659> street<00:02:52.689> as<00:02:53.110> a<00:02:53.140> matter<00:02:53.409> of<00:02:53.500> fact<00:02:53.560> of

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
the street as a matter of fact of

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.059 
the street as a matter of fact of
shooting<00:02:54.220> through<00:02:54.459> this<00:02:54.579> gate<00:02:54.909> and<00:02:55.950> give<00:02:56.950> you

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
shooting through this gate and give you

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.970 
shooting through this gate and give you
a<00:02:57.129> little<00:02:57.310> idea<00:02:57.989> what<00:02:58.989> things<00:02:59.319> look<00:02:59.560> like<00:02:59.590> from

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
a little idea what things look like from

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.869 
a little idea what things look like from
this<00:03:00.189> angle<00:03:01.920> this<00:03:02.920> is<00:03:03.129> really<00:03:03.280> literally

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
this angle this is really literally

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.369 
this angle this is really literally
right<00:03:04.090> across<00:03:04.239> the<00:03:04.569> street<00:03:04.599> in<00:03:04.959> fact<00:03:05.170> if<00:03:05.290> I

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
right across the street in fact if I

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.500 
right across the street in fact if I
paying<00:03:05.709> in<00:03:05.950> I<00:03:06.220> can<00:03:06.849> get<00:03:06.970> right<00:03:07.150> up<00:03:07.299> on<00:03:07.450> that

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
paying in I can get right up on that

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.020 
paying in I can get right up on that
little<00:03:07.870> insurance<00:03:08.620> way<00:03:09.069> but<00:03:09.310> it's<00:03:09.430> too<00:03:09.790> tight

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
little insurance way but it's too tight

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.420 
little insurance way but it's too tight
that<00:03:10.299> you<00:03:10.480> can<00:03:10.750> make<00:03:10.900> out<00:03:11.049> muck<00:03:12.040> so<00:03:12.280> I'll<00:03:12.370> just

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
that you can make out muck so I'll just

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.119 
that you can make out muck so I'll just
kind<00:03:12.760> of<00:03:12.849> stay<00:03:13.090> away<00:03:13.329> paying<00:03:13.870> around<00:03:13.989> here<00:03:14.409> you

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
kind of stay away paying around here you

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
see what city in the background there

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.479 
see what city in the background there
across<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.849> street<00:03:19.269> you<00:03:19.450> can<00:03:19.629> see<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:20.489> Brooks

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
across the street you can see the Brooks

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.920 
across the street you can see the Brooks
lumberyard<00:03:22.120> and<00:03:24.060> as<00:03:25.060> I<00:03:25.209> keep<00:03:25.420> going<00:03:25.569> to<00:03:25.810> the

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
lumberyard and as I keep going to the

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:34.090 
lumberyard and as I keep going to the
left<00:03:27.359> see<00:03:28.359> some<00:03:28.569> more<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:29.079> city<00:03:29.950> skyline

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.290 

and<00:03:34.430> then<00:03:35.030> as<00:03:35.390> I<00:03:35.960> go<00:03:36.170> all<00:03:36.380> the<00:03:36.560> way<00:03:36.590> around

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
and then as I go all the way around

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:43.860 
and then as I go all the way around
we'll<00:03:38.300> come<00:03:38.480> up<00:03:38.510> on<00:03:38.750> the<00:03:38.870> motor<00:03:39.050> city<00:03:39.290> casino

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:50.260 

so<00:03:44.890> the<00:03:45.890> yard<00:03:46.160> is<00:03:46.960> pretty<00:03:47.960> much<00:03:48.260> wide<00:03:48.470> open<00:03:49.270> to

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
so the yard is pretty much wide open to

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.810 
so the yard is pretty much wide open to
the<00:03:50.390> public<00:03:50.540> now<00:03:51.370> although<00:03:52.370> it's<00:03:52.520> through<00:03:52.730> the

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
the public now although it's through the

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.550 
the public now although it's through the
fence<00:03:53.060> it's<00:03:53.330> still<00:03:53.540> open<00:03:53.750> and<00:03:54.020> you<00:03:54.140> can<00:03:54.290> see

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
fence it's still open and you can see

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.250 
fence it's still open and you can see
just<00:03:54.890> about<00:03:55.220> everything<00:03:55.870> except<00:03:56.870> that<00:03:57.050> piece

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
just about everything except that piece

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.950
