00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
well just get whatever so I'm starting

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.290 
well just get whatever so I'm starting
on<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.899> left<00:02:10.140> side<00:02:10.700> it's<00:02:11.700> always<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.060> good<00:02:12.239> idea

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
on the left side it's always a good idea

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.610 
on the left side it's always a good idea
to<00:02:12.629> start<00:02:13.020> with<00:02:13.110> the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
to start with the

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.759 
to start with the
farthest<00:02:14.040> caliper<00:02:14.700> away<00:02:15.060> from<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:16.230> master

farthest caliper away from the master

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.270 
farthest caliper away from the master
and<00:02:17.010> then<00:02:17.730> work<00:02:17.940> your<00:02:18.090> way<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.299> the<00:02:18.480> closest<00:02:19.280> so

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
and then work your way to the closest so

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.509 
and then work your way to the closest so
I'm<00:02:20.519> going<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.760> pull<00:02:21.000> one<00:02:21.030> reservoir<00:02:22.519> through

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
I'm going to pull one reservoir through

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.310 
your brakes aren't working as
as<00:04:53.810> they<00:04:53.960> should<00:04:54.100> and<00:04:55.100> it's<00:04:55.580> probably<00:04:55.910> time<00:04:56.210> to

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
as they should and it's probably time to

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.340 
as they should and it's probably time to
swap<00:04:57.320> it<00:04:57.500> out<00:04:57.710> I<00:04:57.980> usually<00:04:58.670> go<00:04:59.120> a<00:04:59.450> year<00:04:59.930> on<00:05:00.170> the

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
swap it out I usually go a year on the

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.760 
swap it out I usually go a year on the
brake<00:05:00.590> fluid<00:05:00.620> and<00:05:01.840> my<00:05:02.840> clutch<00:05:03.170> is<00:05:03.410> a<00:05:03.440> little

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
brake fluid and my clutch is a little

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.560 
brake fluid and my clutch is a little
bit<00:05:03.920> different<00:05:04.460> it's<00:05:04.730> usually<00:05:05.030> about<00:05:05.390> every

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
bit different it's usually about every

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.760 
bit different it's usually about every
six<00:05:06.110> months<00:05:06.560> on<00:05:06.710> the<00:05:06.740> clutch<00:05:07.100> fluid<00:05:07.990> and<00:05:08.990> I'm

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
six months on the clutch fluid and I'm

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.640 
six months on the clutch fluid and I'm
going<00:05:10.040> to<00:05:10.130> say<00:05:10.430> it's<00:05:10.880> probably<00:05:11.480> because<00:05:12.290> the

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
going to say it's probably because the

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.250 
going to say it's probably because the
clutch<00:05:12.980> line<00:05:13.310> runs<00:05:13.760> so<00:05:14.120> close<00:05:14.450> to<00:05:14.720> the<00:05:14.840> engine

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
clutch line runs so close to the engine

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.670 
clutch line runs so close to the engine
that<00:05:16.190> the<00:05:16.370> engine<00:05:16.790> just<00:05:17.000> cooks<00:05:17.810> that<00:05:18.080> fluid<00:05:18.560> it

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
that the engine just cooks that fluid it

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.130 
that the engine just cooks that fluid it
just<00:05:18.890> turns<00:05:19.190> it<00:05:19.370> brown<00:05:19.520> almost<00:05:20.210> immediately

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140 
just turns it brown almost immediately

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.580 
just turns it brown almost immediately
and<00:05:21.620> once<00:05:21.950> your<00:05:22.130> fluids<00:05:22.610> Brown<00:05:22.970> it's<00:05:23.600> this<00:05:24.410> is

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
and once your fluids Brown it's this is

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.680 
and once your fluids Brown it's this is
useless<00:05:24.950> you<00:05:25.250> might<00:05:25.700> as<00:05:25.820> well<00:05:25.850> change<00:05:26.210> it<00:05:26.480> it's

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
useless you might as well change it it's

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.310 
useless you might as well change it it's
easy<00:05:27.020> enough<00:05:27.260> to<00:05:27.470> do<00:05:28.390> if<00:05:29.390> you<00:05:29.660> have<00:05:29.930> if<00:05:30.140> you've
