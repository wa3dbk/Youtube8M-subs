00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
anyways it works out somehow and that's

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.609 
anyways it works out somehow and that's
how<00:01:05.670> we<00:01:05.820> get<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.360> actual<00:01:06.689> stock<00:01:07.020> market<00:01:07.439> so

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619

massively<00:01:24.180> it's<00:01:24.570> huge<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.950> more

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
massively it's huge this is more

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.830 
massively it's huge this is more
