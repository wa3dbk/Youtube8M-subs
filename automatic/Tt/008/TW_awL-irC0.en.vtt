 prehistory what actually and

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.740
 I saw the store and the trainer 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.180
 sneakers they first attracted me 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.880
 its appearance is enough 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.390
 interesting combination black color yellow 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.450
 The sole is very nice so I asked 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.090

 shoot it just like slippers there 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.110

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.039

 the wings that is what I wanted 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.550
 and I realized that this is not my sneakers 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.579
 quite expensive but nonetheless not 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.589
 regretted this money going back to the fact that on 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.600
 shoe saving is not worth it especially if 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.580
 I walk a lot a lot of walking is necessary for 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.130
 to be healthy 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.439

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.560
 only such a pastime so 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.060
 try so and do here from some 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.360
 design features now 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.560
 I'll tell you two words first 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.110
 branded solomon ovsky contra 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.729
 a sole that does not slip it 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.689
 generally positioned as 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:33.060
 trekking sneakers that is for 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:36.090
 someone active recreation on a cross 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.030
 terrain our cross country 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.770
 roads and sidewalks are far from it 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.659
 rough terrain so i have them 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.290
 using pasta for walking 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.620
 but none the less 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.260
 these are their features for me 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:54.230
 aggressive sole say if 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.050
 look at an angle you can see that 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.940
 quite a few thorns I already have them 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.170
 literally once in my clothes but 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:05.540
 it was a great pleasure and this 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.030
 proprietary Solomon ovsky their way Kleist 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.110
 called here this here is the string I when 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.240
 you bought yourself long ago 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.860
 another couple would also be from Solomon and there 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.800
 there was a first acquaintance then separately about 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.700
 This will tell, I doubt how much 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.260
 long she will stand 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.940
 but nevertheless and how much will it be 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.490
 convenient very cool convenient system 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.400
 here is this lace I also doubted him 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.209
 reliability so here it is kevlar therefore 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.650
 to tear 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.080
 but probably very big 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.980
 attach tilt to dress them 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.260
 very comfortably 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.100
 literally in one motion put his foot 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.959
 tightened the tongue here from the inside is not sewn 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.500
 but it is sewn on top of this 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.390
 Setochka dad larger show it in 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.360
 first keeps him in the middle here 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.910
 sewn and secondly does not allow to fall 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.160
 inside small pebbles and some dirt 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.739
 if you get to some kind of place where 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.510
 it is what surprised me about them 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:04.430
 I know let's see how it will be in practice 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:06.920
 here are these strips of a truncated whale 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.400
 triangles they are usually stitched 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.070
 here they are simply glued to the fabric 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.780
 only here I will hide there is a seam of me 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:18.110
 somewhat embarrassing but see how it is 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.850
 will be in practice looks like 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.060
 must hold ie he is glue 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:27.080
 we are planted here is what me and 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.769
 conquered show sole are the light 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.750
 this is the orthopedic sole itself 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:35.350
 which simply fits the leg and therefore 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.030
 so comfortable if I feel in this shoe 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:41.080
 of any additional features 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:44.239
 Well, the same story with a sock that is, he 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.680
 protected if you accidentally give us 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.769
 it happens a folder border 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.310
 sticking or stone tile can 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:54.319
 fucking hard and tough 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.420
 heel support 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.909
 There is if I now wear shoes if 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.909
 I feel absolutely confident in the magician 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:04.790
 sits well and plus still drags on 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:06.829
 these essential creed system 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:12.530
 place quick links 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:15.469
 like this you are just a super word 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.780
 thing super shoes outsole by the way here 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:19.910
 again I do not know the tradition I think 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.970
 continues from i had those amphibians 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.410
 such word shoes, I also doubted more 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.380
 in a sole, that is, I now have what 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.970
 compare sole enough steady 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.949
 made in my season 3 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.690
 it is so well and slightly worn of course 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:34.870
 eternal nothing happens but we are very 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.810
 resistant to abrasion 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:41.120
 so do not spare money if you 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:45.020
 like the models 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.849
 Here is this model Vince 3 there are colors 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.270
 just a sea of ​​all sorts of different in every 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:53.060
 I watched and saw u on Amazon 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.009
 we only had such yellow 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.520
 black riding but they got me the most 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:58.580
 like 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:02.690
 of another model with so dark purple 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.370
 the color of the top and the sole is also so with 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.680
 such a shade of lilac purple 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.030
 also very beautiful but the rest are bright 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.130
 Solomon generally makes very bright shoes 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.500
 there they have models in general such 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.220
 colorful beautiful oddly enough 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.060
 Well, this is quite for such 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.849
 rough terrain in the mountains to run 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:24.110
 there are like twice as many thorns 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:25.880
 than these but this is already specialized them 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.710
 hesitated to buy and eat from 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.090
 features still the sole is made here 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.030
 anyway manufacturer about it 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:34.729
 says I don't know in terms of convenience I am 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.580
 felt made a three-layer ie 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:41.990
 there is some kind of intermediate sole 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:45.050
 from eva this is in my opinion some kind of foam 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:48.229
 foamed plastic which compensates 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:51.320
 some kind of bumps and hard touches 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:52.820
 and another nuance of I do not know them and 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.259
 paid no attention 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.240
 I have trekking in others 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:58.550
 the shoes that I already told I 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.889
 forgot to say there is a nuance I think here is one 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.900
 same story that 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:07.009
 Here often we feel such a nuance when 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.960
 we walk on pebbles on gravel we 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:11.659
 feel the foot through the soles of these 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.699
 here are the bumps of the tubercle here it is very 

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:14.930
 very smoothed ie legs very 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:17.150
 comfortable nothing not 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:19.360
 and hit don't crush through the sole here 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:22.819
 see this here is the intermediate sole 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:25.550
 foamed it compensates these all 

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:27.110
 bumps in the road are also nuances 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.050
 if there is a long way to go this way 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:33.409
 will be felt and felt by him 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:37.669
 I am very pleased with the word both of them in the first place 

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:39.409
 They are beautiful secondly very comfortable and 

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:41.810
 very light too i forgot to say about 

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:43.460
 boots, too, such a nuance is very important 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:48.229
 in my opinion, well, sometimes you take 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:50.449
 hands shoes and just like dumbbells very 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:53.479
 light i put them on my foot i just them 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:57.349
 don't feel just as native as 

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:59.659
 poured super sit can be a little bit 

00:06:57.349 --> 00:07:03.849
 emotionally but it is very 

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:03.849
 cool shoes thank you for your attention
