that<00:00:49.150> I've<00:00:49.270> talked<00:00:49.510> to<00:00:49.860> just<00:00:50.860> boil<00:00:51.040> water<00:00:51.310> and

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
that I've talked to just boil water and

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.180 
that I've talked to just boil water and
then<00:00:51.730> they<00:00:51.790> put<00:00:51.970> everything<00:00:52.180> in<00:00:52.330> the<00:00:52.420> pocket

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
then they put everything in the pocket

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.250 
then they put everything in the pocket
I've<00:00:54.190> tried<00:00:54.580> that<00:00:54.850> not<00:00:55.390> really<00:00:55.570> crazy<00:00:55.960> I'm

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
I've tried that not really crazy I'm

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.830 
I've tried that not really crazy I'm
just<00:00:56.530> doing<00:00:56.800> it<00:00:56.890> in<00:00:56.980> the<00:00:57.100> pocket<00:00:57.250> so<00:00:57.730> I<00:00:58.000> find<00:00:58.660> it

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
just doing it in the pocket so I find it

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.570 
just doing it in the pocket so I find it
that<00:00:59.260> it<00:00:59.410> does<00:00:59.590> turn<00:00:59.830> out<00:00:59.860> a<00:01:00.040> bit<00:01:00.220> better<00:01:00.400> if

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
that it does turn out a bit better if

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.380 
that it does turn out a bit better if
you<00:01:00.670> boil<00:01:01.090> it<00:01:01.330> on<00:01:01.450> the<00:01:01.540> stove<00:01:02.880> before<00:01:03.880> I<00:01:04.119> go<00:01:04.239> any

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
you boil it on the stove before I go any

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.490 
you boil it on the stove before I go any

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
that that's the first time I've had a

that that's the first time I've had a
can<00:05:27.910> get<00:05:28.390> that<00:05:28.570> messy<00:05:28.900> on<00:05:29.020> there<00:05:29.230> you've<00:05:30.100> got

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
can get that messy on there you've got

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.440 
can get that messy on there you've got
to<00:05:30.250> be<00:05:30.400> careful<00:05:30.550> with<00:05:30.820> that<00:05:30.940> stuff<00:05:31.240> all<00:05:31.420> day

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
to be careful with that stuff all day

to be careful with that stuff all day
right<00:05:31.810> now<00:05:32.130> that's<00:05:33.130> the<00:05:33.280> only<00:05:33.370> little

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
right now that's the only little

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.080 
right now that's the only little
downfall<00:05:34.330> is<00:05:35.080> that<00:05:35.460> the<00:05:36.460> prop<00:05:36.640> those<00:05:36.850> cans

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
downfall is that the prop those cans

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.990 
downfall is that the prop those cans
open<00:05:37.420> they<00:05:37.510> do<00:05:37.630> tend<00:05:37.840> to<00:05:37.930> be<00:05:37.990> pretty<00:05:38.320> messy

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
open they do tend to be pretty messy

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.740 
open they do tend to be pretty messy

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:40.490 
for the first stage it's really not that

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.420
