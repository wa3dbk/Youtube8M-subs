00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.410

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:53.340

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:57.370

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.210
 I was really touched 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.560

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.950

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.890

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.770
 foot 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.860
 with actors like Jaime Camil and if 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:44.150
 marshal this romantic comedy of 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.340
 author alejandro casona is taking 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.250
 place in the towns of Campeche 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.500
 making bayamón was one of them and in 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:57.229
 the port of our city is going to be the 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:59.210
 future scenario of this novel we are going to 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:04.030
 talk about a performance that was performed 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:06.549
 in the main park on day 3 of 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.800
 on April 3, 2013 and that was 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.630
 made by students of the university 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.270
 inter-American for better development 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.660
 known as the unit and the students were 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.900
 then student students design students 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.000
 digital graphic of the second four-month period 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.650
 this performance was under the 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.959
 address of the teacher of the human being 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:31.330
 this one of maestro martín tamayo that 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:33.160
 teaches the subject of the human being has 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.640
 put these kids who study 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.640
 graphic design 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:43.720
 these guys and good in you the dynamics 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.939
 it consisted of putting three types 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.739
 wrapped in a white sheet sitting 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:50.709
 in the main courtyard here nothing more 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:53.079
 sitting down and in a moment I went to 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.209
 someone and he throws the soft paint 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.519
 others aggressively and in the end as 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:59.680
 they were sitting under a blanket was a 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.109
 mural I hope you take a tour of 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.560
 the main park in the mural is 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:09.400
 stuck and so good that 's all for the 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:12.909
 good staff we are on vacation now 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.310
 finishing the holiday week of 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:17.019
 Easter the warmth the beach but 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.690
 not everyone has been happy with these 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:22.120
 parties the artisans who are the 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.129
 responsible for selling to tourists 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.379
 that come in this era all that is 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.970
 they are a bit unhappy because 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.400
 they say that this year sales have not 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.829
 been the same as last years as they say 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.989
 that most people for the excess 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.010
 of heat prefer to go to the beaches 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.959
 so the historic center of the 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.250
 that city is losing a bit that 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.260
 strength and that call 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.900
 before called a lot the tourists and that 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.640
 it increased its sales so I think that 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.650
 we should put it a little further 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:54.110
 commitment to promote our culture 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.360
 well this is another topic that I want 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.150
 recommend again a book this time 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.620
 I really forgot the book because 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.020
 we have liked the two a little to kick 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.300
 and nash because in addition to books they 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.459
 we have perhaps good news for 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.250
 you who are working on a 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:15.050
 new project that will change a 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:17.780
 little what they have seen from nor and what and 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.459
 what little you have seen in now I can 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.910
 make a much more dynamic program 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.860
 for people much more contact 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.440
 so that they know us a little more 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.350
 have fun also know about 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.090
 promotions of certain activities that 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.710
 we are going to do here in Campeche 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.840
 to work 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.390
 for the development of our city well 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.490
 that they are attentive because soon we are going to 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.220
 start taking out the promos so that 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.300
 go motivating to see us in the next 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.910
 program that we're still here like that 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.700
 polishing the name but until now not 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.830
 we have a name on this but I want 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.600
 remind them that in reality everything 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.330
 I'm going to Campeche. 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.160
 for young people mostly for 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.750
 young does not mean that the rest of 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.580
 Campechana society does not interest us 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.290
 clear that you but in this case to 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.380
 us to work with 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.450
 guys why I would like us 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.910
 support in this new project that more 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:16.490
 well it's for everyone we're really going to 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.560
 have a lot of dynamic gut 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.110
 work with people going to work they go to 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:25.100
 see suddenly on the street doing something 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:27.770
 in all things good things we hope 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.990
 that project would like you very much 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.050
 we miss each other, it is not going to go 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:35.990
 they will continue to give news maybe a 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:38.180
 little more the same for you 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:40.490
 that's all and talking about the book the 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:44.000
 book that I want to recommend is called 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:47.560
 Shadow of jong in bars or tasting theme 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.490
 I really do not know how to say your last name 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:54.490
 as a writer but a very good novel 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:57.220
 I had already read it and recently I read it 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.980
 and I was amazed like the first time 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:02.050
 I did not bring the book, I forgot, forgive me 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.240
 but really and a touch-up that makes 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.639
 I eat your gummies or this is me 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.650
 you have prepared but you really see me 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:10.450
 and he wants to read the book maybe and 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.400
 we could do this if you have a book 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:15.250
 that I have read I lend you one that already 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.860
 I read and then it would be parents sharing the 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:20.470
 clear book because it keeps sending its 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.880
 comments abajito and then we could 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:25.030
 make a sort of chain like 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.650
 books here in huesca page in clear and 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.990

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:31.210
