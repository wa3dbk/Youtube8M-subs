00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:07.330
 humidity types of humidity the three types 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.940
 humidity 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.190
 capillary moisture through leaks and 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.350
 condensation to find the best 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.289
 way to treat moisture in your home 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.750
 You will have to find out which of them is 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.630
 what you have if you think your property 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:26.169
 may have an excess of moisture but not 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:29.169
 you can detect an obvious cause of consultation 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:31.720
 to a specialist capillary moisture or by 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:34.059
 capillarity the capillary humidity is 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.579
 caused by the movement of water to 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:38.620
 through the walls most of the 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.050
 walls allow the passage of a bit of 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.379
 water but usually water does not 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.940
 causes damage by a barrier of 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.579
 waterproofing this usually 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.359
 It is a horizontal plastic or a strip of 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:55.690
 blackboard on the wall if missing 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:57.640
 waterproofing or this is ineffective the 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.670
 wall may suffer from moisture 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.589
 capillarity this type of humidity also 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.230
 It can happen when the ground level 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:07.000
 outside your house is higher than your 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.490
 waterproofing system 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.040
 which allows water to enter over 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.390
 of the system symptoms of humidity 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.190
 capillary 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.740
 if you have capillary moisture you can 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:21.190
 note that your skirting boards or floors 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.290
 they are damaged crumbling or salt in 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.380
 the plaster of the wall and the painting 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.740
 peeling can also be a 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.930
 moisture stain along the wall 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.420
 moisture filtrations humidities 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.850
 by leaks may be caused 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.770
 by defective gutters the 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.140
 water leaks can be 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.869
 caused by a water leak through 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.080
 of the walls this kind of humidity 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.690
 can move inside a building the 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.970
 moisture by filtration is generally 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.850
 caused by structural problems of the 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.700
 building such as downspouts or ceilings 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.430
 defective symptoms of moisture by 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.920
 leaks moisture through leaks 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.830
 of water often manifests itself through 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.170
 of moisture stains on the walls 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.470
 ceilings or floors that may darken 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.970
 when it rains you have more possibilities to 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.160
 humidity 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.160
 leaks if you live in a building 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.740
 old with solid walls like walls 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.790
 capias arias that provide certain 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:26.880
 condensation protection condensation 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.950
 is the most common form of moisture is 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.010
 caused by the condensation of the 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.620
 humidity of the air in the walls is about 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.110
 all a winter problem because in 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.360
 this time of year the walls are 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.290
 much cooler than the air in the 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.020
 inside the condensation can be 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.270
 exacerbated by lack of ventilation and 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.300
 if the heating that is turned on and it 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:54.410
 turn off constantly as this allows 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:57.480
 that hot humid air condense 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.090
 symptoms of condensation you may notice 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.600
 drops of water in the windows or walls 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.390
 see dark mold appearing and notice a 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.180
 unpleasant smell if left untreated 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.640
 condensation can damage the paint and 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.990
 the plaster and make the frames of the 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.990
 windows rot
