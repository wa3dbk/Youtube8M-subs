 small group of children to the mayor this 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:05.970
 piece of cake in the background the lob of 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.520
 the whipped cream where the arms are at 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.030
 you decide me personally I 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:14.070
 do not like when my cake is wet 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:17.280
 by embers but if you like yourself 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:19.110
 the juice of a rake that would be the book s 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.030
 but I'm going to put the cream product 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:27.390
 to 20 departments voice to be a pure 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:30.900
 not dry is that does not bother me 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:34.280
 lodging would make a good cake I find because 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.280
 both done worse 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:41.670
 I do not like the happiness of doing 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.970
 things ourselves we read that as we 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.420
 love them so I go with madou here 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.720
 lodges 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:52.470
 I fill with whipped cream when 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:55.470
 five sockets ensures that the rim the 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.560
 cut will stay it's not nice square of 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.850
 crime lines does it take by raising 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:04.380
 all along the cut that makes 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.630
 amateur in view that this is the 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.090
 proportional 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:12.270
 we are professionals and now 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:17.510
 we add the strawberries a good map 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.510
 strawberries and here 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:25.550
 -the second floor of cakes like that 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.420
 we can press slow 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:39.409
 and here I am now five years 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:43.249
 in order to cover the cake well because 

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:44.710
 the whipped cream will protect the cake 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:48.830
 to dry up 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:52.490
 so we serve well that we go to 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:54.949
 down and we know lever is ready for the 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.840
 finishing here I booked strawberries 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:06:00.110
 I have not cut out what is a little 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:02.479
 big but there this exposed part can 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.819
 to dry of taught to turn the press 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:07.479
 like that he stuck in the cream 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:16.509
 fault and it will protect her from drying up 

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:20.689
 and here is a nice finish like that and 

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:23.990

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:25.849
