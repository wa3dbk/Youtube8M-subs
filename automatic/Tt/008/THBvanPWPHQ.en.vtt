00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
they're gonna put in this kind of

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.320 
they're gonna put in this kind of
high-risk<00:04:07.610> treatment<00:04:09.010> I'm<00:04:10.010> still<00:04:10.610> really

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
high-risk treatment I'm still really

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.550 
high-risk treatment I'm still really
really<00:04:12.040> unsure<00:04:13.040> myself<00:04:14.260> about<00:04:15.260> that

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
really unsure myself about that

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.840 
really unsure myself about that
treatment<00:04:16.130> because<00:04:17.060> I<00:04:17.090> had<00:04:17.389> some<00:04:18.130> accidents<00:04:19.130> I

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
treatment because I had some accidents I

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.250 
treatment because I had some accidents I
guess<00:04:20.030> during<00:04:20.600> the<00:04:20.780> normal<00:04:21.590> treatments<00:04:22.340> and<00:04:23.260> I

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
guess during the normal treatments and I

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.890 
guess during the normal treatments and I
was<00:04:25.510> pretty<00:04:26.510> badly<00:04:27.350> affected<00:04:28.040> by<00:04:28.220> it<00:04:28.840> so<00:04:29.840> I'm

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
was pretty badly affected by it so I'm

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.550 
was pretty badly affected by it so I'm
pretty<00:04:30.260> unsure<00:04:31.040> about<00:04:32.030> the<00:04:32.450> whole<00:04:32.810> high-risk

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
pretty unsure about the whole high-risk

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.680 
pretty unsure about the whole high-risk
one<00:04:33.830> because<00:04:34.130> it's<00:04:34.310> a<00:04:34.400> lot<00:04:34.550> more<00:04:34.820> intense<00:04:35.330> and

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
one because it's a lot more intense and

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.400 
one because it's a lot more intense and
we'll<00:04:36.680> have<00:04:37.160> more<00:04:37.400> on<00:04:37.460> my<00:04:37.520> body<00:04:37.820> yes<00:04:38.270> you<00:04:39.229> might
