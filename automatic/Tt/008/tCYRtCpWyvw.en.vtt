00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:23.500
 having the image open we doubled it 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.720
 we can drag it to the icon 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.900

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:41.270

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:57.690
 to the filter filter blur and 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.770

 the radio box we put a value of 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:08.490
 45 pixels we give ok we go back to the 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.980
 layer window and the merge mode of 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.140
 we change this layer to screen 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.870
 then we create a new layer of 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.810
 settings by clicking on the new icon 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.390

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.400
 50 to the green bar a value 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.850
 Positive of 200 and the color bar

 blue a negative value of 50 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.490
 to the layer that has the name leger 1 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:49.560
 which is the copy of the background we lower the 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:52.080
 opacity to 35% and we select the 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:56.490
 layer of settings and we press the keys 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:59.990
 shift control n for windows or shift 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.430
 n command for mac opens a window 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.200
 we leave the values ​​as they are and we 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.320
 we give ok 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.330
 press the letter d to reset the 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.330
 foreground and background colors to 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.780
 black and white respectively with the 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.000
 new layer we use the control command 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.370
 kickback for windows or command 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.410
 kick for mac 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.860
 in this way we fill the layer of 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:28.920
 white color we select filter noise 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.700
 add noise and we give you a quantity of 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:36.090
 20% with the boxes uniform and 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:39.440
 monochromatic activated to this layer you 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.450
 we change the fusion mode to multiple and 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.420
 we select the name layer player 1 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.690
 and duplicate it with control jo command 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.930
 And the new layer is dragged between the 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.750
 adjustment layer and the white fill 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.299
 finally to this layer we change the 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.690
 overlay merge mode and we upload the 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:04.140
 opacity at 50% 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.450
 and this is the final result 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.270
