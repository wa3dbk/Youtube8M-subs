00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 This video describes how to troubleshoot this problem when there is a paper jam error message on your computer or printer control panel. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
 First, remove the paper jam from the back of the printer. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
 Remove the paper from the input tray. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 Press the Power button to turn off the printer. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 Disconnect the power cord from the back of the printer. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 Remove the rear access door. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Check for jammed paper in the printer. If you see paper jammed in the printer, try grasping the paper with both hands and pulling on both sides of the paper without tearing it apart. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
 If the paper tears when trying to remove the paper from the roller, check that there are torn pieces of paper in the rollers and wheels inside the printer. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 If torn pieces of paper remain, there will probably be other paper jams. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 Insert the rear access door into the printer. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Check for paper jams on the front of the printer. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 Be careful when removing paper from the front. Otherwise, the printer may be damaged. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 Open the top cover of the printer. Carefully remove any sheets you see. Collect all pieces of paper that may be torn. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 Use a flashlight to make sure that you have removed all of the small parts inside the printer. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 Check that there are no pieces of paper on the rollers and wheels. If all of the pieces of paper are not removed from the printer, there may be other paper jams. 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 After removing the paper, close the top cover. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 Connect the power cord to the back of the printer. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 Turn on the printer by pressing the power button on the front panel. 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 Try to print a self-test page. 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 On the printer control panel, press the Setup button. 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 Use the arrow buttons to go to Print Report and press OK. Again, use the arrow buttons to move to Self-Test Report and press OK. 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
 If the test page prints successfully, the problem is resolved. 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 If the test page does not print, go to the next step. 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 Paper dust, ink, and grease in your fingers contaminate the printer rollers. In this step we will clean them. 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 Before you begin, collect the following cleaning materials: 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
 Clean, lint-free cloths 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 Cotton swabs 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
 Clean water to soak the nappies. 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 Distilled water or bottled water is preferred, but not necessarily. Do not use alcohol or other chemical cleaners. 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 Turn off the printer by pressing the power button. 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 Disconnect the power cord from the back of the printer. 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
 Then remove the rear access door of the printer. 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 Clean the rollers that appear on the printer with a lint-free cloth lightly moistened with water. 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
 The cloth should be wet, but not so much as water. 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 Rotate the rollers towards the printer using your finger. Make sure there is no dirt or dust left on the roller surface. 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
 Refer to the pickup rollers on the inside of the back of the printer. 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
 Use a dampened cotton swab to wipe the accumulated dust and dirt to clean the rollers. 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
 These cylinders are difficult to reach; however, cleaning them is very important. 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 With the rear access door removed, check the rollers on the cover. 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 Check to see if there is a missing, non-rotating cylinder that doesn't turn freely. These may mean that the rollers do not feed paper and that the rear access door must be replaced. 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 Now replace the rear access cover of your printer. 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
 Connect the power cord. 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
 Turn on the printer by pressing the power button on the front panel. 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 Load paper in the input tray. 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 Try printing a self-test page again. 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
 On the printer control panel, press the Setup button. 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:14.000
 Use the arrow buttons to go to Print Report and press OK. Again, use the arrow buttons to move to Self-Test Report and press OK. 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
 If the pages print successfully, you do not need to continue troubleshooting. 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 If you've tried everything described in this video and you're still experiencing problems, it's likely your printer needs to go to the service. 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 Contact HP to learn about the support options available for your printer. Your service options may vary depending on the date you purchased the printer and the country where you live.
