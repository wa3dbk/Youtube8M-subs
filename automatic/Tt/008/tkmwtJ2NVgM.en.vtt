there<00:00:30.060> really<00:00:30.510> kind<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.779> nice<00:00:30.929> hard<00:00:31.289> back<00:00:31.560> to

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
there really kind of nice hard back to

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.260 
there really kind of nice hard back to
it<00:00:31.859> you're<00:00:32.219> not<00:00:32.399> going<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.640> screw<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:32.910> up<00:00:33.030> and

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
it you're not going to screw it up and

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.940 
it you're not going to screw it up and
in<00:00:33.660> fact<00:00:33.780> all<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.079> might<00:00:34.260> screw<00:00:34.469> up<00:00:34.530> by<00:00:34.680> doing

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
in fact all you might screw up by doing

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.500 
in fact all you might screw up by doing
this<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.670> actual<00:00:35.790> processor<00:00:36.420> on<00:00:36.480> the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
this is the actual processor on the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.760 
this is the actual processor on the
inside<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.989> might<00:00:37.140> confuse<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.590> phone<00:00:37.739> a

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
inside you might confuse the phone a

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.619 
inside you might confuse the phone a
little<00:00:37.920> bit<00:00:38.160> but<00:00:38.489> actually<00:00:38.910> that's<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.360> very

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
little bit but actually that's a very

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.060 
little bit but actually that's a very
rare<00:00:39.989> thing<00:00:40.290> as<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.559> seems<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.860> have<00:00:40.980> happened

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
rare thing as it seems to have happened

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.970 
rare thing as it seems to have happened
so<00:00:41.550> far<00:00:41.820> um<00:00:42.239> what<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.200> have<00:00:43.350> no<00:00:43.530> just<00:00:43.710> about<00:00:43.860> to

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
so far um what I have no just about to

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.799 
so far um what I have no just about to
slide<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.280> function<00:00:44.670> funnily<00:00:45.030> enough<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.450> it

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
slide that function funnily enough is it

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.600 
slide that function funnily enough is it
appears<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.350> make<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.649> left-handed<00:00:47.280> phone

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
appears to make it a left-handed phone

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.520 
appears to make it a left-handed phone
because<00:00:48.300> if<00:00:48.420> you're<00:00:48.539> right-handed<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.379> you

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
because if you're right-handed and you

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.650 
because if you're right-handed and you
try<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.920> sweep<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.520> across<00:00:50.640> it's<00:00:51.210> actually

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
try and sweep it across it's actually

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.990 
try and sweep it across it's actually
quite<00:00:52.230> difficult<00:00:52.500> but<00:00:53.399> as<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.520> left-handed

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
quite difficult but as a left-handed

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.420 
quite difficult but as a left-handed
person<00:00:54.149> it's<00:00:54.809> very<00:00:54.960> quick<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.559> one<00:00:56.070> little<00:00:56.309> tip

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
person it's very quick so one little tip

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.369 
person it's very quick so one little tip
if<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.760> left<00:00:56.940> handed<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.360> nokia<00:00:57.629> n97<00:00:58.109> might

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
if you left handed the nokia n97 might

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.830 
if you left handed the nokia n97 might
be<00:00:58.469> view<00:00:58.739> however<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.670> do<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.850> once<00:01:00.690> you've

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
be view however you do it once you've

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.840 
be view however you do it once you've
got<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:00.989> open<00:01:01.170> you'll<00:01:01.920> notice<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.670> rather

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
got it open you'll notice the rather

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.399 
got it open you'll notice the rather
impressive<00:01:03.420> qwerty<00:01:03.840> on<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.049> inside

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
impressive qwerty on the inside

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.280 
impressive qwerty on the inside
supported<00:01:04.979> by<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.129> joystick<00:01:05.610> there<00:01:05.760> as<00:01:05.909> well

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
supported by the joystick there as well

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.929 
supported by the joystick there as well
it<00:01:07.290> works<00:01:07.590> really<00:01:07.830> quite<00:01:08.130> nicely<00:01:08.369> I

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
it works really quite nicely I

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.700 
it works really quite nicely I
personally<00:01:09.630> didn't<00:01:09.990> use<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.200> joystick<00:01:10.380> so

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
personally didn't use the joystick so

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.980 
personally didn't use the joystick so
much<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.979> navigate<00:01:11.340> around<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:12.000> tend<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.840> use

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
much to navigate around I tend to use

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.960 
much to navigate around I tend to use
the<00:01:13.170> touch<00:01:13.500> screen<00:01:13.650> functionality<00:01:14.070> instead

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
the touch screen functionality instead

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.480 
the touch screen functionality instead
which<00:01:15.540> which<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.409> found<00:01:16.590> quite<00:01:16.799> useful<00:01:17.369> I

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
which which I found quite useful I

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.120 
which which I found quite useful I
thought<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.939> works<00:01:18.119> pretty<00:01:18.330> nicely<00:01:18.450> Oh

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
thought that works pretty nicely Oh

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.469 
thought that works pretty nicely Oh
sometimes<00:01:20.130> what<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.549> might<00:01:20.850> notice<00:01:21.090> when<00:01:21.390> you

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
sometimes what you might notice when you

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.240 
sometimes what you might notice when you
get<00:01:21.630> these<00:01:21.750> menu<00:01:22.140> bits<00:01:22.350> here<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:23.130> actually

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
get these menu bits here to actually

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.370 
get these menu bits here to actually
scroll<00:01:23.610> down<00:01:23.909> when<00:01:24.450> it's<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.659> very<00:01:24.900> long<00:01:25.110> menu

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
scroll down when it's a very long menu

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.020 
scroll down when it's a very long menu
can<00:01:25.560> get<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.770> bit<00:01:25.920> complicated<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.670> bit<00:01:26.790> fiddly

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
can get a bit complicated a bit fiddly

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.969 
can get a bit complicated a bit fiddly
which<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:27.930> quite<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.140> good<00:01:28.320> reason<00:01:28.619> why<00:01:28.740> they've

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
which is quite a good reason why they've

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.679 
which is quite a good reason why they've
included<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.520> stylus<00:01:29.909> as<00:01:30.030> well<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.540> get<00:01:30.659> a

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
included the stylus as well so you get a

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.109 
included the stylus as well so you get a
much<00:01:30.930> much<00:01:31.170> better<00:01:31.560> control<00:01:31.860> but<00:01:32.759> once<00:01:32.939> you've

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
much much better control but once you've

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.670 
much much better control but once you've
got<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.329> you'll<00:01:33.720> find<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.500> quality

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
got that you'll find that the quality

phone works really really nicely in both
dimensions<00:02:53.040> which<00:02:53.550> I<00:02:53.700> was<00:02:53.820> quite<00:02:54.030> surprised

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
dimensions which I was quite surprised

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.140 
dimensions which I was quite surprised
that<00:02:54.709> I<00:02:55.709> thought<00:02:56.370> it'd<00:02:56.490> be<00:02:56.520> really<00:02:56.910> only

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
that I thought it'd be really only

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.820 
that I thought it'd be really only
functional<00:02:57.690> in<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:57.959> horizontal<00:02:58.230> way<00:02:58.650> but

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
functional in the horizontal way but

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.830 
functional in the horizontal way but
actually<00:02:59.100> close<00:02:59.370> it's<00:02:59.580> really<00:02:59.820> quite<00:03:00.030> nice<00:03:00.209> so

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
actually close it's really quite nice so

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.210 
actually close it's really quite nice so
if<00:03:00.959> you<00:03:01.020> don't<00:03:01.230> want<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.470> use<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:01.680> as<00:03:01.770> a<00:03:01.800> proper

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
if you don't want to use it as a proper

it<00:05:05.130> at<00:05:05.280> the<00:05:05.310> right<00:05:05.370> end<00:05:06.470> then<00:05:07.470> it<00:05:07.650> does<00:05:07.800> snap

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
it at the right end then it does snap

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.550 
it at the right end then it does snap
back<00:05:08.370> into<00:05:08.400> position<00:05:08.730> pretty<00:05:09.480> nicely<00:05:09.870> and

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
the trick fairly quickly which isn't too

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.980 
the trick fairly quickly which isn't too
bad<00:05:46.950> for<00:05:47.190> these<00:05:47.400> things<00:05:47.670> the<00:05:48.540> video<00:05:48.750> footage

catches best it could but you know for a
mobile<00:05:57.600> phone<00:05:57.960> it's<00:05:58.140> got<00:05:58.260> a<00:05:58.290> really<00:05:58.380> decent
