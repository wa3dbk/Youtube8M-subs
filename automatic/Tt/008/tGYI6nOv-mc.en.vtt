00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.219 

I<00:01:00.129> already<00:01:00.999> create<00:01:01.780> the<00:01:02.109> sky<00:01:02.469> with<00:01:03.129> HDR<00:01:03.879> and

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
I already create the sky with HDR and

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.039 
I already create the sky with HDR and
light<00:01:05.229> and<00:01:06.120> sphere<00:01:07.120> so<00:01:07.979> first<00:01:09.689> great<00:01:10.689> new

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
light and sphere so first great new

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:17.609 
light and sphere so first great new
material<00:01:11.590> and<00:01:12.479> going<00:01:13.479> color<00:01:13.780> and<00:01:15.810> load<00:01:16.810> the

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
material and going color and load the

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.099 
material and going color and load the
texture<00:01:18.130> I<00:01:19.590> got<00:01:20.590> this

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:22.109 
texture I got this

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:26.700 
texture I got this
frosty<00:01:23.579> image<00:01:24.579> so<00:01:25.119> I'll<00:01:25.479> import<00:01:26.079> that<00:01:26.320> in

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
frosty image so I'll import that in

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:35.580 
frosty image so I'll import that in
there<00:01:27.359> drag-and-drop

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.330 

you

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.609 

go<00:01:42.340> into<00:01:42.729> transparency<00:01:43.510> turn<00:01:43.690> on<00:01:43.990> and<00:01:44.350> going

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
go into transparency turn on and going

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.430 
go into transparency turn on and going
reflection<00:01:45.310> turn<00:01:45.850> it<00:01:46.150> off<00:01:46.360> now<00:01:47.200> in

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
reflection turn it off now in

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.190 
reflection turn it off now in
transparency<00:01:48.400> at<00:01:48.580> refraction<00:01:50.520> 21.5<00:01:51.990> okay<00:01:52.990> and

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
transparency at refraction 21.5 okay and

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.730 
transparency at refraction 21.5 okay and
import<00:01:54.159> the<00:01:54.280> texture<00:01:54.759> and<00:01:55.030> in<00:01:55.780> reflection<00:01:58.740> add

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
import the texture and in reflection add

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.160 
import the texture and in reflection add
Fornell<00:02:00.670> shader<00:02:01.030> and<00:02:01.470> maybe<00:02:02.470> decrease<00:02:03.100> its

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
Fornell shader and maybe decrease its

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.350 
Fornell shader and maybe decrease its
effect<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:07.000> maybe<00:02:07.240> 10%<00:02:07.600> times<00:02:08.259> rough<00:02:09.090> 150<00:02:10.090> and

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
effect to maybe 10% times rough 150 and

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.590 
effect to maybe 10% times rough 150 and
I'll<00:02:11.110> add<00:02:12.040> a<00:02:12.310> little<00:02:12.370> of<00:02:12.730> util<00:02:13.450> of<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:14.590> blur

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
I'll add a little of util of the blur

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.479 
I'll add a little of util of the blur
chlorine<00:02:16.600> s9<00:02:17.290> or<00:02:17.620> something<00:02:18.100> like<00:02:18.250> that<00:02:18.310> now

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
chlorine s9 or something like that now

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:26.400 
chlorine s9 or something like that now
go<00:02:21.489> to<00:02:21.550> bump<00:02:23.790> close<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:25.120> texture<00:02:25.630> drag<00:02:26.110> drop

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
go to bump close the texture drag drop

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.400 
go to bump close the texture drag drop
if<00:02:27.100> you<00:02:27.340> go<00:02:27.550> to<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:28.209> bump<00:02:28.420> add<00:02:29.580> filter<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:31.410> dis

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
if you go to the bump add filter and dis

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.560 
if you go to the bump add filter and dis
it<00:02:32.590> right<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:33.220> image<00:02:33.519> and<00:02:33.820> increase<00:02:34.420> the

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
it right the image and increase the

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:41.370 
it right the image and increase the
contrast<00:02:36.090> I'll<00:02:38.970> decrease<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.390> strength<00:02:40.810> to

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
contrast I'll decrease the strength to

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.229 
contrast I'll decrease the strength to
maybe<00:02:41.830> 5<00:02:42.190> to<00:02:42.610> 8<00:02:42.910> for<00:02:43.840> example<00:02:44.040> then<00:02:45.040> click<00:02:45.459> on

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
maybe 5 to 8 for example then click on

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.979 
maybe 5 to 8 for example then click on
this<00:02:46.720> arrow<00:02:47.410> and<00:02:47.560> go<00:02:48.519> to<00:02:48.579> copy<00:02:48.970> channel<00:02:49.329> go<00:02:49.959> to

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
this arrow and go to copy channel go to

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:55.039 
this arrow and go to copy channel go to
specular<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:50.769> paste<00:02:51.730> channel<00:02:52.690> now<00:02:53.260> we'll

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
specular and paste channel now we'll

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:01.190 
specular and paste channel now we'll
change<00:02:56.049> the<00:02:56.350> specular<00:02:57.840> graph<00:02:58.840> to<00:02:59.680> be<00:03:00.150> more

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
change the specular graph to be more

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:08.699 
change the specular graph to be more
right<00:03:02.579> okay<00:03:04.380> so<00:03:05.380> if<00:03:06.160> you<00:03:06.370> add<00:03:06.640> material<00:03:07.420> on<00:03:08.140> the

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
right okay so if you add material on the

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:16.229 
right okay so if you add material on the
sphere<00:03:09.010> and<00:03:09.220> render<00:03:09.670> it<00:03:11.250> so<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:15.730> problem<00:03:16.090> is

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
sphere and render it so the problem is

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:23.699 
sphere and render it so the problem is
that<00:03:16.570> it<00:03:16.900> isn't<00:03:18.930> really<00:03:20.250> transparent<00:03:21.250> so<00:03:22.709> you

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
that it isn't really transparent so you

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.680 
that it isn't really transparent so you
can<00:03:23.890> easily<00:03:24.250> fix<00:03:24.430> that<00:03:24.549> open<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.570> material

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
can easily fix that open the material

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.650 
can easily fix that open the material
and<00:03:26.470> go<00:03:26.709> to<00:03:26.769> transparency<00:03:27.730> and<00:03:29.070> add<00:03:30.540> into<00:03:31.540> the

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
and go to transparency and add into the

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:38.430 
and go to transparency and add into the
texture<00:03:33.600> filter<00:03:35.400> click<00:03:36.400> on<00:03:36.609> that<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:37.930> separate

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
texture filter click on that to separate

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.550 
texture filter click on that to separate
the<00:03:38.709> image<00:03:40.380> bring<00:03:41.380> up<00:03:41.680> the<00:03:42.090> contrast<00:03:43.090> and

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
the image bring up the contrast and

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.979 
the image bring up the contrast and
enable<00:03:44.560> clipping<00:03:44.980> now<00:03:45.340> invert<00:03:45.940> those<00:03:46.510> numbers

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
enable clipping now invert those numbers

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.510 
enable clipping now invert those numbers
glowing<00:03:47.500> high<00:03:47.950> clip<00:03:48.220> so<00:03:49.150> everywhere

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
glowing high clip so everywhere

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.350 
glowing high clip so everywhere
in<00:03:51.520> which<00:03:51.700> is<00:03:51.880> black<00:03:53.850> there<00:03:54.850> isn't

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
in which is black there isn't

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.640 
in which is black there isn't
transparent<00:03:55.780> and<00:03:58.020> everything<00:03:59.020> that<00:03:59.170> is<00:03:59.350> white

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
transparent and everything that is white

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.810 
transparent and everything that is white
is<00:04:00.090> transparent<00:04:01.090> so<00:04:01.350> now<00:04:03.690> maybe<00:04:04.690> decrease<00:04:05.470> the

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:05.820 
is transparent so now maybe decrease the

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.320 
is transparent so now maybe decrease the
strength<00:04:06.820> of<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:07.860> tech<00:04:08.860> of<00:04:09.130> the<00:04:09.370> this<00:04:09.790> texture

strength of the tech of the this texture

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:18.900 
strength of the tech of the this texture
and<00:04:10.570> maybe<00:04:12.990> brightness<00:04:13.990> and<00:04:14.850> trainer<00:04:15.850> that<00:04:17.910> so

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
and maybe brightness and trainer that so

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.960 
and maybe brightness and trainer that so
I<00:04:19.329> think<00:04:20.079> that<00:04:20.650> is<00:04:20.920> probably<00:04:21.190> it

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
I think that is probably it

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.660 
I think that is probably it
Thanks
