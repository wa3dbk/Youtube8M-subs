well<00:03:28.250> the<00:03:28.340> ideal<00:03:28.700> solution<00:03:29.300> would<00:03:29.420> be

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
well the ideal solution would be

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.720 
well the ideal solution would be
Wireless<00:03:30.170> because<00:03:30.470> the<00:03:30.890> headset<00:03:31.280> looks<00:03:31.460> dumb

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
Wireless because the headset looks dumb

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.430 
Wireless because the headset looks dumb
enough<00:03:32.000> without<00:03:32.150> having<00:03:32.600> a<00:03:32.690> lot<00:03:32.810> of<00:03:32.870> extra

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440

wires coming from it I like the infra
red<00:03:36.830> solution<00:03:37.190> because<00:03:37.640> that<00:03:37.790> means<00:03:37.940> we<00:03:38.180> can

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
red solution because that means we can

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.900 
red solution because that means we can

the<00:04:44.419> arduino<00:04:45.050> near<00:04:45.289> the<00:04:45.439> object<00:04:45.979> you<00:04:46.129> want<00:04:46.340> to

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
the arduino near the object you want to

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.239 
the arduino near the object you want to
control<00:04:47.060> whenever<00:04:47.900> you<00:04:48.289> enter<00:04:48.680> anything<00:04:48.949> into

00:04:49.239 --> 00:04:49.249 
control whenever you enter anything into

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:51.850 
control whenever you enter anything into
the<00:04:49.550> console<00:04:50.120> it<00:04:50.389> should<00:04:50.599> activate<00:04:51.229> the<00:04:51.469> ir

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
the console it should activate the ir

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.480 
the console it should activate the ir
LED<00:04:52.400> and<00:04:52.639> send<00:04:52.909> the<00:04:52.999> signal<00:04:53.479> to<00:04:53.719> that<00:04:53.749> device

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
LED and send the signal to that device

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.709 
LED and send the signal to that device
now<00:04:55.490> all<00:04:55.669> we<00:04:55.819> have<00:04:55.969> to<00:04:55.999> do<00:04:56.240> is<00:04:56.360> combine<00:04:56.569> the

00:04:56.709 --> 00:04:56.719 
now all we have to do is combine the

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:59.619 
now all we have to do is combine the
mind<00:04:57.110> control<00:04:57.499> with<00:04:57.650> the<00:04:57.770> ir<00:04:58.129> LED<00:04:58.729> so<00:04:59.360> you<00:04:59.449> can

00:04:59.619 --> 00:04:59.629 
mind control with the ir LED so you can

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:01.269 
mind control with the ir LED so you can
remove<00:04:59.960> the<00:05:00.139> receiver<00:05:00.529> because<00:05:00.830> we<00:05:01.099> won't

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:01.279 
remove the receiver because we won't

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:03.279 
remove the receiver because we won't
need<00:05:01.490> it<00:05:01.669> anymore<00:05:01.909> and<00:05:02.120> then<00:05:02.479> add<00:05:02.779> back<00:05:02.810> the

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289 
need it anymore and then add back the

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:06.010 
need it anymore and then add back the
mind<00:05:03.529> control<00:05:03.949> wires<00:05:04.250> this<00:05:05.180> is<00:05:05.389> what<00:05:05.569> my<00:05:05.689> final

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
mind control wires this is what my final

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.589 
mind control wires this is what my final
arduino<00:05:06.710> mind-control<00:05:07.430> headset<00:05:07.969> looks<00:05:08.330> like

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:08.599 
arduino mind-control headset looks like

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:11.800 
arduino mind-control headset looks like
then<00:05:09.590> after<00:05:10.099> that<00:05:10.250> just<00:05:10.310> edit<00:05:11.090> your<00:05:11.240> original

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
then after that just edit your original

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.709 
then after that just edit your original
LED<00:05:12.319> code<00:05:12.650> so<00:05:13.009> that<00:05:13.039> instead<00:05:13.639> of<00:05:13.699> turning<00:05:14.330> on

00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:14.719 
LED code so that instead of turning on

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:17.260 
LED code so that instead of turning on
an<00:05:14.960> LED<00:05:15.139> it<00:05:15.680> sends<00:05:16.039> an<00:05:16.129> IR<00:05:16.520> signal<00:05:17.000> instead

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
an LED it sends an IR signal instead

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.890 
an LED it sends an IR signal instead
then<00:05:18.110> upload<00:05:18.680> it<00:05:18.830> and<00:05:18.949> test<00:05:19.310> it<00:05:19.490> out<00:05:19.719> if<00:05:20.719> you

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
then upload it and test it out if you

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.990 
then upload it and test it out if you
don't<00:05:21.139> need<00:05:21.409> the<00:05:21.650> console<00:05:22.279> you<00:05:22.550> can<00:05:22.580> remove

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
don't need the console you can remove

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.659 
don't need the console you can remove
