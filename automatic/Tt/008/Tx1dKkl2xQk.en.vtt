remove these with their fingers I have
to<00:01:43.130> use<00:01:43.249> pliers<00:01:43.549> on<00:01:43.909> this<00:01:44.270> because<00:01:44.569> I'm<00:01:44.659> using

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
to use pliers on this because I'm using

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.800 
to use pliers on this because I'm using
the<00:01:44.990> Shimano<00:01:45.349> chain<00:01:45.799> with<00:01:46.670> this<00:01:46.819> Ram<00:01:47.090> link<00:01:47.420> so

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
the Shimano chain with this Ram link so

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.899 
the Shimano chain with this Ram link so
the<00:01:47.959> tolerances<00:01:48.439> are<00:01:48.590> a<00:01:48.619> little<00:01:48.740> off<00:01:48.950> so<00:01:49.729> once

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
the tolerances are a little off so once

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.580 
the tolerances are a little off so once
we<00:01:50.029> squeeze<00:01:50.329> it<00:01:50.509> release<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:50.959> link<00:01:51.170> we<00:01:51.349> can<00:01:51.380> go

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
we squeeze it release the link we can go

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.149 
we squeeze it release the link we can go
ahead<00:01:51.649> and<00:01:51.859> remove<00:01:52.099> the<00:01:52.279> two<00:01:52.429> pieces<00:01:52.670> and<00:01:54.159> you

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
ahead and remove the two pieces and you

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.559 
ahead and remove the two pieces and you
can<00:01:55.189> take<00:01:55.459> your<00:01:55.549> chain<00:01:55.759> off<00:01:55.909> if<00:01:56.090> you<00:01:56.209> like<00:01:56.389> at

00:01:56.559 --> 00:01:56.569 
can take your chain off if you like at

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:59.379 
can take your chain off if you like at
that<00:01:56.719> point<00:01:56.919> these<00:01:57.919> are<00:01:57.979> the<00:01:58.249> two<00:01:58.429> halves<00:01:59.090> of

00:01:59.379 --> 00:01:59.389 
that point these are the two halves of

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:03.069 
that point these are the two halves of
the<00:01:59.450> link<00:01:59.859> they're<00:02:00.859> identical<00:02:01.429> pieces<00:02:02.079> so

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
the link they're identical pieces so

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.620 
the link they're identical pieces so
they're<00:02:03.229> interchangeable<00:02:03.469> for<00:02:04.099> sides<00:02:04.630> you

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
they're interchangeable for sides you

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.929 
they're interchangeable for sides you
can<00:02:05.810> see<00:02:05.959> the<00:02:06.079> little<00:02:06.349> slots<00:02:06.619> and<00:02:06.919> the<00:02:07.069> in<00:02:07.759> the

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
can see the little slots and the in the

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.389 
can see the little slots and the in the
pins<00:02:08.179> that's<00:02:08.959> where<00:02:09.229> they<00:02:09.500> they<00:02:10.039> slide

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
pins that's where they they slide

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.880 
pins that's where they they slide
through<00:02:10.670> in<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.330> in<00:02:11.660> the<00:02:11.750> grooves<00:02:14.709> so<00:02:15.709> the

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
through in the in the grooves so the

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.979 
through in the in the grooves so the
link<00:02:16.069> would<00:02:16.250> actually<00:02:16.700> go<00:02:16.849> together<00:02:17.030> simply

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
link would actually go together simply

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.170 
link would actually go together simply
besides<00:02:18.620> go<00:02:18.980> together<00:02:19.130> and<00:02:19.610> then<00:02:19.730> you<00:02:19.880> can<00:02:20.030> see

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
besides go together and then you can see

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.650 
besides go together and then you can see
how<00:02:20.360> those<00:02:21.280> edges<00:02:22.280> slide<00:02:22.820> in<00:02:23.000> those<00:02:23.150> slots<00:02:23.450> on

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
how those edges slide in those slots on

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:38.660 
how those edges slide in those slots on
the<00:02:23.690> pins

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.490 

so<00:02:39.090> if<00:02:39.360> you're<00:02:39.510> putting<00:02:39.750> this<00:02:39.840> back<00:02:40.110> on<00:02:40.319> your

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
so if you're putting this back on your

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.720 
so if you're putting this back on your
bike<00:02:40.650> putting<00:02:41.010> your<00:02:41.100> chain<00:02:41.250> back<00:02:41.400> on<00:02:41.460> your

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
bike putting your chain back on your

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.880 
bike putting your chain back on your
bike<00:02:42.200> you<00:02:43.200> go<00:02:43.380> ahead<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:45.440> take<00:02:46.440> your<00:02:46.560> two<00:02:46.709> ends

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
bike you go ahead and take your two ends

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.309 
bike you go ahead and take your two ends
of<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.130> link<00:02:50.390> to<00:02:51.390> enter<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.750> chain<00:02:52.020> that<00:02:52.260> are

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
of the link to enter the chain that are

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.410 
of the link to enter the chain that are
that<00:02:52.740> are<00:02:52.890> open<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.790> go<00:02:53.970> ahead<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.330> you're

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
that are open and go ahead and you're

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.230 
that are open and go ahead and you're
gonna<00:02:54.540> put<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:55.140> each<00:02:55.680> have<00:02:56.010> one<00:02:56.700> on<00:02:56.820> each<00:02:56.940> side

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
gonna put the each have one on each side

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.150 
gonna put the each have one on each side
so<00:02:57.510> they're<00:02:57.870> facing<00:02:58.020> each<00:02:58.260> other<00:02:58.500> one<00:02:58.950> from

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
so they're facing each other one from

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.130 
so they're facing each other one from
the<00:02:59.250> back<00:02:59.400> one<00:02:59.640> from<00:02:59.820> the<00:02:59.940> front<00:03:00.060> like<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:00.959> said

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
the back one from the front like I said

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.449 
the back one from the front like I said
before<00:03:01.260> they're<00:03:01.560> identical<00:03:01.890> pieces<00:03:02.190> so

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
before they're identical pieces so

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.820 
before they're identical pieces so
they're<00:03:02.610> interchangeable<00:03:03.709> doesn't<00:03:04.709> matter

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
they're interchangeable doesn't matter

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.680 
they're interchangeable doesn't matter
which<00:03:05.040> side<00:03:05.070> they<00:03:05.340> go<00:03:05.459> on<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:06.330> go<00:03:06.420> ahead<00:03:06.570> and

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
which side they go on and go ahead and

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.650 
which side they go on and go ahead and
get<00:03:06.780> them<00:03:06.900> started<00:03:07.050> by<00:03:08.209> pushing<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.450> pins

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
get them started by pushing the pins

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.930 
get them started by pushing the pins
through<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.130> larger<00:03:11.130> openings<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:11.820> the

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
through the larger openings and the

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.260 
through the larger openings and the
slots<00:03:12.200> like<00:03:13.200> so<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.920> you're<00:03:14.910> gonna<00:03:15.000> notice

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
slots like so and you're gonna notice

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.600 
slots like so and you're gonna notice
the<00:03:15.570> two<00:03:16.200> sides<00:03:16.560> of<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.070> link<00:03:17.310> that<00:03:17.430> are

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610 
the two sides of the link that are

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.400 
the two sides of the link that are
sticking<00:03:18.030> out<00:03:18.150> one<00:03:18.720> in<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:18.930> front<00:03:19.110> right

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410
