00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
that there's a lot of areas of cars for

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.350 
that there's a lot of areas of cars for
example<00:04:41.340> that<00:04:41.550> the<00:04:41.970> owner<00:04:42.240> can<00:04:42.630> do<00:04:42.900> to<00:04:43.169> prevent

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
example that the owner can do to prevent

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.330 
example that the owner can do to prevent
permanent<00:04:45.360> damage<00:04:45.810> this<00:04:46.740> is<00:04:46.949> one<00:04:47.160> of<00:04:47.190> the

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
permanent damage this is one of the

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.870 
permanent damage this is one of the
areas<00:04:47.520> now<00:04:48.180> because<00:04:48.570> my<00:04:48.720> wife<00:04:49.400> just<00:04:50.400> doesn't

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
areas now because my wife just doesn't

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.590 
areas now because my wife just doesn't
care<00:04:51.919> she<00:04:52.919> kind<00:04:53.250> of<00:04:53.370> cares<00:04:53.639> but<00:04:54.120> not<00:04:54.300> enough

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
care she kind of cares but not enough

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.820 
care she kind of cares but not enough
where<00:04:54.900> she's<00:04:55.080> going<00:04:55.229> to<00:04:55.289> come<00:04:55.500> up<00:04:55.590> with<00:04:55.740> a

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
where she's going to come up with a

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.279 
where she's going to come up with a
solution<00:04:56.009> that's<00:04:56.699> going<00:04:57.240> to<00:04:57.389> prevent<00:04:57.780> this

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
solution that's going to prevent this

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:01.490 
solution that's going to prevent this
from<00:04:58.350> actually<00:04:59.099> getting<00:04:59.130> tore<00:04:59.729> up<00:05:00.320> it<00:05:01.320> could

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
from actually getting tore up it could

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.860 
from actually getting tore up it could
be<00:05:01.680> as<00:05:01.770> simple<00:05:01.800> as<00:05:02.220> her<00:05:02.460> forcing<00:05:03.120> her<00:05:03.300> foot<00:05:03.599> to

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
be as simple as her forcing her foot to

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.339 
be as simple as her forcing her foot to
rest<00:05:04.199> somewhere<00:05:04.530> else<00:05:05.330> anyhow<00:05:06.330> so<00:05:06.990> there<00:05:07.229> is

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
rest somewhere else anyhow so there is

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:09.110 
rest somewhere else anyhow so there is
some<00:05:07.560> things<00:05:07.889> that<00:05:08.160> people<00:05:08.490> can<00:05:08.669> do<00:05:08.880> to

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
some things that people can do to

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.360 
some things that people can do to
prevent<00:05:09.360> permanent<00:05:09.780> damage<00:05:10.139> so<00:05:11.070> that's<00:05:11.280> just

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
prevent permanent damage so that's just

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.089 
prevent permanent damage so that's just
a<00:05:11.550> little<00:05:11.759> sidebar<00:05:12.270> but<00:05:13.229> if<00:05:13.500> you<00:05:13.740> look<00:05:13.919> around

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 
every five years we'll get a little bit

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.520 
every five years we'll get a little bit
of<00:06:00.750> hail<00:06:01.669> but<00:06:02.669> all<00:06:02.759> we<00:06:02.880> get<00:06:03.000> is<00:06:03.060> rain<00:06:03.479> but<00:06:04.349> with

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.300 
of hail but all we get is rain but with
rain<00:06:04.860> is<00:06:05.280> you<00:06:05.520> track<00:06:05.909> the<00:06:06.360> dirty<00:06:07.110> water<00:06:07.470> into

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
rain is you track the dirty water into

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:13.279 
rain is you track the dirty water into
your<00:06:08.960> floor<00:06:09.960> mat<00:06:10.169> into<00:06:10.620> your<00:06:10.740> car<00:06:11.070> and<00:06:11.810> it<00:06:12.810> does

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:13.289 
your floor mat into your car and it does

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:15.890 
your floor mat into your car and it does
accumulate<00:06:13.949> and<00:06:14.550> you've<00:06:15.060> got<00:06:15.240> normal<00:06:15.570> wear

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
accumulate and you've got normal wear

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.490 
accumulate and you've got normal wear
and<00:06:16.169> tear<00:06:16.289> and<00:06:16.919> dirt<00:06:17.570> so<00:06:18.570> how<00:06:18.810> do<00:06:18.870> we<00:06:19.050> deal<00:06:19.349> with

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
and tear and dirt so how do we deal with

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.279 
and tear and dirt so how do we deal with
this<00:06:19.530> well<00:06:20.340> it's<00:06:20.699> pretty<00:06:21.090> straightforward<00:06:21.449> so

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:22.289 
this well it's pretty straightforward so

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:23.180 
this well it's pretty straightforward so
what<00:06:22.470> I'm<00:06:22.560> going<00:06:22.680> to<00:06:22.740> do<00:06:22.860> is<00:06:22.979> I'm<00:06:23.039> going<00:06:23.070> to

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:28.100 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
pull<00:06:23.490> this<00:06:23.669> out<00:06:23.970> of<00:06:24.240> the<00:06:24.330> car<00:06:24.900> and<00:06:26.090> I<00:06:27.110> must

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
pull this out of the car and I must

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.240 
pull this out of the car and I must
pause<00:06:28.680> this<00:06:29.070> and<00:06:29.340> set<00:06:29.880> it<00:06:30.030> up<00:06:30.530> and<00:06:31.530> go<00:06:32.070> from

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250 
pause this and set it up and go from

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.550 
pause this and set it up and go from
there
