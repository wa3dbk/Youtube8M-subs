00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:05.810
 a unique arrived in ufa at the station at home 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.190
 train exhibition lecture complex 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.080
 oao rzh 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.219
 everyone could meet 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.829
 history and learn about the prospects 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.829
 development of rail transport at the 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:25.670
 us wagon represented jobs 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.919
 people who drive traffic 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.570
 trains on the railway train 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.919
 dispatcher is one of the most 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.170
 positions of responsibility 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.210
 they are responsible for driving safety and 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.129
 monitors compliance with the schedule 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.440
 trains each team from the dispatcher 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.870
 fed to electrical systems 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.390
 centralization we have presented a new 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.160
 microprocessor based system 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.710
 which prevent mistakes at work on 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.809
 99 percent each team which 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.269
 comes from a person on this system there 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.550
 processed and if the command is incorrect 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.769
 then it will not be done future 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.739
 of course for process automation 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.269
 management transportation 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:05.180
 but I myself wonder I think not worth it 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.979
 release attention corner of Roscosmos so 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.909
 as art cooperation company ooo 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:13.220
 rzh and insert your booth in this booth 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.170
 of course a lot of unique things from 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.799
 those credentials and 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.790
 2000 Gagarin headset and bead recording in 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.470
 this magazine 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.450
 spacecraft union first 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.549
 women astronauts get along. 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.409
 well and no less close exhibit of this 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.180
 stand is and Chelyabinsk meteorite 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.799
 programs that we have for 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.840
 demonstration to us in front of an employee 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.030
 the michigan museum of all and the crosses too 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.409
 and even a month in the booth even a toy 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.780
 camel us there too by chance 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.399
 astronaut the same people and saw such 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.009
 at the time of sentimentality took with them 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:47.290
 and into orbit as a souvenir and 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:50.740
 mascot very interesting forest road 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.590
 future machinist here decided 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.329
 Do not miss such an interesting exhibition of 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.189
 the fact that they looked that I remember 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.979
 some kind of carriage is possible with simulators 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.960
 wagons sleep son since childhood knives on 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:06.540
 the road to the water 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:09.290
 he became interested in computer games found 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.210
 special for road builders now 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.780
 trains here decided to try 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.780
 this simulator 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.989
 range 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:26.470
 wants to know 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:28.750
 trains to the museum for three years drove along 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.430
 from Murmansk to Vladivostok were on 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.830
 Baikal-Amur Mainline 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.989
 drove all of our country without stopping 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.360
 just come to Moscow for technical 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.790
 Inspecting loss of quiet technical repair 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.700
 change naked and repair everything 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.380
 led the final victory of 70 years we will change 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.569
 new carriage to put everything constantly 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.180
 our country is added not to stand on 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.489
 the place is always an innovation a different solution 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.519
 All this applies, we have in life 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.680
 speed train pro swallow which 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:59.019
 was produced by the German company of the seed communication 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.750
 with the Winter Olympics 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:03.970
 36 such electric trains were ordered 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.110
 now keep running in various 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.299
 Moscow cities Nizhny Novgorod 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.590
 St. Petersburg great Novgorod also 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.829
 between two capitals 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.690
 from 2018 planned massive 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.190
 production in Russia in the Urals 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.319
 factory in the city of Upper Pyshma 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.690
 Sverdlovsk region their will 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.160
 make up to 200 cars a year and they 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.170
 will eventually replace obsolete 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.090
 electric suburban trains 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.819
 the dough will be more modern train 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.650
 in which five cars capacity of them 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.560
 eight hundred twenty two seats 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.930
 and develop soon will be up to 160 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.190
 kilometers per hour class . when I myself was 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.660
 at the olympic games february not 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.910
 take advantage of this service in principle 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.920
 beautiful comfortable electric train 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.200
 modern let's say so responding to all 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.329
 our passengerâ€™s requirements therefore 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.549
 In principle, everything is represented here. 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.500
 these layouts all these know-how developments 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:53.739
 as we say i think in perspective 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.660
 will be introduced in all branches of Russian 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.639
 Railways train just this building 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.889
 train station station go and 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.959
 one more day next time he will arrive 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:03.549
 in ufa only a year later he articles 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.150
 unique to the city television channel 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.150
 then you
