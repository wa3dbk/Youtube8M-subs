another<00:04:28.100> comparison<00:04:28.640> of<00:04:28.729> I<00:04:28.820> mean<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.419> screen

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
another comparison of I mean the screen

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.659 
another comparison of I mean the screen
is<00:04:29.930> tiny<00:04:30.290> that<00:04:30.710> is<00:04:30.860> probably<00:04:31.190> the<00:04:31.280> only<00:04:31.520> thing

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:31.669 
is tiny that is probably the only thing

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:33.490 
is tiny that is probably the only thing
that<00:04:31.970> you're<00:04:32.450> gonna<00:04:32.630> say<00:04:32.930> that<00:04:33.169> you're<00:04:33.320> bad

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
that you're gonna say that you're bad

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.100 
that you're gonna say that you're bad
about<00:04:33.650> it<00:04:33.860> but<00:04:34.010> it<00:04:34.910> makes<00:04:35.120> the<00:04:35.240> resolution<00:04:35.810> so

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
about it but it makes the resolution so

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.030 
about it but it makes the resolution so
much<00:04:36.290> smaller<00:04:36.590> looks<00:04:37.130> crystal<00:04:37.850> clear<00:04:39.040> our

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
much smaller looks crystal clear our

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.650 
much smaller looks crystal clear our
thing<00:04:40.280> I<00:04:40.370> noticed<00:04:40.760> just<00:04:41.210> by<00:04:41.330> turning<00:04:41.390> our

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
thing I noticed just by turning our

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:42.310 
thing I noticed just by turning our
lights<00:04:41.840> off

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
lights off

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.260

these<00:04:43.070> light<00:04:43.310> out<00:04:43.490> the<00:04:43.790> start<00:04:44.060> and<00:04:44.150> select

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
these light out the start and select

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.510 
these light out the start and select
buttons<00:04:44.800> now<00:04:45.800> don't<00:04:46.100> know<00:04:46.190> whether<00:04:46.460> that

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
buttons now don't know whether that

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.279 
buttons now don't know whether that
means<00:04:46.760> the<00:04:46.940> batteries<00:04:47.360> like<00:04:47.570> I'm<00:04:47.750> pretty<00:04:48.020> sure

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289 
means the batteries like I'm pretty sure

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:52.120 
means the batteries like I'm pretty sure
that<00:04:48.440> red<00:04:48.950> means<00:04:49.220> is<00:04:49.370> low<00:04:49.750> so<00:04:50.750> a<00:04:51.080> lot<00:04:52.010> they'll

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
that red means is low so a lot they'll

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:57.460 
that red means is low so a lot they'll
play<00:04:52.280> too<00:04:52.340> much<00:04:52.669> this<00:04:52.850> but<00:04:54.220> yeah<00:04:56.229> the<00:04:57.229> screen

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
play too much this but yeah the screen

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.290 
play too much this but yeah the screen
it<00:04:58.460> looks<00:04:58.729> beautiful<00:05:00.850> that<00:05:01.850> is<00:05:01.940> about<00:05:02.150> as<00:05:02.270> a

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
it looks beautiful that is about as a

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.320 
it looks beautiful that is about as a
lock<00:05:02.510> and<00:05:02.660> so<00:05:02.840> really

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.200 

yeah<00:05:08.419> in<00:05:08.750> conclusion<00:05:09.469> really<00:05:10.009> this<00:05:10.189> this<00:05:10.550> is

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210

00:05:13.179 --> 00:05:13.189 
the nuts of a little system thought I'd

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:17.439
