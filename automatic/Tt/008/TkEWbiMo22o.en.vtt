you<00:00:16.680> speed<00:00:16.949> magnetic<00:00:17.550> power<00:00:17.730> so<00:00:18.359> on<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.779> so

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
you speed magnetic power so on and so

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.420 
you speed magnetic power so on and so
forth<00:00:18.960> so<00:00:19.410> purpose<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.039> game<00:00:20.160> see<00:00:20.369> how

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
forth so purpose of the game see how

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.790 
forth so purpose of the game see how
long<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:20.699> can<00:00:20.760> travel<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.660> see<00:00:21.840> how<00:00:21.990> long<00:00:22.050> you

long you can travel and see how long you

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.560 
long you can travel and see how long you
can<00:00:22.830> survive<00:00:23.279> essentially<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.210> here<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.539> a

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
can survive essentially so here is a

against<00:01:18.780> I'm<00:01:18.930> gonna<00:01:19.049> just<00:01:19.140> go<00:01:19.259> play<00:01:19.439> again

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
against I'm gonna just go play again

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.109 
against I'm gonna just go play again
here<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.220> show<00:01:20.400> you<00:01:20.460> hopefully<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.850> can<00:01:20.909> get<00:01:21.060> a

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
here to show you hopefully I can get a

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.910 
here to show you hopefully I can get a
powerup<00:01:21.479> estamos<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.049> can<00:01:22.200> get<00:01:22.320> like<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> boost

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
powerup estamos you can get like a boost

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.460 
powerup estamos you can get like a boost
or<00:01:23.130> magnetic<00:01:23.540> power<00:01:24.540> here<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.080> I'm<00:01:25.170> flying

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
or magnetic power here so I'm flying

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.640 
or magnetic power here so I'm flying
along<00:01:25.830> here<00:01:26.240> line<00:01:27.240> along<00:01:27.570> flying<00:01:28.020> along<00:01:28.320> and

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
along here line along flying along and

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.039 
along here line along flying along and
again<00:01:29.610> we're<00:01:29.850> trying<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.119> avoid<00:01:30.420> obstacles

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
again we're trying to avoid obstacles

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.020 
again we're trying to avoid obstacles
and<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:32.070> got<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> boost<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.820> saw<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
and I got a boost that you saw the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.179 
and I got a boost that you saw the
rocket<00:01:33.509> change<00:01:33.810> there<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.710> can<00:01:34.829> get<00:01:34.890> boost

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
rocket change there so you can get boost

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.260 
rocket change there so you can get boost
like<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.610> can<00:01:35.700> also<00:01:35.820> get<00:01:35.970> ones<00:01:36.180> are

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
like that you can also get ones are

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.450 
like that you can also get ones are
magnetic<00:01:36.689> power<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.110> bring<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.220> whole

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
magnetic power that bring in a whole

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.560 
magnetic power that bring in a whole
bunch<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.759> gym<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.060> they'll<00:01:39.240> bring<00:01:39.390> in

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
bunch of gym so they'll bring in

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.030 
bunch of gym so they'll bring in
surrounding<00:01:40.020> gems<00:01:40.229> you're<00:01:40.770> going<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:40.979> avoid

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
surrounding gems you're going to avoid

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.490 
surrounding gems you're going to avoid
stuff<00:01:41.369> like<00:01:41.520> stalagmites<00:01:42.119> and<00:01:42.329> rocks<00:01:43.140> and

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
stuff like stalagmites and rocks and

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.630 
stuff like stalagmites and rocks and
stuff<00:01:43.710> like<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.009> obviously<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.490> want

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
stuff like that and obviously you want

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.520 
stuff like that and obviously you want
to<00:01:44.700> keep<00:01:44.820> on<00:01:45.000> collecting<00:01:45.180> gems<00:01:45.689> or<00:01:45.930> else<00:01:46.110> you

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
to keep on collecting gems or else you

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.440 
to keep on collecting gems or else you
lose<00:01:46.560> momentum<00:01:46.860> but<00:01:47.280> if<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.700> do<00:01:47.970> hit<00:01:48.299> an

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
lose momentum but if you do hit an

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.800 
lose momentum but if you do hit an
object<00:01:48.869> as<00:01:49.290> long<00:01:49.799> as<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.040> can<00:01:50.189> hit<00:01:51.060> gems<00:01:51.540> again

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
object as long as you can hit gems again

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.630 
object as long as you can hit gems again
you<00:01:51.930> regain<00:01:52.350> your<00:01:52.380> momentum<00:01:53.040> so<00:01:53.220> essentially

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
you regain your momentum so essentially

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.639 
you regain your momentum so essentially
you<00:01:53.729> always<00:01:54.000> want<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.210> see<00:01:54.360> stay<00:01:54.899> near<00:01:55.290> gems

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
you always want to see stay near gems

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.289 
you always want to see stay near gems
especially<00:01:56.579> if<00:01:56.670> you're<00:01:56.790> going<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:56.969> hit<00:01:57.090> an

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
especially if you're going to hit an

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.569 
especially if you're going to hit an
object<00:01:57.770> upcoming<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:58.979> can<00:01:59.100> see<00:01:59.219> here<00:01:59.369> I

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
object upcoming so you can see here I

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.609 
object upcoming so you can see here I
hit<00:01:59.729> something<00:02:00.000> but<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.299> as<00:02:00.630> long<00:02:01.110> as<00:02:01.229> I<00:02:01.320> keep<00:02:01.469> on

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
hit something but I as long as I keep on

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.080 
hit something but I as long as I keep on
hearing<00:02:01.649> those<00:02:01.979> gems<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.490> those<00:02:02.579> sustain

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
hearing those gems and those sustain

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.440 
hearing those gems and those sustain
line<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.540> those<00:02:03.659> gems<00:02:03.899> then<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:05.009> keep<00:02:05.969> on<00:02:06.119> going

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
line of those gems then I keep on going

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.690 
line of those gems then I keep on going
up<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.750> up<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.020> again<00:02:07.399> power-ups<00:02:08.399> along<00:02:08.580> the

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
up and up and again power-ups along the

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
up and up and again power-ups along the
way<00:02:08.789> like<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:08.970> say<00:02:09.090> there's<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.270> couple<00:02:09.390> boost

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
way like I say there's a couple boost

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.969 
way like I say there's a couple boost
that<00:02:09.810> we've<00:02:09.929> picked<00:02:10.080> up<00:02:10.200> here<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.470> lot<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:10.739> big

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
that we've picked up here a lot of big

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.199 
that we've picked up here a lot of big
gems<00:02:11.220> entomologist<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.849> can<00:02:11.940> see<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.180> I

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
gems entomologist you can see that I

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.340 
gems entomologist you can see that I
picked<00:02:12.480> up<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.660> big<00:02:12.870> boost

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
picked up a big boost

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.830 
picked up a big boost
cause<00:02:13.890> me<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.220> fly<00:02:14.460> up<00:02:14.580> there<00:02:14.730> but<00:02:15.660> yeah<00:02:15.720> that's

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
cause me to fly up there but yeah that's

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.180 
cause me to fly up there but yeah that's
essentially<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.290> game<00:02:16.470> again<00:02:16.740> you<00:02:16.830> see<00:02:17.130> how

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
essentially the game again you see how

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.290 
essentially the game again you see how
long<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.430> can<00:02:17.490> survive<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.970> I'm<00:02:18.030> going<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.210> go

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
long you can survive and I'm going to go

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.700 
long you can survive and I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.570> can<00:02:18.630> see<00:02:18.810> here<00:02:18.960> if<00:02:19.020> I<00:02:19.110> just<00:02:19.140> stop

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
ahead you can see here if I just stop

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.320 
ahead you can see here if I just stop
pulling<00:02:19.980> my<00:02:20.070> finger<00:02:20.400> than<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:20.610> just<00:02:20.910> lose

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
pulling my finger than you just lose

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.220 
pulling my finger than you just lose
momentum<00:02:21.600> there<00:02:22.250> anyways<00:02:23.250> so<00:02:23.550> this<00:02:23.760> is

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
momentum there anyways so this is

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.540 
momentum there anyways so this is
jetpack<00:02:25.230> rocket<00:02:25.710> man<00:02:25.830> pretty<00:02:26.100> simple<00:02:26.430> game

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
jetpack rocket man pretty simple game

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.610 
jetpack rocket man pretty simple game
premise<00:02:26.820> I<00:02:26.910> like<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.210> controls<00:02:27.540> if<00:02:28.320> anything

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
premise I like the controls if anything

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.950 
premise I like the controls if anything
i<00:02:28.950> want<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.310> see<00:02:29.490> update<00:02:29.940> for<00:02:30.150> iphone<00:02:30.240> 5<00:02:30.720> it

resolution on the iphone 5 so that would
be<00:02:35.850> nice<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.180> see<00:02:36.330> in<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.540> new<00:02:36.660> update<00:02:37.140> other

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
than that does have support for Game
