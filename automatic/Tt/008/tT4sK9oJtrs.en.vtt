00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.630
 hello welcome to this second part 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:08.570
 about what is high definition or hd and 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:11.150
 ultra high definition in the video 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.190
 previous we saw that it is high definition 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.470
 we saw that there is another definition called 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.499
 standard that is that of the televisions 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:22.060
 analogues and we also saw that there is high 

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:26.720
 720 definition and there is high definition 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:30.550
 1080 or call also full hd 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:34.430
 what happens when I play a file 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.730
 standard on an HD or high TV 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.769
 definition then what happens is 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.010
 simply that the standard file is 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.809
 expands to the size of the TV but the 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.400
 file does not become high 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.980
 definition to be reproduced in a 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.559
 TV or on an HD device if 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.710
 get a file on television or in 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.110
 standard format or if you exported from the 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.619
 computer a video in standard size 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.840
 for no matter on what device what 

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:07.230
 reproduce is not going to become hd 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.630
 how can i see hd to see high 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.180
 definition is very important that all the 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.520
 process of the video that I am seeing is 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.550
 done in hd or in high 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.080
 definition for example when I recorded 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.700
 the video the video had to be given 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.280
 recorded with a high camera 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.310
 definition and it must have been edited 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.400
 also in high definition and exported 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.730
 in high definition and I have to see it 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.980
 also in high definition 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.990
 no matter if I see it in a 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.910
 television or if I see it on a computer 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.640
 a computer is also in the 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.910
 capacity through your monitor your 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.610
 screen to play files in high 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.430
 definition when we see in 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.730
 televisions there is a gavÃ  cable called 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:58.020
 the hdmi cable that means high 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:00.240
 definition multimedia interface east 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.760
 cable is responsible for transmitting 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.020
 data in high definition or I do not 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:09.000
 I can pretend to play a file of 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.280
 high definition on a television if not 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.700
 I have this cable unless it's a signal 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.710
 open high definition television 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.110
 which is what the 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.300
 analog blackout or the channels of 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.950
 open television public channels 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.130
 of the countries are going to start broadcasting 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.560
 high definition open signals 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:31.230
 I can see a beady disc on high 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.060
 definition in hd is a question that 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.980
 I constantly receive and a concern 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.540
 that people have and I'm going to 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.610
 buy a divide 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.959
 I have a / I have my TV at high 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.659
 definition then I will see high 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:46.109
 definition through this video not the 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:48.780
 divide only is a video format 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:50.400
 for standard television, I mean what 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.019
 I can connect a television on high 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.599
 definition but what I'm seeing is not 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.890
 it is high definition to divide through 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.090
 of a divide I can not reproduce 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.090
 High Definition 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:05.469
 then there comes something that is the bluray 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:08.499
 the bluray is an optical disk like a 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:11.859
 divide but that has greater capacity and 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:15.730
 which is designed to play video 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:18.609
 in high definition and dividing if it 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.799
 connects to the television via cables 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.329
 hdmi 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.819
 then for this you can play 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:27.250
 let's say a movie a video on high 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.169
 definition on my TV to get 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.129
 that movie or that video on high 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:32.129
 definition in bluray 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:39.040
 well now let's talk about what it is 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:42.250
 ultra high definition or ultra hd here 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.010
 we have a corporate image where 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.280
 we see first the resolution 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.140
 standard we see below each of the 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.300
 resolutions of each of the 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.090
 references the exact resolution in 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:04:00.280
 pixels then what is high comes 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:03.430
 hd 720 definition after hd 1080 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.140
 full hd then comes something that has more 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:09.190
 resolution one more video version 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:14.200
 advanced call 2k and then something comes 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:15.760
 called 4k or the manufacturing companies what 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.630
 they have also called for televisions 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:22.570
 ultra hd which is a cinema format 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:26.230
 digital there is another format even more 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:28.750
 big is 8K and film cameras 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.090
 digital cinema cameras record in the 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:34.510
 4k format that is real twenty one size 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.730
 very large and obviously when the 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.990
 frames of the video when the image is 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.210
 larger 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.610
 because the file weighs more and are files 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:46.159
 much more difficult to also handle 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.050
 in this case when I'm going to do 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:49.400
 youtube videos for example as 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.639
 many of the videos he made what 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.050
 made through hd 720 most of 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:57.949
 the videos that we see in high 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:01.280
 definition on youtube are hd 720 many 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:03.919
 others are published in 1080 but high 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.780
 definition in 1080 or full hd require 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:07.460
 much more bandwidth that is me 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.430
 I need to have a higher speed of 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:14.599
 internet for worse to be able to reproduce 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:16.819
 this video and already find videos in 2k or 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:19.639
 finding videos in 4k is much more 

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:24.169
 difficult even it is very difficult me from 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:27.469
 my personal position I think it is that 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:29.900
 the theme of the ultra high is very useful 

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:33.500
 definition in common TVs 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:37.250
 because it's not easy to get a 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:39.110
 film in 4k scarcely have the 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.909
 cinemas the projection rooms that they 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.610
 they arrive in these digital cinema formats 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:45.139
 but we are currently in the 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:47.449
 present at the time of recording this 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:48.740
 video we can not go to the street 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:50.150
 we can 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.250
 inter do not decide what I want to get 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.380
 this movie in 4k and we download the 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.539
 we put to play then like this 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:59.449
 we have an ultra high TV 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:01.250
 definition will touch us conform 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:06.400
 with the movies that we can get 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:08.569
 in bluray up to hd 1080 or full hd 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.310
 good will be the information I wanted 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:15.099
 give them around that is high 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:17.660
 hd definition I hope you find it useful 

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:20.419
 at some point when they are going to set 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:23.470
 your cameras to record when they go to 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:26.030
 select in Youtube your resolution of 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:27.680
 visualization that they have clear that what 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.710
 who are watching even when they go to 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:33.169
 buy a television or a device let's say 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.250
 of video or photographic capture that 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:36.319
 you put yourself also that are 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.000
 buying the invite to see another 

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:40.039
 called video that is the resolution 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.909
 thank you very much until next time 

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:42.909
 opportunity a hug
