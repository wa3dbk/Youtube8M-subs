00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.619 

but<00:01:03.160> at<00:01:03.460> the<00:01:03.520> moment<00:01:03.730> I<00:01:03.940> think<00:01:04.120> it's<00:01:04.239> Ellis

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
but at the moment I think it's Ellis

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.080 
but at the moment I think it's Ellis
bummer<00:01:04.950> especially<00:01:05.950> on<00:01:06.370> the<00:01:06.460> preseason<00:01:06.790> toy

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090

who's<00:01:07.420> throwing<00:01:08.260> a<00:01:08.380> few<00:01:08.620> tricks<00:01:08.800> around<00:01:08.980> and

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
who's throwing a few tricks around and

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:16.820 
who's throwing a few tricks around and
making<00:01:09.880> people's<00:01:10.270> room<00:01:11.020> cards<00:01:11.350> on<00:01:11.440> it<00:01:11.530> exit

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.590 

are<00:01:17.830> correctly<00:01:18.160> without<00:01:18.340> doubt<00:01:18.760> is<00:01:19.090> it<00:01:19.330> he's<00:01:19.570> a

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
are correctly without doubt is it he's a

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.930 
are correctly without doubt is it he's a
mover<00:01:20.050> I<00:01:20.229> think<00:01:21.070> he<00:01:21.130> practices<00:01:21.610> though<00:01:21.729> in<00:01:21.850> his

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
mover I think he practices though in his

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.360 
mover I think he practices though in his
room<00:01:22.120> so<00:01:22.390> i<00:01:22.660> think<00:01:23.229> that's<00:01:23.440> that's<00:01:24.040> why<00:01:24.220> it's<00:01:24.340> a

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
room so i think that's that's why it's a

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:30.990 
room so i think that's that's why it's a
good<00:01:24.460> move<00:01:24.640> i<00:01:29.280> mostly<00:01:30.280> listen<00:01:30.370> to<00:01:30.610> deep<00:01:30.790> house
