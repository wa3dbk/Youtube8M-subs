00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:11.159
 that can add up 

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:14.109
 seated start of a new career 

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:17.149
 that he actually I have not been there for a few years since years 

00:00:17.149 --> 00:00:20.300
 moreover that is not it will be the first time writing is the service 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.140
 available 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.480
 but then you get here 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.919
 to nag 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:29.259
 Government troops insist that reports the triumph connection I see it 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:30.539
 certainly 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.220
 Erasenkerke meaning they had the word artworks and you can say that 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.079
 that irritates 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:36.910
 Works of art very nicely 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.110
 how long are you per hour 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.110
 the doctors could have been temporarily responsible for that 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.450
 but I have an offer in 3d week 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.300
 Anne Frank Poppelaars is so I still do a lot of work I do and 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.950
 tapped with employees 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:54.420
 and that to be able to make punctuality you sometimes have to put it underneath 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.030
 focus tolerate 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.030
 the waiting and then draws more at the time yes 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.180
 cannot be deployed for two and four weeks 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.500
 that's just a bit high 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.070
 conquer drogba 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.300
 thereby also becomes a temporary one and there but what can it all be that image 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.660
 I'm late 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.290
 and finally stand 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.840
 nevertheless the argan tom leak bridge remains cheers 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.630
 this moment is not yet clear 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:17.720
 Mr. 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.660
 now it just wasn't my intention to get rid of it while only halfway through the 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.160
 make a competition out of it 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.430
 set of big lakes american pants 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.150
 the realization 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.920
 for which people are this painter from the books in which price range 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.260
 hopefully to return again 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.900
 I find it quite difficult because they settle and delve into the artworks 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.990
 Kinect to grow now has ten 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.190
 heijmans anyone who plans that do even more heavy work 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.460
 this is a nice thing about i know i had to make samples of course 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.200
 and which direction 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.200
 theater nice 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.070
 and that is difficult to deny not clear note well it goes well and 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.130
 affordable 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.780
 the paintings have made karpov alps 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.050
 especially behind 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.710
 for me yes, the title fight and self-image 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.449
 that is possible at that time it was quite your job that those statements 

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:10.179
 man to be in shape on 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.859
 the police are at that moment 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:15.469
 her music has changed somewhat with new neighborhoods are all with 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.509
 the first minute stopped in the three northern section where it all 

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:19.569
 a little bit more 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.829
 happy here is its low point 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.510
 after the winter break probably with the Christmas holidays to feel later 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:26.759
 tapped inside 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:28.529
 then rather work 

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:31.529
 these are all working on my first piece 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:34.329
 the region closely 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:35.629
 youth prince 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.289
 in the heart of so much success 

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:41.179
 I do not know if we because we are in the Zaanse or exhibition in Brussels 

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:42.929
 milan rome billion
