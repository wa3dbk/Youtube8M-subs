scales or rotates around its own axis

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.700 
scales or rotates around its own axis
instead<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.700> single<00:01:20.939> axis<00:01:21.509> this<00:01:22.259> makes<00:01:22.590> it

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
instead of a single axis this makes it

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.560 
instead of a single axis this makes it
easy<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.040> do<00:01:23.280> things<00:01:23.580> like<00:01:23.729> curl<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.180> joint

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570

now<00:01:28.650> allows<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.340> define<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.850> rotation

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
now allows you to define the rotation

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.569 
now allows you to define the rotation
order<00:01:30.659> for<00:01:30.840> an<00:01:30.900> object<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.950> new<00:01:32.100> gimbley

rotation option makes it much easier to
visualize<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.369> behavior<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:35.970> each<00:01:36.450> rotation

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
visualize the behavior of each rotation

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.350 
visualize the behavior of each rotation

gimbal lock may occur because the
individual<00:01:42.090> axis<00:01:42.600> bands<00:01:42.990> shift<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.590> display

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
individual axis bands shift to display
