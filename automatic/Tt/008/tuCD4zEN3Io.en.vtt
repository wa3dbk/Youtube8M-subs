 the last fool to turn out that there are still someone who counts in your curves and who 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.890
 according to according to if mcc had something I think of these fools who 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.190
 they take responsibility they felt they had broken a toilet 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.940
 something that certainly could have moved that night 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.870
 they talk about whether to have smashed coaches from the land of the tac but if there then 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.000
 they put a coach on 150 people in a day and then have to be compensated

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.230
 they checked 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.110
 how we condemned each other we looked at each other 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.900
 in the eyes the mistake was made we want to pay but we leave for one 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.000
 torch lit for a firecracker 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.430
 for a bernard father fired then this is fine too 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.910
 because we have to take it too because we know what the law says today 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.770
 I'm fine with this but I don't have to say that we have broken through gates in Rome not 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.160
 we have the tickets for the game, but we do not enter but we break through us 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.720
 we respected everything that had been there I don't want to say it was 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.160
 all concocted moreover I don't want to say that we justify the acts of 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.729
 vandalism indeed 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:10.660
 point out 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.820
 prevented before in every sense to go to the stage of the flyer ad 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.599
 invite multijet people 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.749

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:23.579
 i 220 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.579
 the previous are g3600 tickets bought 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:31.869
 it's average is very low for a city was of problems with was flights but then 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:35.900
 let me understand one thing but we also had to ask him the criminal record a 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.239
 who will have to get on that train I don't know mica kissed adorisio 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.269
 supporters legal camorra law director 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.299
 highways and roads 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.290
 We are offending summer by our way of being ourselves 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.070
 we fight every day 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.670
 with konakart with the reality that Naples is not easy 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.359
 and the real ultras and know what it means to do the ultra sun Naples 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:05.420
 % I certainly don't reproach I live here anna as well I surely can't 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:06.360
 disown 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.690
 i live in a popular neighborhood l to the reality that my city but definitely 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.320
 tie if a feeling a faith is something so beautiful so clean 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.070
 now I don't know if it was said 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.579
 go for quite a while now it was almost like people who 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:25.529
 graphic paisà with let's go and ask for nothing from naples not exceptional witness 

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:29.269
 Our president is so sorry at the moment that he is hanging 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.449
 from the lips of certain people, indeed, I would really like to take advantage of this 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:34.600
 say that 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.520
 we are by his side but we have never disappointed him and nothing is there 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.520
 there is absolutely no responsibility on the part of the fans 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:44.710
 not even doubt 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.970
 but associating the fans to quentin's i know how to say those that hijack i 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:50.690
 trains 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.059
 those that treat poorly understand version 

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:56.300
 and camorristi seemed to me with trap exaggeration 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.649
 berlusconi d 

00:03:57.649 --> 00:04:00.299
 clashes between voiceover fans have been 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.319
 ellesse grandmother when we arrived at the stadium once again a few friends 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.219
 that something is done in short, but what is left 

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:10.110
 there was nothing like doing a gender casino 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.799
 because maybe in Italy people are registering to think of something else 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.120
 because the problem of italy naples with its rubbish with its fans e 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.970
 with the Camorra 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.810
 to me it seems a great thing 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.029
 speculation and exploitation of everything about our city 

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:28.519
 here we are not angels, I am made the body we do not have the halo on our heads 

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:30.400
 absolutely not 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.229
 we were playing a chance 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:36.639
 that of knowing that this was the right opportunity to go 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:37.360
 forward 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.300
 and could look and these damn colorizeit we gave one 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.370
 life at we gave our family de nada d your children your wives 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.520
 we still kill ourselves these people to go 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.530
 still see this time be pointed out green delinquents absolutely 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.590
 no this therefore the pension of the ultrà this the other bell that channel 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.570
 9 open if it is opportune to make you listen
