00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.699 
so this one's not it this one
information<00:02:28.370> so<00:02:29.370> 78<00:02:29.940> megabyte<00:02:30.420> one<00:02:30.660> okay<00:02:31.560> so

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
information so 78 megabyte one okay so

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.550 
information so 78 megabyte one okay so
that<00:02:32.370> one<00:02:32.549> you<00:02:32.579> would<00:02:32.819> have<00:02:32.850> to<00:02:33.260> just<00:02:34.260> delete

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
that one you would have to just delete

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.640 
that one you would have to just delete
it<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:35.450> install<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.480> again<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.109> once<00:02:37.530> you

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
it and install it again and once you

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.080 
it and install it again and once you
finish<00:02:37.829> installing<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.489> and<00:02:38.549> go<00:02:38.670> back<00:02:38.700> in<00:02:38.970> to

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
finish installing it and go back in to

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.849 
finish installing it and go back in to
GTA<00:02:39.450> if<00:02:40.440> that<00:02:40.650> does<00:02:40.799> not<00:02:40.829> work<00:02:41.010> for<00:02:41.459> you<00:02:42.450> either

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
GTA if that does not work for you either

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:45.920 
GTA if that does not work for you either
then<00:02:43.859> the<00:02:44.700> final<00:02:45.060> solution<00:02:45.420> this<00:02:45.569> would<00:02:45.750> what

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
then the final solution this would what

once it turns back on what you need to

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.449 
once it turns back on what you need to
do<00:04:08.049> is<00:04:08.319> go<00:04:08.709> into<00:04:08.860> GTA<00:04:09.280> and<00:04:09.549> it<00:04:09.640> will<00:04:09.760> work<00:04:09.970> so

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
do is go into GTA and it will work so

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.729 
do is go into GTA and it will work so
that's<00:04:12.459> how<00:04:12.640> I<00:04:12.849> fix<00:04:13.180> my<00:04:13.420> GTA<00:04:13.840> line<00:04:14.200> freezing

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
that's how I fix my GTA line freezing

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.550 
that's how I fix my GTA line freezing
like<00:04:15.700> I<00:04:15.880> would<00:04:16.060> join<00:04:16.299> it<00:04:16.510> and<00:04:16.660> then<00:04:16.810> it<00:04:17.440> would

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
like I would join it and then it would

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.120 
like I would join it and then it would
just<00:04:17.590> freeze<00:04:18.310> and<00:04:18.790> had<00:04:18.940> to<00:04:19.060> turn<00:04:19.299> off<00:04:19.419> a<00:04:19.450> ps3<00:04:20.130> I

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
just freeze and had to turn off a ps3 I

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.610 
just freeze and had to turn off a ps3 I
think<00:04:21.579> this<00:04:21.700> would<00:04:21.820> work<00:04:21.850> for<00:04:22.030> Xbox<00:04:22.600> too<00:04:23.080> also

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
think this would work for Xbox too also

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.830 
think this would work for Xbox too also
well<00:04:23.979> as<00:04:24.310> well<00:04:25.030> if<00:04:25.150> you<00:04:25.210> can<00:04:25.330> install<00:04:25.720> an

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
well as well if you can install an

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.990 
well as well if you can install an
update<00:04:26.070> through<00:04:27.070> Xbox<00:04:27.370> even<00:04:27.790> though<00:04:27.880> you're

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
update through Xbox even though you're

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.129 
update through Xbox even though you're
in<00:04:28.030> the<00:04:28.150> latest<00:04:28.389> up<00:04:28.540> they<00:04:28.690> just<00:04:28.720> try<00:04:29.080> to

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
in the latest up they just try to

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.140 
in the latest up they just try to
