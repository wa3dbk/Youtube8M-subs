00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
so that the only way to guarantee this

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.090 
so that the only way to guarantee this
freedom<00:02:33.970> was<00:02:34.960> a<00:02:35.010> constitutional<00:02:36.010> amendment

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
freedom was a constitutional amendment

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.390 
freedom was a constitutional amendment
and<00:02:36.640> that<00:02:37.420> would<00:02:37.630> be<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.870> 13th<00:02:38.260> event<00:02:38.440> here

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
and that would be the 13th event here

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.250 
and that would be the 13th event here
for<00:02:39.820> example<00:02:39.910> all<00:02:40.420> presidents<00:02:40.960> agent<00:02:41.380> office
