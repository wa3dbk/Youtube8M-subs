00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.340
 Yes 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.920
 right 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.500
 ewa 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.400
 I 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.610
 you need 80 grams of butter or 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.560
 margarine 100 g sugar a pinch of salt 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.010
 two 300 grams of wheat flour 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.620
 sweetened teaspoon baking powder and 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:19.900
 150 milliliters of milk 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.520
 Also you need powdered sugar 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.730
 Lemon juice and your food coloring 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.510
 in yellow and chocolate then you have the 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:32.360
 oven before either upper bottom heat 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:34.850
 180 degrees or hot air 160 degrees 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.580
 First, you give the 80 grams of butter 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:41.119
 or margarine in a mixing bowl and 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.820
 she stirs majdic then you grab the 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.700
 Add 100 grams of sugar and stir everything 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.520
 but then the two come to that 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.070
 you should only a quarter not half 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.450
 minute stir around this again better 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.020
 connect and then the dough is on 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.119
 damned and everything and then 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.720
 the second album is also one 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.720
 half a minute 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.160
 then i have a little tip 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.600
 for you I always have something like that 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.860
 edge sets off and you can not 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.110
 then you can lose yourself 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.780
 a knife takes that away and so 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.520
 which then died to make to the mixer 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:22.310
 and then that's back too 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:23.900
 stirred in the middle are 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.520
 now the 300 grams of flour 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.710
 now comes after the painted 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.000
 Teaspoon of baking powder and for that 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.400
 Just take a teaspoon 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.530
 and stroke him like that on the upper band 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.670
 if you can say that and then you have 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.670
 Your already a teaspoon 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.849
 and then you need the 150th 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.000
 milliliters of milk because the ban 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:55.130
 both together if you only have the flour 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.130
 zeug individual rhine park is the day too 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.610
 day no ship as I have the 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.900
 nice and before I have the bun 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.900
 in his blog 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.260
 I have about every muffin in shape 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:34.610
 made two tablespoons 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:36.750
 yes then I have the 18 minutes over 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.150
 then I put in again 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.790
 little tip for you and indeed needed 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.200
 just a stick and that is 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.209
 her in the night in and if 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.250
 something in them remains then the are 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.819
 keep on doing well if nothing else 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.650
 there are limits 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:54.489
 To cool off I have the same way 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:56.170
 Cool parts and then I have 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.939
 the second production finished 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.620
 and then they all become me 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:01.930
 I've decorated that way and not 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:07.689
 wonder there is a part missing the frosting 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:11.099
 and the chocolate made but that is 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:11.099
 unfortunately lost me 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:19.070
 that's why you do not see this here you see 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.070
 once again made it cheap 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.900
 do not be surprised about this other one 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.120
 but remains all possible 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:16.460
 prevented cost traps 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.460
 if I would say to take
