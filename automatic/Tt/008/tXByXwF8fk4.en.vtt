00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.059
 interesting novelty nice to show 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:16.139
 but actually comes up with this new version 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:20.550
 the dl in 4.1.2 has awakened me a lot in 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.380
 A lot of attention and I really found 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.730
 Great, let's go there first of all. 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:31.230
 Let's do this version here to see the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.030
 that says about it if you really know if 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.890
 It is good or have not for those who do not know 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.610
 sound and I scored 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.040
 he makes a reference and tests the 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.340
 speed of the web processor anyway 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.420
 it average speed of everything related 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.410
 to android does in the end it gives a note 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.920
 and compare with other equipment 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.710
 Boy, I really like this environment. 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.739
 marketing because it really does 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.719
 several to check and so I'll see the 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:07.320
 old in action and then in the end we 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:09.540
 let's see what it will take in the belly 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.390
 and he 's showing that he's carrying it 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.659
 up almost at the end and then it starts 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.659
 the test 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.149
 and we're gone 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:41.970
 remembering that it takes is 4 to 6 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.970
 minutes to take the test 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:24.170
 we are 80% of the test already finished 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:09.480
