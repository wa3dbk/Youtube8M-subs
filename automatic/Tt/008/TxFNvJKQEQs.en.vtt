00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.400
 another characteristic shared by all 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.100
 these schools is the way 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.259
 they promote permanently the 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.439
 participation of parents 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:20.859
 in the education of their children together 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:25.080
 they work to achieve the goals because 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:25.080
 not enough to send them to school 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.369
 not always the process of meetings and 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.960
 every out teacher also calls us 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.570
 so that parents know because 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.940
 there are times when parents are not like that 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.649
 you know them, you know how children are 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.270
 we think it's okay that it's okay 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.710
 multiple these problems how are they going 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.820
 going is we do not know then for this 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.410
 I also thank the professor that 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.449
 has the modality and confidence of 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.890
 get to parents and we try to take out 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:54.020
 go ahead in the dream together with them 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.380
 in the house we teach here 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.400
 you see that the teachers 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:06.390
 I can help my son like others 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.390
 will be in an I up to 2 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.120
 overcoming numerous obstacles and 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.190
 needs these schools have obtained 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.640
 encouraging results and they are achieving 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.750
 that your children learn what is expected 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.970
 in the second degree 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.400
 these difficulties obstacles do not we 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.160
 brake 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.990
 but rather are how to age one 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.060
 stumbling blocks are a stepping stone for 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.490
 keep climbing but they do not stop you 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.400
 I think that a teacher from the coast 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.870
 saw the jungle of the hill of the city or 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.580
 wherever you can not stop 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.530
 with the resources if we would not have 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.900
 teachers in Peru we take advantage of what 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:52.380
 we have at hand and we get the most 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.380
 profit the amounts 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:00.300
 and see if we want to put everything together in one 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.300
 only daily pen 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.200
 online and took the exam 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.450
 they saw us forced 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.610
 all right 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.850
 in the first two years of school 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.600
 acquires the essential skills for 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.300
 all future learning and more is a 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:39.290
 important school stage that has to 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:42.410
 be addressed with priority for that reason 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.870
 evaluations become effective 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.900
 tool to measure learning 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.470
 of our children and to know how much 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:54.440
 progresses and where it should be improved and so 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.530
 we will be able to progress and give hundreds of 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.540
 thousands of Peruvian children an education of 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.600
 quality that helps them grow and 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:06.010
 achieve new goals as people and 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.010
 as citizens
