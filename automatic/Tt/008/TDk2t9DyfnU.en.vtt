in<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.810> top<00:01:09.990> four<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:11.030> effort<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.180> really

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
in the top four and effort is really

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.120

gonna<00:01:12.540> have<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.689> tough<00:01:13.350> job<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.590> fight<00:01:13.860> against

him<00:01:14.310> especially<00:01:14.939> on<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.299> man<00:01:15.420> plasma<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.170> do

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
him especially on this man plasma I do

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.410 
him especially on this man plasma I do
think<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.100> terran<00:01:17.790> favored<00:01:18.150> against

think it is terran favored against

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.870 
think it is terran favored against
pretty<00:01:19.290> much<00:01:19.439> any<00:01:19.650> race<00:01:19.920> really<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.610> Terran

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
pretty much any race really the Terran

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.070 
pretty much any race really the Terran
could<00:01:21.030> really<00:01:21.150> hold<00:01:21.420> their<00:01:21.540> main<00:01:21.689> base<00:01:21.810> quite

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
could really hold their main base quite

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.240 
could really hold their main base quite
easily<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.710> be<00:01:23.700> able<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.960> use<00:01:24.960> those<00:01:25.170> um<00:01:25.409> use

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
easily and be able to use those um use

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.469 
easily and be able to use those um use

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
can defend fairly easily there are two

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.390 
can defend fairly easily there are two
natural<00:01:39.329> expansions<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.860> thing<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.159> um

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
natural expansions and the thing is um

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.460 
natural expansions and the thing is um
the<00:01:41.729> one<00:01:41.909> thing<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.329> guess<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:43.079> makes<00:01:43.350> it

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
the one thing that I guess it makes it

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.280 
the one thing that I guess it makes it
slightly<00:01:43.890> better<00:01:44.159> for<00:01:44.490> effort<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.479> flash

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
slightly better for effort is that flash

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.080 
slightly better for effort is that flash
as<00:01:46.590> medic<00:01:47.130> marines<00:01:47.369> will<00:01:47.549> take<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.759> while<00:01:48.030> to

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
as medic marines will take a while to

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.179 
as medic marines will take a while to
destroy<00:01:48.780> those<00:01:48.930> lurker<00:01:49.290> eggs<00:01:49.439> given<00:01:50.100> how

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
destroy those lurker eggs given how

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.819 
destroy those lurker eggs given how
little<00:01:50.310> damage<00:01:50.579> they<00:01:50.909> do<00:01:50.970> against<00:01:51.479> them<00:01:51.829> with

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
little damage they do against them with

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.310 
little damage they do against them with
each<00:01:53.009> shot<00:01:53.280> because<00:01:53.549> of<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.790> high<00:01:53.909> armor<00:01:54.320> the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
each shot because of the high armor the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.910 
each shot because of the high armor the
lurker<00:01:55.590> eggs

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
lurker eggs

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.560 
lurker eggs
I'm<00:01:56.490> gonna<00:01:56.670> guess<00:01:56.909> though<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.270> effort

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
I'm gonna guess though that effort

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.510 
I'm gonna guess though that effort
probably<00:01:58.409> will<00:01:58.560> go<00:01:58.680> lurker<00:01:58.920> first<00:01:59.310> that's

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
probably will go lurker first that's

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.280 
probably will go lurker first that's
pretty<00:01:59.759> my<00:01:59.880> guess<00:02:00.149> although<00:02:00.810> Miller's<00:02:01.110> first

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
pretty my guess although Miller's first

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.990 
pretty my guess although Miller's first
certainly<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.890> not<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.340> obviously<00:02:02.729> because

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
certainly is not that obviously because

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.969 
certainly is not that obviously because
this<00:02:03.119> map<00:02:03.299> starts<00:02:03.540> off<00:02:03.780> as<00:02:03.930> an<00:02:04.020> island<00:02:04.170> but<00:02:04.680> to

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
this map starts off as an island but to

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.069 
this map starts off as an island but to
defend<00:02:05.250> against<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:06.149> really<00:02:06.600> concerted

automatic marine push especially from
some<00:02:09.390> hidden<00:02:09.690> angle<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.229> really<00:02:10.619> need

some hidden angle you really need

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.949 
some hidden angle you really need
lurkers<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.370> also<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.510> advantage<00:02:12.870> of

lurkers and also the advantage of
lurkers<00:02:13.290> could

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
lurkers could

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.770 
lurkers could
through<00:02:13.950> those<00:02:14.100> lurker<00:02:15.030> eggs<00:02:15.180> quite<00:02:15.570> easily

hatchery<00:02:21.390> here<00:02:21.570> from<00:02:21.900> effort<00:02:22.320> a<00:02:22.470> very

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
hatchery here from effort a very

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.410 
hatchery here from effort a very
standard<00:02:23.070> build<00:02:23.250> obviously<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.820> think<00:02:24.240> really

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
standard build obviously I think really

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.410 
standard build obviously I think really
the<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.810> best<00:02:24.990> build<00:02:25.230> on<00:02:25.350> this<00:02:25.470> map<00:02:26.150> with<00:02:27.150> zerg

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
the the best build on this map with zerg

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.600 
the the best build on this map with zerg
against<00:02:27.750> pretty<00:02:27.960> much<00:02:28.110> any<00:02:28.290> race<00:02:28.500> other<00:02:29.340> in

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
against pretty much any race other in

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
against pretty much any race other in
Zurich<00:02:29.850> maybe<00:02:30.770> and<00:02:31.910> flash<00:02:32.910> now<00:02:33.180> scouting

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
Zurich maybe and flash now scouting

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.080 
Zurich maybe and flash now scouting
looks<00:02:34.290> taking<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.560> wrong<00:02:34.710> direction<00:02:35.090> but

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
looks taking the wrong direction but

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.750 
looks taking the wrong direction but
both<00:02:36.690> players<00:02:36.870> will<00:02:37.200> be<00:02:37.320> scouting<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:38.070> at<00:02:38.640> the

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
both players will be scouting the at the

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.460 
both players will be scouting the at the
second<00:02:39.090> time<00:02:39.210> I<00:02:39.240> guess<00:02:42.020> it's<00:02:43.020> gonna<00:02:43.170> come<00:02:43.440> down

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
second time I guess it's gonna come down

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.500 
second time I guess it's gonna come down
also<00:02:43.830> I<00:02:44.010> think<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.340> how<00:02:44.670> much<00:02:44.820> map<00:02:45.060> knowledge

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
also I think to how much map knowledge

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.090 
also I think to how much map knowledge
both<00:02:45.960> players<00:02:46.230> have<00:02:46.350> and<00:02:46.710> effort<00:02:46.980> actually

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
both players have and effort actually

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.650 
both players have and effort actually
going<00:02:47.340> for<00:02:47.490> a<00:02:47.580> double<00:02:47.760> expand<00:02:48.270> before

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
going for a double expand before

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.720 
going for a double expand before
spawning<00:02:49.200> pool<00:02:49.530> so<00:02:50.070> going<00:02:50.310> for<00:02:50.520> three

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
spawning pool so going for three

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:51.980 
spawning pool so going for three
hatcheries<00:02:51.150> before<00:02:51.480> spawning<00:02:51.720> pool

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
hatcheries before spawning pool

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.510 
hatcheries before spawning pool
interesting<00:02:52.440> play<00:02:52.620> there<00:02:52.800> and<00:02:52.950> flash

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
interesting play there and flash

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.790 
interesting play there and flash
actually<00:02:53.790> well<00:02:54.450> what<00:02:54.750> is<00:02:54.870> flash<00:02:55.050> doing<00:02:55.500> flash

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
actually well what is flash doing flash

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.800 
actually well what is flash doing flash
is<00:02:56.040> built<00:02:56.310> I<00:02:56.490> thought<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.150> was<00:02:57.270> a<00:02:57.300> scouting

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
is built I thought that was a scouting

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.010 
is built I thought that was a scouting
SCV<00:02:58.290> but<00:02:58.530> no<00:02:58.800> flash<00:02:59.520> has<00:02:59.790> built<00:03:00.090> a<00:03:00.300> proxy

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
SCV but no flash has built a proxy

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.710 
SCV but no flash has built a proxy
factory<00:03:01.680> at<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.460> five<00:03:02.640> o'clock<00:03:02.940> location<00:03:03.540> and

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
factory at the five o'clock location and

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.530 
factory at the five o'clock location and
this<00:03:03.900> is<00:03:04.080> why<00:03:04.260> flash<00:03:04.650> is<00:03:04.950> flash<00:03:05.520> flashes<00:03:06.390> is

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
this is why flash is flash flashes is

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.480 
this is why flash is flash flashes is
absolutely<00:03:07.020> brilliant<00:03:07.410> but<00:03:07.530> will<00:03:08.070> effort

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
absolutely brilliant but will effort

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.490 
absolutely brilliant but will effort
will<00:03:09.030> effort<00:03:09.420> sense<00:03:09.780> this<00:03:10.020> that's<00:03:10.230> gonna<00:03:10.350> be<00:03:10.440> a

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
will effort sense this that's gonna be a

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.590 
will effort sense this that's gonna be a
big<00:03:10.680> question<00:03:11.070> maybe<00:03:11.250> flash<00:03:11.730> is<00:03:11.970> gonna<00:03:12.090> fake

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
big question maybe flash is gonna fake

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.810 
big question maybe flash is gonna fake
like<00:03:13.140> he's<00:03:13.290> gonna<00:03:13.470> go<00:03:13.680> for<00:03:13.890> a<00:03:13.920> fast<00:03:14.430> expand

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
like he's gonna go for a fast expand

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.580 
like he's gonna go for a fast expand
here<00:03:15.000> by<00:03:15.180> building<00:03:15.540> that<00:03:15.630> one<00:03:15.810> at<00:03:16.020> bringing

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
here by building that one at bringing

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.100 
here by building that one at bringing
that<00:03:16.770> one<00:03:16.860> SUV<00:03:17.340> south<00:03:17.630> towards<00:03:18.630> his<00:03:18.780> natural

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
that one SUV south towards his natural

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.140 
that one SUV south towards his natural
expansion<00:03:19.560> if<00:03:19.770> he<00:03:20.100> can<00:03:20.280> fake<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:20.640> natural

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
expansion if he can fake the natural

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.180 
expansion if he can fake the natural
expansion<00:03:21.600> then<00:03:21.720> effort<00:03:22.110> will<00:03:22.440> certainly<00:03:23.010> not

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
expansion then effort will certainly not

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.860 
expansion then effort will certainly not
be<00:03:23.310> prepared<00:03:23.520> for<00:03:23.850> whatever<00:03:24.060> flash<00:03:24.420> is<00:03:24.600> coming

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
be prepared for whatever flash is coming

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.540 
be prepared for whatever flash is coming
from<00:03:24.960> that<00:03:25.050> factory<00:03:25.620> maybe<00:03:26.010> flash<00:03:26.280> was<00:03:26.430> gonna

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
from that factory maybe flash was gonna

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.070 
from that factory maybe flash was gonna
go<00:03:26.670> for<00:03:26.820> a<00:03:26.880> quick<00:03:26.910> tanks<00:03:27.540> or<00:03:27.660> perhaps<00:03:27.810> have

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
go for a quick tanks or perhaps have

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.380 
go for a quick tanks or perhaps have
quixtar<00:03:28.620> pours<00:03:28.890> even<00:03:29.190> possible<00:03:29.610> from<00:03:30.360> that

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
quixtar pours even possible from that

quixtar pours even possible from that
proxy<00:03:30.870> location<00:03:31.320> we'll<00:03:31.410> have<00:03:31.500> to<00:03:31.590> see

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
proxy location we'll have to see

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.620

because<00:03:32.490> vulture<00:03:32.850> is<00:03:32.910> still<00:03:33.210> gonna<00:03:33.360> have<00:03:33.540> to

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
because vulture is still gonna have to

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:34.940 
because vulture is still gonna have to
break<00:03:33.810> through<00:03:33.990> one<00:03:34.170> of<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.350> paths<00:03:34.560> in<00:03:34.770> order

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
to get into the base so I'm not sure if

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.420 
to get into the base so I'm not sure if
vultures<00:03:36.840> are<00:03:36.960> gonna<00:03:37.050> be<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.350> plan<00:03:37.950> here<00:03:38.250> but

to<00:03:46.530> be<00:03:46.620> safer<00:03:47.040> I<00:03:47.190> think<00:03:47.580> the<00:03:47.670> factory<00:03:48.000> was<00:03:48.150> just

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
to be safer I think the factory was just

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.690 
to be safer I think the factory was just
built<00:03:48.480> there<00:03:48.660> to<00:03:48.900> to<00:03:49.620> build<00:03:49.800> vultures<00:03:50.550> as

built there to to build vultures as
we're<00:03:50.880> seeing<00:03:51.090> right<00:03:51.210> now<00:03:51.270> and<00:03:51.630> all<00:03:51.810> men

continued<00:03:55.290> his<00:03:55.440> scouting<00:03:55.740> pattern<00:03:56.250> and

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
continued his scouting pattern and

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.300 
continued his scouting pattern and
managed<00:03:56.940> to<00:03:56.970> discover<00:03:57.300> that<00:03:57.720> a<00:03:57.750> hidden

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
factory there and he's going to know

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.970 
factory there and he's going to know
that<00:04:00.630> some<00:04:00.840> sort<00:04:01.050> of<00:04:01.080> tech<00:04:01.290> rush<00:04:01.500> is<00:04:01.650> coming

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
that some sort of tech rush is coming

that some sort of tech rush is coming
the<00:04:02.340> factory<00:04:02.700> is<00:04:02.760> now<00:04:02.880> lifted<00:04:03.150> so<00:04:03.420> no<00:04:03.630> more

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
the factory is now lifted so no more

the factory is now lifted so no more
vultures<00:04:04.140> gonna<00:04:04.380> be<00:04:04.440> produced<00:04:04.740> uh-huh<00:04:05.160> but

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
vultures gonna be produced uh-huh but

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
those drones are gonna get pelted at by

those drones are gonna get pelted at by
that<00:04:07.380> vulture<00:04:08.130> on<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.790> high<00:04:08.940> ground<00:04:08.970> there

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
that vulture on the high ground there

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.760 
that vulture on the high ground there
and<00:04:09.420> Oh<00:04:09.630> looks<00:04:09.959> like<00:04:10.050> the<00:04:10.170> vulture<00:04:10.470> actually

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
and Oh looks like the vulture actually

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.570 
and Oh looks like the vulture actually
landing<00:04:11.580> inside<00:04:12.030> of<00:04:12.380> inside<00:04:13.380> of<00:04:14.010> effort<00:04:14.370> space

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
landing inside of inside of effort space

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:15.800 
landing inside of inside of effort space
that's<00:04:14.850> something<00:04:15.090> I<00:04:15.150> obviously<00:04:15.420> should<00:04:15.720> have

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
that's something I obviously should have

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.630 
that's something I obviously should have
noted<00:04:16.140> was<00:04:16.290> possible<00:04:16.709> but<00:04:16.920> um<00:04:17.070> looks<00:04:17.520> like

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
noted was possible but um looks like

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.220 
noted was possible but um looks like
that<00:04:17.820> Serbians<00:04:18.540> are<00:04:18.570> gonna<00:04:18.720> be<00:04:18.810> pounding<00:04:18.959> away

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
that Serbians are gonna be pounding away

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.170 
that Serbians are gonna be pounding away
well<00:04:19.500> that<00:04:19.620> vulture<00:04:19.859> have<00:04:20.100> ranged<00:04:20.580> to<00:04:20.880> protect

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
well that vulture have ranged to protect

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.550 
well that vulture have ranged to protect
that<00:04:21.299> factory<00:04:21.750> that<00:04:21.840> is<00:04:22.080> a<00:04:22.109> very<00:04:22.410> good

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
that factory that is a very good

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.630 
that factory that is a very good
question<00:04:22.770> I'm<00:04:23.100> not<00:04:23.160> sure<00:04:23.280> if<00:04:23.460> they're<00:04:23.580> gonna

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
question I'm not sure if they're gonna

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.640 
question I'm not sure if they're gonna
have<00:04:23.760> range<00:04:24.030> but<00:04:24.270> no<00:04:24.960> it<00:04:25.080> looks<00:04:25.229> like<00:04:25.350> the<00:04:25.470> one

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
have range but no it looks like the one

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.140 
have range but no it looks like the one
on<00:04:25.860> the<00:04:26.100> cliff<00:04:26.340> doesn't<00:04:26.640> have<00:04:26.729> range<00:04:26.940> but

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
on the cliff doesn't have range but

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.629 
on the cliff doesn't have range but
another

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
another

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.489 
another
we'll<00:04:27.939> be<00:04:28.030> coming<00:04:28.210> out<00:04:28.389> shortly<00:04:28.419> and<00:04:29.020> it<00:04:29.349> looks

00:04:29.489 --> 00:04:29.499 
we'll be coming out shortly and it looks

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:31.529 
we'll be coming out shortly and it looks
like<00:04:29.560> the<00:04:29.800> Serbians<00:04:30.219> are<00:04:30.310> trying<00:04:30.520> to<00:04:30.610> try<00:04:31.479> to

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:31.539 
like the Serbians are trying to try to

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:33.420 
like the Serbians are trying to try to
trap<00:04:31.780> it<00:04:31.930> but<00:04:32.080> no<00:04:32.319> flash<00:04:32.770> is<00:04:32.979> too<00:04:33.159> good<00:04:33.370> for

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
trap it but no flash is too good for

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.839 
trap it but no flash is too good for
that

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:33.849 
that

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:36.269 
that
now<00:04:34.090> one<00:04:34.509> vote<00:04:35.469> trick<00:04:35.710> should<00:04:35.949> be<00:04:36.069> able<00:04:36.219> to

00:04:36.269 --> 00:04:36.279 
now one vote trick should be able to

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:37.860 
now one vote trick should be able to
take<00:04:36.370> down<00:04:36.550> all<00:04:36.729> these<00:04:36.909> circling<00:04:37.300> if<00:04:37.509> flash

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
take down all these circling if flash

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.719 
take down all these circling if flash
micro<00:04:38.379> is<00:04:38.499> right<00:04:38.740> and<00:04:38.949> flash<00:04:39.219> of<00:04:39.400> course<00:04:39.610> in

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
micro is right and flash of course in

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.149 
micro is right and flash of course in
the<00:04:39.789> master<00:04:40.240> micro<00:04:40.659> an<00:04:40.840> effort<00:04:41.349> already<00:04:41.740> is

00:04:42.149 --> 00:04:42.159 
the master micro an effort already is

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:44.399 
the master micro an effort already is
behind<00:04:42.639> in<00:04:42.819> this<00:04:42.939> game<00:04:43.150> he's<00:04:43.900> forced<00:04:44.199> to<00:04:44.259> build

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:44.409 
behind in this game he's forced to build

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:45.899 
behind in this game he's forced to build
that<00:04:44.529> hydras<00:04:44.979> 10<00:04:45.129> earlier<00:04:45.460> than<00:04:45.610> he<00:04:45.759> would

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:45.909 
that hydras 10 earlier than he would

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:48.209 
that hydras 10 earlier than he would
have<00:04:45.999> wanted<00:04:46.240> to<00:04:46.449> perhaps<00:04:47.349> he<00:04:47.469> does<00:04:47.800> suspect

00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:48.219 
have wanted to perhaps he does suspect

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:50.580 
have wanted to perhaps he does suspect
some<00:04:48.400> sort<00:04:48.639> of<00:04:48.819> a<00:04:48.879> wraith<00:04:49.870> bill<00:04:50.139> coming<00:04:50.499> up

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
some sort of a wraith bill coming up

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.890 
some sort of a wraith bill coming up
though<00:04:50.770> because<00:04:51.009> he<00:04:51.879> snows<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:52.389> factory<00:04:52.749> was

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
though because he snows the factory was

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.510 
though because he snows the factory was
lifted<00:04:53.319> so<00:04:53.469> no<00:04:53.710> more<00:04:53.860> factory<00:04:54.189> units<00:04:54.430> are

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
lifted so no more factory units are

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.920 
lifted so no more factory units are
possible<00:04:54.879> obviously<00:04:55.180> so<00:04:55.330> a<00:04:55.360> wraith<00:04:55.569> build<00:04:55.840> is

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
possible obviously so a wraith build is

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.480 
possible obviously so a wraith build is
certainly<00:04:56.139> possible<00:04:56.349> so<00:04:56.919> he<00:04:57.039> knows<00:04:57.249> he<00:04:57.400> needs

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
certainly possible so he knows he needs

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.279 
certainly possible so he knows he needs
to<00:04:57.580> get<00:04:57.669> those<00:04:57.849> hydraulics<00:04:58.389> up<00:04:58.539> and<00:04:58.719> that<00:04:59.169> the

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 
to get those hydraulics up and that the

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:00.779 
to get those hydraulics up and that the
vulture<00:04:59.650> is<00:04:59.770> still<00:05:00.099> alive<00:05:00.370> though<00:05:00.550> after

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
vulture is still alive though after

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:02.790 
vulture is still alive though after
dispatching<00:05:00.969> all<00:05:01.419> those<00:05:01.599> zerglings<00:05:02.080> and<00:05:02.349> now

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
dispatching all those zerglings and now

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.290 
dispatching all those zerglings and now
he<00:05:02.860> can't<00:05:03.250> go<00:05:03.340> around<00:05:03.460> and<00:05:03.729> kill<00:05:04.000> off<00:05:04.150> any

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
he can't go around and kill off any

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.790 
he can't go around and kill off any
drone<00:05:04.750> that<00:05:04.870> dares<00:05:05.110> to<00:05:05.199> come<00:05:05.379> out<00:05:05.500> of<00:05:05.620> the<00:05:05.680> main

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.249 
drone that dares to come out of the main
base<00:05:06.069> so<00:05:06.520> basically<00:05:07.000> despite<00:05:07.870> the<00:05:08.020> double

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:08.259

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:11.249 
base so basically despite the double
expand<00:05:08.620> for<00:05:09.460> now<00:05:09.639> effort<00:05:10.150> is<00:05:10.270> tied<00:05:10.659> in<00:05:10.900> to<00:05:11.080> is

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259

basically pinned into his main bases is

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.879 
basically pinned into his main bases is
absolutely<00:05:13.629> terrible<00:05:13.900> for<00:05:14.110> effort<00:05:14.379> and<00:05:14.529> this

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:14.889 
absolutely terrible for effort and this

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:17.790 
absolutely terrible for effort and this
really<00:05:15.129> shows<00:05:15.400> you<00:05:15.610> how<00:05:15.789> creative<00:05:16.240> flashes<00:05:16.870> he

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
really shows you how creative flashes he

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.589 
really shows you how creative flashes he
is<00:05:17.949> a<00:05:17.979> master<00:05:18.430> of<00:05:18.460> the<00:05:18.639> medic<00:05:18.879> Marines<00:05:19.210> really

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599 
is a master of the medic Marines really

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:22.439 
is a master of the medic Marines really
and<00:05:19.810> he<00:05:20.189> still<00:05:21.189> is<00:05:21.219> showing<00:05:21.849> himself<00:05:21.969> he<00:05:22.270> can

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:22.449 
and he still is showing himself he can

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:24.089 
and he still is showing himself he can
just<00:05:22.839> change<00:05:23.169> his<00:05:23.319> plans<00:05:23.560> at<00:05:23.740> any<00:05:23.889> given

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:24.099 
just change his plans at any given

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:25.950 
just change his plans at any given
moment<00:05:24.279> now<00:05:24.669> the<00:05:24.729> rates<00:05:25.089> are<00:05:25.270> out<00:05:25.389> now<00:05:25.900> the

moment now the rates are out now the

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.779 
moment now the rates are out now the
hand<00:05:26.319> is<00:05:26.469> finally<00:05:26.770> revealed<00:05:26.949> and<00:05:27.490> I<00:05:27.729> don't

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:27.789 
hand is finally revealed and I don't

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:29.339 
hand is finally revealed and I don't
know<00:05:28.060> what<00:05:28.360> effort<00:05:28.629> can<00:05:28.719> do<00:05:28.839> about<00:05:29.050> this<00:05:29.199> he

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:29.349 
know what effort can do about this he

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:31.260 
know what effort can do about this he
does<00:05:29.529> not<00:05:29.710> have<00:05:29.949> enough<00:05:30.219> resources<00:05:30.669> to<00:05:31.089> be<00:05:31.180> a

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
does not have enough resources to be a

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.300 
does not have enough resources to be a
handless<00:05:31.750> I<00:05:31.900> think<00:05:32.110> mining<00:05:32.800> off<00:05:32.889> of<00:05:33.009> just<00:05:33.129> his

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
handless I think mining off of just his

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.469 
handless I think mining off of just his
main<00:05:33.490> base<00:05:34.319> and<00:05:36.029> he's<00:05:37.029> just<00:05:37.150> getting<00:05:37.389> that

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
main base and he's just getting that

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:39.659 
main base and he's just getting that
scouted<00:05:37.930> to<00:05:38.020> confirm<00:05:38.469> his<00:05:38.710> suspicions<00:05:39.189> and<00:05:39.370> oh

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669 
scouted to confirm his suspicions and oh

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:42.589 
scouted to confirm his suspicions and oh
now<00:05:40.210> to<00:05:40.270> rates<00:05:40.870> in<00:05:41.080> the<00:05:41.319> mineral<00:05:41.620> line<00:05:41.830> for

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:42.599 
now to rates in the mineral line for

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:45.329 
now to rates in the mineral line for
form<00:05:43.599> flash<00:05:44.080> and<00:05:44.409> the<00:05:44.560> effort<00:05:44.919> is<00:05:45.009> gonna<00:05:45.129> be<00:05:45.279> in

00:05:45.329 --> 00:05:45.339 
form flash and the effort is gonna be in

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:46.619 
form flash and the effort is gonna be in
huge<00:05:45.699> trouble<00:05:45.789> here<00:05:46.210> looks<00:05:46.389> like<00:05:46.449> he's

00:05:46.619 --> 00:05:46.629 
huge trouble here looks like he's

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:48.420 
huge trouble here looks like he's
placing<00:05:46.870> an<00:05:47.229> evolution<00:05:47.830> chamber<00:05:48.009> I<00:05:48.159> believe

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
placing an evolution chamber I believe

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:49.829 
placing an evolution chamber I believe
he's<00:05:48.879> been<00:05:49.029> trying<00:05:49.300> to<00:05:49.330> build<00:05:49.479> at<00:05:49.569> spore

00:05:49.829 --> 00:05:49.839 
he's been trying to build at spore

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:51.389 
he's been trying to build at spore
colony<00:05:50.169> because<00:05:50.379> he<00:05:50.469> no<00:05:50.620> cloak<00:05:50.949> is<00:05:51.129> probably

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:51.399 
colony because he no cloak is probably

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:53.010 
colony because he no cloak is probably
gonna<00:05:51.520> be<00:05:51.580> up<00:05:51.669> very<00:05:51.969> soon<00:05:52.210> and<00:05:52.419> of<00:05:52.779> course

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
gonna be up very soon and of course
