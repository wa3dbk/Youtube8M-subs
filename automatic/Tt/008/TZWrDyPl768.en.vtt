 little men we are glad you 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:30.010
 welcomes to the armory site 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:33.280
 Petrovich workshop which makes for 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.370
 us this weapon with great love 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.470
 the question we would like today 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.580
 consider the assembly concerns this 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.059
 weapons 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:45.820
 today we will consider assembly 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:50.970
 ppsh machine which is designed to 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:53.589
 children from the age of 5 about here and 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.860
 will help us in this matter 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:59.820
 our expert nikita who is 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:05.500
 our most important expert 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:07.270
 appraiser of our production efforts 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.860
 of this weapon 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:15.690
 so back to the disassembly hello 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:21.940
 today we collect automaton we went 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:25.180
 take the butt then paste here 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.400
 this is the hole so come on show 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.190
 well hole up 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:36.550
 see we see the hole thanks but also 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:40.650
 insert disk after you 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:44.800
 you can gather him 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:48.510
 if you don't disassemble it automatically 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:52.600
 you can just stick it but if you 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:57.730
 still for the game as a constructor tom 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:00.880
 You can basically twist the fishing open 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:03.490
 Please, show us but that's kind of two 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:07.180
 screw up to them need a little unscrew 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:16.650
 so that having created an emphasis rule yes 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:20.160
 thanks we take the trunk 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.970
 show top100 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:31.160
 berzin yes what we put in there 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:31.160
 This right here, this guide 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:40.470
 stuck then it can be a little bit 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:42.660
 pliers makes a little bit no 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:47.490
 converges until it can be fixed dax 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:52.110
 to merchants with pliers we insert into it 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:54.990
 hole then take note 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.450
 here is when you will collect the machine 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.540
 here it will be necessary to shoot it 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:08.070
 pimp 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:12.270
 plays the role of the bag and the sight he he like 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:19.080
 sight and how mounting it strengthens the whole 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:24.590
 automatic and therefore it is not completely all 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.590
 count it 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.550
 it is necessary for spinning without 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.810
 and without much effort 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.890
 Well, to keep at the same time 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:42.180
 unaddressed but it also 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:46.140
 then stop shut close 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.980
 yes show that there the experience can be 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.980
 was aiming 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:59.720
 do we leave this one here 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:02.630
 as I say already she plays the role of the trigger 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:08.090
 we insert this wide is obtained 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:13.400
 like a belt lesson 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:24.830
 It turned out not disassembled and let's 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:27.050
 let us look at the view were affordable 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:47.170
 see all the operations you need 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:50.810
 hold the only thing that can be with 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:53.300
 im wrong it can be twisted a 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.610
 It may be to go with the other hand, if 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.800
 can't see right how are you going 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:04.850
 this let's hit this side is not like this 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:12.850
 wait a second, it was necessary to turn 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:17.090
 apparently fix you now like this all 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:19.910
 secured machine gathered that is it 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.400
 can make elementary kids already with 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:26.330
 the age of five to use 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:29.060
 which tool is simple enough 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.160
 assembly and at the same time developing in 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:35.090
 child 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:37.790
 ingenuity ingenuity and others 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.650
 local quality Nikita thank you 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.840
 great 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:46.540
 Itâ€™s time to come 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.540
