located syndrome today we take a look at

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.749 
located syndrome today we take a look at
the<00:00:02.820> event<00:00:03.480> for<00:00:03.810> fallen<00:00:04.259> surgeons<00:00:04.759> this

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
the event for fallen surgeons this

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.519 
the event for fallen surgeons this
grantman<00:00:06.270> when<00:00:06.660> I<00:00:06.690> first<00:00:06.960> came<00:00:07.109> out<00:00:07.259> with<00:00:07.470> a

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
grantman when I first came out with a

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.879 
grantman when I first came out with a
motor<00:00:07.770> spring<00:00:08.220> update<00:00:08.840> it<00:00:09.840> was<00:00:10.050> so<00:00:10.380> easy<00:00:10.620> to

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
motor spring update it was so easy to

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.089 
motor spring update it was so easy to
manage<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.429> recoil<00:00:11.849> if<00:00:12.120> you<00:00:12.269> watch<00:00:12.450> my<00:00:12.660> video

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:13.099 
manage the recoil if you watch my video

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.770 
manage the recoil if you watch my video
demonstrate<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.219> recoil<00:00:14.639> it<00:00:14.849> was<00:00:15.030> so<00:00:15.330> easy<00:00:15.570> to

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
demonstrate the recoil it was so easy to

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.529 
demonstrate the recoil it was so easy to
manage<00:00:15.990> it<00:00:16.230> with<00:00:16.379> medium<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:16.770> long<00:00:17.010> ranges

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539 
manage it with medium and long ranges

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.960 
manage it with medium and long ranges
then<00:00:18.539> they<00:00:19.080> patched<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.680> they<00:00:20.130> increased<00:00:20.670> the

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
then they patched it they increased the

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.849 
then they patched it they increased the
recoil<00:00:21.390> for<00:00:21.660> this<00:00:21.810> weapon<00:00:22.020> with<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.380> new<00:00:22.560> patch

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
recoil for this weapon with a new patch

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.660 
recoil for this weapon with a new patch
and<00:00:23.250> now<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:24.090> made<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> comparison<00:00:25.340> the<00:00:26.340> egg-cam

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
and now I made a comparison the egg-cam

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.529 
and now I made a comparison the egg-cam
the<00:00:27.330> vertical<00:00:27.810> recoil<00:00:27.930> is<00:00:28.730> 2.15<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.910> maximum

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
the vertical recoil is 2.15 the maximum

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.870 
the vertical recoil is 2.15 the maximum
that<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.840> can<00:00:30.929> reach<00:00:31.320> for<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.830> recoil<00:00:32.160> while

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
that you can reach for the recoil while

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.569 
that you can reach for the recoil while
with<00:00:33.059> this<00:00:33.270> weapon<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:34.110> minimum<00:00:35.070> vertical

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
with this weapon the minimum vertical

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.020 
with this weapon the minimum vertical
recoil<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:36.410> 2.15<00:00:37.410> which<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.280> maximum<00:00:38.820> for

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
recoil is 2.15 which is the maximum for

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.479 
recoil is 2.15 which is the maximum for
the<00:00:39.149> heck<00:00:39.329> ahem<00:00:39.660> that's<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.860> really<00:00:41.340> big

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
the heck ahem that's a really big

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.810 
the heck ahem that's a really big
difference<00:00:41.760> guys<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.690> goes<00:00:42.870> up<00:00:43.079> up<00:00:43.260> to

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
difference guys and it goes up up to

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.389 
difference guys and it goes up up to
2.40<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.570> gun<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.410> vertical<00:00:46.860> recoil<00:00:46.980> is

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
2.40 so this gun the vertical recoil is

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.819 
2.40 so this gun the vertical recoil is
the<00:00:47.430> hardest<00:00:48.059> one<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.450> manage<00:00:48.960> for<00:00:49.200> holy<00:00:49.469> guns

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
the hardest one to manage for holy guns

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.060 
the hardest one to manage for holy guns
so<00:00:50.719> it<00:00:51.719> changed<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.199> approach<00:00:52.410> for<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.890> gun

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
so it changed the approach for the gun

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.939 
so it changed the approach for the gun
completely<00:00:53.930> so<00:00:54.930> my<00:00:55.140> advice<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.649> would<00:00:55.739> want

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
completely so my advice you would want

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.970 
completely so my advice you would want
to<00:00:55.980> use<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.340> gun<00:00:56.840> taking<00:00:57.840> consideration<00:00:58.350> if

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
to use this gun taking consideration if

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.400 
to use this gun taking consideration if
you're<00:00:59.309> trying<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.730> stand<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.420> shoot<00:01:00.660> if<00:01:01.170> you

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
you're trying to stand and shoot if you

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.740 
you're trying to stand and shoot if you
miss<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.920> first<00:01:01.949> bar<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.879> first<00:01:03.120> shot

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
miss the first bar so the first shot

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.350 
miss the first bar so the first shot
good<00:01:04.260> luck<00:01:04.589> killing<00:01:05.519> on<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.850> second<00:01:06.240> one

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
good luck killing on the second one

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.289 
good luck killing on the second one
because<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.590> really<00:01:08.130> be<00:01:08.490> really

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
because you have to really be really

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.719 
because you have to really be really
good<00:01:09.540> at<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.810> managing<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.380> recoil<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:11.040> if

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
good at and managing the recoil and if

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.730 
good at and managing the recoil and if
it<00:01:11.909> was<00:01:12.060> hard<00:01:12.390> for<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.659> hanky-hem<00:01:12.990> imagine<00:01:13.650> on

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
it was hard for the hanky-hem imagine on

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.340 
it was hard for the hanky-hem imagine on
this<00:01:13.950> one<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.939> can<00:01:15.180> also<00:01:15.390> use<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.810> full<00:01:16.140> grip

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
this one so you can also use a full grip

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.830 
this one so you can also use a full grip
on<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.680> gun<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.130> think<00:01:17.939> it's<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.240> must<00:01:18.479> if<00:01:18.720> you

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
on this gun I think it's a must if you

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.359 
on this gun I think it's a must if you
were<00:01:19.020> really<00:01:19.320> wanting<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.680> make<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.130> gun

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
were really wanting to make this gun

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.149 
were really wanting to make this gun
really<00:01:20.970> shines<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:22.290> vertical<00:01:22.740> recoil<00:01:22.830> is

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
really shines the vertical recoil is

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.249 
really shines the vertical recoil is
very<00:01:23.430> important<00:01:23.970> for<00:01:24.150> medium<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:24.810> long<00:01:24.990> range

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
very important for medium and long range

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.340 
very important for medium and long range
engagements<00:01:25.500> not<00:01:26.280> really<00:01:26.729> for<00:01:27.080> close<00:01:28.080> range

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
engagements not really for close range

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.560 
engagements not really for close range
engagements<00:01:28.439> because<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.549> can<00:01:29.759> bar<00:01:30.000> stir<00:01:30.329> all

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
engagements because you can bar stir all

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.050 
engagements because you can bar stir all
the<00:01:30.720> time<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.290> not<00:01:32.009> really<00:01:32.250> worrying<00:01:32.880> about

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
the time and not really worrying about

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.810 
the time and not really worrying about
missing<00:01:33.930> also<00:01:34.530> guys<00:01:34.890> their<00:01:35.100> runs<00:01:35.310> per<00:01:35.490> minute

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
missing also guys their runs per minute

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.840 
missing also guys their runs per minute
for<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.210> webinar<00:01:36.979> 640<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.610> have<00:01:38.820> a

weight of 3 point 5 kilogram and really
in<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.150> hip<00:01:42.299> fire<00:01:42.600> it's<00:01:42.990> easy<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.500> manage<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:44.130> in

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
in a hip fire it's easy to manage and in

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.850 
in a hip fire it's easy to manage and in
my<00:01:44.700> opinion<00:01:45.119> for<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.329> rifle<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.500> very

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
my opinion for a rifle this is very

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.819 
my opinion for a rifle this is very
important<00:01:47.579> also<00:01:48.450> guys<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:49.140> want<00:01:49.320> to<00:01:49.409> say<00:01:49.560> that

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
right now the damage feels similar to

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.840 
right now the damage feels similar to
the<00:01:52.560> one<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.070> heck<00:01:53.280> ahem

and don't take my words for granted
because<00:01:56.579> it's<00:01:57.119> just<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.390> feeling<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.960> don't<00:01:58.020> have

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
because it's just a feeling I don't have

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.069 
because it's just a feeling I don't have
a<00:01:58.350> server<00:01:58.680> which<00:01:59.399> is<00:01:59.610> enable<00:02:00.090> where<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.570> can

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
a server which is enable where I can

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.080 
a server which is enable where I can
test<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.380> damage<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.250> in<00:02:02.520> my<00:02:02.579> opinion<00:02:03.000> this

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
test the damage and in my opinion this

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.940 
test the damage and in my opinion this
gosh<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.540> have<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.780> little<00:02:04.110> bit<00:02:04.380> more<00:02:04.619> damage

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
gosh you have a little bit more damage

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.639 
gosh you have a little bit more damage
because<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:06.149> bullets<00:02:06.630> have<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.229> larger

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
because the bullets have a larger

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.979 
because the bullets have a larger
caliber<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.819> in<00:02:09.030> my<00:02:09.119> opinion<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.599> little<00:02:09.720> bit

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
caliber so in my opinion a little bit

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.320 
caliber so in my opinion a little bit
more<00:02:10.200> damage<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:11.400> doesn't<00:02:11.849> mean<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.000> this

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
more damage it doesn't mean that this

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.110 
more damage it doesn't mean that this
gun<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.599> bad

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
gun is bad

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.539 
gun is bad
because<00:02:13.510> we<00:02:13.810> really<00:02:14.349> make<00:02:14.560> shine<00:02:14.830> this<00:02:15.069> weapon

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:15.549 
because we really make shine this weapon

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.600 
because we really make shine this weapon
