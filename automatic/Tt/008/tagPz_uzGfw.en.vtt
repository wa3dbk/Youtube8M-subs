00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
scene I was talking about and this is

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.830 
scene I was talking about and this is
about<00:02:43.560> as<00:02:43.739> fast<00:02:43.950> as<00:02:44.219> this<00:02:44.340> car<00:02:44.400> will<00:02:44.819> go<00:02:44.849> it's

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
about as fast as this car will go it's

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.020 
about as fast as this car will go it's
pretty<00:02:46.170> fast<00:02:46.620> but<00:02:46.950> it's<00:02:47.099> not<00:02:47.159> like<00:02:47.609> you<00:02:47.849> know<00:02:48.000> a

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
pretty fast but it's not like you know a

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.050 
pretty fast but it's not like you know a
Bugatti<00:02:48.900> or<00:02:49.560> none<00:02:49.919> of<00:02:50.099> that<00:02:50.159> not<00:02:50.819> like<00:02:51.030> the

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
Bugatti or none of that not like the

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.629 
Bugatti or none of that not like the
Corvette<00:02:51.620> nothing<00:02:52.620> like<00:02:52.799> that<00:02:53.040> in<00:02:53.220> this<00:02:53.400> game

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639 
Corvette nothing like that in this game

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.449 
Corvette nothing like that in this game
but<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:54.299> know<00:02:54.450> it<00:02:55.319> gets<00:02:55.560> up<00:02:55.829> and<00:02:55.950> goes<00:02:56.069> as<00:02:56.340> you

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
but you know it gets up and goes as you

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.099 
but you know it gets up and goes as you
can<00:02:56.549> see<00:02:56.700> can<00:02:56.909> lose<00:02:57.060> control<00:02:57.150> kind<00:02:57.659> of<00:02:57.780> easy

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
can see can lose control kind of easy

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.050 
can see can lose control kind of easy
since<00:02:58.650> it's<00:02:58.859> so<00:02:59.010> heavy<00:02:59.219> at<00:02:59.370> these<00:02:59.549> high<00:02:59.730> speeds

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
since it's so heavy at these high speeds

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.149 
since it's so heavy at these high speeds
that<00:03:00.180> can<00:03:00.419> be<00:03:00.569> pretty<00:03:00.810> damaging<00:03:01.349> but<00:03:02.040> it

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
that can be pretty damaging but it

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.159 
that can be pretty damaging but it
doesn't<00:03:02.549> just<00:03:02.819> drift<00:03:03.269> on<00:03:03.510> these<00:03:03.689> turns<00:03:03.959> it

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:04.169 
doesn't just drift on these turns it

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:05.720 
doesn't just drift on these turns it
doesn't<00:03:04.500> it<00:03:04.709> doesn't<00:03:04.889> do<00:03:05.129> that<00:03:05.159> like<00:03:05.579> the

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
doesn't it doesn't do that like the

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.399 
doesn't it doesn't do that like the
other<00:03:05.849> cars<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.299> know<00:03:06.419> it<00:03:06.569> carries<00:03:07.139> the<00:03:07.169> whole

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
other cars you know it carries the whole

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.470 
other cars you know it carries the whole
car<00:03:07.650> with<00:03:07.829> it<00:03:08.010> cuz<00:03:08.159> it's<00:03:08.340> so<00:03:08.430> heavy<00:03:08.790> but<00:03:09.269> here's
