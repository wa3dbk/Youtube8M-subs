00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.569
 hello today we have unboxing 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:07.470
 unpacking in Russian 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:12.110
 naturally unpack we will not 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.940
 here is this new candy 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.680
 portable console he game boy 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.980
 advance 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:23.449
 i bought at the store and she kind of like 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.449
 original let's look into the box 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.429
 nothing superfluous is written here 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.019
 nintendo 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:36.380
 which gives me hope that she 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:40.079
 the original is such a simple little box 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:43.829
 the prefix cost 1700 rubles which is very 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.020
 cheap and in some people games but 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:55.739
 tanks written written games not included 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:59.250
 let's get the wire to connect 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:03.530
 with a computer on the hut that a little me 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:07.439
 scared because I started thinking that 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.900
 This is for downloading games as included 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.500
 computer so empire did not identify this 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.540
 prefix 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:18.420
 but only the crosses started charging 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:22.430
 further food is all packed 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.939
 beautiful you have a very bad sticker 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.630
 can even be used for nds 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.340
 genital gives me 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.060
 for nintendo ds lite because it 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.060
 other connectors 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:39.680
 and here is a box inside such here 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.380
 little book 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.510
 100 strange at the graph and she seems to be 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:51.220
 very good 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:53.440
 nintendo original in Russian 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:59.720
 it is written what is needed 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:01.760
 a place to put it and how to load size 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.110
 the screen is what how to switch colors 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.100
 gnawed gameboy 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:10.090
 and complete instruction for one cables 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:17.650
 everything else about cars will return 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:26.030
 how is the console itself here are her slots 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:29.810
 for charging for allen cable this 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.190
 turn off turn on the slot for games is suitable 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.320
 cartridges for game boy 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:39.440
 Lead boy color and game boy advance 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:42.590
 the volume is all done very beautifully 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.650
 good nintendo inscription here too 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.190
 there is nothing superfluous guarantee but this one 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.570
 the sticker said the store was stuck 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.950
 to distinguish from coke supplier she 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:57.530
 came in case of breakage too 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.080
 written about the model number game boy 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:04.540
 advance sp 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.540
 open too nothing extra 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:11.120
 now let me tell you how to distinguish 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.400
 the original from not original what i 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:18.170
 I read a lot today told me 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:21.800
 other people first on the original assembled 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:25.520
 Well, all the joints are even this prefix 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:28.570
 fits like a wig to the original to 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:31.130
 turns on should be written geymboy 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:35.630
 I have no games and nothing 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.890
 only spirit appears 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:43.920
 there are positions 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:49.950
 game boy advance is another version where 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:52.590
 written colors model number a with g 001 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.560
 This means the first model and here 2 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:04:01.890
 there are 101 lights there to be many 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:06.510
 options for colors more well, that's teaching 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:09.209
 part to close the buttons well 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.570
 clicked here written geymboy 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:16.440
 because it is written on pirated 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:19.470
 nintendo game box and many others 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.700
 inscriptions written white on 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.240
 pirate people say they are 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.880
 written multicolored 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:30.150
 green and any other colors 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:33.950
 backlight off the screen dark 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.950
 stuffy pirate is much brighter 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:45.390
 crosses are not just wine but cogs 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:51.620
 nintendo cogs they are not visible 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:54.840
 and social cross nintendo RSK and I 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:59.030
 that is, there is no ordinary screw your eats 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:01.410
 normal 4 and there on 3 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.410
 how to show but unfortunately not 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.660
 imagine possible 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:10.729
 oh well then on pirate geymboya 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.729
 again the inscription is convex and 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:20.640
 multicolored here she is just black 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:22.680
 the best way to know what it is 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.380
 pirate is not pirated it is to make out her 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:28.500
 and see what is written on the board and 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:32.210
 give us speak in paint and mine 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.210
 normal tarik is not put 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:41.620
 another option that pirated game boy 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:45.960
 Chinese do not read the same cards from 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.960
 original geymboy color and advance 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:52.440
 usually the ring of fights and color read only 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:59.410
 advance narrow and they do not read 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:06:04.150
 flash cards and they don't recognize 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:08.620
 multiplayer pirated here on this review 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:12.450
 lap housing map finished this tomorrow 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:19.960
 I should have a flash cartridge and 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:25.530
 we will continue to review flash cartridges all 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.530
