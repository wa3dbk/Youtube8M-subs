00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hey people welcome to the episode number 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.040
 3 from fifa level up here too I have to 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.109
 say thank you again the second 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.280
 episode of that, too, I'm extremely good 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.340
 arrived, I am very happy 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.630
 quite a lot so thanks for that 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.920
 seems to make you all fun for me 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.400
 is also fun and that's the point 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.080
 the thing 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.029
 from there I can be quite satisfied 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.560
 so far his first team against the 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.470
 We came was a mix from Korea 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.260
 austria and new year mls with service 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.400
 and the other striker in the storm both 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.779
 very good players the first mistake 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.580
 however, he hacked on his side 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.869
 has a lot of space there can unfortunately 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.610
 However, do not shoot well because of it 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.960
 values ​​and then in the end 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.180
 away from the margin or at 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.680
 tried extra shot from tyson here 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.420
 relatively clear at the shot in the offside 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.010
 But then it was more of a mistake 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.739
 brew my defense and nice ball 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.000
 on that saw that too much space but 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.469
 luck for me that this ball is not 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.969
 go in and there was a big mistake 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.989
 this will only be the end of this chance today 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.460
 creates his by 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.410
 by his very bad 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.309
 come out where he jumps past the ball 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.570
 So the big chance but 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.129
 luckily not in it 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.899
 but later it did 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.059
 she sat down much better with her head 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.039
 characterized heads the ball a 1 0 after 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.420
 just 19 minutes on the other 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.129
 page similar scene again header 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.380
 also from me here with hot but the 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.150
 unfortunately no header player so no 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.500
 too big a danger that he does not have a head 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.760
 example, she also proved good later 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.890
 again hackett beautiful flank completely 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.600
 free store and hot does not meet 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.439
 It really only needs a lot of space 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.900
 einköpfen still 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.340
 three four five maybe a few meters 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.570
 in front of empty tor but it creates 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.950
 actually the ball over the gate 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.180
 carry and not to clean 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.220
 nice shot then here again from 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.270
 hackett made a very good game 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.590
 was very active so far 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.299
 unfortunately, however, thwarted and today 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.579
 then for the time being clarified after shot but the 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.740
 also the gate over thus thus also 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.479
 No big danger it was up here 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.890
 date a deserving winner one the 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.329
 deserved guidance for my opponents after all 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.819
 then richardson nice free kick but 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.380
 Here, too, the Korean booty of the 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:46.600
 although he did a good job 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.740
 pretty stupid out of his ball loss 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.060
 then here in the defense of my opponent 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.579
 müller is getting lucky 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.709
 but opposes outdated Gionta young 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.359
 or something like that has its good game 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:57.729
 confirmed and holds another ball 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:58.990
 Theissen then plays here in the 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.149
 middle there is müller of it 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.349
 miller strong miller and the ball is 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.500
 in the end, here again 

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:06.849
 actually kept each of the cattle 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.380
 this is a pity because it is today 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:10.209
 but the chances were really good 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.250
 of course, came with now again 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.420
 and who is in the right faithful chance 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.440
 still not over the counter 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.629
 maybe again , sit down with it 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.519
 some pace and some strings and 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.829
 dribble strength then shoots on it 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:23.049
 and now the ball is finally in 84 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.760
 minute 84 minutes it took to 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:26.440
 The ball finally goes into the gate until we 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.329
 finally overcome the Korean goal 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.829
 can and so that's it 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.810
 well deserved all really 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.010
 at the very most deserved 1 2 1 he 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.250
 provides yet again but also chance 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.440
 here the ball passes 90 not too 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.510
 dangerous and then my opponent again 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.340
 in the extension gate with the shot 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.859
 and there as brown brown brown latte 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.450
 clarified giant riesendusel again 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:48.250
 but he did not quite shoot for me 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.220
 adjusted in the end, however, then 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.599
 but 96,000 is free through the pattern 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.120
 stores in the air across there is müller 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.959
 I mean miller and luck in it 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.370
 still for me because the shot actually 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.709
 was pretty bad if i was honest 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.150
 the ball is almost on the right 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.010
 Goal post over 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.840
 but so in there experienced in the 100 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.060
 second has a lot of space and blocked 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.319
 the offender really the distance 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.810
 best player of mine against that was 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.950
 received almost all 21 more 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.389
 Tyson in the middle there is now with 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.950
 a due date by müller with the 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:16.959
 next chance and that's in there 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.549
 3 to 1 expanded the management 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.609
 Two-door leadership and that was enormous 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:23.139
 important to play 15 minutes and 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:24.849
 acetic led with two factors back then 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:25.870
 I with hackett on jenkins in the too 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:27.819
 a lot of space has to flank that 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.829
 header and tyson hits again 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.480
 not tyson proves once again that he 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.099
 nothing at all about head balls 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.120
 is quite rightly on the right 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:35.440
 really has to be in it 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.819
 he does not do anything in the end 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.319
 luck, but not anymore 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.300
 wear comes because the game goes 3 2 1 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:42.100
 Another victory for me 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.660
 and that is very nice through this 3 2 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.560
 1 victory we can of course all the 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.260
 make a bill again 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.570
 3 x 2 is 6 -1 is five we are allowed one 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.740
 Players of our choice to upgrade to 5 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.940
 is very nice we were often like you 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.470
 can see clearly here 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.690
 the end effect of this victory is definitely 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.980
 All in all alone today 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.510
 mostly against that prevented it yet 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.110
 not that not much higher 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.700
 failed 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.410
 the player we chose the wat 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.430
 de montaña is fast but otherwise 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.980
 nothing really works 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.180
 For him , jalali came a little faster 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.350
 is a bit worse in training something 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.120
 bad at the end but also for it 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.440
 better fit in what is important to me 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.420
 that he hit too good to send a cross 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.530
 unfortunately what can the lower jack just 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.910
 so we could not buy it then 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.010
 even where he was not too expensive 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.560
 so that was not a big deal 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.920
 problem and put him directly into the team 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.390
 on 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.060
 the next opponent of today's episode 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.180
 then the resistenza fc was another 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.830
 player with a huge lo que 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.800
 Team why did not go play 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.300
 I do not know mostly that's it 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.670
 more like what was there not to play 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.630
 wait for normal rather than effective 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.270
 that's not really possible anymore 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.980
 do not really show time because of that 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.560
 It's easy to pack this standard beginner 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.480
 bronze players were in relative terms 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.830
 yes strange positions partially 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.050
 I believed that he was in the 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.400
 storm or something like that had to the 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.140
 then came this kind of game from where 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.210
 playing backwards so think is with you 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.800
 the huge chance and the goal 1 0 after 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.330
 18 minutes and he really has 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.760
 Himself a present when he's back there 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.960
 playing around with his user team 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.010
 then he has to expect me to do that 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.840
 tor do if I the ball eventually 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.850
 get big mistakes from him in 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.070
 connection, however, he gave a little gas 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.110
 thiago ribeiro good try though 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.150
 about story about happiness for me at this 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.070
 ask because that was surprisingly good 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.440
 Chance for his team to be so bad 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.600
 actually is 38 times with one 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.060
 long shot good shot but also good 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.190
 The goalkeeper parades in and parries 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.810
 the ball around the post then directs the 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.280
 flank in the middle there is into the ball 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.870
 blocked but not yet with chamber 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.160
 our branch office what is it doing there 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.990
 no, our defender even 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.730
 Kämmerin hits the 2 0 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.620
 that the son has a cool graduation 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.300
 I did not think I mean that 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.680
 maybe 30 or so I know it 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.070
 not out of the head at tremendously low 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.600
 every case 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.640
 and then he hits there such a thing out 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.590
 very nice 20 tyson again 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.120
 the chance before the break again 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.920
 the guidance maybe only to the 13 0 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.450
 However, to expand his copper to 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.980
 imprecise and thus past the gate 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.080
 but suddenly also my opponent 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.000
 with chances Franzel just over it 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.410
 good shot you would not have today 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.800
 had a chance in the weir very well 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.960
 come 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.490
 Maybe he is not as good as 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.020
 he should have come to go in 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.430
 He suffered shortly afterwards with the chance 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.260
 but not too good here 

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.580
 taken nice flank but from the 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:08.200
 Of course, turning is difficult 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.520
 thus, two to zero again 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.170
 franz uhl then he has a good one 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.060
 shot his second good scene today in the 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.720
 but already thinks today holds in the 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.490
 75 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.470
 that 's about 90 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.270
 minute the game is over I win 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.910
 two to zero by the terrorists time 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.840
 from cameron and jenkins 20 so one 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:24.850
 update at 4 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.890
 I'll get our rm and for that 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:28.180
 Fini is slower but clear 

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:28.660
 better and rebel a little better 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.580
 to adjust 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.530
 a little worse at the end even so 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.600
 no such huge improvement but one 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.280
 on the way to the better player and he 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.330
 is also in San franc like 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.650
 said what is important on the big one 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.270
 You have to be good guys as well as men 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.830
 can bring flanks there is on everyone 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.000
 case better that was it already 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.350
 again from today's episode three 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.880
 People played four silver games 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:46.120
 are already there we are on a good one 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.710
 path 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.840
 I hope the next time, too 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:52.710
 again until then until then 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.710
 and goodbye
