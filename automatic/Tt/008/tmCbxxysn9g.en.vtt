 our review palmann dvr 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.450
 dvr 25 with at first glance, the usual device 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.610
 but he kept himself the most unusual 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.610
 impression of why now tell 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:27.290
 DVR palmann dvr 25 with 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.480
 visually reminiscent of the latest model 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.800
 iphone flat panels rectangular 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.390
 corpus rounded edges 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.190
 smooth side face swept in front 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.800
 a large lens is mounted at the back 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.810
 large 2 and 8 inch display next to 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.240
 him neat metal buttons with 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.980
 clear and understandable cry at the top and 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.660
 bottom edge of the power button 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.130
 necessary connectors card slot 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.560
 memory and fixture locations 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.510
 the word appearance of the device left 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.670
 the most pleasant impression which is not 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.710
 say about picking start with the fact that 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.170
 box nameless moreover she even 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.060
 just universal grade pleases 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.040
 extensive set of various laces 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.549
 charger fastener instructions 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.710
 case 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.650
 but almost every item has comments 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.570
 so the case judging by the shape was meant 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.370
 for navigator instruction with bad 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.750
 translation and mounting windshield not 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.430
 has contacts for power 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:22.729
 although on the corps do the site 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:24.950
 Contacts are apparently understanding that not 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.049
 finalized here missed there forgot about 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.030
 this manufacturer as an apology 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.130
 put in the kit a simple mp3 player 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.690
 and it's nice by the way before you buy 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.690
 be sure to check this item 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.690
 in work the registrar polman also 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.310
 causes a mixed impression so 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.230
 The main menu of the device consists of two 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.100
 traditional items with the same traditional 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.350
 set of settings 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.910
 video or photo resolution special effects 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.160
 video cycling setting 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.960
 sensitivity sensor language 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.470
 set date and time formatting 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.120
 memory cards and other whole menu pleases 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.020
 good translation but sad 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.550
 primitive fonts 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.160
 similarly with video quality when 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.080
 maximum parameters of 1920 to 1080 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.540
 points 30 frames per second 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.550
 the video is very good clear and 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.780
 nice detail that is not a shake like 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.110
 This met other registrars 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.900
 full hd in 720p mode video quality 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.340
 also remains at a very decent level 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.400
 the picture worsens only when 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.170
 shooting with a resolution of 848 by 480 pixels 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.030
 however, a drastic loss of quality 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.160
 the video still does not have to talk 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:33.150
 but there is a possibility of summation 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.980
 pictures start video with maximum 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.470
 quality parameters look enough 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.420
 well think output is clear and without 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.040
 explanations the registrar is good but 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.090
 put him the maximum score interfere 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.430
 gaps little things 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.810
 However, this is all a secondary remark if 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.570
 you are ready to put up with them you can 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.610
 feel free to add palmann dvr 25 from the list 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.019
 applicants for the purchase of this all 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.019
 have a nice day and see you soon
