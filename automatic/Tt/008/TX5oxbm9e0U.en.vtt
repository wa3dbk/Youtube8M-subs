00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.369 
reality the reality of I should have
stopped<00:03:08.699> at<00:03:09.299> a<00:03:09.329> junior<00:03:09.569> show<00:03:09.870> along<00:03:10.109> the<00:03:10.290> way

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
stopped at a junior show along the way

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.830 
stopped at a junior show along the way
before<00:03:10.769> I<00:03:10.799> decided<00:03:11.129> to<00:03:11.280> do<00:03:11.430> this<00:03:11.659> sets<00:03:12.659> in

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
before I decided to do this sets in

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.890 
before I decided to do this sets in
pretty<00:03:13.590> fast<00:03:13.859> so<00:03:14.159> so<00:03:14.849> yeah<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:15.540> know<00:03:15.599> I<00:03:15.659> think

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
pretty fast so so yeah you know I think

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.360 
pretty fast so so yeah you know I think
that<00:03:16.260> this<00:03:16.379> is<00:03:16.439> a<00:03:16.590> great<00:03:16.799> show<00:03:16.949> i<00:03:16.980> think<00:03:17.250> when

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
that this is a great show i think when

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.189 
that this is a great show i think when
guys<00:03:17.549> do<00:03:17.759> qualify<00:03:18.090> for<00:03:18.419> nationals<00:03:18.870> i<00:03:18.989> think

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:19.199 
guys do qualify for nationals i think

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.990 
guys do qualify for nationals i think
this<00:03:19.349> should<00:03:19.530> be<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.889> next<00:03:20.040> logical<00:03:20.340> step<00:03:20.669> and

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
this should be the next logical step and

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.819 
this should be the next logical step and
not<00:03:21.090> just<00:03:21.329> not<00:03:21.720> just<00:03:21.750> qualify<00:03:22.379> and<00:03:22.530> this<00:03:22.650> is<00:03:22.799> a

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
not just not just qualify and this is a

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:24.860 
not just not just qualify and this is a
mistake<00:03:23.009> I<00:03:23.310> made<00:03:23.519> when<00:03:23.639> I<00:03:23.699> was<00:03:23.790> younger<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.419> so

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
mistake I made when I was younger and so

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.159 
mistake I made when I was younger and so
I<00:03:24.900> can't<00:03:25.439> hardly<00:03:25.879> you<00:03:26.879> know<00:03:27.000> you<00:03:27.419> rag<00:03:27.930> on<00:03:28.049> the

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169 
I can't hardly you know you rag on the

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:30.020 
I can't hardly you know you rag on the
guys<00:03:28.319> too<00:03:28.620> much<00:03:28.799> who<00:03:29.040> are<00:03:29.129> doing<00:03:29.310> it<00:03:29.549> now<00:03:29.699> but

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
guys too much who are doing it now but

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.159 
guys too much who are doing it now but
just<00:03:30.209> because<00:03:30.329> you've<00:03:30.509> qualified<00:03:30.689> for

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
just because you've qualified for

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:32.420 
just because you've qualified for
nationals<00:03:31.199> doesn't<00:03:31.829> always<00:03:32.009> mean<00:03:32.129> you<00:03:32.189> ready

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
nationals doesn't always mean you ready

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.039 
nationals doesn't always mean you ready
for<00:03:32.609> a<00:03:32.639> national<00:03:33.030> level<00:03:33.120> show<00:03:33.389> and<00:03:33.569> I<00:03:33.599> think<00:03:33.840> I

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
for a national level show and I think I

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.749 
for a national level show and I think I
think<00:03:34.530> you<00:03:34.859> know<00:03:34.949> people<00:03:34.979> talk<00:03:35.400> a<00:03:35.459> lot<00:03:35.729> about

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:35.759 
think you know people talk a lot about

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:37.789 
think you know people talk a lot about
you<00:03:36.569> know<00:03:36.659> these<00:03:36.930> shows<00:03:37.109> being<00:03:37.349> watered<00:03:37.650> down

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
you know these shows being watered down

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.289 
you know these shows being watered down
and<00:03:38.099> stuff<00:03:38.280> like<00:03:38.400> that<00:03:38.459> with<00:03:38.729> the<00:03:38.819> competitors

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
and stuff like that with the competitors

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:40.819 
and stuff like that with the competitors
and<00:03:39.449> I<00:03:39.540> think<00:03:39.780> that<00:03:39.930> has<00:03:39.959> a<00:03:40.139> lot<00:03:40.259> to<00:03:40.409> do<00:03:40.650> with<00:03:40.680> it

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
and I think that has a lot to do with it

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.289 
and I think that has a lot to do with it
there's<00:03:41.129> you<00:03:41.340> know<00:03:41.370> there's<00:03:41.459> a<00:03:41.639> lot<00:03:41.669> of<00:03:41.819> local

there's you know there's a lot of local

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.300 
there's you know there's a lot of local
