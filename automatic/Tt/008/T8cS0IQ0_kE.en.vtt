 and that your computer 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.510

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.190
 and I'll click here to proceed 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.800

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.650
 It's what you wanted. 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.410

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:17.539
 restoration 

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:20.539
 and it will undo this restore 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:25.239
 but what we want to do now a restoration so let's confirm 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.179

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:53.460
 this is the first 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.209
 before clicking here I concluded 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.430
 and then pleading with those who have completed their vaio notebook 

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:07.109
 then do go back to impose a time spent in the case here I chose day 12 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:08.760
 doses of 2010 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.760

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.849
 they doing it you go beyond 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:22.060
 often do not need to reinstall the operating system 

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:27.739
 because of a bug that the system restore itself runs
