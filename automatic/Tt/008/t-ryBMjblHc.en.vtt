00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
surfing is just constantly a challenge

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.059 
surfing is just constantly a challenge
it's<00:00:03.840> not<00:00:03.929> something<00:00:04.470> you've<00:00:04.589> never<00:00:04.770> really

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
it's not something you've never really

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.039 
it's not something you've never really
mastered<00:00:05.400> the<00:00:05.910> ocean<00:00:06.330> will<00:00:06.480> always<00:00:06.779> humble

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
mastered the ocean will always humble

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.110 
mastered the ocean will always humble
you<00:00:07.230> and<00:00:07.379> will<00:00:07.470> always<00:00:07.500> be<00:00:07.919> hits<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.639> boss<00:00:08.820> and

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
you and will always be hits the boss and

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.660 
you and will always be hits the boss and
so<00:00:09.440> every<00:00:10.440> time<00:00:10.559> you<00:00:10.679> paddle<00:00:11.010> out<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.280> ocean

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
so every time you paddle out the ocean

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:21.859 
so every time you paddle out the ocean
teaches<00:00:11.969> you<00:00:12.090> oh<00:00:12.120> that's<00:00:12.330> one<00:00:12.540> zone<00:00:12.690> away<00:00:20.869> well

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
teaches you oh that's one zone away well

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.660 
teaches you oh that's one zone away well
wood<00:00:22.050> is<00:00:22.199> just<00:00:22.439> there's<00:00:23.010> nothing<00:00:23.189> like<00:00:23.490> it

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
wood is just there's nothing like it

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.599 
wood is just there's nothing like it
it's<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.910> biomimetic<00:00:24.390> material<00:00:25.170> so<00:00:25.380> the

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
it's a biomimetic material so the

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.250 
it's a biomimetic material so the
feeling<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.880> when<00:00:27.150> it's<00:00:27.300> gliding<00:00:27.869> on<00:00:28.230> a

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
feeling of it when it's gliding on a

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.529 
feeling of it when it's gliding on a
wave<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.830> believe<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.519> in<00:00:29.670> tune<00:00:29.939> with<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.359> way

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
wave I believe is in tune with the way

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.229 
wave I believe is in tune with the way
our<00:00:31.170> bodies<00:00:31.529> are<00:00:31.650> meant<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.949> feel<00:00:32.189> feel<00:00:33.030> that

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
our bodies are meant to feel feel that

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.299 
our bodies are meant to feel feel that
flex<00:00:33.540> because<00:00:33.899> it's<00:00:34.050> an<00:00:34.140> organic<00:00:34.559> material<00:00:34.680> I

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
flex because it's an organic material I

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.340 
flex because it's an organic material I
always<00:00:36.180> did<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.719> always<00:00:36.870> made<00:00:37.170> my<00:00:37.320> own

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
always did it and I always made my own

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.900 
always did it and I always made my own
board<00:00:37.649> but<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:37.860> need<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.070> living<00:00:38.399> other<00:00:38.550> many

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
board but I need a living other many

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.700 
board but I need a living other many
other<00:00:38.969> ways<00:00:39.300> like<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.629> taught<00:00:39.840> art<00:00:40.110> for<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.379> long

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
other ways like I taught art for a long

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
to study painting and eventually got my

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.400 
to study painting and eventually got my
contractor's<00:00:45.360> license<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.020> was<00:00:46.140> doing

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
contractor's license and I was doing

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.049 
contractor's license and I was doing
environmentally<00:00:47.039> conscious<00:00:47.370> design<00:00:47.670> and

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
environmentally conscious design and

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.209 
environmentally conscious design and
remodels<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.020> building<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.649> at<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.100> same

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
remodels and building and at the same

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.650 
remodels and building and at the same
time<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.460> was<00:00:50.640> always<00:00:50.789> building<00:00:51.059> surfboards

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
time I was always building surfboards

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.110 
time I was always building surfboards
just<00:00:51.930> out<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.800> back<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.100> my<00:00:53.219> truck<00:00:53.489> or<00:00:53.760> in

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
just out of the back of my truck or in

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.240 
just out of the back of my truck or in
whatever<00:00:54.840> space<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.379> could<00:00:55.440> find<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:56.010> do<00:00:56.280> it

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
whatever space I could find to do it

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.220 
whatever space I could find to do it
about<00:00:57.910> 12<00:00:58.480> years<00:00:58.510> ago<00:00:58.690> I've<00:00:58.930> made<00:00:59.110> the

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
about 12 years ago I've made the

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.190 
about 12 years ago I've made the
decision<00:00:59.350> to<00:00:59.800> try<00:00:59.950> and<00:01:00.220> bring<00:01:00.580> my<00:01:01.270> desire<00:01:02.170> to

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
decision to try and bring my desire to

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.620 
decision to try and bring my desire to
design<00:01:03.130> things<00:01:03.400> more<00:01:03.580> sustainably<00:01:04.120> into<00:01:04.510> the

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:04.630 
design things more sustainably into the

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.710 
design things more sustainably into the
surfboards<00:01:05.050> I<00:01:05.140> was<00:01:05.260> building<00:01:06.300> the<00:01:07.300> first<00:01:07.480> one

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
surfboards I was building the first one

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.810 
surfboards I was building the first one
took<00:01:08.410> me<00:01:08.620> probably<00:01:08.830> a<00:01:09.070> year<00:01:09.280> and<00:01:09.340> a<00:01:09.460> half<00:01:09.610> to

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
took me probably a year and a half to

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.030 
took me probably a year and a half to
build<00:01:09.970> just<00:01:10.330> from<00:01:10.510> the<00:01:11.140> beginning<00:01:11.440> stage<00:01:11.800> all

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
build just from the beginning stage all

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.340 
build just from the beginning stage all
the<00:01:12.220> way<00:01:12.310> through<00:01:12.550> I<00:01:13.000> just<00:01:13.810> did<00:01:14.080> it<00:01:14.170> in<00:01:14.200> my

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
the way through I just did it in my

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.440 
the way through I just did it in my
spare<00:01:14.710> time<00:01:14.770> like<00:01:15.250> at<00:01:15.640> night<00:01:15.910> late<00:01:16.210> at<00:01:16.330> night

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
spare time like at night late at night

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.230 
spare time like at night late at night
tweaking<00:01:16.810> out<00:01:16.930> in<00:01:17.050> my<00:01:17.170> garage<00:01:17.410> and<00:01:18.150> there<00:01:19.150> was

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
tweaking out in my garage and there was

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.570 
tweaking out in my garage and there was
a<00:01:19.300> lot<00:01:19.510> of<00:01:19.540> trial<00:01:20.200> and<00:01:20.320> error<00:01:20.470> and<00:01:20.740> just<00:01:20.800> kind

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
a lot of trial and error and just kind

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.190 
a lot of trial and error and just kind
of<00:01:21.670> reinventing<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:22.330> wheel<00:01:22.480> as<00:01:22.810> I<00:01:22.930> went<00:01:23.080> along

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
of reinventing the wheel as I went along

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.280 
of reinventing the wheel as I went along
a<00:01:24.210> lot<00:01:25.210> of<00:01:25.300> people's<00:01:25.570> were<00:01:25.690> like<00:01:25.900> it<00:01:26.050> was<00:01:26.170> the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
a lot of people's were like it was the

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.840 
a lot of people's were like it was the
crazy<00:01:26.530> wood<00:01:26.770> board<00:01:26.980> guy<00:01:27.160> but<00:01:27.400> then<00:01:27.580> it<00:01:27.700> really

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
crazy wood board guy but then it really

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.790 
crazy wood board guy but then it really
started<00:01:28.330> a<00:01:28.450> grassroots<00:01:28.660> sort<00:01:29.260> of<00:01:29.350> a<00:01:29.440> level

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
started a grassroots sort of a level

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.740 
started a grassroots sort of a level
where<00:01:29.979> I'd<00:01:30.790> walk<00:01:31.000> down<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.300> street<00:01:31.540> and

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
where I'd walk down the street and

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.060 
where I'd walk down the street and
somebody<00:01:32.020> had<00:01:32.200> seen<00:01:32.350> me<00:01:32.470> with<00:01:32.500> the<00:01:32.680> board<00:01:32.890> and

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
somebody had seen me with the board and

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.410 
somebody had seen me with the board and
I<00:01:33.100> would<00:01:33.220> just<00:01:33.340> give<00:01:33.490> it<00:01:33.580> to<00:01:33.670> him<00:01:33.820> in<00:01:33.880> a<00:01:33.970> circuit

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
I would just give it to him in a circuit

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.320 
I would just give it to him in a circuit
and<00:01:34.479> then<00:01:34.600> I'd<00:01:34.750> order<00:01:35.020> one<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:37.000> so<00:01:37.119> I<00:01:37.150> had<00:01:37.300> to

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
and then I'd order one and so I had to

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.230 
and then I'd order one and so I had to
make<00:01:37.540> a<00:01:37.570> decision<00:01:38.020> do<00:01:38.979> I<00:01:39.040> jump<00:01:39.640> headfirst<00:01:39.850> in

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
make a decision do I jump headfirst in

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.520 
make a decision do I jump headfirst in
the<00:01:40.300> building<00:01:40.570> surfboards<00:01:40.960> for<00:01:41.050> a<00:01:41.140> living<00:01:41.380> or

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
the building surfboards for a living or

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.020 
the building surfboards for a living or
do<00:01:41.619> I<00:01:41.650> stick<00:01:42.100> with<00:01:42.220> the<00:01:42.280> remodeling<00:01:42.759> and<00:01:42.880> just

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
do I stick with the remodeling and just
