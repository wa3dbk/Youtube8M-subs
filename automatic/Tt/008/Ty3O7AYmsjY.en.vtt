thing<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.500> say<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.920> with<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.670> hardcase<00:00:55.370> now

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
thing to say is with the hardcase now

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.209 
thing to say is with the hardcase now
the<00:00:56.969> previous<00:00:57.510> hard<00:00:57.899> carry<00:00:58.260> case<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.920> came

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
the previous hard carry case that came

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.490 
the previous hard carry case that came
with<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.699> carabiner<00:01:00.300> clip<00:01:00.690> was<00:01:00.899> only<00:01:01.289> big

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
with the carabiner clip was only big

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.380 
with the carabiner clip was only big
enough<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.890> hold<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.280> microphone<00:01:02.520> itself

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
enough to hold the microphone itself

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.380 
enough to hold the microphone itself
whereas<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.379> one<00:01:04.589> here<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.189> big<00:01:05.970> enough<00:01:06.180> to

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
whereas this one here is big enough to

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.630 
whereas this one here is big enough to
not<00:01:06.510> only<00:01:06.780> hold<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.229> microphone<00:01:07.470> but<00:01:08.400> also

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
not only hold the microphone but also

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.590 
not only hold the microphone but also
the<00:01:09.210> spot<00:01:09.630> for<00:01:09.840> which<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.260> comes<00:01:10.439> with<00:01:11.450> it<00:01:12.450> is

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
the spot for which it comes with it is

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.660 
the spot for which it comes with it is
really<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.930> great<00:01:13.530> improvement<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:14.250> my<00:01:14.400> mind

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
really a great improvement in my mind

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.780 
really a great improvement in my mind
because<00:01:15.110> there's<00:01:16.110> very<00:01:16.590> little<00:01:17.009> occasions

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
because there's very little occasions

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.789 
because there's very little occasions
when<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.210> won't<00:01:18.479> be<00:01:18.689> using<00:01:18.930> this<00:01:19.380> Beaufort

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
when you won't be using this Beaufort

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.440 
when you won't be using this Beaufort
line<00:01:19.920> previously<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.759> just<00:01:20.970> have<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.240> have<00:01:21.420> it

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
line previously you just have to have it

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.100 
line previously you just have to have it
you<00:01:21.900> used<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.229> have<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.380> loose<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.460> bag<00:01:23.640> and

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
you used to have a loose in the bag and

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.230 
you used to have a loose in the bag and
that<00:01:25.110> wasn't<00:01:25.290> great<00:01:25.920> because<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.909> get<00:01:27.150> it

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
that wasn't great because you get it

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.090 
that wasn't great because you get it
lost<00:01:27.450> or<00:01:27.720> get<00:01:27.930> deformed<00:01:28.290> out<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.680> shape<00:01:28.890> so

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
lost or get deformed out of shape so

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.880 
lost or get deformed out of shape so
it's<00:01:29.520> great<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.759> have<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.240> both<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.740> same

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
it's great to have it both in the same

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.789 
it's great to have it both in the same
hard<00:01:32.250> carry<00:01:32.610> case<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.869> look<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.290> well<00:01:34.530> it's

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
hard carry case the look of it well it's

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.249

have been cool to perhaps have those

on<00:04:26.460> this<00:04:26.580> app<00:04:26.759> I<00:04:26.910> haven't<00:04:27.300> used<00:04:28.250> primarily

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
on this app I haven't used primarily

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.070 
on this app I haven't used primarily
because<00:04:29.639> what<00:04:29.970> I<00:04:30.000> needed<00:04:30.389> for<00:04:30.570> I<00:04:30.630> don't<00:04:30.780> need

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
because what I needed for I don't need

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.629 
because what I needed for I don't need
to<00:04:31.199> use<00:04:31.349> all<00:04:31.500> those<00:04:31.620> pro<00:04:31.860> features<00:04:32.310> but<00:04:32.520> it's

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
to use all those pro features but it's

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:33.950 
to use all those pro features but it's
really<00:04:32.849> good<00:04:33.030> to<00:04:33.180> know<00:04:33.210> that<00:04:33.360> they're

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
really good to know that they're

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.689 
really good to know that they're
investing<00:04:34.470> the<00:04:34.560> time<00:04:34.590> and<00:04:35.039> the<00:04:35.130> effort<00:04:35.250> into

investing the time and the effort into

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:38.450 
investing the time and the effort into
making<00:04:36.150> an<00:04:36.419> app<00:04:36.599> that<00:04:36.840> really<00:04:37.590> goes<00:04:37.740> above<00:04:38.340> and

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
making an app that really goes above and

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.379 
making an app that really goes above and
beyond<00:04:38.789> the<00:04:39.330> average<00:04:39.900> use<00:04:41.120> finally<00:04:42.120> if<00:04:42.270> you

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
beyond the average use finally if you

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.330 
beyond the average use finally if you

going to cut it and you're going to want

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.330 
going to cut it and you're going to want
something<00:04:54.180> a<00:04:54.419> little<00:04:54.720> bit<00:04:54.870> better<00:04:55.470> to<00:04:55.919> can<00:04:56.099> set

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
something a little bit better to can set

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.890 
something a little bit better to can set
out<00:04:56.460> some<00:04:56.699> of<00:04:56.820> the<00:04:56.909> wind<00:04:57.330> and<00:04:57.599> some<00:04:57.750> of<00:04:57.840> that

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
out some of the wind and some of that

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.230 
out some of the wind and some of that
noise<00:04:58.220> for<00:04:59.220> noise<00:04:59.490> cancellation<00:04:59.550> I

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
noise for noise cancellation I

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.189 
noise for noise cancellation I
personally<00:05:00.780> use<00:05:01.020> the<00:05:01.260> road<00:05:01.650> dead<00:05:02.159> kitten<00:05:02.639> I

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:03.199 
personally use the road dead kitten I

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:06.620 
personally use the road dead kitten I
find<00:05:04.199> that<00:05:04.320> this<00:05:04.440> is<00:05:04.880> perfectly<00:05:05.880> adequate<00:05:06.180> for

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
find that this is perfectly adequate for

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.960 
find that this is perfectly adequate for
the<00:05:06.900> job<00:05:06.930> and<00:05:07.470> is<00:05:07.800> really<00:05:08.099> really<00:05:08.460> good<00:05:08.729> for

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
the job and is really really good for

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.540 
the job and is really really good for
cancelling<00:05:09.840> out<00:05:09.930> some<00:05:10.199> of<00:05:10.320> that<00:05:10.550> interference

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
cancelling out some of that interference

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.790 
cancelling out some of that interference
which<00:05:11.729> will<00:05:11.880> ruin<00:05:12.060> your<00:05:12.300> recordings<00:05:12.840> and<00:05:13.050> the

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
which will ruin your recordings and the

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.350 
which will ruin your recordings and the
other<00:05:13.919> cool<00:05:14.070> thing<00:05:14.310> is<00:05:14.430> it<00:05:14.520> fits<00:05:14.760> not<00:05:14.970> only

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
other cool thing is it fits not only

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.180 
other cool thing is it fits not only
over<00:05:15.780> the<00:05:15.870> microphone<00:05:16.050> but<00:05:16.470> also<00:05:16.620> over<00:05:17.159> the

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
over the microphone but also over the

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.950 
over the microphone but also over the
default<00:05:17.849> spot<00:05:18.150> also<00:05:18.449> you<00:05:18.539> can<00:05:18.659> get<00:05:18.780> that

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
default spot also you can get that

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.890 
default spot also you can get that
really<00:05:19.260> high<00:05:19.800> grade<00:05:20.220> of<00:05:20.659> noise<00:05:21.659> reduction

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
really high grade of noise reduction

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.100 
really high grade of noise reduction
another<00:05:22.830> advantage<00:05:23.159> is<00:05:23.370> is<00:05:23.849> that<00:05:24.389> it<00:05:24.539> fits

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
another advantage is is that it fits

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.050 
another advantage is is that it fits
over<00:05:25.470> the<00:05:25.500> end<00:05:25.740> of<00:05:25.949> your<00:05:26.070> phone<00:05:26.280> as<00:05:26.520> well<00:05:26.669> so<00:05:26.970> if

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
over the end of your phone as well so if

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.339 
over the end of your phone as well so if
you<00:05:27.150> did<00:05:27.389> happen<00:05:27.570> to<00:05:27.780> be<00:05:27.870> in<00:05:27.930> a<00:05:28.020> location

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:28.349 
you did happen to be in a location

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:31.550 
you did happen to be in a location
without<00:05:28.919> your<00:05:29.250> rode<00:05:30.000> I<00:05:30.180> XY<00:05:30.659> microphone<00:05:31.289> then

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
without your rode I XY microphone then

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.140 
without your rode I XY microphone then
you've<00:05:31.770> got<00:05:31.919> the<00:05:32.009> ability<00:05:32.099> to<00:05:32.460> try<00:05:32.880> and<00:05:33.000> get

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
you've got the ability to try and get

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.390 
you've got the ability to try and get
some<00:05:33.389> recordings<00:05:33.930> at<00:05:34.169> least<00:05:34.380> with<00:05:34.949> some<00:05:35.220> level

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
some recordings at least with some level

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.180 
some recordings at least with some level
of<00:05:35.700> protection<00:05:35.960> so<00:05:36.960> in<00:05:37.289> conclusion<00:05:37.590> this<00:05:37.979> is<00:05:38.039> a

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
of protection so in conclusion this is a

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.850 
of protection so in conclusion this is a
