00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.870
 do not ask how I do not shut up anymore 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.520
 it does not make any sense but now 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.050
 Yes, now a very nice oil and well 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.730
 puja knows when very nice is between 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.070
 basic quotes is perhaps we are here 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.990
 this race which is a ramp a 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.910
 so good this rapa has little 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.670
 he really called him ramp because 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.810
 is up is different but for 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.020
 I only fit one effectively and 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.870
 that's me the case is to see why 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.940
 this ramp with so strange seems a 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.020
 damn a damn space ship and eye 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.390
 because it's three laps now we're going to 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.770
 catch the slipstream this gentleman to jump 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.480
 we are going ahead in air in epic plan 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.160
 movie 2015 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.020
 voucher voucher voucher no no do not pass the 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.879
 good point I have what I have 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.770
 perfect basic for we have here this 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.539
 race we have to win this race 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.750
 Anyway, let's catch the slipstream this 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.399
 fellow worth voucher I go sixth are three 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.770
 I think we can get it 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.930
 it's because I think that is the key 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.549
 is on the ramp not to fall once 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.450
 pass it to the first one every time and 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.450
 here and not mess it up a lot 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:17.690
 this gentleman mate 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.570

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.030

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.230

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.180

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.299
 that really people people I 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.700
 I understand for the first the first 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.340
 call us coast as if sleep takes 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.350
 the first one but please see what kind 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.970
 of antidotes people smoke before 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.170
 that is when you create your account 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.459
 web pressure 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.069
 I think people take a tail boat 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.049
 expired or a strip boat that is 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.640
 takes my parents at night knows and it 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.549
 He said something similar because not formal 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.590
 as well as if they sleep is called then 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.819
 this last round I think we're going third 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.160
 at least to be inside the podium 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:10.160
 when it burns 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.480
 the perfect people 8 to see if the 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.850
 first it becomes attached with the second something 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.610
 similar for in the last round goes to 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.320
 to be impossible to catch he gave will be 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.430
 totally impossible that I would retire 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.430
 to accompany you that has pringado 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.080
 please let something happen that falls 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.880
 Me meteorite that I know 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.140
 the 7 to come forward and be a 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.220
 illusion that all you are going to be able and 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.840
 I really am not ahead 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:39.410
 taking advantage of the cluelessness the objective 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:41.680
 something quite because as soon as 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.680
 escape 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.720
 the trunk this teammates be well 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.980
 hitting a smack we think it was you 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.970
 burn ahead wait ahead 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:55.210
 because of the stick in this may now 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.210
 same 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.720
 Marin Jatib has entered third position 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.230
