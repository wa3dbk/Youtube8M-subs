00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.940
 today 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:11.150
 It is how to use one Masami selling 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.480
 Leather senning 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.330
 laser 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.240
 It is a laser 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:22.220
 This say leather 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:24.310
 When it is cut, the cut edge is cut like Aso 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.490
 Not 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.860
 At an acute angle 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.230
 Supplement 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:34.480
 I can cut it 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.610
 Leather Senning is the issue of maker color 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.870
 let me in 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.960
 A little 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.590
 I was shown it 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.600
 Kuon of this wild boar 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.710
 Ro 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.710
 Here is 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.180
 This diagonally 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:56.690
 You're leaning like this 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.940
 That 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.720
 Speaking of 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.320
 And put 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.320
 Riku different 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.909
 After layer presentation 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:12.210
 Be thin 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:15.760
 I did it that way 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.050
 When I saw it 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.880
 8000 years even in the year 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.390
 I like it great 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.409
 I do not want 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.409
 I thought though 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:33.159
 Tool 0 to go around first 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.880
 How to get close to it 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.260
 I thought about that 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.280
 Laser to people 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.390
 If the stay 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.790
 this 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.350
 panel 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.350
 This panel 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.469
 Horizontally 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.250
 to raise 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:57.750
 In those who are Oite of the ring to the normal child 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.500
 Straight 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.570
 Not straight here 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.770
 A little 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.770
 Tilt forward 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.520
 For people Te 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.120
 When 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.440
 Say this 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:18.600
 Because it is the angle of the leather 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.600
 At this angle 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:26.580
 I can do it 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.890
 In sometimes because fell fried which is 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.770
 Also cut 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:36.090
 It seems like this angle 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:38.400
 It becomes thinner because there is a group 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.040
 Repeat this 1 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.319
 Repeat this for example this 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.879
 gradually 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.879
 Please lower it 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.660
 The angle of the scissors is this family 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:55.810
 8 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.069
 Like leather 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.380
 Or Ne it's going to be in texture 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:11.040
 Well tools 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.860
 Of course with that scissors 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.650
 Maybe this can be Erika 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.360
 First 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.310
 That scissors poison butterfly too 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.580
 Dry line 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.290
 I think it will be more 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.650
 Well there is tool day 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:34.189
 Edgy 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.189
 Also this kind of approach is to give a sense One 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.040
 There is a cat 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.849
 I tried to delusion 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:49.550
 That's how many years ago 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:53.319
 In this creative image also lies repeated 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:56.280
 From that this cut 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.280
 I liked doing 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.400
 Because there is still a little variety 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.040
 In the future 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.040
 I think that I want to work today is over
