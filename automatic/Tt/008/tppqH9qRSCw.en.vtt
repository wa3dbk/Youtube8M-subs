guide<00:00:52.760> me<00:00:52.970> as<00:00:53.090> I'm<00:00:53.270> coloring<00:00:53.630> and<00:00:53.900> using<00:00:54.860> my

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
guide me as I'm coloring and using my

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.030 
guide me as I'm coloring and using my
lightest<00:00:55.700> Brown<00:00:55.970> I'm<00:00:56.530> using<00:00:57.530> light<00:00:58.010> strokes

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
lightest Brown I'm using light strokes

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:17.950 
lightest Brown I'm using light strokes
to<00:00:58.880> shade<00:00:59.120> in<00:00:59.300> areas<00:00:59.810> of<00:01:00.050> the<00:01:00.230> hair

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.010 

and<00:01:19.490> make<00:01:20.490> sure<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.910> leave<00:01:21.060> some<00:01:21.120> highlighted

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
and make sure to leave some highlighted

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.620 
and make sure to leave some highlighted
areas<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.940> you<00:01:23.940> can<00:01:24.090> do<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.360> by<00:01:24.600> just

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
areas and you can do that by just

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.560 
areas and you can do that by just
leaving<00:01:25.050> the<00:01:25.350> paperwhite<00:01:25.950> in<00:01:26.220> between<00:01:27.150> some

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
leaving the paperwhite in between some

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.140 
leaving the paperwhite in between some
of<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.810> braid<00:01:28.050> strands<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:29.580> gives<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
of the braid strands this gives the

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.720 
of the braid strands this gives the
illusion<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.780> depth<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.620> it<00:01:32.220> makes<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.700> look

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:32.730 
illusion of depth and it makes it look

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:36.280 
illusion of depth and it makes it look
shiny<00:01:33.180> as<00:01:33.540> well<00:01:33.860> so<00:01:34.860> now<00:01:34.950> I'm<00:01:35.100> using<00:01:35.220> my<00:01:35.670> black

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
shiny as well so now I'm using my black

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.540 
shiny as well so now I'm using my black
color<00:01:37.290> pencil<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.800> can<00:01:37.920> use<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.100> dark<00:01:38.490> brown

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
color pencil you can use a dark brown

color pencil you can use a dark brown
one<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.150> I'm<00:01:39.750> once<00:01:40.110> again<00:01:40.260> cheating<00:01:40.800> the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
one and I'm once again cheating the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.640 
one and I'm once again cheating the
darkest<00:01:41.400> area<00:01:41.730> of<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.970> hair<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.360> also<00:01:43.230> using

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
darkest area of the hair and also using

00:01:43.650 --> 00:02:00.830 
darkest area of the hair and also using
this<00:01:43.800> to<00:01:44.040> blend<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.490> two<00:01:44.730> colors<00:01:44.760> together

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.690 

another<00:02:01.840> good<00:02:02.079> way<00:02:02.289> to<00:02:02.350> create<00:02:02.770> highlights<00:02:03.340> is

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
another good way to create highlights is

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:20.250 
another good way to create highlights is
to<00:02:04.329> use<00:02:04.479> a<00:02:04.509> small<00:02:05.110> eraser

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.910 

in<00:02:21.260> some<00:02:22.010> areas<00:02:22.460> that<00:02:22.760> are<00:02:22.820> darker<00:02:23.780> or<00:02:24.050> the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
your drawing and the more you take your

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.390
