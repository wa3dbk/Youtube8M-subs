00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:09.860
 that a race as they are welcome to 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.650
 one more of my videos here we are 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.959
 playing with control he cited this that 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.060
 I showed in the last video only for 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:18.310
 show them how well it works we're going to 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.560
 start 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.599
 while we are here playing this game 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.150
 pieces burnout civil paradise I'm going to 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.430
 talk a little about the fact control by 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.410
 that 's why I made the video to talk to them 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.779
 a little bit of control would be more or less 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.809
 as a prohibited at best nothing of the 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:38.589
 which is this control cited more than a 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:41.290
 video gameplay that well this is 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:44.840
 the game I could not in his time much 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.640
 when I had just left in fact I have 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.200
 and now they do not have a career 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.650
 you can still enter the races 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.650
 private 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:55.380
 so I've only been playing for 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.930
 to test the control this to set 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.050
 I eat how you can notice the 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.360
 wait is not on because this 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.670
 game is not compatible with the 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.800
 playstation or this game is not 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.040
 compatible with the playstation but of 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.120
 same way registers the steering wheel as if 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.610
 it was a regular control so since 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.980
 several games are I do not have many worlds 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.500
 of races I do not have the modus and 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.450
 this so the games the hard few 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.840
 of career that I have all cullen 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.940
 with the seller and they all work 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.100
 made up to one of ships that I have 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.190
 it's also about working with the steering wheel 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.150
 so that seems like a very, very, very 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.640
 very tall person connect the playstation 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.160
 Move to the accessory this automatically 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.070
 makes it like a control 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.920
 regular 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.810
 The only thing that changes is that you do not have the 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.290
 two levers because everyone else 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.970
 buttons includes this front what 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.580
 only that you do not have are the two levers 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.580
 the left lever because the camera the 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.440
 would change for what has been the 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:06.640
 movement this right is what we 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.560
 you need the buttons this month 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.479
 to look back and this is for 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.520
 change of seasons I think it comes 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.720
 being aha is the same as it is 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:19.239
 the l1 and I shelter you in this in those in 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.700
 these levers that are here and with the 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:24.270
 truth that is so very process 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.770
 any racing game 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.570
 automatically when you buy the accessory 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.640
 this one of the steering wheel in ristre and added 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.410
 any racing everything is done 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.860
 compatible with playstation move 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.860
 although it is not and that seems to me a lot and 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.230
 very well and as you can see it has a 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.780
 very chic precision you can 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.390
 control it super well in the car it 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.890
 you can control super well since you can 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.200
 be playstation 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.170
 very advanced precision can be 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.060
 control super super well the car the 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.730
 game of living planet parking is 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.160
 specially designed to play with the 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.950
 playstation moon so you can still 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.260
 to play super well there are some 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.700
 new games that will come out or that already 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.520
 they came out like the one in that 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.100
 training we wrote one on that already 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.160
 is compatible with the world so it's a 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.200
 weight can be better but those who 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.950
 they are not compatible with the equal world 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.410
 it works another thing that I liked a lot is 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:27.160
 the engines you have have engines 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:29.140
 vibration in each handle that you hold like that 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.480
 that when you hit someone say 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:35.170
 this side I tremble only this 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.660
 handle and if it hit the wall on this side 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.170
 I only tremble on this side if 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.989
 I have a frontal Latin impact what 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:47.170
 it's been the control engine so 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:50.769
 that you have three vibration motors that 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.260
 they are still there, do not get chingada 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:56.079
 what is brought to speed is efficient 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.480
 It has three vibration motors which 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.920
 I also thought it was very cool to have 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.410
 have that 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.720
 another thing that I liked is the pedals not 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.180
 good the triggers these is the 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.489
 accelerator and the brake I liked many 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.100
 since they have a curve like that person 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.230
 where you can listen to him and he has a lot 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.930
 you have a lot of pressure to be able to 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.419
 regulate the speed well you can go to 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.780
 a slow speed to go 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:25.660
 controlling well you have very good very 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.660
 good control of the car accelerators 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.810
 Accelerator brake forgiveness is very 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.360
 well you can control us very well 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.330
 what is the plan of equal works very 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.730
 fine and one thing that if you have to do 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.730
 with any game like I said it is 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:44.040
 compatible or go back up here 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:46.169
 It is compatible with any game but 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.210
 when you start is a game that is not 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.400
 compatible with the playstation and 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.100
 turn on your playstation is going to 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.200
 register a number 7 smoker in control 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.030
 number 7 any game that is already 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.550
 compatible with it not automatically 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.710
 he knows that 9 is number seven and he goes 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.540
 to program the world but a game that 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.310
 is compatible with the world is not going to 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.229
 register will think that there is nothing 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.410
 there so what you have to do 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:12.780
 is you going to go to the menu and you're going to leave 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.360
 control settings and there you will appear 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.400
 to you as a player number 7 on 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.860
 playstation move what you're going to have to 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.800
 do is select it and put it in 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.750
 player 1 that's what I already 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:28.180
 it automatically makes you hungry 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.190
 be compatible with playstation move and 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.740
 that seems super good to me you can play 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:37.210
 any when racing with this 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:39.640
 steering wheel is in Chinese I liked it very much and 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.530
 well, if you are a player that 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.690
 they like racing games and already 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.060
 you have the playstation that you like 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.430
 you finish all of the colors of 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.290
 movement like this kind of thing the 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:54.490
 I really recommend it to you for years 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:57.130
 in the shaking comments all the engines 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:59.710
 They trembled and this one I recommend 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.510
 very much these super simÃ³n that for good already 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.669
 to not make this video longer 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.550
 I just wanted to show you more or less 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:09.210
 how does it work 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.950
 I already say goodbye I will continue playing a 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.200
 I've been playing a little bit of 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.910
 space to run a bit of space 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.160
 because I do not want to hit what I'm 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.770
 talking but good luck the next 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.690
 once I hit the term the video I'm going to 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.910
 try to get some speed 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.830
 unequaled every time you edit the time to see 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:28.050
 until when did it collide and is it much that 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.090
 we finish the video we take it later 

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.450
 thank you formidable and have a happy 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.450
 day 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:18.720
 received passing that corner we listen to what 

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.720
 that they had online
