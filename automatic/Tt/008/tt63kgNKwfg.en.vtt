James and he said this is a task I've

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.750 
James and he said this is a task I've
spent<00:00:07.529> a<00:00:07.589> whole<00:00:07.770> day<00:00:07.830> looping<00:00:08.490> through

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
spent a whole day looping through

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.360 
spent a whole day looping through
looking<00:00:09.690> through<00:00:09.750> forums<00:00:10.349> I<00:00:10.559> can't<00:00:10.860> find<00:00:11.160> out

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
looking through forums I can't find out

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.770 
looking through forums I can't find out
how<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.580> do<00:00:11.700> it<00:00:11.880> I<00:00:12.000> want<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.269> have<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.420> shape<00:00:12.750> like

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
how to do it I want to have a shape like

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.990 
how to do it I want to have a shape like
a<00:00:13.049> box<00:00:13.380> or<00:00:13.620> something<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.280> when<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:14.610> move<00:00:14.849> my

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
a box or something and when I move my

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.910 
a box or something and when I move my
mouse<00:00:15.179> over<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.719> I'd<00:00:16.020> like<00:00:16.230> it<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.410> run<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.680> macro

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
mouse over it I'd like it to run a macro

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.269 
mouse over it I'd like it to run a macro
so<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:19.109> could<00:00:19.260> just<00:00:19.470> be<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.680> message<00:00:20.039> box

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
so and it could just be a message box

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.220 
so and it could just be a message box
that<00:00:20.430> says<00:00:20.609> have<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:20.820> great<00:00:21.210> day<00:00:21.449> any<00:00:21.960> help

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
that says have a great day any help

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.300 
that says have a great day any help
would<00:00:22.320> be<00:00:22.380> appreciated

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
would be appreciated

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.599 
would be appreciated
so<00:00:23.670> James<00:00:23.970> we<00:00:24.359> absolutely<00:00:24.660> can<00:00:25.140> do<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.609> it's

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
so James we absolutely can do that it's

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.179 
so James we absolutely can do that it's
not<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.420> way<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.570> think<00:00:28.019> perhaps<00:00:28.260> when<00:00:29.070> you

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
not the way you think perhaps when you

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.370 
not the way you think perhaps when you
go<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.369> insert<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.449> go<00:00:30.570> to<00:00:30.630> shapes<00:00:31.019> and

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
go to insert and you go to shapes and

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.930 
go to insert and you go to shapes and
let's<00:00:31.619> just<00:00:31.769> use<00:00:31.890> one<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.250> these<00:00:32.369> bubble<00:00:32.759> ones

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
let's just use one of these bubble ones

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.360 
let's just use one of these bubble ones
for<00:00:33.180> example<00:00:33.290> just<00:00:34.290> make<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.440> big<00:00:34.710> giant<00:00:34.950> button

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
for example just make a big giant button

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.610 
for example just make a big giant button
so<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:35.969> think<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.510> know<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.690> want<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.440> want

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
so you think you know you want you want

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.020 
so you think you know you want you want
it<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.770> be<00:00:37.890> when<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.160> move<00:00:38.340> your<00:00:38.489> mouse<00:00:38.670> not

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
it to be when you move your mouse not

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.130 
it to be when you move your mouse not
when<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.270> click<00:00:39.540> but<00:00:39.719> when<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.899> move<00:00:40.020> your

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
when you click but when you move your

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.970 
when you click but when you move your
mouse<00:00:40.350> where<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.370> will<00:00:41.520> trigger<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.570> macro<00:00:43.230> so

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
mouse where it will trigger a macro so

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.000 
mouse where it will trigger a macro so
the<00:00:44.340> problem<00:00:44.700> with<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.360> shape<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.410> one

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
the problem with that is a shape is one

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.350 
the problem with that is a shape is one
of<00:00:47.100> those<00:00:47.219> things<00:00:47.489> where<00:00:47.670> you<00:00:47.730> have<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:48.000> assign

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
of those things where you have to assign

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.260 
of those things where you have to assign
the<00:00:48.600> macro<00:00:48.899> kind<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.289> like<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.590> developer

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
the macro kind of like the developer

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.479 
the macro kind of like the developer
insert<00:00:51.270> form<00:00:52.199> controls<00:00:52.890> like<00:00:53.190> one<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.399> these

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
insert form controls like one of these

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.520 
insert form controls like one of these
form<00:00:53.760> control<00:00:54.120> buttons<00:00:54.449> or<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.050> can't<00:00:55.289> really

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
form control buttons or you can't really

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.979 
form control buttons or you can't really
have<00:00:56.250> a<00:00:58.340> there's<00:00:59.340> only<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.760> macro<00:01:00.510> assigned<00:01:00.840> to

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
have a there's only a macro assigned to

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.900 
have a there's only a macro assigned to
clicking<00:01:01.320> on<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.649> button<00:01:01.890> there's<00:01:02.039> not<00:01:02.730> like

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
clicking on the button there's not like

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.789 
clicking on the button there's not like
different<00:01:03.329> events<00:01:03.750> like<00:01:04.290> when<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.619> have

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
different events like when you have

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.130 
different events like when you have
ActiveX<00:01:05.580> controls<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.330> can<00:01:06.479> have<00:01:06.600> events

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
ActiveX controls you can have events

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.750 
ActiveX controls you can have events
such<00:01:07.320> as<00:01:07.350> mouse<00:01:07.799> move<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.400> what<00:01:08.580> you're

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
such as mouse move is what you're

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.850 
such as mouse move is what you're
thinking<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.240> but<00:01:09.780> there<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.350> workaround

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
thinking of but there is a workaround

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.060 
thinking of but there is a workaround
that<00:01:11.040> comes<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.490> mind<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.880> we<00:01:12.060> could<00:01:12.240> try<00:01:13.070> if

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
that comes to mind that we could try if

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.830 
that comes to mind that we could try if
you<00:01:14.220> go<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.400> insert<00:01:14.790> on<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.360> Developer<00:01:15.810> tab

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
you go to insert on the Developer tab

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.350 
you go to insert on the Developer tab
and<00:01:16.380> go<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.890> ActiveX<00:01:17.580> controls<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.240> let's

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
and go to ActiveX controls and let's

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.080 
and go to ActiveX controls and let's
just<00:01:18.509> use<00:01:18.630> maybe<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.320> label<00:01:19.830> because<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.610> label

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
just use maybe a label because a label

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.390 
just use maybe a label because a label
we<00:01:21.210> can<00:01:21.390> make<00:01:21.540> transparent<00:01:22.350> so<00:01:23.070> let's<00:01:23.220> make<00:01:23.369> a

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
we can make transparent so let's make a

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.460 
we can make transparent so let's make a
giant<00:01:23.520> label<00:01:24.270> about<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.810> size<00:01:25.080> and

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
giant label about the size and

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.200 
giant label about the size and
dimensions<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.580> you're<00:01:26.880> thinking

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
dimensions of that and you're thinking

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.819 
dimensions of that and you're thinking
well<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.630> kind<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.350> defeats<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.770> purpose

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
well that kind of defeats the purpose

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.039 
well that kind of defeats the purpose
because<00:01:29.340> it<00:01:29.460> covers<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.880> up<00:01:30.060> well<00:01:30.720> let's

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
because it covers it up well let's

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.569 
because it covers it up well let's
right-click<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.650> go<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.740> properties<00:01:32.220> first

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
right-click and go to properties first

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.760 
right-click and go to properties first
of<00:01:32.850> all<00:01:33.000> let's<00:01:33.780> take<00:01:33.930> away<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.409> thing<00:01:34.619> that

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
of all let's take away the thing that

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.999 
of all let's take away the thing that
says<00:01:34.950> label<00:01:35.189> 1<00:01:35.549> on<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.909> caption<00:01:36.390> here<00:01:36.740> so<00:01:37.740> that

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
says label 1 on the caption here so that

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.920 
says label 1 on the caption here so that
at<00:01:38.220> least<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.640> will<00:01:38.820> be<00:01:38.939> blank<00:01:39.270> now<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.600> next

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
at least that will be blank now the next
