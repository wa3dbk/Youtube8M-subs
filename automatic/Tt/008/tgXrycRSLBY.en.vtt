10 insider preview build 10,000 74 so
the<00:00:10.650> first<00:00:10.860> thing<00:00:11.099> I<00:00:11.610> notice<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.389> that<00:00:12.840> the

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
the first thing I notice is that the

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.970 
the first thing I notice is that the
taskbar<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.160> start<00:00:14.340> menu<00:00:14.969> are<00:00:15.150> now

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
taskbar and start menu are now

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.290 
taskbar and start menu are now
transparent<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:18.170> have<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.439> blurry<00:00:20.130> effect<00:00:20.460> to

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
transparent and have a blurry effect to

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.820 
transparent and have a blurry effect to
the<00:00:21.390> background<00:00:21.990> which<00:00:22.140> i<00:00:22.320> think<00:00:22.380> is<00:00:22.619> really

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
the background which i think is really

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.740 
the background which i think is really
nice<00:00:23.100> because<00:00:23.340> it<00:00:23.580> reminds<00:00:23.939> me<00:00:24.000> of<00:00:24.119> arrow<00:00:24.359> and

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
nice because it reminds me of arrow and

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.179 
nice because it reminds me of arrow and
arrow<00:00:25.740> everyone<00:00:26.490> like<00:00:26.670> Darrow<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:28.010> see<00:00:29.010> that

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
arrow everyone like Darrow I see that

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.810 
arrow everyone like Darrow I see that
the<00:00:29.310> power<00:00:29.609> button<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.029> moved<00:00:30.359> down<00:00:30.750> there<00:00:31.050> and

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
the power button is moved down there and

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.120 
the power button is moved down there and
I<00:00:32.820> don't<00:00:33.000> see<00:00:33.180> icons<00:00:33.690> on<00:00:33.960> these<00:00:34.230> but<00:00:34.950> I'm

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
I don't see icons on these but I'm

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.910 
I don't see icons on these but I'm
comparing<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.840> the<00:00:36.840> previous<00:00:37.680> build

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
comparing this to the previous build

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.330 
comparing this to the previous build
which<00:00:38.430> was<00:00:38.899> 10,000<00:00:39.899> 41<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.620> can't<00:00:41.129> remember

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
which was 10,000 41 I can't remember

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.889 
which was 10,000 41 I can't remember
these<00:00:41.700> head<00:00:41.879> icons<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.570> think<00:00:42.870> they<00:00:42.989> didn't<00:00:44.899> we

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
these head icons I think they didn't we

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.920 
these head icons I think they didn't we
have<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.559> new<00:00:47.399> apps<00:00:47.789> here<00:00:48.770> this<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.930> new

have the new apps here this is the new
outlook<00:00:52.440> app<00:00:52.969> which<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.360> think<00:00:54.690> looks<00:00:54.899> really

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
outlook app which I think looks really

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.689 
outlook app which I think looks really
nice<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:56.539> they're<00:00:57.539> taking<00:00:58.170> use<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.739> the

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
nice and they're taking use of the

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.000 
nice and they're taking use of the

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
stretch which I guess is a bit probably

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.360 
stretch which I guess is a bit probably

bigger<00:04:28.090> so<00:04:28.389> easy<00:04:28.690> to<00:04:28.900> skip<00:04:29.199> through<00:04:29.470> I<00:04:32.100> think

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
bigger so easy to skip through I think

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.969

but I haven't really had much time to
test<00:04:37.870> this<00:04:37.990> one<00:04:38.169> yet<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:42.490> calculator<00:04:43.479> can<00:04:43.750> be

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:04.539 
themes from here which I notice there

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:06.330 
themes from here which I notice there
are<00:07:04.690> they<00:07:05.050> remove<00:07:05.410> some<00:07:05.590> options<00:07:06.009> from<00:07:06.100> this

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:06.340

are they remove some options from this
control<00:07:07.090> panel<00:07:08.070> and<00:07:09.070> I<00:07:09.880> think<00:07:10.090> just<00:07:10.270> showed

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:10.449 
control panel and I think just showed

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:14.610 
control panel and I think just showed
you<00:07:10.630> everything<00:07:10.780> oh<00:07:12.780> you<00:07:13.780> can<00:07:13.930> also<00:07:14.080> make<00:07:14.410> the

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:14.620 
you everything oh you can also make the

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:18.170 
you everything oh you can also make the
start<00:07:15.160> menu<00:07:15.310> transparent<00:07:16.060> or<00:07:16.210> no<00:07:16.300> engineering

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.180 
start menu transparent or no engineering

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.600 
start menu transparent or no engineering
so<00:07:19.180> you<00:07:19.270> can<00:07:19.449> snow<00:07:19.630> longer<00:07:19.900> transparent<00:07:20.610> but

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:21.610 
so you can snow longer transparent but

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.550 
so you can snow longer transparent but
obviously<00:07:22.030> I<00:07:22.120> like<00:07:22.330> the<00:07:22.419> transparency<00:07:23.169> but<00:07:23.320> I

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:23.560 
obviously I like the transparency but I

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.230 
obviously I like the transparency but I
guess<00:07:23.919> for<00:07:23.949> some<00:07:24.250> of<00:07:24.490> you<00:07:24.639> who<00:07:24.669> don't<00:07:24.940> like<00:07:25.150> the

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.240 
guess for some of you who don't like the

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.580 
guess for some of you who don't like the
transparency<00:07:25.780> you'll<00:07:26.020> have<00:07:26.169> pretty<00:07:26.410> slow

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:26.590 
transparency you'll have pretty slow

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:28.140 
transparency you'll have pretty slow
computers<00:07:27.070> because<00:07:27.400> the<00:07:27.550> option<00:07:27.820> turn<00:07:28.000> that

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:28.150 
computers because the option turn that

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:32.659 
computers because the option turn that
off<00:07:28.330> I<00:07:28.949> can<00:07:29.949> also<00:07:30.099> change<00:07:30.250> these<00:07:30.820> two<00:07:31.180> black

00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:32.669 
off I can also change these two black

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:36.330 
off I can also change these two black
but<00:07:33.669> I<00:07:33.849> prefer<00:07:34.330> green<00:07:35.009> because<00:07:36.009> you<00:07:36.220> know

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:36.340 
but I prefer green because you know

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:40.110 
but I prefer green because you know
that's<00:07:36.550> my<00:07:36.699> fav<00:07:36.910> color<00:07:37.259> and<00:07:38.550> I<00:07:39.550> guess<00:07:39.820> that<00:07:40.090> is

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:40.120 
that's my fav color and I guess that is

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.260 
that's my fav color and I guess that is
it<00:07:40.509> for<00:07:41.039> this<00:07:42.039> video<00:07:42.280> I<00:07:42.729> think<00:07:43.000> I've<00:07:43.090> showed
