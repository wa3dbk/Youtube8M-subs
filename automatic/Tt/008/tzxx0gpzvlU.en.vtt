the mental you can zoom and you can

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.920 
the mental you can zoom and you can
quite<00:01:33.890> a<00:01:34.039> quick<00:01:34.490> walk<00:01:34.640> distances<00:01:35.210> and<00:01:35.420> it's<00:01:35.840> an

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
quite a quick walk distances and it's an

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:36.710 
quite a quick walk distances and it's an
automatic

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
automatic

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.260 
automatic
and<00:01:37.230> so<00:01:38.160> we'll<00:01:38.460> just<00:01:38.670> we'll<00:01:38.820> just<00:01:38.850> try<00:01:39.090> our

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
and so we'll just we'll just try our

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.490 
and so we'll just we'll just try our
disability<00:01:40.200> because<00:01:41.720> okay<00:01:42.720> who<00:01:43.080> knows<00:01:43.260> i'll

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
disability because okay who knows i'll

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.230 
disability because okay who knows i'll
point<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.890> graduate<00:01:44.280> carbonyl<00:01:44.730> and<00:01:44.910> those

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
point the graduate carbonyl and those

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.270 
point the graduate carbonyl and those
scenes<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:45.810> caesars<00:01:46.230> Edison<00:01:46.620> we<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:46.890> we<00:01:47.130> can

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
scenes in caesars Edison we can we can

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.000 
scenes in caesars Edison we can we can
zoom<00:01:47.310> out<00:01:47.580> on<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.150> so<00:01:49.050> it's<00:01:49.140> just<00:01:49.260> you<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:49.890> a

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
zoom out on and so it's just you have a

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.400 
zoom out on and so it's just you have a
