00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 so it's for a video to know 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.680
 make a nice mouse that does not cost 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.280
 practically nothing but a unit of 1 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.130
 liter to the stars and half units of either 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:19.470
 coca cola be a normal bottle so 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:24.720
 here and a number rate but not in a 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.910
 scissors and maybe scotch and you 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.949
 may do scot then liters of 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.380
 big scotch like these is not the 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:37.920
 does if not walk forward then he 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.760
 will have to take the dow loses more in 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.950
 details here 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:50.190
 see me I took my role as 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:52.410
 it's not a bottle I 'm going to remove 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:01:04.530
 the moment is better to have it but the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:06.810
 family and at the moment we're here because 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.400
 that like the bottle brush then 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.659
 you will take the chisel once 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.360
 that you have a hole in the bottle 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.220
 with the rates take them the sco and 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.280
 you will go around 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:22.590
 but bi goua I specify that it is necessary 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:26.790
 a place to play at that moment the same 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:33.110
 if it's not nickel mitteland but 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:36.710
 how good is the principle following 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.710
 you will have to 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:47.350
 then you will have to take 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:51.939
 often the masters this one like this 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:55.280
 or you must not influence too much and 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:59.329
 Here you have your mouse to stone it 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.250
 you remain in control as a means of rate 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.630
 of Damascus I made the stop but also 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.909
 in a provocation it is expensive 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.520
 you said then I do not have 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.729
 need it on there that jean luc ferry 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.610
 3d yes I will forget you 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:17.660
 so what are you left of? 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:20.420
 put small grains of wheat or 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.720
 corn but I advise you wheat is 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.970
 a little peace in it you put it by 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.769
 there and then either you put it on 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.720
 clichÃ©s but these police the mouse 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.069
 can come out 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.230
 either you put it like that and it's 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.660
 much better mud how to do 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.870
 when in fact you explain the trick 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.359
 Mouse goes like home to fall and 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:47.000
 will not be able to go back up here it is 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:48.620
 very simple go we will end up deposit 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.220
 for a next video on the traps 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.220
