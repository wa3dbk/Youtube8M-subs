00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:15.450
 to prepare chicken the cream with 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:18.270
 peppers we are going to need six pieces 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.970
 of thighs without bone a quarter of a half 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.820
 cream 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:26.210
 a quarter cup of milk half onion 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.579
 two peppers two tablespoons 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.000
 butter a teaspoon of consommÃ© 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:33.980
 chicken salt and pepper first thing 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.650
 let's do is remove all the fat 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.910
 that brings the chicken so that our 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:45.100
 saucer does not come out with a lot of fat 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.100
 in addition there is that meat 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.879
 the fat that has above 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.450
 and so we're going to do it with all the 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.190
 other pieces 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.630
 now what are we going to do in our room 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.310
 our module we are going to do more 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.400
 small incisions in the part of 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.400
 above 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.180
 without completely cutting what is the 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:16.290
 piece only 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.290
 let's tear a little the surface 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.009
 and on the side of the sale also 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.820
 and so we're going to do it with all the 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.070
 pieces once we have them already 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.510
 all 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.350
 we are going to put 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:38.119
 a little bit of salt 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.119
 and pepper on both sides 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.659
 and so we're going to do it with all 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.189
 our pieces 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.189
 on both sides 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.770
 and grandchildren 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.760
 to 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.920
 in a pan over medium heat we go to 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.420
 melt the two tablespoons of 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.660
 butter and let's 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.330
 put the chicken 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.170
 and we're going to cook it over medium heat 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.170
 On low heat 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.040
 until it is completely browned by 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.409
 both sides while I was cooking 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.450
 our chicken simmered in the 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:33.959
 butter let's start our 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.959
 onion 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.860
 administer it 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.810
 let's break it into big pieces since 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.320
 then we will liquefy it to fry it 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.320
 a little 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.700
 let's go 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.150
 the pepper 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.150
 that brings out the center 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:11.200
 and we remove the peduncle 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:15.040
 just curtains like this big pieces 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.569
 let's go to and you have to take the 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.209
 candle 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.209
 to the peppers very carefully 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.500
 we make the veins 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:34.960
 visit we leave in pieces 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.550
 to fry them right now because 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.940
 we have cut the onion and the peppers 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.230
 let's add what we are in 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.950
 the butter where we are 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.150
 Seeing our support 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:51.049
 let's put the 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.049
 of onion 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.760
 let's flip our chicken that already 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.870
 it is perfectly golden on one side 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.870
 let's turn 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:13.909
 and we're going to continue to do it for the 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:13.909
 other side that we do not yet record something 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.459
 and move the onions a little so that they 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.810
 soak with butter and let's 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.810
 add also the peppers 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.930
 and we're going to let everything get golden 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.500
 perfectly 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.570
 a few moments 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.570
 once the peppers and the onions 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:45.730
 They are soft and completely cooked 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.730
 we take them out and we're going to liquefy them 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.320
 once it has been known chicken 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.160
 I took it out and now I'm going to do it with a 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.160
 wipe I go to 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:10.400
 I will clean with a washcloth and I will 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:13.660
 observe a little of the butter that 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.660
 it was in the background 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.060
 you have to clean it very well 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.310
 since it is clean we put it on fire 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:29.630
 minimum the pan and we will add the 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.630
 liquefied chilli 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:45.029
 and we're going to cook a few 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:45.029
 minutes 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:55.330
 I'm going to add a little salt 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:55.330
 and a little pepper 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:08.090
 and I'm also going to add 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:10.130
 a teaspoon of chicken broth 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.320
 you have to incorporate everything very well 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.210
 software assault us at minimum fire and 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.780
 let's add 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:20.740
 a quarter of a cup of milk and we're going to 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:20.740
 stir 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.330
 incorporating 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.560
 and we're going to add the average room 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.560
 cream 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:52.660
 you have to do this at minimum fire because 

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:55.720
 if the cream get to boil it more 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:59.480
 could cut anything else is to give 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:01.480
 temperature and that is warm 

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:04.770
 since it is completely incorporated 

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:08.210
 let's add 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.210
 our pieces 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:16.190
 let's cover the pieces perfectly 

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:18.270
 with the cream and we're going to 

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:22.050
 cooking 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:25.440
 for about three to five minutes in the 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:27.620
 cream so they impregnate a little the 

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.620
 taste 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:33.510
 and then we will serve 

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.550
 we can accompany this dish with 

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:40.740
 a little white rice 

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.480
 and with the drink of your preference I hope 

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:45.200
 that you liked this video and the 

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.200
