00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.269
 hello so today ask me you 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.830
 offers a summer jobs yuke 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.500
 is fast approaching and it gives us 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.170
 really like to use colors 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.630
 at least I love the colors and then 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.580
 the summer we prepare faster so 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.410
 again in this video I show that my 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.270
 girlfriend the first thing I do if 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.810
 I apply my 37 in color 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.789
 turquoise everywhere on the mobile eyelid 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.570
 it's a limited statement for the summer 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:37.239
 who will be coming out next month so gone 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.870
 look for it then with a brush I 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:43.149
 just want to go smadj and all and then 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.860
 it is certain that in this month of June we 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.130
 share a little intensity but it's 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.149
 only I apply it as a base 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.070
 so you know how to help us look for 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.989
 a lot more color to the tray 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.280
 then prince I'm going to apply under 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:01:00.550
 their eyes I take the color 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.719
 turquoise if I pressed his share all 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.549
 we folded note win7 that we can see 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.310
 why I love the twin set is a 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:10.420
 very very adherent product we apply 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.820
 something over it comes 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:19.119
 really look for a lot of intensity 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:21.580
 a color I support that everywhere so 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.880
 when we say so with a character 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.650
 flared now I want to go smoke 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.010
 the ends where I applied the 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:35.350
 really a natural color say the 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:36.430
 out of summer or in intensity or that 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.729
 can see the judgment that color 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.110
 variable or a point that insults for 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.150
 help us to have a beautiful treatment 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.400
 I'm learning a world if these controllers 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.840
 my skin pressing what am I going 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:52.900
 to do that foot just below 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:55.450
 worries then mounting the bottom in the 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.560
 corridors underneath that had us 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.840
 a lot with the transition with the 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.540
 white stripe of the product I apply alone 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.500
 gesture over that will create a point 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.899
 light then also in the corner 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.730
 internal of the eye for and former drug addict 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.609
 remake our eyes even more nobody 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.130
 however the other end of the twin set 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:20.710
 on the feet this radical 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.660
 very generously we can see that the 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.920
 look is really no one like 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.780
 that too I will take 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.030
 this is one of the last steps I'm you 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.250
 promise a number of dark traps the 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.580
 senegal that are as close as possible 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.980
 of missiles I think I made a 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.890
 rope and rations of the really black 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.250
 piercing the mucosa that is going to form in 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.690
 it all rests so we're done 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.180
 eyes that we can see it's really a 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.430
 piercing look or color 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.930

 I love the drama that it adds a yuke 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.220

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.950
