00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.910 

because<00:00:00.510> I<00:00:00.630> guess<00:00:00.780> the<00:00:00.989> bot<00:00:01.140> didn't<00:00:01.500> feel<00:00:01.740> like

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
because I guess the bot didn't feel like

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:24.550 
because I guess the bot didn't feel like
actually<00:00:02.159> giving<00:00:02.669> me<00:00:02.700> anything

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.760 

okay<00:00:25.560> well<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.130> got<00:00:26.430> into<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.789> queue<00:00:27.150> as<00:00:27.270> you<00:00:27.449> saw

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.380 
okay well I got into a queue as you saw
waited<00:00:28.770> for<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.130> bots<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.490> offer<00:00:29.669> me<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.090> trade

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
waited for the bots to offer me to trade

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.020 
waited for the bots to offer me to trade
and<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:31.169> did<00:00:31.320> not<00:00:31.470> offer<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.520> thing<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.850> is

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
and it did not offer and the thing is is

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.939 
and it did not offer and the thing is is
like<00:00:33.059> for<00:00:33.390> instance<00:00:33.480> my<00:00:33.780> requested<00:00:34.410> returns<00:00:34.800> I

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:34.949 
like for instance my requested returns I

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:39.579 
like for instance my requested returns I
requested<00:00:35.370> everything<00:00:35.699> that<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:35.879> won<00:00:37.970> but<00:00:38.970> I

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:39.589 
requested everything that I won but I

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:48.140 
requested everything that I won but I
won<00:00:40.589> maybe<00:00:45.800> 13<00:00:46.800> items<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.610> so<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.030> my

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
won maybe 13 items and so this is my

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.819 
won maybe 13 items and so this is my
third<00:00:48.480> time<00:00:48.540> because<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.440> don't<00:00:49.589> get<00:00:49.710> all

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
third time because you don't get all

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.829 
third time because you don't get all
your<00:00:49.860> items<00:00:50.250> back<00:00:50.460> what<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.180> do<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.600> sit

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:51.839 
your items back what you do is you sit

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:53.569 
your items back what you do is you sit
here<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.199> do<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.980> until<00:00:53.370> you

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
here and you do this until you

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.280 
here and you do this until you
get<00:00:55.729> until<00:00:56.729> you<00:00:56.760> get<00:00:57.000> you're<00:00:57.420> into<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.080> queue

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
get until you get you're into the queue

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.660 
get until you get you're into the queue
and<00:00:58.440> then<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.650> bots<00:00:58.799> offers<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.220> trade<00:00:59.549> and

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
and then the bots offers you a trade and

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.520 
and then the bots offers you a trade and
it's<00:00:59.820> usually<00:01:00.000> four<00:01:00.449> items<00:01:00.930> four<00:01:01.229> or<00:01:01.350> five

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
it's usually four items four or five

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.619 
it's usually four items four or five
items<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.129> then<00:01:02.670> eventually<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.479> know<00:01:03.570> you

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
items and then eventually you know you

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.969 
items and then eventually you know you
can<00:01:03.960> get<00:01:04.049> them<00:01:04.170> from<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.439> bots<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.619> then<00:01:04.920> you

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
can get them from the bots and then you

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.350 
can get them from the bots and then you
have<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.189> go<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.580> rinse<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:05.939> repeat<00:01:06.210> this

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
have to go and rinse and repeat this

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.210 
have to go and rinse and repeat this
process<00:01:06.530> because<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.560> bot<00:01:07.920> doesn't

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
process because that bot doesn't

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.340 
process because that bot doesn't
necessarily<00:01:08.729> have<00:01:08.880> all<00:01:09.030> your<00:01:09.119> items<00:01:09.680> you<00:01:12.350> know

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
necessarily have all your items you know

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.570 
necessarily have all your items you know
because<00:01:13.710> it's<00:01:13.860> just<00:01:13.890> what's<00:01:14.159> in<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.400> BOTS

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
because it's just what's in the BOTS

because it's just what's in the BOTS
