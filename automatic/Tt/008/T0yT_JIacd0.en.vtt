00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.930 

so<00:05:23.650> we've<00:05:23.800> left<00:05:24.010> Havana<00:05:24.370> and<00:05:24.580> reached<00:05:24.790> our

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
so we've left Havana and reached our

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.880 
so we've left Havana and reached our
targets<00:05:25.300> hide<00:05:25.420> out<00:05:25.630> here<00:05:25.840> we<00:05:26.470> can<00:05:26.620> see<00:05:26.740> that
