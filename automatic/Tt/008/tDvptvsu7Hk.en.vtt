00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.130 
fish as you can see in we have some of
coral<00:00:30.410> bright<00:00:31.940> I'm<00:00:32.940> just<00:00:33.570> kind<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.870> shriveled

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
coral bright I'm just kind of shriveled

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.920 
coral bright I'm just kind of shriveled
up<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:35.399> don't<00:00:35.670> know<00:00:35.790> why<00:00:36.260> go<00:00:37.260> on<00:00:37.640> fetch<00:00:38.640> one

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
up and I don't know why go on fetch one

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.170 
up and I don't know why go on fetch one
one<00:00:39.930> down<00:00:40.079> here<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:41.399> doesn't<00:00:41.850> look<00:00:41.969> too

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
one down here and it doesn't look too

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.830 
one down here and it doesn't look too
good<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.570> don't<00:00:43.050> know<00:00:43.640> and<00:00:44.640> we'll<00:00:44.820> fish<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.719> a

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
good I don't know and we'll fish is a

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:54.410 
good I don't know and we'll fish is a
fish<00:00:47.539> snail<00:00:48.800> here<00:00:51.350> regular<00:00:52.350> gravel<00:00:53.120> rock<00:00:54.120> I

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
fish snail here regular gravel rock I

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.880 
fish snail here regular gravel rock I
think<00:00:54.629> it's<00:00:54.750> probably<00:00:54.960> live<00:00:55.260> rock<00:00:55.530> by<00:00:55.710> now

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
think it's probably live rock by now

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.840 
think it's probably live rock by now
because<00:00:56.160> we<00:00:56.250> have<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:56.550> tank<00:00:56.820> for<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.030> year

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
because we have this tank for a year

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.340 
because we have this tank for a year
it's<00:00:59.850> cool<00:01:00.090> watch<00:01:00.329> when<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.079> don't<00:01:01.289> have

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
it's cool watch when you don't have

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.299 
it's cool watch when you don't have
anything<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.710> do<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:02.390> guess<00:01:03.799> you<00:01:04.799> know<00:01:04.920> we<00:01:05.189> have

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
anything to do I guess you know we have

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:12.260 
anything to do I guess you know we have
a<00:01:05.369> lower<00:01:07.760> skimmer<00:01:10.520> filter<00:01:11.520> that's<00:01:11.640> probably<00:01:12.150> a

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
a lower skimmer filter that's probably a

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.570 
a lower skimmer filter that's probably a
little<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.990> lot<00:01:13.439> bigger<00:01:13.850> than<00:01:14.930> gallons<00:01:15.930> then

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
little a lot bigger than gallons then

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.310 
little a lot bigger than gallons then
how<00:01:17.580> many<00:01:17.640> we<00:01:17.850> need<00:01:17.880> for<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.210> tank<00:01:18.420> which<00:01:19.290> is

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
how many we need for the tank which is

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.530 
how many we need for the tank which is
right<00:01:19.830> too<00:01:20.250> dark<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.909> can't<00:01:21.119> see<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.509> but

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
right too dark and you can't see it but

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.330 
right too dark and you can't see it but
that<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.759> filter<00:01:24.710> some<00:01:25.710> feeding<00:01:26.070> stuff

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
that is the filter some feeding stuff
