00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:05.680
 days and welcome to this video dedicated to the menu and navigation 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.169
 on opel elements 

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:11.969
 a menu allows you to facilitate and watch the navigation of your visitors 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.499
 on your website 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:17.250
 currently there are four main elements that make it possible to create a 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.539
 menu 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.539
 a button link to a page 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.539
 a link to a page 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.970
 a picture 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.320
 and a pop-up menu 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.330
 the pop-up menu and individuals 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.820
 that's why another video is dedicated to him 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.670
 we will not tackle the subject in this video 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.670
 we will focus on the classic menus 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.620
 to note 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.400
 you can also add a link to another page directly in a 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.840
 text element 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.650
 for example here 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.120
 I add a simple text element 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.120
 I add to nothing in my text 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.530
 and I give him a style 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.120
 it does not really concern the menus but it can be likened to a 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.120
 navigation element 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.570
 in the weekend website template 01 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.430
 we find the three main elements 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.230
 button link to a page 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.490
 this makes it possible to put an image in the background and make the whole area clickable 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.520
 link to a page 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.520
 only the text will be clickable 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.470
 picture 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.470
 since we can insert a link in the image 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:15.809
 in the property tab of the elements menu 

00:02:31.169 --> 00:02:34.169
 either through the quick access menu 

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:37.069
 Warning 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.119
 in an image no text has spoken 

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:42.939
 unless the text is embedded in the image 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:46.959
 but you can edit the alternative text ie the one that 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.959
 appears when the mouse are placed on the image 

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:58.119
 it's a plus for search engines 

00:02:58.119 --> 00:03:01.119
 your images will be better referenced 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:14.020
 each predefined template 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.890
 that we propose when creating a new project contains or 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.589
 several menus 

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:23.529
 to personalize your menus you have to go to the page that have been 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:25.739
 dropped the menu items 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.909
 usually they are on the base calc since this allows to display 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.909
 the menu on all pages that inherits is layered 

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:36.029
 to edit the text of a link 

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:39.349
 just double click in the text box and change its name 

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:45.119
 to modify the link, click on the link selection button 

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:48.179
 main in the quick access menu bar 

00:03:48.179 --> 00:03:51.179
 and define the new link 

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:04.479
 to add a menu item 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:07.699
 drag drop one of the four main menu items on the 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:10.699
 page 

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:15.009
 select a link 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:20.919
 renamed the element 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.419
 then standardize the style 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:31.860
 to do this 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.689
 select items and then change the role in the tab of 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:37.689
 customer menu items 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.650
 remember to refresh your page for changes to be made 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.650
 account 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:20.919
 regarding standardization of style 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:24.409
 remember that you can copy paste an already existing item 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:27.409
 this will save you from having to redo all styles 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.850
 you can obviously move or change the style of the menus already 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:34.849
 existing 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:46.519
 do not forget to save your changes for it to be taken 

00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:49.519
 account 

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:04.639
 first of all we recommend you create for menu on a calc range 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:07.639
 so that it applies to your entire site 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:11.969
 for the rest, go to the navigation category q menu of 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:14.969
 items 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:19.479
 he had put the menu item on your page 

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:25.080
 you have the choice between an internal link 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.180
 the visitor will be redirected to another page of your site 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:31.229
 where is external 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:34.229
 to another website 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:37.900
 select the link 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.900
 then click on validate 

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:44.759
 customize your granny's text 

00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:52.509
 and repeat the operation according to the number of links you want 

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:54.319
 add to your menu 

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:55.149
 right here 

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:58.149
 we will add 2 

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:16.979
 standardize style and position all menu items
