it's<00:03:11.819> burgers<00:03:12.239> but<00:03:13.170> one<00:03:13.650> good<00:03:13.860> thing<00:03:13.920> is<00:03:14.280> that

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
it's burgers but one good thing is that

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.009 
it's burgers but one good thing is that
there's<00:03:14.670> no<00:03:14.790> milky<00:03:15.180> solution<00:03:15.690> in<00:03:15.780> there<00:03:15.930> you

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
there's no milky solution in there you

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.539 
there's no milky solution in there you
want<00:03:16.200> to<00:03:16.230> watch<00:03:16.410> out<00:03:16.620> for<00:03:16.650> milky<00:03:17.069> solution

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
want to watch out for milky solution

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.970 
want to watch out for milky solution
that<00:03:17.730> means<00:03:17.910> that<00:03:18.120> there's<00:03:18.329> water<00:03:18.709> inside<00:03:19.709> you

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
that means that there's water inside you

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.360 
that means that there's water inside you
inside<00:03:20.459> your<00:03:20.670> lower<00:03:20.970> unit<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:22.129> that's<00:03:23.129> it

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
inside your lower unit and that's it

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.920 
inside your lower unit and that's it
that<00:03:23.549> leads<00:03:23.849> to<00:03:23.970> potential<00:03:24.269> problem<00:03:24.750> so

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
that leads to potential problem so

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.720 
that leads to potential problem so
what's<00:03:25.319> good<00:03:25.560> news<00:03:25.799> is<00:03:26.010> that<00:03:26.160> this<00:03:26.310> is<00:03:26.370> sealed

some new fluid in the the this pump me

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.860 
some new fluid in the the this pump me
really<00:03:44.310> something<00:03:44.970> that<00:03:45.120> they<00:03:45.269> are<00:03:45.299> that<00:03:45.750> they

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
really something that they are that they

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.899 
really something that they are that they
just<00:03:46.109> came<00:03:46.319> out<00:03:46.500> with<00:03:46.650> a<00:03:47.040> couple<00:03:47.400> years<00:03:47.760> ago

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:47.909 
just came out with a couple years ago

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.809 
just came out with a couple years ago
and<00:03:48.810> now<00:03:49.079> you<00:03:49.139> plug<00:03:49.470> it<00:03:49.620> right<00:03:49.739> in<00:03:49.950> just

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
and now you plug it right in just

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:51.979 
and now you plug it right in just
screwed<00:03:51.030> right<00:03:51.150> in<00:03:51.389> and<00:03:51.540> didn't<00:03:51.780> need<00:03:51.900> an

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
screwed right in and didn't need an

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.640 
screwed right in and didn't need an
adapter<00:03:52.470> and<00:03:53.190> now<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:53.819> just

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.220 

like<00:03:57.650> that<00:03:58.390> fires<00:03:59.390> of<00:03:59.689> hell

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.030 

until<00:04:03.230> you<00:04:03.319> go<00:04:03.470> through<00:04:03.500> about<00:04:03.890> two<00:04:04.400> quarts

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
until you go through about two quarts

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.839 
until you go through about two quarts
and<00:04:07.040> it<00:04:07.189> will<00:04:07.310> check<00:04:07.489> the<00:04:07.640> oil

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:16.430 

just<00:04:12.659> keep<00:04:12.840> pumping<00:04:14.659> okay<00:04:15.659> so<00:04:15.719> I<00:04:15.900> pumped<00:04:16.350> out

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
just keep pumping okay so I pumped out

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.909 
just keep pumping okay so I pumped out
three<00:04:17.239> three<00:04:18.239> quarts<00:04:18.539> of<00:04:18.600> an<00:04:18.780> oil<00:04:19.139> pumped<00:04:19.769> into

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
three three quarts of an oil pumped into

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.379 
three three quarts of an oil pumped into
the<00:04:20.220> GI<00:04:20.579> fries

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
the GI fries

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:23.180 
the GI fries
however<00:04:21.840> it's<00:04:22.049> still<00:04:22.139> a<00:04:22.289> little<00:04:22.500> shy<00:04:22.800> so<00:04:23.070> it

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
however it's still a little shy so it

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.550 
however it's still a little shy so it
probably<00:04:23.520> needs<00:04:23.810> like<00:04:24.810> maybe<00:04:25.020> another<00:04:25.229> ten

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
probably needs like maybe another ten

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.150 
probably needs like maybe another ten
pumps<00:04:25.949> or<00:04:26.100> a<00:04:26.430> third<00:04:27.360> more<00:04:27.840> so<00:04:28.350> if<00:04:28.830> you're<00:04:29.039> going

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
pumps or a third more so if you're going

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.620 
pumps or a third more so if you're going
to<00:04:29.250> do<00:04:29.370> it<00:04:29.490> should<00:04:29.699> be<00:04:29.759> get<00:04:30.000> four<00:04:30.210> quarts<00:04:30.539> of

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
to do it should be get four quarts of

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:36.980 
to do it should be get four quarts of

so<00:04:40.850> I've<00:04:41.850> pumped<00:04:42.120> it<00:04:42.270> all<00:04:42.360> through<00:04:42.600> the<00:04:42.780> good

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
so I've pumped it all through the good

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.439 
so I've pumped it all through the good
news<00:04:43.110> is<00:04:43.320> I've<00:04:43.949> only<00:04:44.099> got<00:04:44.340> the<00:04:44.490> three<00:04:44.789> but

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
news is I've only got the three but

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:47.210 
news is I've only got the three but

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
because it's a Volvo

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.420 
because it's a Volvo
it's<00:04:47.310> got<00:04:47.520> dipstick<00:04:48.479> on<00:04:48.660> top<00:04:48.870> and<00:04:49.620> tomorrow<00:04:50.220> we

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
can just top it off through the dipstick

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:53.960 
can just top it off through the dipstick
instead<00:04:52.979> of<00:04:53.070> having<00:04:53.220> to<00:04:53.340> worry<00:04:53.460> about<00:04:53.520> this<00:04:53.820> so
