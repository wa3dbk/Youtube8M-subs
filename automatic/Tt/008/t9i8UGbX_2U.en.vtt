we'll be taking this contest to a new

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.429 
we'll be taking this contest to a new

comparison<00:00:25.439> test<00:00:25.760> so<00:00:26.760> in<00:00:26.939> this<00:00:27.060> video<00:00:27.240> we'll

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
comparison test so in this video we'll

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.589 
comparison test so in this video we'll
be<00:00:27.660> comparing<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:29.029> signatures<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.060> Windows

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.750 
Defender
against<00:00:31.769> its<00:00:32.059> competitors<00:00:33.140> comodo<00:00:34.140> which<00:00:34.760> you

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
against its competitors comodo which you

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.520 
against its competitors comodo which you
know<00:00:35.850> well<00:00:36.180> my<00:00:36.360> guess<00:00:36.600> would<00:00:36.840> be<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.260> has

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
know well my guess would be it has

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.700 
know well my guess would be it has
average<00:00:38.160> signatures<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.030> MC<00:00:39.809> soft<00:00:40.050> it's<00:00:40.500> one

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
average signatures and MC soft it's one

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.280 
average signatures and MC soft it's one
of<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.950> best<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.489> department<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:42.360> we'll

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
of the best in the department so we'll

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.110 
of the best in the department so we'll
try<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.500> compare<00:00:43.920> against<00:00:44.340> an<00:00:44.489> average<00:00:44.910> and

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
try to compare against an average and

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.560 
try to compare against an average and
great<00:00:46.160> product<00:00:47.160> in<00:00:47.340> terms<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.820> signatures<00:00:48.300> and

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
great product in terms of signatures and

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.350 
great product in terms of signatures and
we'll<00:00:48.930> see<00:00:49.260> how<00:00:50.039> Windows<00:00:50.520> Defender<00:00:50.760> stands

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
we'll see how Windows Defender stands

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.110 
we'll see how Windows Defender stands
against<00:00:51.930> its<00:00:52.649> competitors<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.610> whether<00:00:53.940> or

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
against its competitors and whether or

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.209 
against its competitors and whether or
not<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.660> good<00:00:55.079> enough<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.320> be<00:00:55.620> your<00:00:55.800> basic

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
not it is good enough to be your basic

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.110 
not it is good enough to be your basic
anti-malware<00:00:56.969> solution<00:00:57.739> so<00:00:58.739> I've<00:00:59.550> got<00:00:59.850> three

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
anti-malware solution so I've got three

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.819 
anti-malware solution so I've got three
folders<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.750> malware<00:01:01.170> over<00:01:01.410> here

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
folders of malware over here

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.170 
folders of malware over here
each<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:02.219> them<00:01:02.430> have<00:01:04.070> 239<00:01:05.070> items<00:01:05.489> they're<00:01:05.909> all

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
each of them have 239 items they're all

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.250 
each of them have 239 items they're all
the<00:01:06.360> same<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:07.430> I'll<00:01:08.430> scan<00:01:08.880> them<00:01:09.150> with<00:01:09.720> each<00:01:10.020> of

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
the same and I'll scan them with each of

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.560 
the same and I'll scan them with each of
these<00:01:10.409> products<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.250> show<00:01:12.060> you<00:01:12.119> guys<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
these products and show you guys the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.240 
these products and show you guys the
results<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.170> we'll<00:01:13.320> see<00:01:13.530> who<00:01:13.710> comes<00:01:13.920> out<00:01:14.189> with

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
results and we'll see who comes out with

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.820 
results and we'll see who comes out with
the<00:01:14.610> best<00:01:14.820> detection<00:01:15.420> rate<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.810> how<00:01:16.380> Windows

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
the best detection rate and how Windows

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.370 
the best detection rate and how Windows
Defender<00:01:17.630> compares<00:01:18.630> with<00:01:18.900> these<00:01:19.140> two

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
Defender compares with these two

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.270 
Defender compares with these two
products<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.610> first<00:01:21.390> we'll<00:01:21.869> go<00:01:22.080> with<00:01:22.350> comodo

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
products so first we'll go with comodo

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.320 
products so first we'll go with comodo
cleaning<00:01:23.369> essentials<00:01:25.189> I'll<00:01:26.189> do<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.670> scan<00:01:27.060> and

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
cleaning essentials I'll do a scan and

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.780 
cleaning essentials I'll do a scan and
I'll<00:01:27.570> be<00:01:27.750> right<00:01:27.930> back<00:01:28.140> with<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.530> results

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.999 

tomato<00:01:32.790> has<00:01:33.180> finished<00:01:33.630> scanning<00:01:34.200> as<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.829> can

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
tomato has finished scanning as you can

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.580 
tomato has finished scanning as you can
see<00:01:35.360> so<00:01:36.680> we<00:01:37.680> won't<00:01:37.920> restart<00:01:38.840> because<00:01:39.840> we<00:01:40.380> don't

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
see so we won't restart because we don't

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.060 
see so we won't restart because we don't
need<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.920> scan<00:01:41.159> for<00:01:41.369> hidden<00:01:41.670> surfaces<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:43.110> as

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
need to scan for hidden surfaces so as

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.190 
need to scan for hidden surfaces so as
you<00:01:44.340> can<00:01:44.490> see<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:45.000> won't<00:01:45.329> be<00:01:45.570> counting<00:01:45.990> these

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
you can see I won't be counting these

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.429 
you can see I won't be counting these
files<00:01:46.530> Curtis<00:01:47.070> they're<00:01:47.430> just<00:01:47.670> temp<00:01:48.000> files

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
files Curtis they're just temp files

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:55.600 
files Curtis they're just temp files
created<00:01:49.439> by<00:01:49.470> Comodo<00:01:52.070> so<00:01:53.070> let's<00:01:53.369> see<00:01:53.549> we've<00:01:53.759> got

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
created by Comodo so let's see we've got

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:03.679 
created by Comodo so let's see we've got
106<00:01:56.610> items<00:01:59.540> which<00:02:00.540> means<00:02:01.939> komodo<00:02:02.939> gets<00:02:03.420> a

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
106 items which means komodo gets a

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.469 
106 items which means komodo gets a
detection<00:02:04.229> rate<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.610> 68<00:02:05.610> point<00:02:06.090> seven<00:02:06.450> three

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
detection rate of 68 point seven three

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.660 
detection rate of 68 point seven three
percent<00:02:09.080> these<00:02:10.080> files<00:02:10.379> were<00:02:10.770> really<00:02:11.610> new

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
percent these files were really new

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.120 
percent these files were really new
you<00:02:13.300> can<00:02:13.540> technically<00:02:14.050> call<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.680> sir<00:02:14.890> at<00:02:15.010> a

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
you can technically call it sir at a

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.729 
you can technically call it sir at a
malware<00:02:15.550> but<00:02:15.730> I'm<00:02:15.880> still<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:16.420> bit<00:02:17.140> disappointed

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
malware but I'm still a bit disappointed

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.800 
malware but I'm still a bit disappointed
with<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:18.040> detection<00:02:18.370> rate<00:02:18.640> I<00:02:18.880> was<00:02:19.300> expecting

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
with the detection rate I was expecting

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.710 
with the detection rate I was expecting
it<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:20.080> be<00:02:20.110> like<00:02:20.440> around<00:02:20.709> 75<00:02:21.459> to<00:02:21.700> 80<00:02:21.880> but

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
it to be like around 75 to 80 but

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.930 
it to be like around 75 to 80 but
nevertheless<00:02:23.050> we<00:02:23.590> will<00:02:23.770> continue<00:02:24.430> and<00:02:24.610> I'll

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
nevertheless we will continue and I'll

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:31.110 
nevertheless we will continue and I'll
be<00:02:25.120> back<00:02:25.270> with<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:25.540> results<00:02:26.110> for<00:02:26.349> MC<00:02:26.739> soft<00:02:30.120> MC

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
be back with the results for MC soft MC

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.140 
be back with the results for MC soft MC
soft<00:02:31.360> has<00:02:31.690> finished<00:02:32.110> scanning<00:02:32.770> so<00:02:33.220> let's<00:02:33.670> head

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
soft has finished scanning so let's head

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.590 
soft has finished scanning so let's head
over<00:02:34.510> there<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:34.959> take<00:02:35.260> a<00:02:35.290> look

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
over there and take a look

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.259 
over there and take a look
okay<00:02:37.600> so<00:02:37.660> we're<00:02:38.200> only<00:02:38.380> left<00:02:38.800> with<00:02:39.040> 23<00:02:39.430> so<00:02:39.940> quite

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
okay so we're only left with 23 so quite

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.840 
okay so we're only left with 23 so quite
clearly<00:02:40.540> MC<00:02:41.200> soft<00:02:41.440> has<00:02:41.769> done<00:02:42.280> a<00:02:42.489> lot<00:02:42.880> better<00:02:44.850> so

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
clearly MC soft has done a lot better so

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.160 
clearly MC soft has done a lot better so
that<00:02:46.120> gives<00:02:46.360> us<00:02:46.600> a<00:02:46.780> detection<00:02:47.290> rate<00:02:47.440> of<00:02:47.880> 93.2%

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
that gives us a detection rate of 93.2%

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.970 
that gives us a detection rate of 93.2%
which<00:02:50.170> is<00:02:50.440> pretty<00:02:50.799> good<00:02:51.010> so<00:02:51.989> now<00:02:52.989> it's<00:02:53.620> time

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
which is pretty good so now it's time

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.789 
which is pretty good so now it's time
for<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.970> moment<00:02:55.180> of<00:02:55.390> crude<00:02:55.750> let's<00:02:56.350> see<00:02:56.590> how

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
for the moment of crude let's see how

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.039 
for the moment of crude let's see how
Windows<00:02:57.220> Defender<00:02:57.400> compares<00:02:58.330> with<00:02:58.569> these<00:02:58.780> two

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
Windows Defender compares with these two

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.830 
Windows Defender compares with these two
products<00:02:59.530> so<00:02:59.680> I'll<00:02:59.830> be<00:03:00.010> back<00:03:00.220> once<00:03:01.209> Windows

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
products so I'll be back once Windows

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.020 
products so I'll be back once Windows

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
Defender has done its job now it's time

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.309 
Defender has done its job now it's time
to<00:03:09.580> check<00:03:09.760> whether<00:03:10.030> it<00:03:10.269> has<00:03:10.450> really<00:03:10.810> done<00:03:11.110> its

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
items

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.849 
items
well<00:03:18.910> they'll<00:03:19.269> give<00:03:19.660> us<00:03:19.840> a<00:03:19.959> really<00:03:20.170> impressive

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:20.859 
well they'll give us a really impressive

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:25.740 
well they'll give us a really impressive
detection<00:03:21.400> rate<00:03:24.090> that<00:03:25.090> is<00:03:25.239> eighty<00:03:25.540> eight

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
detection rate that is eighty eight

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.140 
detection rate that is eighty eight
point<00:03:26.019> four<00:03:26.350> nine<00:03:26.380> percent<00:03:27.070> so<00:03:27.609> make<00:03:27.910> no

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
point four nine percent so make no

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.120 
point four nine percent so make no
mistake<00:03:28.180> people<00:03:28.780> Windows<00:03:29.350> Defender<00:03:29.560> has<00:03:30.100> a

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
mistake people Windows Defender has a

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:32.729 
mistake people Windows Defender has a
really<00:03:30.700> good<00:03:30.940> signature<00:03:31.480> database<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:32.320> it's

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
really good signature database and it's

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.819 
really good signature database and it's
doing<00:03:33.070> really<00:03:33.310> well<00:03:33.609> so<00:03:34.390> unless<00:03:34.989> you're<00:03:35.560> using

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
doing really well so unless you're using

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.310 
doing really well so unless you're using
something<00:03:36.220> like<00:03:36.370> MC<00:03:36.790> soft<00:03:37.239> it<00:03:37.570> makes<00:03:37.840> no<00:03:38.290> sense

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
something like MC soft it makes no sense

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.130 
something like MC soft it makes no sense
to<00:03:38.769> have<00:03:39.040> another<00:03:39.600> you<00:03:40.600> know<00:03:40.720> just<00:03:40.989> an

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
to have another you know just an

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.080 
to have another you know just an
anti-virus<00:03:41.650> product<00:03:42.250> of<00:03:42.370> course<00:03:42.579> if<00:03:42.910> you're

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
anti-virus product of course if you're

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.460 
anti-virus product of course if you're
using<00:03:43.120> something<00:03:43.690> like<00:03:43.870> comodo<00:03:44.380> internet

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
using something like comodo internet

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.560 
using something like comodo internet
security<00:03:44.950> that<00:03:45.579> comes<00:03:45.790> with<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.120> firewall

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
security that comes with the firewall

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.229 
security that comes with the firewall
and<00:03:46.840> lots<00:03:47.170> of<00:03:47.320> other<00:03:47.530> stuff<00:03:47.680> that<00:03:48.239> Windows

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
and lots of other stuff that Windows

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.569 
and lots of other stuff that Windows
Defender<00:03:49.450> doesn't<00:03:50.320> have<00:03:50.530> then<00:03:51.010> maybe<00:03:51.340> it

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
Defender doesn't have then maybe it

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.000 
Defender doesn't have then maybe it
might<00:03:51.760> be<00:03:51.820> a<00:03:52.000> wise<00:03:52.269> decision<00:03:52.540> but<00:03:53.500> otherwise

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
might be a wise decision but otherwise

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.400 
might be a wise decision but otherwise
compared<00:03:54.880> to<00:03:55.060> most<00:03:55.209> basic<00:03:55.840> anti-malware

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
compared to most basic anti-malware

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.949 
compared to most basic anti-malware
programs<00:03:57.130> Windows<00:03:57.670> Defender<00:03:57.910> does<00:03:58.420> very<00:03:58.750> well

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
programs Windows Defender does very well

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.199 
programs Windows Defender does very well
