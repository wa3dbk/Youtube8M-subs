00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.500
 Gunpla Kit Review of Memories New Mobile Report Gundam w 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.500
 Gundam Heavy Arms 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.070
 The Gundam Heavy Arms will be featured in the Anime New Battle Report Gundam w 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:18.400
 Mobile suit developed by Doktor s of the nose point charm point 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:21.310
 Code name in vinegar is so called Gundam Zero 3 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:25.359
 Toro is the thing of your Gundam Da 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:28.990
 It is a wonderful mobile suit that is arm-packed so much even in the whole body 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:32.619
 Mobile Suits of heavily armed of the hand is less likely to have drawing and Gotegote 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:37.210
 It is standard to stand out or not to move so much 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:40.110
 By reducing the amount of line information , the basic form is quite simple Gundam. 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:44.520
 This is a handicraft of Mr. Ogawara- 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:48.630
 The main weapons are beam gatling and army knife beam gatling integrated with the shield 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:53.430
 The forearm unit of the left arm is stored and attached with a united material 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.840
 Heavy Arms is the only beam weapon, but it's quite heavy , so the balance of the aircraft is unstable 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.140
 It has become 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.130
 When the usually mobile suit is not equipped with a Toka shield in left arm 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.640
 Equip your right arm with a rifle or something 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:06.930
 It 's normal to take a balance, because I'm troubled even when I use plastic models. 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.340
 Ath 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.780
 When all the shots are exhausted and the beam gatling is dumped, it shifts to the fighting battle with the army knife. 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.100
 In consideration of 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.900
 Fans have burned in this setting because they have not made corrections on the system 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.980
 Hey I Plastic'm bad balance 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:28.660
 Of the five Gundams, it is a walking ammunition store that is good at surface control but 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:32.650
 Hebiamuzu in a state of exhausted shot all the bullets Aminaifu at'm now a total of such state 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:37.090
 If you did you exhibit a sufficient combat capability in a single most 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:39.890
 The battle ends with only the book , but the scene of the fighting game is not cool and not cool 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:44.570
 It was often said that after shooting all the bullets it was a production 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:47.070
 It is a scene that fans defeat especially while spinning Airies with anny knife. 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:51.770
 It is what I bought 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.130
 Toro takes on a fierce battle when he is duel in the Antarctic with Zex's Talgis 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.520
 in advance 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.120
 There was also a trois playing a break with the beam saber that I put in my left arm. 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.840
 The 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:04.910
 Then when the Trois returns to the universe it's made their way at the Earth 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.090
 Recovered by Sallypo and remodeled as Howard by Howard as space 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.200
 Gundam Heavy Arms has been changed 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.459
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:15.670
 Among the other Gundam is Toka or are Buchikowasa or hidden the or suicide 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.380
 Hebiamuzu only I'm was not in such eye 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.940
 However 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.660
 Roi had less Evan because he was missing or lost his memory 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.090
 What 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.480
 I met you 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:31.550
 The pilot is Troubat Nessuno Shia character 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:34.250
 Not only the skill of the strongest male mobile suit operation is quite high but also for other Gundam pilots 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.959
 It is also the younger brother character in the handsome character that can be attentive 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:42.900
 It is the character of fate to be swayed, and because of its popularity, it is a leading role in Endless waltz 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:47.280
 It is the first time in high treatment treatment to be treated and show to the past end Yes 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:50.459
 It is super nice that the rounding round in the air bullets and mobile suits 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.390
 It is probably because there are many clowns wearing scenes or endless waltz 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:03:00.180
 It is a standard thing to cover the mask of Piero also to Gunpla 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:02.890
 In is in serious eye of woman that thin book on the half-length nude is taking the 10 books Toka 20 books'm landmarks Comiket 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:07.930
 The place is hot and fucking hot by voice 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:11.920
 It was about to die- I can not cry sad 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:15.670
 Surely the price is ¥ 600 and those sold at that time are ¥ 500 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.569
 Toro is the version released with your figure added in 2000 . 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:23.829
 Can of the kit's impression not that this 0 after the head is too big 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:27.920
 The roll axis of the hip Ne yo painful joints do not move so much does not move so much is 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:31.220
 The other part is a bad effect of poly joints though it is because of the interference of parts . 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:35.239
 However, the color plastic specification is also excellent on the color classification 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:38.300
 It takes only 30 minutes to assemble, so it's easy to get along with it. 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:42.140
 I did not come out with a 1/100 kit 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:45.020
 I surely was not out garage kit of Ne b club'm such not only guy 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.910
 It is something that I was troubled to buy because it was expensive. 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.510
 Reasonable price for 1/100 debris 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.620
 Hey, it was 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:58.900
 After all it's easy to decorate and decorate, but if you want to finish it easily 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:00.459
 Even with a small amount of paint, it is okay to use the seal of this series 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.030
 You should use it while 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:06.150
 If you make a diorama, the scene where the hero uses the beam saber is the best 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.780
 What a good thing-it's easy 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.430
 If you beat the Leeds with a bummy knife, the scene was that there were no Aireys kits 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.170
 Anyway now 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:19.980
 Oh it there is a spear head of the robot soul 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.980
 I Son if Heavy Arms also becomes the story I guy of robot soul Nee
