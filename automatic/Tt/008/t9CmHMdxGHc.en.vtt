00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.160 
below of the base build for this
i'ma<00:00:29.910> show<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.090> guys<00:00:30.179> some<00:00:30.330> defenses<00:00:30.810> today

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
i'ma show you guys some defenses today

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.620 
i'ma show you guys some defenses today
so<00:00:31.289> here's<00:00:31.500> number<00:00:31.619> four<00:00:31.940> he's<00:00:32.940> attacking<00:00:33.270> me

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
so here's number four he's attacking me

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.160 
so here's number four he's attacking me
with<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.739> looks<00:00:34.920> like<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.160> go<00:00:35.550> we<00:00:36.210> -<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.780> we<00:00:36.930> I

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
with it looks like a go we - the we I

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.880 
with it looks like a go we - the we I
mean<00:00:38.010> go<00:00:38.850> we<00:00:39.239> got<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.750> go<00:00:39.870> baby<00:00:40.110> that's<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.770> go

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
mean go we got to go baby that's a go

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.260 
mean go we got to go baby that's a go
baby

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
baby

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.400 
baby
anyways<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.899> he<00:00:42.960> comes<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.230> with<00:00:43.290> the

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
anyways so he comes in with the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.229 
anyways so he comes in with the
earthquakes<00:00:43.800> trying<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.100> copy<00:00:44.280> my<00:00:44.489> swag<00:00:44.730> but

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
earthquakes trying to copy my swag but

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.700 
earthquakes trying to copy my swag but
you<00:00:45.360> can't<00:00:45.600> do<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.899> though<00:00:46.050> cuz<00:00:46.379> he<00:00:46.530> got<00:00:46.559> a

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
you can't do it though cuz he got a

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.910 
you can't do it though cuz he got a
zero-star<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:48.440> let's<00:00:49.440> speed<00:00:49.649> this<00:00:49.680> up<00:00:49.860> a

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
zero-star and let's speed this up a

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.160 
zero-star and let's speed this up a
little<00:00:50.100> bit<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.430> have<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.610> wash<00:00:50.760> them<00:00:51.170> boy

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
little bit you have to wash them boy

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
little bit you have to wash them boy
times<00:00:52.440> one<00:00:52.680> speed

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
times one speed

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.549 
times one speed
alright<00:00:53.910> here<00:00:54.030> we<00:00:54.059> go<00:00:54.270> comes<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.140> we<00:00:55.230> go<00:00:55.379> where

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
alright here we go comes in we go where

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.029 
alright here we go comes in we go where
we<00:00:56.329> expecting<00:00:57.440> them<00:00:58.440> to<00:00:58.559> go<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.800> center

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
we expecting them to go to the center

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.650 
we expecting them to go to the center
but<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.670> guess<00:00:59.879> what<00:01:00.059> they're<00:01:00.239> not<00:01:00.359> going<00:01:00.629> to

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
but I guess what they're not going to

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.920 
but I guess what they're not going to
because<00:01:01.140> it's<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.590> what<00:01:01.980> they<00:01:02.070> don't<00:01:02.250> do<00:01:02.930> they

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
because it's the what they don't do they

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.530 
because it's the what they don't do they
don't<00:01:04.170> go<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.500> center<00:01:05.060> the<00:01:06.060> way<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.420> base

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
don't go to the center the way the base

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.910 
don't go to the center the way the base
is<00:01:06.689> set<00:01:06.840> up<00:01:06.960> if<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.470> haven't<00:01:07.619> watched<00:01:07.830> the

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
is set up if you haven't watched the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.170 
is set up if you haven't watched the
other<00:01:08.040> videos<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.580> have<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.729> lot<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:08.880> Defense

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
other videos I have a lot of Defense

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.700 
other videos I have a lot of Defense
replays<00:01:09.479> for<00:01:09.659> these<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:10.049> base<00:01:10.260> because<00:01:10.560> it's

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
replays for these this base because it's

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.320 
replays for these this base because it's
just<00:01:11.159> proof<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.670> need<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.880> see<00:01:12.000> more<00:01:12.150> proof

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
just proof you need to see more proof

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.969 
just proof you need to see more proof
for<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.570> bases<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:12.960> would<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.350> would<00:01:13.560> want<00:01:13.710> proof

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
for the bases I would I would want proof

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.770 
for the bases I would I would want proof
I<00:01:14.130> was<00:01:14.310> trying<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.520> build<00:01:14.610> my<00:01:14.790> own<00:01:14.820> base<00:01:15.210> before

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
I was trying to build my own base before

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.960 
I was trying to build my own base before
I<00:01:15.990> use<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.470> war<00:01:16.650> wait<00:01:17.490> here's<00:01:17.700> some<00:01:17.790> proof

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
I use it in war wait here's some proof

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.520 
I use it in war wait here's some proof
like<00:01:18.299> because<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.080> doesn't<00:01:19.320> even<00:01:19.409> have

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
like because this doesn't even have

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.080 
like because this doesn't even have
rushed<00:01:19.799> heroes<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.340> was<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.460> stole<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.939> was<00:01:21.060> a

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
rushed heroes it was a stole it was a

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.880 
rushed heroes it was a stole it was a
decent<00:01:21.270> attack<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:21.780> mean<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.080> very<00:01:22.200> hard<00:01:22.799> to

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
decent attack I mean it's very hard to

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.420 
decent attack I mean it's very hard to
take<00:01:23.310> out<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.610> space<00:01:23.820> but<00:01:24.650> yeah<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:25.890> here<00:01:26.310> we

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
take out the space but yeah so here we

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.770 
take out the space but yeah so here we
go<00:01:26.549> we<00:01:26.670> got<00:01:26.700> forty<00:01:27.090> percent<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.540> said<00:01:27.689> number

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
go we got forty percent I said number

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.980 
go we got forty percent I said number
four<00:01:28.369> so<00:01:29.369> let's<00:01:29.549> scroll<00:01:30.420> back<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.810> show<00:01:30.930> you

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
four so let's scroll back and show you

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.140 
four so let's scroll back and show you
their<00:01:31.619> number<00:01:31.890> two<00:01:32.130> actually<00:01:32.579> attacked<00:01:32.909> me

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
their number two actually attacked me

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.590 
their number two actually attacked me
should<00:01:33.840> be<00:01:33.869> somewhere<00:01:34.320> that's<00:01:34.799> number<00:01:34.920> four

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
should be somewhere that's number four

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.730 
should be somewhere that's number four
somewhere<00:01:36.600> right<00:01:36.840> here<00:01:37.259> here's<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.500> number

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
somewhere right here here's the number

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.039 
somewhere right here here's the number
two<00:01:37.920> razor<00:01:38.460> blade<00:01:38.820> razor<00:01:39.479> blade<00:01:39.750> didn't<00:01:39.960> give

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
two razor blade razor blade didn't give

it's<00:02:07.110> not<00:02:07.259> bad<00:02:07.759> and<00:02:08.759> yet<00:02:09.300> this<00:02:10.050> looks<00:02:10.349> solid

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
it's not bad and yet this looks solid

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.020 
it's not bad and yet this looks solid
from<00:02:10.800> where<00:02:10.950> it's<00:02:11.099> coming<00:02:11.310> like<00:02:11.550> this<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:11.940> like

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
from where it's coming like this is like

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.820 
from where it's coming like this is like
a<00:02:12.120> solid<00:02:12.300> strategy<00:02:12.599> going<00:02:12.989> from<00:02:13.230> this

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
a solid strategy going from this

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.890 
a solid strategy going from this
but<00:02:14.700> it<00:02:15.120> doesn't<00:02:15.360> work<00:02:15.480> because<00:02:15.569> it's<00:02:15.780> the

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
but it doesn't work because it's the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.490 
but it doesn't work because it's the
basis<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:16.500> they<00:02:16.890> sent<00:02:17.129> how<00:02:17.190> it<00:02:17.730> rolls<00:02:18.019> and<00:02:19.019> no

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
basis that they sent how it rolls and no

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.930 
basis that they sent how it rolls and no
chance<00:02:19.920> for<00:02:20.750> a<00:02:21.750> two<00:02:22.379> star<00:02:22.620> or<00:02:22.860> one<00:02:23.129> star<00:02:23.340> no

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
one's ever gotten one star on me so it's

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.930
