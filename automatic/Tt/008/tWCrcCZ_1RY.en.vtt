black<00:00:30.779> icons<00:00:31.320> with<00:00:31.949> some<00:00:32.160> like<00:00:32.309> on<00:00:32.489> sticking

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
black icons with some like on sticking

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.030 
black icons with some like on sticking
out<00:00:33.059> but<00:00:33.600> most<00:00:33.809> themes<00:00:34.079> have<00:00:34.350> at<00:00:34.500> least<00:00:34.620> one<00:00:34.920> or

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
out but most themes have at least one or

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.610 
out but most themes have at least one or
two<00:00:35.070> icons<00:00:35.579> sticking<00:00:36.030> out<00:00:36.180> so<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.809> guess<00:00:37.469> it

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
two icons sticking out so I guess it

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.819 
two icons sticking out so I guess it
doesn't<00:00:38.340> really<00:00:38.370> matter<00:00:39.410> this<00:00:40.410> theme<00:00:40.620> also

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
doesn't really matter this theme also

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
comes in red if you would like but I

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.200 
comes in red if you would like but I

that's<00:04:14.170> pretty<00:04:14.410> cool<00:04:14.709> um<00:04:15.720> so<00:04:16.720> um<00:04:17.500> I<00:04:18.010> mean<00:04:18.640> some

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
that's pretty cool um so um I mean some

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.270 
that's pretty cool um so um I mean some
of<00:04:18.970> the<00:04:19.060> apps<00:04:19.209> stick<00:04:19.539> out<00:04:19.720> but<00:04:20.130> that's<00:04:21.130> just

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
of the apps stick out but that's just

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.779 
of the apps stick out but that's just
because<00:04:21.489> you<00:04:22.210> can't<00:04:22.419> customize<00:04:22.630> every<00:04:23.260> app<00:04:23.789> as

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789
