go now the next thing we need to do is

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:27.330 
go now the next thing we need to do is
we<00:01:25.929> need<00:01:25.959> to<00:01:26.109> change<00:01:26.289> the<00:01:26.409> blend<00:01:26.679> mode<00:01:26.770> of<00:01:27.130> this

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
we need to change the blend mode of this

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.999 
we need to change the blend mode of this
we're<00:01:28.030> going<00:01:28.119> to<00:01:28.179> change<00:01:28.600> it<00:01:28.810> to<00:01:28.990> overlie<00:01:29.560> now

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
we're going to change it to overlie now

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:31.919 
we're going to change it to overlie now
what<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.219> overlay<00:01:30.549> blend<00:01:30.729> mode<00:01:31.029> does<00:01:31.359> is<00:01:31.689> it

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929 
what the overlay blend mode does is it

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:35.069 
what the overlay blend mode does is it
actually<00:01:31.959> makes<00:01:32.700> anything<00:01:33.700> that<00:01:34.090> is<00:01:34.209> 50%<00:01:34.689> gray

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
actually makes anything that is 50% gray

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.319 
actually makes anything that is 50% gray
in<00:01:35.319> the<00:01:35.469> layer<00:01:35.679> and<00:01:35.979> it<00:01:36.459> makes<00:01:36.729> it<00:01:36.819> transparent

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
in the layer and it makes it transparent

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:39.449 
in the layer and it makes it transparent
so<00:01:37.840> in<00:01:37.929> this<00:01:38.049> case<00:01:38.289> it<00:01:38.679> should<00:01:39.189> make<00:01:39.340> the

00:01:39.449 --> 00:01:39.459 
so in this case it should make the

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:44.190 
so in this case it should make the
entire<00:01:39.700> layer<00:01:40.179> transparent<00:01:41.049> there<00:01:41.950> we<00:01:42.039> go<00:01:43.200> all

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
entire layer transparent there we go all

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.050 
entire layer transparent there we go all
right<00:01:44.380> now<00:01:44.469> any<00:01:44.770> of<00:01:45.039> any<00:01:45.219> changes<00:01:45.459> we<00:01:45.639> do<00:01:45.909> to

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
right now any of any changes we do to

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.940 
right now any of any changes we do to
this<00:01:46.149> will<00:01:46.389> still<00:01:46.630> be<00:01:46.719> applied<00:01:46.959> below<00:01:47.499> as<00:01:47.770> long

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
this will still be applied below as long

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.099 
this will still be applied below as long
as<00:01:48.069> they're<00:01:48.219> not<00:01:48.369> fifty<00:01:48.759> percent<00:01:48.969> grade<00:01:49.270> so<00:01:50.020> to

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:50.109 
as they're not fifty percent grade so to

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:52.949 
as they're not fifty percent grade so to
actually<00:01:50.289> make<00:01:51.069> some<00:01:51.759> changes<00:01:52.450> in<00:01:52.509> this<00:01:52.689> image

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
my my my brush options and right now I

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.140 
my my my brush options and right now I
have<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.680> opacity<00:02:38.950> of<00:02:39.220> thirty<00:02:39.519> percent<00:02:39.910> a<00:02:40.000> lot

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
have the opacity of thirty percent a lot

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.580 
have the opacity of thirty percent a lot
of<00:02:40.239> times<00:02:40.390> it's<00:02:40.569> going<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.780> be<00:02:40.900> defaulted<00:02:41.470> at

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
of times it's going to be defaulted at

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.920 
of times it's going to be defaulted at
one<00:02:41.799> hundred<00:02:41.980> percent<00:02:42.480> so<00:02:43.480> this<00:02:43.629> is<00:02:43.750> probably

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
one hundred percent so this is probably

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.150 
one hundred percent so this is probably
what<00:02:44.170> your<00:02:44.290> screen<00:02:44.650> will<00:02:44.829> look<00:02:44.950> like<00:02:45.840> now<00:02:47.160> with

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
what your screen will look like now with

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.869 
what your screen will look like now with
a<00:02:48.190> brush<00:02:48.610> tool<00:02:49.180> open<00:02:49.930> I<00:02:50.170> can<00:02:50.920> actually<00:02:51.099> quickly

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 
a brush tool open I can actually quickly

a brush tool open I can actually quickly
change<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.329> opacity<00:02:52.420> of<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.079> brush<00:02:53.349> by<00:02:53.859> just

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
change the opacity of the brush by just

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.009

I'm actually going to start painting at

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.880 
I'm actually going to start painting at
ten<00:02:58.060> percent<00:02:58.540> so<00:02:59.019> I'm<00:02:59.109> gonna<00:02:59.200> hit<00:02:59.349> one<00:02:59.650> and

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
ten percent so I'm gonna hit one and

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.680 
ten percent so I'm gonna hit one and
that<00:03:00.069> brings<00:03:00.220> it<00:03:00.400> down<00:03:00.489> to<00:03:00.549> 10<00:03:00.819> now<00:03:01.450> if<00:03:01.599> you

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
that brings it down to 10 now if you

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.809 
that brings it down to 10 now if you
were<00:03:01.810> to<00:03:01.840> hit<00:03:02.019> two<00:03:02.319> it<00:03:02.560> would<00:03:02.680> make<00:03:02.829> it<00:03:02.859> 23<00:03:03.310> but

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
were to hit two it would make it 23 but

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.880 
were to hit two it would make it 23 but
make<00:03:03.970> it<00:03:04.000> 30<00:03:04.329> etc<00:03:04.870> to<00:03:05.290> get<00:03:05.440> back<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:05.799> one

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
make it 30 etc to get back to one

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.130 
make it 30 etc to get back to one
hundred<00:03:05.950> percent<00:03:06.129> just<00:03:06.970> hit<00:03:07.090> zero<00:03:07.390> and<00:03:07.720> it

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
hundred percent just hit zero and it

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.479 
hundred percent just hit zero and it
goes<00:03:08.290> all<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:08.470> way<00:03:08.590> up<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:08.709> 100<00:03:09.069> but<00:03:09.220> I<00:03:09.280> want<00:03:09.459> to
