router<00:00:06.240> there<00:00:07.050> are<00:00:07.290> countless<00:00:07.800> ways<00:00:08.069> you<00:00:08.340> can

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
router there are countless ways you can

today<00:00:11.099> I'm<00:00:11.250> going<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.460> show<00:00:11.639> you<00:00:11.669> the

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:11.879 
today I'm going to show you the

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:13.280 
today I'm going to show you the
technique<00:00:12.269> you'll<00:00:12.450> probably<00:00:12.660> use<00:00:12.839> more<00:00:13.110> than

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
technique you'll probably use more than

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.230 
technique you'll probably use more than
any<00:00:13.500> other<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:14.759> routing<00:00:15.150> a

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
any other and that is routing a

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.910 
any other and that is routing a
decorative<00:00:15.599> profile<00:00:16.170> on<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.620> edge<00:00:16.710> of<00:00:16.860> a

decorative profile on the edge of a

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.769 
decorative profile on the edge of a
board<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.880> have<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:18.060> lot<00:00:18.390> of<00:00:18.539> choices

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
board and you have a lot of choices

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.750 
board and you have a lot of choices
whether<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:19.740> want<00:00:19.890> something<00:00:20.220> simple<00:00:20.400> like<00:00:20.699> a

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
whether you want something simple like a

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.140 
whether you want something simple like a
round<00:00:21.210> over<00:00:21.420> or<00:00:21.750> maybe<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.619> chamfer<00:00:23.150> or

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
round over or maybe a chamfer or

round over or maybe a chamfer or
something<00:00:24.510> even<00:00:24.630> more<00:00:24.929> decorative<00:00:25.349> like<00:00:26.340> an

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
something even more decorative like an

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.419 
something even more decorative like an
OG<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:27.509> nice<00:00:27.720> thing<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.080> regardless<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.220> which

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
OG the nice thing is regardless of which

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.279 
OG the nice thing is regardless of which
of<00:00:29.460> those<00:00:29.640> profiles<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.359> choose<00:00:30.689> the

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
of those profiles you choose the

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.860 
of those profiles you choose the
technique<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.890> precisely<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.700> same<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.540> I'll

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
technique is precisely the same so I'll

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.390 
technique is precisely the same so I'll
show<00:00:34.170> you<00:00:34.200> how<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.470> soften<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.070> edge<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.310> this

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:35.400 
show you how to soften the edge of this

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.510 
show you how to soften the edge of this
board<00:00:35.700> using<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.540> round<00:00:36.750> over<00:00:37.080> bit<00:00:37.110> now<00:00:38.010> as<00:00:38.190> with

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
board using a round over bit now as with

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.860 
board using a round over bit now as with
any<00:00:38.700> router<00:00:39.150> technique

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
any router technique

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.990 
any router technique
it<00:00:40.140> begins<00:00:40.500> with<00:00:40.800> mounting<00:00:41.310> the<00:00:41.400> bit<00:00:41.580> in<00:00:41.760> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
it begins with mounting the bit in the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.700 
it begins with mounting the bit in the
router<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.990> can<00:00:43.110> see<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.440> I've<00:00:43.530> removed

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
router and you can see that I've removed

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.500 
router and you can see that I've removed
the<00:00:43.980> base<00:00:44.190> from<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.580> motor<00:00:44.790> just<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.360> make<00:00:45.480> it

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
the base from the motor just to make it

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.850 
the base from the motor just to make it
a<00:00:45.630> little<00:00:45.720> more<00:00:45.810> clear<00:00:46.140> what<00:00:46.290> I'm<00:00:46.410> doing<00:00:46.680> here

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
a little more clear what I'm doing here

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.280 
a little more clear what I'm doing here
but<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.580> can<00:00:47.850> actually<00:00:48.090> mount<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.780> bit<00:00:48.960> with

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
but you can actually mount the bit with

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.560 
but you can actually mount the bit with
the<00:00:49.470> base<00:00:49.620> attached<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.790> I'll<00:00:51.180> show<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.450> how

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
the base attached so I'll show you how

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.900 
the base attached so I'll show you how
this<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.810> done<00:00:51.990> you<00:00:52.650> just<00:00:52.860> slide<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.190> bit<00:00:53.550> into

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
this is done you just slide the bit into

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.300 
this is done you just slide the bit into
the<00:00:54.360> collet<00:00:54.720> let<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.590> go<00:00:55.680> all<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.010> way<00:00:56.040> to<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.310 
the collet let it go all the way to the

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.820 
the collet let it go all the way to the
bottom<00:00:56.640> then<00:00:57.180> just<00:00:57.420> raise<00:00:57.630> it<00:00:57.660> slightly<00:00:57.930> hang

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
bottom then just raise it slightly hang

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.740 
bottom then just raise it slightly hang
on<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.280> with<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.610> finger<00:00:59.880> while<00:01:00.600> you

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
on to it with that finger while you

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.350 
on to it with that finger while you
tighten<00:01:01.290> the<00:01:01.380> collet<00:01:01.770> nut<00:01:02.030> tighten<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.120> first

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
tighten the collet nut tighten it first

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.870 
tighten the collet nut tighten it first
by<00:01:03.540> hand<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.110> then<00:01:05.010> with<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> wrench<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.640> make

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
by hand and then with a wrench to make

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.690 
by hand and then with a wrench to make
sure<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.150> nice<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.509> secure<00:01:07.219> I've<00:01:08.219> also<00:01:08.429> got

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
sure it's nice and secure I've also got

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.029 
sure it's nice and secure I've also got
a<00:01:08.729> hold<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.450> collet<00:01:10.200> locking<00:01:10.590> lever<00:01:10.770> here

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:11.039 
a hold of the collet locking lever here

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:13.219 
a hold of the collet locking lever here
in<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.219> back<00:01:11.429> that<00:01:12.000> just<00:01:12.240> keeps<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.689> call<00:01:13.079> it

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
in the back that just keeps that call it

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.569 
in the back that just keeps that call it
from<00:01:13.380> spinning<00:01:13.679> while<00:01:13.979> I'm<00:01:14.100> tightening<00:01:14.490> the

from spinning while I'm tightening the

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:17.060 
from spinning while I'm tightening the
nut<00:01:14.780> so<00:01:15.780> now<00:01:16.109> the<00:01:16.170> bits<00:01:16.500> mounted<00:01:16.859> in<00:01:16.950> there

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070

nice and secure all I need to do is

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.020 
nice and secure all I need to do is
reinstall<00:01:19.499> the<00:01:19.890> base<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.399> I'm<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:20.850> about

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
reinstall the base and I'm just about

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.709 
reinstall the base and I'm just about
ready<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.299> rout<00:01:26.030> so<00:01:27.030> I'll<00:01:27.149> raise<00:01:27.359> the<00:01:27.539> bit

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:27.719 
ready to rout so I'll raise the bit

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:29.330 
ready to rout so I'll raise the bit
until<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.140> straight<00:01:28.380> cutting<00:01:28.649> edge<00:01:28.859> is<00:01:29.039> above

a<00:01:50.540> bit<00:01:50.689> away<00:01:50.840> from<00:01:51.049> the<00:01:51.259> edge<00:01:51.380> and<00:01:51.740> release<00:01:52.130> the

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
a bit away from the edge and release the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.039 
a bit away from the edge and release the
trigger<00:01:52.520> then<00:01:53.180> let<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.509> bit<00:01:53.689> come<00:01:53.899> to<00:01:54.020> a

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
trigger then let the bit come to a

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:55.719 
trigger then let the bit come to a
complete<00:01:54.409> stop<00:01:54.680> before<00:01:54.740> lifting<00:01:55.399> the<00:01:55.520> router

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
complete stop before lifting the router

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:01.749 
complete stop before lifting the router
off<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.240> workpiece<00:02:00.009> so<00:02:01.009> that's<00:02:01.220> all<00:02:01.430> there<00:02:01.610> is

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
off the workpiece so that's all there is

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.550 
off the workpiece so that's all there is
to<00:02:02.090> routing<00:02:02.450> a<00:02:02.509> profile<00:02:02.990> on<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.229> edge<00:02:03.350> of<00:02:03.500> a

to routing a profile on the edge of a
board<00:02:03.799> doesn't<00:02:04.460> get<00:02:04.670> much<00:02:04.789> simpler<00:02:05.090> than<00:02:05.330> that

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
board doesn't get much simpler than that

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.830 
board doesn't get much simpler than that
now<00:02:06.110> we've<00:02:06.289> got<00:02:06.439> a<00:02:06.470> nice<00:02:06.740> soft<00:02:07.250> edge<00:02:07.840> won't

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
now we've got a nice soft edge won't

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.350 
now we've got a nice soft edge won't
snag<00:02:09.140> clothes<00:02:09.530> or<00:02:09.830> skin<00:02:10.130> it<00:02:10.580> looks<00:02:10.789> good<00:02:11.090> the

snag clothes or skin it looks good the
corner<00:02:11.660> won't<00:02:11.840> break<00:02:12.050> easily<00:02:12.260> it's<00:02:13.220> a<00:02:13.370> nice

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
corner won't break easily it's a nice
