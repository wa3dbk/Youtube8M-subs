00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.310 

we<00:01:14.850> first<00:01:15.119> learned<00:01:15.450> about<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.900> value<00:01:16.290> of

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
we first learned about the value of

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.800 
we first learned about the value of
herbs<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.100> we<00:01:17.220> went<00:01:17.460> on<00:01:17.759> our<00:01:17.909> honeymoon<00:01:17.939> suite

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
herbs and we went on our honeymoon suite

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.160 
herbs and we went on our honeymoon suite
room<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.939> we<00:01:20.939> tasted<00:01:21.450> Pizza<00:01:21.840> Margherita

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
room and we tasted Pizza Margherita

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.310 
room and we tasted Pizza Margherita
which<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.430> pizza<00:01:24.119> with<00:01:24.479> cheese<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.110> fresh

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
which is pizza with cheese and fresh

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.990 
which is pizza with cheese and fresh
basil<00:01:26.270> so<00:01:27.270> when<00:01:27.450> we<00:01:27.570> came<00:01:27.810> back<00:01:27.869> we<00:01:28.560> decided<00:01:29.430> we

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
basil so when we came back we decided we

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.100 
basil so when we came back we decided we
wanted<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.630> recreate<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.470> pizza<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:33.110> we

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
wanted to recreate that pizza and we

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.320 
wanted to recreate that pizza and we
tried<00:01:34.950> some<00:01:35.220> store-bought<00:01:35.520> phases<00:01:36.030> of<00:01:36.180> what

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330 
tried some store-bought phases of what

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.270 
tried some store-bought phases of what
that<00:01:36.450> looks<00:01:36.659> very<00:01:36.930> expensive<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.860> we<00:01:38.100> thought

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
that looks very expensive so we thought

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.480 
that looks very expensive so we thought
why<00:01:38.520> don't<00:01:38.580> we<00:01:38.759> go<00:01:38.940> around<00:01:42.950> so<00:01:43.950> taking<00:01:44.280> care<00:01:44.310> of

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
why don't we go around so taking care of

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.940 
why don't we go around so taking care of
the<00:01:44.610> herb<00:01:44.729> pot<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.180> pretty<00:01:45.420> easy<00:01:45.659> all<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.860> have

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
the herb pot is pretty easy all you have

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.800 
the herb pot is pretty easy all you have
to<00:01:47.039> do<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.250> water<00:01:47.429> it<00:01:47.550> probably<00:01:48.330> every<00:01:48.780> other

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
to do is water it probably every other

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.899 
to do is water it probably every other
day<00:01:49.140> make<00:01:50.100> sure<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.310> oil<00:01:50.520> doesn't<00:01:50.759> get

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
day make sure this oil doesn't get

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.600 
day make sure this oil doesn't get
totally<00:01:51.240> dried<00:01:51.479> out<00:01:52.069> and<00:01:53.069> make<00:01:53.280> sure<00:01:53.399> it's<00:01:53.520> in

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
totally dried out and make sure it's in

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:13.970 
totally dried out and make sure it's in
a<00:01:53.670> sunny<00:01:53.880> place

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.620 

running<00:02:14.980> out<00:02:15.160> to<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.400> garden<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:16.180> picking

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
running out to the garden and picking

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.270 
running out to the garden and picking
some<00:02:16.900> fresh<00:02:17.110> basil<00:02:17.350> and<00:02:17.740> putting<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.130> on<00:02:18.250> a

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
some fresh basil and putting it on a

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.340 
some fresh basil and putting it on a
pizza<00:02:18.760> is<00:02:18.910> one<00:02:18.940> of<00:02:19.150> our<00:02:19.330> favorite<00:02:19.780> things<00:02:20.020> to

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
pizza is one of our favorite things to

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.580 
pizza is one of our favorite things to
do

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.040 

so<00:02:27.190> Alex<00:02:27.610> taught<00:02:27.910> me<00:02:28.150> about<00:02:28.330> pinching<00:02:28.930> off

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
so Alex taught me about pinching off

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.280 
so Alex taught me about pinching off
basil<00:02:30.120> it's<00:02:31.120> hard<00:02:31.360> for<00:02:31.569> me<00:02:31.720> because<00:02:31.900> I'm

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
basil it's hard for me because I'm

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.170 
basil it's hard for me because I'm
worried<00:02:32.620> that<00:02:32.650> I'm<00:02:32.920> going<00:02:33.099> to<00:02:33.280> hurt<00:02:33.489> this<00:02:33.730> tiny

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
worried that I'm going to hurt this tiny

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
worried that I'm going to hurt this tiny
plant<00:02:34.890> but<00:02:35.890> Alex<00:02:36.400> told<00:02:36.580> me<00:02:37.030> that<00:02:37.390> if<00:02:37.690> you<00:02:37.750> pinch

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
plant but Alex told me that if you pinch

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.490 
plant but Alex told me that if you pinch
off<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.620> top<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:40.030> will<00:02:40.239> allow<00:02:40.569> two-sentence

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
off the top that will allow two-sentence

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.009 
off the top that will allow two-sentence
to<00:02:41.650> grow<00:02:41.860> in<00:02:42.099> his<00:02:42.250> place<00:02:42.550> so<00:02:43.420> that<00:02:43.569> actually

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
to grow in his place so that actually

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.860 
to grow in his place so that actually
makes<00:02:44.230> for<00:02:44.620> a<00:02:44.650> much<00:02:44.890> fuller<00:02:45.310> basil<00:02:45.880> plant<00:02:46.180> than

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
makes for a much fuller basil plant than

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.449 
makes for a much fuller basil plant than
if<00:02:47.290> you<00:02:47.590> did<00:02:47.920> not<00:02:48.040> pinch<00:02:48.400> it<00:02:48.550> off<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:51.010> me<00:02:51.160> it<00:02:51.280> was

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
if you did not pinch it off to me it was

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.900 
if you did not pinch it off to me it was
kind<00:02:51.790> of<00:02:51.910> like<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.120> life<00:02:52.420> lesson<00:02:52.780> of<00:02:53.910> learning

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
kind of like a life lesson of learning

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.900 
kind of like a life lesson of learning
just<00:02:55.900> so<00:02:56.650> much<00:02:56.860> as<00:02:57.069> we've<00:02:57.280> learned<00:02:57.519> from<00:02:57.730> our

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
just so much as we've learned from our

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.259 
just so much as we've learned from our
garden<00:02:58.150> we've<00:02:58.750> learned<00:02:59.380> that<00:02:59.970> through<00:03:00.970> pain

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
garden we've learned that through pain

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.710 
garden we've learned that through pain
comes<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:01.870> growth<00:03:02.110> and<00:03:02.739> so<00:03:03.390> through<00:03:04.390> just

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
comes the growth and so through just

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.410 
comes the growth and so through just
pinching<00:03:05.709> off<00:03:05.890> the<00:03:06.100> top<00:03:06.280> of<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.519> basil<00:03:06.940> comes

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
pinching off the top of the basil comes

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:28.630 
pinching off the top of the basil comes
more<00:03:07.780> growth

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.700
