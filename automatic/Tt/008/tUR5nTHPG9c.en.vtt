00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
various other tasks and this is a much

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.070 
various other tasks and this is a much
better<00:02:26.610> deal<00:02:26.760> I<00:02:26.970> think<00:02:27.180> pay<00:02:27.540> eighty<00:02:27.810> bucks

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
better deal I think pay eighty bucks

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.020 
better deal I think pay eighty bucks
once<00:02:28.380> keep<00:02:28.739> this<00:02:28.860> modem<00:02:29.250> for<00:02:29.400> however<00:02:29.819> long

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
DOCSIS three and ER and then upgrade

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.990 
DOCSIS three and ER and then upgrade
eventually<00:02:34.739> instead<00:02:34.950> of<00:02:35.130> paying<00:02:35.370> eight<00:02:35.700> bucks

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
eventually instead of paying eight bucks

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.380 
eventually instead of paying eight bucks
or<00:02:36.180> whatever<00:02:36.300> a<00:02:36.690> month<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.440> Comcast's<00:02:38.160> so<00:02:38.670> they

or whatever a month to Comcast's so they

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.300

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
were bugging us to upgrade because of

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.800 
were bugging us to upgrade because of
this<00:02:41.489> thing<00:02:41.730> still<00:02:41.970> being<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.209> DOCSIS<00:02:42.630> two

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810

this thing still being a DOCSIS two
modem<00:02:43.170> so<00:02:44.390> we<00:02:45.390> have<00:02:45.480> grade<00:02:45.720> from<00:02:45.900> this<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.950> this

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
modem so we have grade from this to this

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.309 
modem so we have grade from this to this
and<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.730> speeds<00:02:48.030> are<00:02:48.209> now<00:02:48.360> up<00:02:48.630> to<00:02:48.660> 105<00:02:49.470> down

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
and the speeds are now up to 105 down

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.720 
and the speeds are now up to 105 down
which<00:02:52.319> is<00:02:52.470> crazy<00:02:52.739> I've<00:02:53.100> never<00:02:53.130> had<00:02:53.459> speeds

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
which is crazy I've never had speeds

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.490 
which is crazy I've never had speeds
that<00:02:53.910> fast<00:02:54.150> although<00:02:54.390> up<00:02:54.750> in<00:02:54.959> my<00:02:55.080> bedroom<00:02:55.319> it

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
that fast although up in my bedroom it

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:56.720 
that fast although up in my bedroom it
doesn't<00:02:55.769> matter<00:02:55.890> that<00:02:55.980> much<00:02:56.220> because<00:02:56.430> I'm

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
doesn't matter that much because I'm

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.030 
doesn't matter that much because I'm
still<00:02:56.910> bridged<00:02:57.209> wirelessly<00:02:57.780> but<00:02:58.590> down<00:02:58.799> here

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
still bridged wirelessly but down here

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.259 
still bridged wirelessly but down here
on<00:02:59.130> this<00:02:59.280> computer<00:02:59.640> oh<00:02:59.940> boy<00:03:00.780> is<00:03:01.019> it<00:03:01.049> fast

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
on this computer oh boy is it fast

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.490 
on this computer oh boy is it fast
assuming<00:03:03.269> a<00:03:03.330> web<00:03:03.480> server<00:03:03.720> is<00:03:03.959> that<00:03:03.989> fast<00:03:04.349> to

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
assuming a web server is that fast to

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.410 
assuming a web server is that fast to
begin<00:03:04.739> with<00:03:04.920> but<00:03:05.370> what's<00:03:05.549> nice<00:03:05.670> about<00:03:05.730> that<00:03:06.030> is

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
begin with but what's nice about that is

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.300 
begin with but what's nice about that is
it<00:03:06.630> allows<00:03:06.959> more<00:03:07.260> people<00:03:07.319> to<00:03:07.680> be<00:03:07.830> online<00:03:07.980> at

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
it allows more people to be online at

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.850 
it allows more people to be online at
the<00:03:08.340> same<00:03:08.580> time<00:03:08.849> so<00:03:09.319> that's<00:03:10.319> that's<00:03:10.680> the

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
the same time so that's that's the

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.229 
the same time so that's that's the
problem<00:03:10.950> we're<00:03:11.280> having<00:03:11.310> with<00:03:11.610> this<00:03:11.730> modem<00:03:12.120> is

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
problem we're having with this modem is

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.360 
problem we're having with this modem is
that<00:03:12.360> it<00:03:12.450> was<00:03:12.540> DOCSIS<00:03:12.959> to<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:13.650> you<00:03:14.040> know<00:03:14.160> the

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
that it was DOCSIS to so you know the

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.130 
that it was DOCSIS to so you know the
amount<00:03:14.610> of<00:03:14.670> people<00:03:14.880> using<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.810> internet<00:03:16.080> at

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
amount of people using the internet at

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.710 
amount of people using the internet at
the<00:03:16.170> same<00:03:16.380> time<00:03:16.650> would<00:03:16.799> bog<00:03:17.010> it<00:03:17.190> down<00:03:17.660> this<00:03:18.660> is

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
the same time would bog it down this is

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.640 
the same time would bog it down this is
much<00:03:19.019> nicer<00:03:19.850> so<00:03:20.850> I<00:03:21.170> just<00:03:22.170> thought<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.410> update

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
much nicer so I just thought it update

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.140 
much nicer so I just thought it update
