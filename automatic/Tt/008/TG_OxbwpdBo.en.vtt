00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.050 
and you are 100% correct when you say
that<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.290> don't<00:01:43.500> want<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.799> develop<00:01:44.100> muscular

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
that you don't want to develop muscular

that you don't want to develop muscular
imbalance<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.020> neck<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.560> some<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.220> the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
imbalance in the neck and some of the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.980 
imbalance in the neck and some of the
exercises<00:01:47.490> that<00:01:47.880> you're<00:01:47.970> using<00:01:48.210> are<00:01:48.450> probably

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
exercises that you're using are probably

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.389 
exercises that you're using are probably
going<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.470> do<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.009> what<00:01:50.159> I'm<00:01:50.220> going<00:01:50.340> to

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
going to do that so what I'm going to

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.620 
going to do that so what I'm going to
show<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.640> today<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.570> how<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.439> develop<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:53.630> well

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
show you today is how to develop a well

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.310 
show you today is how to develop a well
balanced<00:01:55.350> musk<00:01:55.890> on<00:01:56.340> neck<00:01:56.880> musculature<00:01:57.600> so

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
balanced musk on neck musculature so

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.050 
balanced musk on neck musculature so
that<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.590> can<00:01:58.740> continue<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.130> thicken<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.729> with

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
that you can continue to thicken it with

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.859 
that you can continue to thicken it with
more<00:02:00.329> muscle<00:02:00.840> more<00:02:01.350> strength<00:02:01.860> without

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
more muscle more strength without

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.880 
more muscle more strength without
sacrificing<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.960> integrity<00:02:04.439> of<00:02:04.530> your

long or kids that carry heavy book heavy
book<00:03:04.050> bags<00:03:04.260> is<00:03:04.530> because<00:03:05.430> there<00:03:05.790> is<00:03:06.000> a

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
book bags is because there is a

book bags is because there is a
continuous<00:03:07.790> sheath<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:08.970> muscle<00:03:09.450> if<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:09.600> can

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
continuous sheath of muscle if you can

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.990 
continuous sheath of muscle if you can
imagine<00:03:09.920> from<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:11.340> you<00:03:11.580> know<00:03:11.670> from<00:03:11.850> your

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
imagine from the you know from your

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.440 
imagine from the you know from your
heels<00:03:12.300> all<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.660> way<00:03:13.110> up<00:03:13.350> until<00:03:13.500> you<00:03:13.770> get<00:03:14.250> to

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
heels all the way up until you get to

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.990 
heels all the way up until you get to
their<00:03:15.450> right<00:03:16.020> and<00:03:16.320> then<00:03:17.190> you've<00:03:17.310> got<00:03:17.520> this<00:03:17.700> gap

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
their right and then you've got this gap

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.300 
their right and then you've got this gap
so<00:03:18.720> it's<00:03:18.930> just<00:03:19.080> continuous<00:03:19.650> muscle<00:03:20.010> all<00:03:20.220> the

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
so it's just continuous muscle all the

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.190 
so it's just continuous muscle all the
way<00:03:20.400> around<00:03:21.030> your<00:03:21.150> entire<00:03:21.330> body<00:03:21.600> and<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:21.960> just

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
way around your entire body and it just

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.470 
way around your entire body and it just
stops<00:03:22.560> here<00:03:22.980> so<00:03:23.430> as<00:03:23.880> all<00:03:24.060> that<00:03:24.240> muscle

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
stops here so as all that muscle

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.110 
stops here so as all that muscle
develops<00:03:25.200> it<00:03:25.320> gets<00:03:25.470> tighter<00:03:25.800> it<00:03:26.610> just<00:03:26.850> sort<00:03:27.060> of

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
develops it gets tighter it just sort of

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.800 
develops it gets tighter it just sort of
pulls<00:03:27.930> where<00:03:28.440> that<00:03:28.620> hinges<00:03:29.540> all<00:03:30.540> right<00:03:30.630> and

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
pulls where that hinges all right and

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.830 
pulls where that hinges all right and
this<00:03:31.170> ends<00:03:31.500> up<00:03:31.590> being<00:03:31.890> what<00:03:32.040> you<00:03:32.160> look<00:03:32.280> like

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
this ends up being what you look like

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.690 
this ends up being what you look like
here<00:03:33.840> this<00:03:34.110> is<00:03:34.140> your<00:03:34.800> head<00:03:34.980> sticking<00:03:35.310> out<00:03:35.520> you

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
here this is your head sticking out you

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.040 
here this is your head sticking out you

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
you to hyperextend like that and you're

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:10.890 
you to hyperextend like that and you're
strengthening<00:06:09.789> the<00:06:10.090> muscles<00:06:10.419> that<00:06:10.539> typically

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
don't get strengthened that's going to

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.960 
don't get strengthened that's going to
force<00:06:12.580> the<00:06:13.320> the<00:06:14.320> neck<00:06:14.800> back<00:06:15.039> into<00:06:15.370> its<00:06:15.550> its

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
well-balanced structure can you continue

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.250 
well-balanced structure can you continue
