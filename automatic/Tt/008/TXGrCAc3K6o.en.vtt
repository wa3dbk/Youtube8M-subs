swap<00:00:18.539> out<00:00:18.720> components

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.590 

also<00:00:28.310> is<00:00:28.490> good<00:00:28.700> to<00:00:28.820> note<00:00:28.940> that<00:00:28.970> this<00:00:29.300> case<00:00:29.570> does

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:29.600 
also is good to note that this case does

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.240 
also is good to note that this case does
actually<00:00:29.960> have<00:00:30.230> rubber<00:00:30.470> feet<00:00:30.710> so<00:00:30.980> it<00:00:31.070> won't

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
actually have rubber feet so it won't

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.910 
actually have rubber feet so it won't
scratch<00:00:31.550> any<00:00:31.790> surface<00:00:31.880> that<00:00:32.270> you<00:00:32.480> put<00:00:32.660> it<00:00:32.780> on

here's how to install the hard drive fan
all<00:01:23.560> you<00:01:23.710> do<00:01:23.860> is<00:01:24.070> make<00:01:24.310> sure<00:01:24.340> you<00:01:24.580> route<00:01:24.790> the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
all you do is make sure you route the

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.060 
all you do is make sure you route the
cables<00:01:25.300> towards<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:25.720> back<00:01:25.870> of<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.080> case<00:01:26.290> then

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
cables towards the back of the case then

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.620 
cables towards the back of the case then
match<00:01:27.310> the<00:01:27.490> bracket<00:01:27.820> up<00:01:27.940> with<00:01:28.120> the<00:01:28.210> top<00:01:28.390> of<00:01:28.540> the

match the bracket up with the top of the

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.950 
match the bracket up with the top of the
case<00:01:28.810> and<00:01:29.080> then<00:01:29.710> it<00:01:29.800> should<00:01:30.070> just<00:01:30.340> slide<00:01:30.430> in<00:01:30.960> it

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
case and then it should just slide in it

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.630 
case and then it should just slide in it
can<00:01:32.230> be<00:01:32.380> a<00:01:32.410> bit<00:01:32.560> temperamental<00:01:32.830> to<00:01:33.220> start<00:01:33.490> with

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
can be a bit temperamental to start with

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.430 
can be a bit temperamental to start with
but<00:01:33.910> once<00:01:34.090> you<00:01:34.180> get<00:01:34.300> the<00:01:34.390> hang<00:01:34.450> of<00:01:34.600> it<00:01:34.720> you<00:01:35.260> good

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
but once you get the hang of it you good

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:43.230 
but once you get the hang of it you good
to<00:01:35.560> go

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.069 

and<00:01:44.549> there<00:01:45.549> we<00:01:45.640> go<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:46.030> fan<00:01:46.270> is<00:01:46.420> installed<00:01:46.840> it

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:47.079 
and there we go the fan is installed it

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:50.520 
and there we go the fan is installed it
really<00:01:47.470> is<00:01:47.560> that<00:01:47.590> simple<00:01:49.020> this<00:01:50.020> case<00:01:50.290> is

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
really is that simple this case is

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.460 
really is that simple this case is
designed<00:01:50.890> to<00:01:51.070> be<00:01:51.189> an<00:01:51.340> arched<00:01:51.700> style<00:01:52.210> you<00:01:53.200> can't

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
really install those massive CPU coolers

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.719 
really install those massive CPU coolers
that<00:01:55.630> you<00:01:55.720> can<00:01:55.930> actually<00:01:56.229> get<00:01:56.439> so<00:01:57.369> as<00:01:57.580> long<00:01:57.670> as

you're sensible this case should be the

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.590 
you're sensible this case should be the
case<00:01:59.860> for<00:01:59.890> you<00:02:00.159> you're<00:02:00.789> able<00:02:01.030> to<00:02:01.119> slide<00:02:01.390> the

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.479 
this all you do is unscrew the left and
the<00:02:07.659> right<00:02:07.780> side<00:02:08.200> screw<00:02:08.619> from<00:02:08.860> the<00:02:09.009> case<00:02:09.220> and

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
the right side screw from the case and

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.220 
the right side screw from the case and
now<00:02:09.640> once<00:02:09.880> you're<00:02:10.060> at<00:02:10.149> this<00:02:10.360> stage<00:02:10.630> all<00:02:10.929> you<00:02:11.080> do

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
now once you're at this stage all you do

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.170 
now once you're at this stage all you do
is<00:02:11.410> pull<00:02:11.769> the<00:02:11.800> tray<00:02:12.130> out<00:02:12.340> but<00:02:12.790> those<00:02:12.910> of<00:02:13.060> you

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
is pull the tray out but those of you

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.790 
is pull the tray out but those of you
that<00:02:13.300> are<00:02:13.420> interested<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:14.080> motherboard<00:02:14.590> tray

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
that are interested the motherboard tray

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.220 
that are interested the motherboard tray
is<00:02:15.069> actually<00:02:15.580> removable

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
is actually removable

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.930 
is actually removable
and<00:02:17.709> now<00:02:18.010> you<00:02:18.069> can<00:02:18.250> see<00:02:18.280> you<00:02:18.580> can<00:02:18.790> actually

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
and now you can see you can actually

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.360 
and now you can see you can actually
access<00:02:19.390> your<00:02:19.780> components<00:02:20.349> easily<00:02:20.830> because<00:02:21.159> at

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
access your components easily because at

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.860 
access your components easily because at
the<00:02:21.489> top<00:02:21.700> is<00:02:21.940> where<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.239> motherboard<00:02:22.720> would

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
the top is where the motherboard would

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.210 
the top is where the motherboard would
be<00:02:22.989> installed<00:02:23.349> and<00:02:23.620> obviously<00:02:24.010> the

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
be installed and obviously the

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.550 
be installed and obviously the
components<00:02:24.790> will<00:02:24.879> be<00:02:24.909> on<00:02:25.090> top<00:02:25.269> of<00:02:25.390> that

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.290 

what<00:02:29.220> you'll<00:02:29.370> probably<00:02:29.610> notice<00:02:29.849> on<00:02:30.150> this

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
what you'll probably notice on this

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.880 
what you'll probably notice on this
motherboard<00:02:30.630> tray<00:02:30.959> is<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.470> there<00:02:31.590> are<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.739> lot

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
motherboard tray is that there are a lot

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.190 
motherboard tray is that there are a lot
of<00:02:31.920> spaces<00:02:32.340> in<00:02:32.760> between<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:33.270> metal<00:02:33.450> the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
of spaces in between the metal the

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.630 
of spaces in between the metal the
reason<00:02:34.500> for<00:02:34.530> this<00:02:34.650> is<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.040> allow<00:02:35.280> you<00:02:35.459> to

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
reason for this is to allow you to

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.280 
reason for this is to allow you to
easily<00:02:35.670> access<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.540> back<00:02:36.989> of<00:02:37.200> the

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
easily access the back of the

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.710 
easily access the back of the
motherboard<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:38.160> unscrew<00:02:38.610> CPU<00:02:39.120> coolers<00:02:39.510> and

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
motherboard to unscrew CPU coolers and

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.690 
motherboard to unscrew CPU coolers and
various<00:02:40.110> other<00:02:40.260> things<00:02:40.349> like<00:02:40.709> that<00:02:40.890> the

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
various other things like that the

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.979 
various other things like that the
controllers<00:02:42.209> that<00:02:42.360> you<00:02:42.420> can<00:02:42.569> see<00:02:42.750> at<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:42.959> top

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
controllers that you can see at the top

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.699 
controllers that you can see at the top
of<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.410> case<00:02:43.590> are<00:02:43.860> a<00:02:44.700> power<00:02:45.060> button<00:02:45.269> and<00:02:45.709> what

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
of the case are a power button and what

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.620 
of the case are a power button and what
seems<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.069> be<00:02:47.099> a<00:02:47.190> fan<00:02:47.550> speed<00:02:47.910> controller<00:02:48.390> if

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
seems to be a fan speed controller if

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.630 
seems to be a fan speed controller if
you<00:02:49.110> wish<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.380> pick<00:02:49.560> up<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:49.980> move<00:02:50.190> your<00:02:50.370> case
