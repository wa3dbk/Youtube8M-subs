00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
because I say obviously we've got NXT so

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.250 
because I say obviously we've got NXT so
that's<00:00:18.090> kind<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.390> foundation<00:00:18.539> we've<00:00:19.109> got

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
that's kind of the foundation we've got

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.570 
that's kind of the foundation we've got
some<00:00:19.439> amazing<00:00:19.650> stuff<00:00:19.920> going<00:00:20.130> on<00:00:20.189> there<00:00:20.340> so<00:00:20.460> it

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
some amazing stuff going on there so it

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.400 
some amazing stuff going on there so it
proves<00:00:21.060> that<00:00:21.210> if<00:00:21.390> they<00:00:21.570> want<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:22.020> do<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.260> they

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
proves that if they want to do it they

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.050 
proves that if they want to do it they
can<00:00:22.710> do<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.580> think<00:00:23.640> they've<00:00:23.850> got

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
can do it and I think they've got

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.550 
can do it and I think they've got

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.920 
and it was just it was it was epic and
just<00:01:21.390> because<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.600> was<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.720> little<00:01:21.810> bit

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
just because it was a little bit

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.330 
just because it was a little bit
different<00:01:22.320> from<00:01:22.409> what<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.710> kind<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.040> used<00:01:23.189> to

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
different from what you kind of used to

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.760 
different from what you kind of used to
saying<00:01:23.630> so<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.659> think<00:01:24.720> if<00:01:24.960> they<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.740> know

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
saying so I think if they you know

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.410 
saying so I think if they you know
unless<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.159> was<00:01:26.250> just<00:01:26.430> Vincent<00:01:27.090> man<00:01:27.180> trying<00:01:27.390> to

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
unless it was just Vincent man trying to

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.080 
unless it was just Vincent man trying to
stir<00:01:27.810> with<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.619> tweet<00:01:28.890> just<00:01:29.130> kind<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.640> you

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
stir with this tweet just kind of to you

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.390

know<00:01:30.210> calm<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.810> waters<00:01:31.020> but<00:01:31.619> now<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.220> think

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
know calm the waters but now I think

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.740 
know calm the waters but now I think
would<00:01:32.700> be<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.939> time<00:01:33.180> for<00:01:33.210> them<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.509> actually

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
would be a time for them to actually

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.140 
would be a time for them to actually
like<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.590> makes<00:01:34.740> sense<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.400> kind<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.030> do

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
like that it makes sense to kind of do

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.980 
like that it makes sense to kind of do
it<00:01:36.270> now<00:01:36.420> because<00:01:36.630> there's<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.840> bit<00:01:36.960> of

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
it now because there's a bit of

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.450 
it now because there's a bit of
attention<00:01:37.229> on<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.829> if<00:01:37.890> they<00:01:37.920> sort<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.280> they

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
attention on it and if they sort of they

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.190 
attention on it and if they sort of they
start<00:01:38.700> pushing<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.329> know<00:01:39.750> maybe<00:01:39.990> if<00:01:40.110> they

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
start pushing it you know maybe if they

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.690 
start pushing it you know maybe if they
brought<00:01:40.409> Charlotte<00:01:40.829> up<00:01:40.920> or<00:01:41.070> someone<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.549> then

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
brought Charlotte up or someone and then

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.149 
brought Charlotte up or someone and then
it<00:01:42.270> kind<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.570> built<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.170> model<00:01:43.320> around<00:01:43.680> her

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
it kind of built the model around her

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.980 
it kind of built the model around her
and<00:01:44.399> page<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.939> if<00:01:45.060> AJ<00:01:45.329> did<00:01:45.509> come<00:01:45.689> back<00:01:45.840> for

and page and if AJ did come back for
example<00:01:46.320> she's<00:01:46.500> obviously<00:01:46.710> got<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:47.130> great

story line now she can come back into
with<00:01:51.119> Steph<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.540> everything<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:53.090> yeah<00:01:54.090> I

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
definitely think that they've really got

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.800 
definitely think that they've really got
to<00:01:59.159> start<00:01:59.369> really<00:01:59.969> got<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.299> start<00:02:00.450> looking<00:02:00.719> at

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
to start really got to start looking at

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.649 
to start really got to start looking at
themselves<00:02:01.340> and<00:02:02.340> not<00:02:02.939> only<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.180> but<00:02:03.329> the

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
themselves and not only that but the

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.480 
themselves and not only that but the
obvious<00:02:04.200> success<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.740> Ronda<00:02:05.100> Rousey<00:02:05.399> in<00:02:05.460> UFC

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
obvious success of Ronda Rousey in UFC

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.969 
obvious success of Ronda Rousey in UFC
as<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.090> reason<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.689> go<00:02:07.200> with<00:02:07.409> this<00:02:07.530> stuff<00:02:07.740> even

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
as a reason to go with this stuff even

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.190 
as a reason to go with this stuff even
if<00:02:08.069> just<00:02:08.280> for<00:02:08.399> just<00:02:09.330> for<00:02:09.450> their<00:02:09.599> own<00:02:09.629> selfish

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
if just for just for their own selfish

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.930 
if just for just for their own selfish
monetary<00:02:10.950> purposes<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.670> know<00:02:11.730> there<00:02:11.910> is

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
monetary purposes you know there is

money<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.300> be<00:02:12.450> had<00:02:12.750> I

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
money to be had I

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.700 
money to be had I
think<00:02:13.280> in<00:02:14.060> competitive<00:02:14.840> women<00:02:15.020> fighting<00:02:15.440> each

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
think in competitive women fighting each

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.310 
think in competitive women fighting each
other<00:02:15.860> and<00:02:16.220> having<00:02:16.960> people<00:02:17.960> take<00:02:18.290> it

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
other and having people take it

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.230 
other and having people take it
seriously<00:02:18.470> well<00:02:19.400> they<00:02:19.490> get<00:02:19.610> at<00:02:19.760> SummerSlam

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
with steph and Brie like up until the

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.070 
with steph and Brie like up until the
screw<00:02:22.550> job<00:02:22.700> at<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:23.000> ends<00:02:23.420> like<00:02:23.690> that<00:02:23.900> was

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
screw job at the ends like that was

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.230 
screw job at the ends like that was
getting<00:02:24.440> some<00:02:24.650> genuine<00:02:25.070> reaction<00:02:25.220> it<00:02:25.850> was

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
getting some genuine reaction it was

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.120 
getting some genuine reaction it was
over<00:02:26.630> I've<00:02:26.900> spoken<00:02:27.320> about<00:02:27.500> that<00:02:27.710> a<00:02:27.740> lot<00:02:27.860> in<00:02:28.100> the

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
over I've spoken about that a lot in the

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.740 
over I've spoken about that a lot in the
past<00:02:28.400> but<00:02:28.640> it<00:02:28.820> wasn't<00:02:29.150> at<00:02:29.300> one<00:02:29.480> stage

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
past but it wasn't at one stage

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.050 
past but it wasn't at one stage
definitely<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:30.260> right<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:31.490> I<00:02:31.550> think<00:02:31.580> that

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
definitely a right and I think that

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.610 
definitely a right and I think that
there<00:02:32.540> can<00:02:32.720> be<00:02:32.750> again<00:02:33.110> I<00:02:33.260> guess<00:02:33.470> the

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
there can be again I guess the

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.140 
there can be again I guess the
difference<00:02:33.920> there<00:02:34.190> was<00:02:34.220> stephanie<00:02:35.030> was

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
difference there was stephanie was

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.580 
difference there was stephanie was
involved<00:02:35.420> that<00:02:35.720> was<00:02:35.840> as<00:02:35.960> simple<00:02:36.080> as<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.380> is<00:02:36.440> I

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
involved that was as simple as it is I

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.630 
involved that was as simple as it is I
think<00:02:36.710> yeah<00:02:36.890> but<00:02:37.100> yeah<00:02:37.220> baby<00:02:37.400> you<00:02:37.460> know<00:02:37.580> you
