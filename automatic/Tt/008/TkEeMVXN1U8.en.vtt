00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
switches these are the command versions

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.749 
switches these are the command versions
and<00:00:09.570> they're<00:00:10.559> packaged<00:00:10.980> just<00:00:11.280> like<00:00:11.460> normal

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759

switches they come with the little

switches they come with the little
remote<00:00:16.080> here<00:00:16.470> like<00:00:16.800> this<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:18.020> count<00:00:19.020> with

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
remote here like this and count with

remote here like this and count with
everything<00:00:19.619> that<00:00:19.800> would<00:00:20.070> normally<00:00:20.220> come<00:00:20.609> to

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
everything that would normally come to

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.849 
everything that would normally come to
switch<00:00:21.180> except<00:00:22.050> for<00:00:22.320> they're<00:00:22.970> able<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.180> run

I'm<00:00:25.859> not<00:00:26.010> sure<00:00:26.189> how<00:00:26.279> much<00:00:26.460> they<00:00:26.670> actually

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
I'm not sure how much they actually

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.700 
I'm not sure how much they actually
cause<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.480> think<00:00:27.750> it's<00:00:27.990> like<00:00:28.080> an<00:00:28.199> extra<00:00:28.380> twenty

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
cause I think it's like an extra twenty

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.820 
cause I think it's like an extra twenty
dollars<00:00:29.039> or<00:00:29.130> something<00:00:29.340> like<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.550> but

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
dollars or something like that but

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.229 
dollars or something like that but
except<00:00:31.830> for<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.130> aren't<00:00:32.369> able<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.640> run<00:00:32.910> these

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
except for you aren't able to run these

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.090 
except for you aren't able to run these
like<00:00:33.840> anything<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.230> have<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.410> one<00:00:34.620> Swit<00:00:34.890> a

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
like anything you have this one Swit a

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.150 
like anything you have this one Swit a
separate<00:00:35.550> five<00:00:36.050> so<00:00:37.050> if<00:00:37.140> he<00:00:37.260> did<00:00:37.440> switch<00:00:37.890> five

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
separate five so if he did switch five

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.069 
separate five so if he did switch five
on<00:00:38.520> either<00:00:39.000> remote<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.660> doesn't<00:00:39.930> make<00:00:40.050> a

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
on either remote it doesn't make a

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.250 
on either remote it doesn't make a
difference<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:41.750> through<00:00:42.750> your<00:00:42.840> switches<00:00:43.170> back

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
difference in through your switches back

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.490 
difference in through your switches back
and<00:00:43.320> forth<00:00:43.670> enough<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.910> arcs<00:00:45.210> two<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.289> one

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
and forth enough the arcs two and one

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.220 
and forth enough the arcs two and one
now<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.309> can<00:00:47.430> actually<00:00:47.579> buy<00:00:47.960> separate<00:00:48.960> stuff

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
now you can actually buy separate stuff

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.860 
now you can actually buy separate stuff
where<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.590> can<00:00:49.739> hook<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.100> up<00:00:50.329> up<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.750> and

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
where you can hook this up up to it and

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.930 
where you can hook this up up to it and
I<00:00:51.989> actually<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.410> something<00:00:52.649> like<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:54.649> but

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
I actually have something like that but

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.069 
I actually have something like that but
hang<00:00:56.940> on<00:00:57.090> let's<00:00:57.329> sit<00:00:57.570> right<00:00:59.600> here<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.719> the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
hang on let's sit right here is the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.779 
hang on let's sit right here is the
program<00:01:01.559> button<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.160> sticks<00:01:02.399> out<00:01:02.550> pretty

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
program button and it sticks out pretty

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.550 
program button and it sticks out pretty
far<00:01:03.090> actually<00:01:05.030> if<00:01:06.049> it<00:01:07.049> would<00:01:07.170> have<00:01:07.290> been<00:01:07.380> nice

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
far actually if it would have been nice

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.350 
far actually if it would have been nice
if<00:01:07.590> they<00:01:07.920> want<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.220> at<00:01:08.460> least<00:01:08.490> stuck<00:01:09.150> that

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
blend it in a little bit more but if you

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.230 
blend it in a little bit more but if you
push<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.210> hold<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:16.460> i'll<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.970> searched

push and hold that i'll and and searched

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.980 
push and hold that i'll and and searched
blink<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:19.790> then<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:21.030> can<00:01:21.150> hit<00:01:21.299> like<00:01:21.330> switch

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
blink and then you can hit like switch

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.960 
blink and then you can hit like switch
five<00:01:22.890> and<00:01:23.490> then<00:01:24.290> set<00:01:25.430> it'll<00:01:26.430> stop<00:01:26.729> blinking

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
five and then set it'll stop blinking

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.230 
five and then set it'll stop blinking
and<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.570> shouldn't<00:01:27.780> be<00:01:27.869> able<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:29.000> run<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.119> off

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
and you shouldn't be able to run it off

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.460 
and you shouldn't be able to run it off
a<00:01:30.270> switch<00:01:30.900> by<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:35.780> have<00:01:36.780> another<00:01:36.960> one<00:01:37.170> set<00:01:37.380> up

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
a switch by I have another one set up

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.090 
a switch by I have another one set up
down<00:01:37.650> here<00:01:37.979> which<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.430> switch<00:01:38.729> six<00:01:39.860> so<00:01:40.860> if<00:01:40.979> we

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
down here which is switch six so if we

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.940 
down here which is switch six so if we
go<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.520> SW<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.810> then

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
go in SW and then

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.380 
go in SW and then
six<00:01:45.229> and<00:01:46.229> we<00:01:46.830> can<00:01:47.040> just<00:01:47.250> throw<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:48.000> back<00:01:48.240> and

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
six and we can just throw that back and

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.350 
six and we can just throw that back and
forth<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.869> oxen<00:01:49.229> one<00:01:49.350> an<00:01:49.439> ox<00:01:49.590> tail<00:01:53.360> very

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
forth the oxen one an ox tail very

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.749 
forth the oxen one an ox tail very
simple<00:01:57.560> that's<00:01:58.560> just<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.890> simple<00:01:59.189> test<00:01:59.430> track

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
simple that's just a simple test track

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.639 
simple that's just a simple test track
running<00:02:00.149> off<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.299> CW<00:02:00.899> 80<00:02:01.080> and<00:02:02.270> TMCC<00:02:03.270> but<00:02:05.210> that

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
running off the CW 80 and TMCC but that

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:12.199 
running off the CW 80 and TMCC but that
it<00:02:07.649> works<00:02:09.229> this<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.380> the<00:02:10.500> simplified<00:02:11.209> version

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
it works this is the simplified version

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.330 
it works this is the simplified version
of<00:02:12.330> them<00:02:12.600> really<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.560> only<00:02:13.709> difference<00:02:14.190> is

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
of them really the only difference is

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.190 
of them really the only difference is
that<00:02:14.459> you<00:02:14.640> can<00:02:14.670> run<00:02:15.000> them<00:02:15.150> with<00:02:15.330> a<00:02:15.780> remote

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
that you can run them with a remote

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.790 
that you can run them with a remote
without<00:02:16.680> any<00:02:17.190> kind<00:02:17.430> of<00:02:17.459> external<00:02:18.410> things<00:02:19.410> and

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
without any kind of external things and

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.390 
without any kind of external things and
I'm<00:02:19.920> not<00:02:20.580> going<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.799> be<00:02:22.799> using<00:02:23.280> these

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
I'm not going to be using these

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.130 
I'm not going to be using these
controllers<00:02:23.850> to<00:02:24.090> them<00:02:24.239> trying<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.660> get<00:02:24.780> rid<00:02:25.110> of

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
controllers to them trying to get rid of

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.559 
controllers to them trying to get rid of
them<00:02:25.380> yeah<00:02:26.010> it<00:02:26.280> comes<00:02:26.549> with<00:02:26.819> um<00:02:27.060> that<00:02:27.269> you<00:02:27.390> want

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
them yeah it comes with um that you want

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
underside of the switch here there is

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.580 
underside of the switch here there is
one<00:02:38.750> slight<00:02:39.750> difference<00:02:42.170> you<00:02:43.170> see<00:02:43.440> that

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
one slight difference you see that

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.190 
one slight difference you see that
there's<00:02:43.769> an<00:02:43.890> extra<00:02:44.569> screw<00:02:45.569> terminal<00:02:46.019> here

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
there's an extra screw terminal here

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.289 
there's an extra screw terminal here
it's<00:02:46.470> it's<00:02:46.950> marked<00:02:47.280> data<00:02:47.549> I'm<00:02:47.910> not<00:02:48.060> sure<00:02:48.239> if

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
it's it's marked data I'm not sure if

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:49.759 
it's it's marked data I'm not sure if
you<00:02:48.390> can<00:02:48.510> get<00:02:48.600> all<00:02:48.720> right<00:02:48.750> there<00:02:49.049> you<00:02:49.590> read

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
you can get all right there you read

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.199 
you can get all right there you read
that<00:02:50.390> it's<00:02:51.390> marked<00:02:51.570> for<00:02:51.840> data<00:02:52.079> and<00:02:53.000> I'm<00:02:54.000> not

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
that it's marked for data and I'm not

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.670 
that it's marked for data and I'm not
really<00:02:54.359> sure<00:02:54.570> what<00:02:54.720> it<00:02:54.810> does<00:02:54.840> I<00:02:55.049> should<00:02:55.530> have

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
really sure what it does I should have

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.110 
really sure what it does I should have
probably<00:02:55.980> looked<00:02:56.340> that<00:02:56.430> up<00:02:56.579> at<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.760> manual

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
probably looked that up at the manual

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.900 
probably looked that up at the manual
but<00:02:57.329> it<00:02:57.900> seems<00:02:58.260> like<00:02:58.500> it<00:02:58.680> should<00:02:59.010> get<00:02:59.579> data

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
but it seems like it should get data

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.050 
but it seems like it should get data
just<00:03:00.239> fine<00:03:00.540> if<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:00.870> like<00:03:01.049> your<00:03:01.430> ground<00:03:02.430> into

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
just fine if you like your ground into

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:11.150 
just fine if you like your ground into
the<00:03:03.890> track<00:03:07.910> hook<00:03:08.910> up<00:03:09.350> your<00:03:10.350> ground<00:03:10.680> like<00:03:11.040> it

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
the track hook up your ground like it

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.650 
the track hook up your ground like it
already<00:03:11.430> should<00:03:11.760> be<00:03:12.079> on<00:03:13.079> to<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:13.350> outer<00:03:13.890> rails

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
already should be on to the outer rails

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.849 
already should be on to the outer rails
yeah<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:15.870> it<00:03:15.930> seems<00:03:16.079> like<00:03:16.290> works<00:03:16.500> just<00:03:16.709> fine

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
yeah and it seems like works just fine

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.120 
yeah and it seems like works just fine
like<00:03:17.070> that<00:03:17.130> so<00:03:17.750> I'm<00:03:18.750> not<00:03:18.810> sure<00:03:18.989> what<00:03:19.739> you<00:03:19.859> need

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
like that so I'm not sure what you need

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.840 
like that so I'm not sure what you need
that<00:03:20.160> data<00:03:20.519> for<00:03:20.850> I<00:03:21.150> suppose<00:03:21.690> that's<00:03:22.140> for<00:03:22.380> like

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
that data for I suppose that's for like

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.130 
that data for I suppose that's for like
connecting<00:03:23.850> directly<00:03:24.390> to<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:26.510> the<00:03:27.510> front<00:03:27.930> of

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
connecting directly to the the front of

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.440 
connecting directly to the the front of
the<00:03:28.470> command<00:03:29.310> base<00:03:29.609> here<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.859> port<00:03:31.859> here<00:03:32.450> mark

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
the command base here the port here mark

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.869 
the command base here the port here mark
computer

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:38.399 

so<00:03:37.359> that's<00:03:37.599> just<00:03:37.870> kind<00:03:38.109> of<00:03:38.140> what<00:03:38.230> I'm<00:03:38.379> thinking

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:38.409 
so that's just kind of what I'm thinking

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:45.479 
so that's just kind of what I'm thinking
but<00:03:39.099> not<00:03:39.819> sure<00:03:40.150> so<00:03:43.829> anyhow<00:03:44.829> that's<00:03:45.040> about<00:03:45.310> all

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
but not sure so anyhow that's about all

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.520 
but not sure so anyhow that's about all
I<00:03:45.519> have<00:03:45.609> for<00:03:45.909> these<00:03:45.999> switches<00:03:46.450> see<00:03:47.290> you<00:03:47.349> next

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530
