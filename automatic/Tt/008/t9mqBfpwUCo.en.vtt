00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.060 

say<00:01:37.880> this<00:01:38.060> so<00:01:38.240> we<00:01:38.450> would<00:01:38.660> not<00:01:38.810> be<00:01:38.870> here<00:01:39.290> we

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
say this so we would not be here we

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.230 
say this so we would not be here we
didn't<00:01:40.310> think<00:01:40.400> it<00:01:40.550> was<00:01:40.640> a<00:01:40.730> really<00:01:40.850> competitive

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
didn't think it was a really competitive

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.640 
didn't think it was a really competitive
game<00:01:41.600> with<00:01:41.780> a<00:01:41.810> chance<00:01:42.080> of<00:01:42.170> an<00:01:42.290> upset<00:01:42.620> and

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
game with a chance of an upset and

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.710 
game with a chance of an upset and
that's<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:43.100> potential<00:01:43.670> news<00:01:43.880> story<00:01:44.240> here<00:01:44.570> is

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
that's the potential news story here is

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.840 
that's the potential news story here is
that<00:01:45.200> Alabama<00:01:45.979> gets<00:01:46.220> knocked<00:01:46.370> off<00:01:46.610> which

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
that Alabama gets knocked off which

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.219 
that Alabama gets knocked off which
would<00:01:46.970> be<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.120> biggest<00:01:47.270> story<00:01:47.660> of<00:01:47.720> the<00:01:47.810> season

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
would be the biggest story of the season

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.900 
would be the biggest story of the season
so<00:01:48.380> far<00:01:48.410> so<00:01:48.860> if<00:01:49.250> we<00:01:49.400> didn't<00:01:49.550> think<00:01:49.670> there<00:01:49.760> was<00:01:49.820> a

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
so far so if we didn't think there was a

00:01:49.910 --> 00:02:04.620 
so far so if we didn't think there was a
chance<00:01:49.940> that<00:01:50.270> we'd<00:01:50.540> be<00:01:50.660> somewhere<00:01:51.050> else

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630
