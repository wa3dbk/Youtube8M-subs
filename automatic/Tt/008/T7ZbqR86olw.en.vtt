00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
sounds to me like your prayer is having

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:30.290 
sounds to me like your prayer is having
an<00:02:23.260> adverse<00:02:23.500> effect<00:02:27.510> here's<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.600> funny<00:02:28.870> part

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
an adverse effect here's the funny part

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.030 
an adverse effect here's the funny part
that<00:02:31.300> would<00:02:31.450> appear<00:02:31.810> to<00:02:31.840> mean<00:02:32.140> that<00:02:32.380> even<00:02:32.560> God

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
that would appear to mean that even God

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.820 
that would appear to mean that even God
doesn't<00:02:33.070> like<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.910> Bible<00:02:34.060> Belt<00:02:34.330> I<00:02:37.830> mean

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
and not only did it not happen but our

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.480 
and not only did it not happen but our
chances<00:02:46.900> became<00:02:47.410> less<00:02:49.290> so<00:02:50.290> maybe<00:02:50.650> even<00:02:50.800> he

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
chances became less so maybe even he

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.690 
chances became less so maybe even he
doesn't<00:02:52.000> like<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:53.650> Bible<00:02:54.010> Belt<00:02:54.130> Christians
