how's the earth made and the other

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.030 
how's the earth made and the other
planets<00:00:09.760> the<00:00:10.630> theory<00:00:10.900> is<00:00:11.110> that<00:00:11.410> from<00:00:11.920> the

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.040 
planets the theory is that from the

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.339 
planets the theory is that from the
cloud<00:00:12.250> of<00:00:12.429> dust<00:00:12.460> and<00:00:12.969> gas<00:00:13.179> that<00:00:13.210> made<00:00:13.630> a<00:00:13.660> star<00:00:14.049> a

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:14.349 
cloud of dust and gas that made a star a

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
disc forms in it dust clumps together

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.380 
disc forms in it dust clumps together
forming<00:00:18.130> bigger<00:00:18.400> and<00:00:18.640> bigger<00:00:18.850> lumps<00:00:19.090> and

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
forming bigger and bigger lumps and

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.359 
forming bigger and bigger lumps and
eventually<00:00:20.140> gravity<00:00:20.650> will<00:00:20.830> pull<00:00:20.980> them

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
eventually gravity will pull them

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.550 
eventually gravity will pull them
together<00:00:21.519> into<00:00:21.880> planets<00:00:22.330> but<00:00:23.140> this<00:00:23.320> will<00:00:23.470> only

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
together into planets but this will only

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.320 
together into planets but this will only
work<00:00:23.859> if<00:00:24.039> the<00:00:24.070> LOX<00:00:24.400> actually<00:00:24.849> stick<00:00:25.150> together

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
work if the LOX actually stick together

something that has puzzled astro chemist
Helen<00:00:28.449> Fraser<00:00:29.519> we<00:00:30.519> know<00:00:30.670> how<00:00:30.820> the<00:00:30.880> big<00:00:31.240> things

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
Helen Fraser we know how the big things

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.540 
Helen Fraser we know how the big things
stick<00:00:31.900> together<00:00:32.080> with<00:00:32.439> gravitational<00:00:32.920> forces

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
stick together with gravitational forces

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.520 
stick together with gravitational forces
and<00:00:33.940> have<00:00:34.360> a<00:00:34.390> small<00:00:34.780> thing<00:00:35.049> stick<00:00:35.350> together

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
and have a small thing stick together

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.469 
and have a small thing stick together
with<00:00:35.890> the<00:00:35.979> attractive<00:00:36.280> forces<00:00:36.790> between<00:00:36.940> them

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:37.479 
with the attractive forces between them

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:39.420 
with the attractive forces between them
but<00:00:38.170> the<00:00:38.260> problem<00:00:38.589> is<00:00:38.710> that<00:00:38.860> when<00:00:38.979> we<00:00:39.010> get<00:00:39.250> to

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
but the problem is that when we get to

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.910 
but the problem is that when we get to
this<00:00:39.580> gap<00:00:40.089> between<00:00:40.330> millimeter<00:00:41.080> sizes<00:00:41.440> and

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
this gap between millimeter sizes and

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.369 
this gap between millimeter sizes and
kilometer<00:00:42.610> sizes<00:00:43.120> we<00:00:43.570> actually<00:00:43.989> don't<00:00:44.229> know

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
kilometer sizes we actually don't know

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.520 
kilometer sizes we actually don't know
how<00:00:44.530> the<00:00:44.589> particles<00:00:45.129> stick<00:00:45.370> together<00:00:45.519> at<00:00:45.909> all

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
how the particles stick together at all

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.079 
how the particles stick together at all
Helen<00:00:47.530> tried<00:00:47.830> to<00:00:47.979> recreate<00:00:48.400> the<00:00:48.699> beginnings

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:49.089 
Helen tried to recreate the beginnings

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:51.600 
Helen tried to recreate the beginnings
of<00:00:49.210> a<00:00:49.299> planet<00:00:49.659> by<00:00:50.080> firing<00:00:50.470> centimeter<00:00:51.280> sized

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
of a planet by firing centimeter sized

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.640 
of a planet by firing centimeter sized
lumps<00:00:52.239> at<00:00:52.330> each<00:00:52.449> other<00:00:52.659> to<00:00:53.110> see<00:00:53.320> if<00:00:53.409> they<00:00:53.530> would

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:53.650 
lumps at each other to see if they would

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.770 
lumps at each other to see if they would
stick<00:00:53.979> but<00:00:54.699> the<00:00:54.790> results<00:00:55.269> were<00:00:55.600> disappointing

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
stick but the results were disappointing

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.140 
stick but the results were disappointing
what<00:00:56.680> happens<00:00:57.100> is<00:00:57.250> gravity<00:00:57.729> acts<00:00:57.850> on<00:00:58.059> the

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
what happens is gravity acts on the

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.729 
what happens is gravity acts on the
particles<00:00:58.629> and<00:00:58.809> before<00:00:59.049> they<00:00:59.170> get<00:00:59.290> anywhere

00:00:59.729 --> 00:00:59.739 
particles and before they get anywhere

near hitting each other they just

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.210 
near hitting each other they just

effects of gravity you'll hear the

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.560 
effects of gravity you'll hear the
pilots<00:01:26.020> say<00:01:26.200> the<00:01:26.320> word<00:01:26.530> injection<00:01:27.570> he's

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
pilots say the word injection he's

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.300 
pilots say the word injection he's
French<00:01:28.870> so<00:01:29.230> he<00:01:29.320> says<00:01:29.530> it<00:01:29.680> in<00:01:29.770> a<00:01:29.860> very<00:01:30.100> nice

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
French so he says it in a very nice

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.820 
French so he says it in a very nice
accent<00:01:30.760> and<00:01:31.020> what<00:01:32.020> happens<00:01:32.470> is<00:01:32.650> you<00:01:32.770> start

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
accent and what happens is you start

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.500 
accent and what happens is you start
floating<00:01:33.400> off<00:01:33.730> the<00:01:33.760> ground

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
floating off the ground

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.390 
floating off the ground
and<00:01:34.600> as<00:01:35.170> you<00:01:35.320> start<00:01:35.409> floating<00:01:35.980> off<00:01:36.040> the<00:01:36.070> ground

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
and as you start floating off the ground

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.530 
and as you start floating off the ground
this<00:01:36.550> is<00:01:36.700> really<00:01:37.090> where<00:01:37.240> you<00:01:37.270> have

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
this is really where you have

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.120 
this is really where you have
microgravity<00:01:38.470> and<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:40.600> only<00:01:40.840> lasts<00:01:41.290> 22

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
microgravity and that only lasts 22

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.730 
microgravity and that only lasts 22
seconds<00:01:42.880> and<00:01:43.420> what's<00:01:43.690> very<00:01:43.810> important<00:01:44.470> at<00:01:44.650> the

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
seconds and what's very important at the

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.040 
seconds and what's very important at the
end<00:01:44.860> of<00:01:45.010> 22<00:01:45.490> seconds<00:01:46.090> is<00:01:46.210> the<00:01:46.390> plane<00:01:46.780> has<00:01:47.020> to

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
end of 22 seconds is the plane has to

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.500 
end of 22 seconds is the plane has to
pull<00:01:47.409> back<00:01:47.680> out<00:01:47.950> of<00:01:48.159> the<00:01:48.280> parabola<00:01:48.580> and<00:01:49.120> it<00:01:49.330> has

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
pull back out of the parabola and it has

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.360 
pull back out of the parabola and it has

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:51.370 
to do that at the same angle it went in

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.270 
to do that at the same angle it went in
at<00:01:51.490> ie<00:01:51.700> that<00:01:52.060> 50<00:01:52.450> degrees<00:01:52.750> upwards<00:01:53.200> becomes<00:01:53.890> 50

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
at ie that 50 degrees upwards becomes 50

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.950 
at ie that 50 degrees upwards becomes 50
degrees<00:01:54.610> straight<00:01:54.940> downwards<00:01:55.390> towards<00:01:55.810> the

degrees straight downwards towards the

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.430 
degrees straight downwards towards the
sea

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
sea

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.039 
sea
it<00:01:57.220> might<00:01:57.460> seem<00:01:57.700> quite<00:01:57.880> scary<00:01:58.330> for<00:01:58.570> the<00:01:58.630> pilots

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
it might seem quite scary for the pilots

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:00.840 
it might seem quite scary for the pilots
who<00:01:59.229> are<00:01:59.320> just<00:01:59.500> looking<00:01:59.650> at<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.040> sea<00:02:00.280> but

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
who are just looking at the sea but

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.670 
who are just looking at the sea but
again<00:02:01.150> for<00:02:01.330> us<00:02:01.510> inside<00:02:01.900> the<00:02:02.020> aeroplane<00:02:02.380> what

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
again for us inside the aeroplane what

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.760 
again for us inside the aeroplane what
we<00:02:02.860> feel<00:02:03.100> is<00:02:03.220> another<00:02:03.520> two<00:02:04.090> g-force<00:02:04.690> and<00:02:05.049> we

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
we feel is another two g-force and we

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.630 
we feel is another two g-force and we
repeat<00:02:06.130> this<00:02:06.390> 31<00:02:07.390> times<00:02:07.840> during<00:02:08.379> a<00:02:08.560> flight

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
repeat this 31 times during a flight

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.760 
repeat this 31 times during a flight
and<00:02:09.810> generally<00:02:10.810> that<00:02:10.930> takes<00:02:11.230> about<00:02:11.380> four<00:02:11.740> to

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
and generally that takes about four to

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:18.400 
and generally that takes about four to
five<00:02:11.920> hours<00:02:12.520> on<00:02:12.790> an<00:02:13.420> airplane<00:02:13.810> with<00:02:14.080> no<00:02:14.110> toilet

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.110 

we<00:02:19.410> work<00:02:19.620> in<00:02:19.800> a<00:02:19.890> team<00:02:20.160> of<00:02:20.310> three<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.970> each

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
we work in a team of three and each

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.080 
we work in a team of three and each
person<00:02:21.600> has<00:02:21.750> a<00:02:21.780> very<00:02:22.050> specific<00:02:22.470> job<00:02:23.000> so<00:02:24.000> as

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
person has a very specific job so as

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.690 
person has a very specific job so as
soon<00:02:24.300> as<00:02:24.360> we<00:02:24.510> hear<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:25.050> injection<00:02:25.800> sound<00:02:26.310> they

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
soon as we hear the injection sound they

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.940 
soon as we hear the injection sound they
have<00:02:26.850> to<00:02:27.000> turn<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.660> little<00:02:27.960> particle<00:02:28.320> holder<00:02:28.800> so

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
have to turn a little particle holder so

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.920 
have to turn a little particle holder so
the<00:02:29.070> particles<00:02:29.580> are<00:02:29.700> aligned<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.420> ready<00:02:30.480> for

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
the particles are aligned and ready for

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.290 
the particles are aligned and ready for
the<00:02:31.350> Pistons<00:02:31.800> to<00:02:31.980> fire<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.850> push<00:02:33.120> the

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
the Pistons to fire and push the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.880 
the Pistons to fire and push the
particles<00:02:33.750> towards<00:02:34.080> each<00:02:34.200> other<00:02:34.410> until<00:02:34.740> they

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
particles towards each other until they

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.620 
particles towards each other until they
collide<00:02:35.220> then<00:02:35.760> another<00:02:36.030> member<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.600> team

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
collide then another member of the team

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.590 
collide then another member of the team
will<00:02:37.320> actually<00:02:37.740> fire<00:02:38.070> the<00:02:38.280> Pistons<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.030> you

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
will actually fire the Pistons and you

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.120 
will actually fire the Pistons and you
hear<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.900> Pistons<00:02:40.320> move<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:40.860> there's

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
hear the Pistons move and there's

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
hear the Pistons move and there's
something<00:02:41.310> like<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:44.310> role<00:02:44.460> of<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.760> final

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
something like the role of the final

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.150 
something like the role of the final
person<00:02:45.390> is<00:02:45.660> simply<00:02:45.960> to<00:02:46.110> start<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:46.680> stop<00:02:46.980> an

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
person is simply to start and stop an

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.130 
person is simply to start and stop an
ultra-fast<00:02:47.670> camera<00:02:48.330> which<00:02:48.480> is<00:02:48.630> recording

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
ultra-fast camera which is recording

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.870 
ultra-fast camera which is recording
exactly<00:02:49.740> where<00:02:49.890> our<00:02:49.920> particles<00:02:50.550> are<00:02:50.700> moving

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
exactly where our particles are moving

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.090 
exactly where our particles are moving
on<00:02:51.090> what's<00:02:51.270> happening<00:02:51.720> we<00:02:52.380> try<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:52.830> do<00:02:52.950> this

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
on what's happening we try and do this

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.510 
on what's happening we try and do this
two<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:53.820> three<00:02:54.060> times<00:02:54.390> per<00:02:54.810> parabola<00:02:55.520> even

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
two to three times per parabola even

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.310 
two to three times per parabola even
under<00:02:56.760> these<00:02:56.940> conditions<00:02:57.570> the<00:02:57.840> particles

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
under these conditions the particles

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.080 
under these conditions the particles
don't<00:02:58.530> stick<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:59.070> next<00:02:59.760> round<00:02:59.940> of

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
don't stick the next round of

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.800 
don't stick the next round of
experiments<00:03:00.420> will<00:03:01.050> be<00:03:01.080> even<00:03:01.470> more<00:03:01.500> extreme

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
experiments will be even more extreme

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.670 
experiments will be even more extreme
basically<00:03:03.810> we're<00:03:03.959> going<00:03:04.080> to<00:03:04.170> try<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:04.410> get<00:03:04.530> to

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
basically we're going to try and get to

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.160 
basically we're going to try and get to
very<00:03:04.980> low<00:03:05.250> temperatures<00:03:05.700> minus<00:03:06.540> 200<00:03:07.140> degrees

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
very low temperatures minus 200 degrees

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.370 
very low temperatures minus 200 degrees
C<00:03:07.770> and<00:03:08.040> code<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:09.060> particles<00:03:09.540> in<00:03:09.690> ice<00:03:09.930> so<00:03:10.260> we

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
C and code the particles in ice so we

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.080 
C and code the particles in ice so we
can<00:03:10.500> see<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:10.890> effects<00:03:11.190> of<00:03:11.370> ice<00:03:11.640> and<00:03:11.940> low

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
can see the effects of ice and low

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.900 
can see the effects of ice and low
temperature<00:03:12.720> on<00:03:12.870> this<00:03:13.320> sticking<00:03:13.860> process<00:03:14.370> and

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
temperature on this sticking process and

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.240 
temperature on this sticking process and
maybe<00:03:15.240> work<00:03:15.570> out<00:03:15.870> how<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.230> baby<00:03:16.590> planets<00:03:17.100> are

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
maybe work out how the baby planets are

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.530 
maybe work out how the baby planets are
actually<00:03:17.610> formed<00:03:18.740> how<00:03:19.740> was<00:03:20.070> it<00:03:20.250> for<00:03:20.430> you

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
actually formed how was it for you

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.650 
actually formed how was it for you
please<00:03:21.540> comment<00:03:21.989> on<00:03:22.320> and<00:03:22.530> rate<00:03:22.830> this<00:03:23.160> movie

think<00:03:24.660> you<00:03:24.810> can<00:03:24.959> do<00:03:25.080> better<00:03:25.260> then<00:03:26.250> try<00:03:26.610> to

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
think you can do better then try to

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.440 
think you can do better then try to
explain<00:03:27.570> it<00:03:27.720> yourself
