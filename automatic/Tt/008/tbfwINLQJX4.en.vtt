00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
randomly hitting it seems like whenever

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.050 
randomly hitting it seems like whenever
he<00:02:03.990> goes<00:02:04.080> red<00:02:04.410> I've<00:02:04.560> hit<00:02:04.740> him<00:02:04.830> there<00:02:05.130> we<00:02:05.250> go<00:02:05.369> so

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.609 
he goes red I've hit him there we go so
I'll<00:02:06.179> probably<00:02:06.270> have<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.569> really<00:02:07.289> update<00:02:07.410> him

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
I'll probably have to really update him

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.559 
I'll probably have to really update him
now<00:02:07.770> yet<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.250> when<00:02:08.399> he<00:02:08.490> does<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.849> he's<00:02:09.060> gonna

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
now yet so when he does that he's gonna

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.630 
now yet so when he does that he's gonna
like<00:02:09.840> hit<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:10.950> better<00:02:11.160> avoid<00:02:11.520> him
