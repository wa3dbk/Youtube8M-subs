00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
and I almost LOL sad Hill right there I

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.840 
and I almost LOL sad Hill right there I
mean<00:01:49.079> are<00:01:49.350> they<00:01:49.470> attacking<00:01:49.710> zoms<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.430> know<00:01:50.549> a

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
mean are they attacking zoms you know a

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.030 
mean are they attacking zoms you know a
lot<00:01:51.630> because<00:01:51.960> they<00:01:52.110> know<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.829> weird

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
lot because they know that the the weird

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.800 
lot because they know that the the weird
spec<00:01:53.340> or<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.579> priest<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.000> like<00:01:54.210> less<00:01:54.420> healing

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
spec or the priest is like less healing

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:55.969 
spec or the priest is like less healing
so<00:01:54.930> they're<00:01:55.049> more<00:01:55.170> likely<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.500> get<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.649> kill<00:01:55.860> on

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
so they're more likely to get a kill on

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.310 
so they're more likely to get a kill on
his<00:01:56.159> on<00:01:56.280> what<00:01:57.000> we<00:01:57.149> do<00:01:57.240> seem<00:01:57.420> ever<00:01:57.570> got<00:01:57.780> in<00:01:57.990> oh
