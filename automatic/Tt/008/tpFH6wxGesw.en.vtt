side you can't really see the thickness

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.400 
side you can't really see the thickness
difference<00:00:41.160> all<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.640> easily<00:00:42.110> but<00:00:43.110> this<00:00:43.230> is

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
clicked in and it just shuts nicely this

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.340 
clicked in and it just shuts nicely this
is<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.920> really<00:01:26.369> nice<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:27.000> really<00:01:27.479> nice<00:01:27.689> case

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
is a really nice a really nice case

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.069 
is a really nice a really nice case
because<00:01:29.299> it<00:01:30.299> has<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.829> back<00:01:32.420> which<00:01:33.420> protects<00:01:33.869> it

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
because it has a back which protects it

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.649 
because it has a back which protects it
from<00:01:34.110> scratches<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.119> discuss<00:01:36.119> now<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.390> one

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
from scratches and discuss now the one

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.660 
from scratches and discuss now the one
thing<00:01:36.840> happens<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.790> see<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.479> very

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
thing happens is that you see a very

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.190 
thing happens is that you see a very
very<00:01:41.670> slight<00:01:42.509> Boeing<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:44.009> back<00:01:44.250> plastic

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
very slight Boeing of the back plastic

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.580 
very slight Boeing of the back plastic
so<00:01:46.200> there<00:01:46.439> could<00:01:46.590> be<00:01:46.619> like<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> very<00:01:47.220> tiny<00:01:47.579> gap

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
so there could be like a very tiny gap

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.350 
so there could be like a very tiny gap
here<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:50.189> can't<00:01:50.430> even<00:01:50.610> if<00:01:50.820> you're<00:01:50.939> pushing<00:01:51.270> on

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
here you can't even if you're pushing on

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.660 
here you can't even if you're pushing on
it<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.540> goes<00:01:51.659> away<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:52.229> really<00:01:53.100> not<00:01:53.280> something

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
it it goes away is really not something

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.160 
it it goes away is really not something
that<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:55.110> know<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.649> really<00:01:55.829> even<00:01:56.100> notice<00:01:57.170> but

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
that you know you really even notice but

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.200 
that you know you really even notice but
there's<00:01:58.890> an<00:01:59.070> extra<00:01:59.399> millimeter<00:01:59.579> there<00:02:00.000> from

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
there's an extra millimeter there from

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.030 
there's an extra millimeter there from
what<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.540> case<00:02:00.750> was<00:02:00.780> designed<00:02:01.290> for<00:02:01.560> there's<00:02:01.950> a

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
what the case was designed for there's a

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.289 
what the case was designed for there's a
really<00:02:02.399> nice<00:02:02.549> case<00:02:02.759> so<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:02.939> highly<00:02:03.119> recommend

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
really nice case so I highly recommend

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.899 
really nice case so I highly recommend
it<00:02:03.979> from<00:02:04.979> monoprice<00:02:05.490> so<00:02:05.610> when<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.790> get<00:02:05.880> your

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
it from monoprice so when you get your

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.489 
it from monoprice so when you get your
new<00:02:06.030> iPad<00:02:06.360> 3<00:02:06.979> you'll<00:02:07.979> be<00:02:08.099> ready<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.340> go
