Capcom<00:03:24.630> origins<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.680> Darkstalkers

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
Capcom origins and Darkstalkers

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.150

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
resurrection definitely didn't hit the

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.830 
resurrection definitely didn't hit the
sales<00:03:29.430> numbers<00:03:29.820> I<00:03:30.000> believe<00:03:30.390> that<00:03:30.690> they<00:03:30.810> really

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
sales numbers I believe that they really

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.260 
sales numbers I believe that they really
wanted<00:03:31.680> even<00:03:32.010> though<00:03:32.220> I<00:03:32.310> personally<00:03:32.940> love<00:03:33.120> the

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
crap out of those games that the fact we

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.220 
crap out of those games that the fact we
get<00:03:35.100> to<00:03:35.610> awesome<00:03:36.090> Marvel<00:03:36.420> titles<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.900> x-men

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
get to awesome Marvel titles the x-men

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.570

ones<00:03:37.440> they<00:03:37.650> I'm<00:03:37.920> pretty<00:03:38.130> sure<00:03:38.280> they<00:03:38.400> couldn't

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
ones they I'm pretty sure they couldn't

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.370 
ones they I'm pretty sure they couldn't
do<00:03:38.790> because<00:03:38.970> it<00:03:39.210> had<00:03:39.330> Jim<00:03:39.570> Lee's<00:03:39.780> x-men<00:03:40.230> which

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
do because it had Jim Lee's x-men which

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.080 
do because it had Jim Lee's x-men which
doesn't<00:03:40.680> really<00:03:40.830> exist<00:03:40.980> anymore<00:03:41.310> and<00:03:41.610> they

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
doesn't really exist anymore and they

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.880 
doesn't really exist anymore and they
couldn't<00:03:42.330> do<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.600> original<00:03:42.990> Darkstalkers<00:03:43.500> on

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
couldn't do the original Darkstalkers on

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.010 
couldn't do the original Darkstalkers on
Darkstalkers<00:03:44.460> resurrection<00:03:44.750> mostly<00:03:45.750> because

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
Darkstalkers resurrection mostly because

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:48.080 
Darkstalkers resurrection mostly because
they<00:03:46.200> figured<00:03:46.650> if<00:03:46.980> you<00:03:47.190> have<00:03:47.310> dark<00:03:47.550> stalkers<00:03:47.910> 2

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
they figured if you have dark stalkers 2

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.940 
they figured if you have dark stalkers 2
and<00:03:48.390> 3<00:03:48.630> you<00:03:48.900> don't<00:03:48.990> really<00:03:49.260> want<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.620> first

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950
