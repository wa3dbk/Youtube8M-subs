remote app that allows you to receive

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.769 
remote app that allows you to receive
data<00:00:16.070> from<00:00:16.219> your<00:00:16.609> list<00:00:16.939> it<00:00:17.060> expands<00:00:17.390> vehicle

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:17.779 
data from your list it expands vehicle

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.409 
data from your list it expands vehicle
and<00:00:17.930> send<00:00:18.470> data<00:00:18.650> to<00:00:18.769> it<00:00:19.039> so<00:00:19.640> for<00:00:19.789> instance<00:00:19.820> here

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:20.419 
and send data to it so for instance here

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:22.179 
and send data to it so for instance here
we<00:00:20.539> have<00:00:20.659> an<00:00:20.749> electric<00:00:21.109> vehicle<00:00:21.199> what<00:00:21.980> you<00:00:22.070> can

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
we have an electric vehicle what you can

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.300 
we have an electric vehicle what you can
see<00:00:22.400> is<00:00:22.909> an<00:00:23.390> application<00:00:23.919> implementation<00:00:24.919> for

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
see is an application implementation for

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.649 
see is an application implementation for
a<00:00:25.369> smart<00:00:25.640> work<00:00:25.819> so<00:00:25.970> here<00:00:26.119> we<00:00:26.210> have<00:00:26.239> the<00:00:26.419> samsung

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:26.659 
a smart work so here we have the samsung

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:29.979 
a smart work so here we have the samsung
galaxy<00:00:26.810> gear<00:00:28.089> you<00:00:29.089> can<00:00:29.269> access<00:00:29.689> certain

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:29.989 
galaxy gear you can access certain

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:32.019 
galaxy gear you can access certain
information<00:00:30.589> so<00:00:31.130> here<00:00:31.399> we<00:00:31.489> have<00:00:31.519> the<00:00:31.759> state<00:00:31.939> of

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
information so here we have the state of

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.790 
information so here we have the state of
charge<00:00:32.239> for<00:00:32.540> instance<00:00:32.870> you<00:00:33.380> have<00:00:33.500> further

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
charge for instance you have further

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.130 
charge for instance you have further
data<00:00:34.010> like<00:00:34.250> the<00:00:34.399> mileage<00:00:34.790> the<00:00:35.300> average<00:00:35.420> gas

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
data like the mileage the average gas

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.279 
data like the mileage the average gas
consumption<00:00:36.590> and<00:00:37.120> the<00:00:38.120> range<00:00:38.329> available<00:00:38.660> the

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:39.289 
consumption and the range available the

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:42.580 
consumption and the range available the
vehicle<00:00:39.710> can<00:00:39.829> go<00:00:40.660> so<00:00:41.660> communication<00:00:42.320> is<00:00:42.410> done

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
vehicle can go so communication is done

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.439 
vehicle can go so communication is done
via<00:00:42.649> cellular<00:00:43.280> network<00:00:43.760> so<00:00:43.969> this<00:00:44.120> gives<00:00:44.300> you

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
via cellular network so this gives you

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:46.630 
via cellular network so this gives you
the<00:00:44.600> ability<00:00:44.660> to<00:00:45.100> receive<00:00:46.100> the<00:00:46.370> information

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
the ability to receive the information

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.639 
the ability to receive the information
wherever<00:00:47.390> you<00:00:47.690> are<00:00:47.899> you<00:00:48.079> don't<00:00:48.260> have<00:00:48.379> to<00:00:48.469> stand

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
wherever you are you don't have to stand

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:49.900 
wherever you are you don't have to stand
next<00:00:48.800> to<00:00:48.949> the<00:00:49.039> car<00:00:49.250> you<00:00:49.399> can<00:00:49.519> be<00:00:49.609> sitting<00:00:49.850> on

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
next to the car you can be sitting on

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.180 
next to the car you can be sitting on
the<00:00:49.969> couch<00:00:50.210> can<00:00:50.600> be<00:00:50.750> in<00:00:51.500> the<00:00:51.620> office<00:00:51.949> and

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
the couch can be in the office and

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.430 
the couch can be in the office and
wherever<00:00:52.910> you<00:00:53.179> are<00:00:53.329> you<00:00:53.600> have<00:00:53.719> access<00:00:54.109> to<00:00:54.140> the

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
wherever you are you have access to the

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.060 
wherever you are you have access to the
data<00:00:56.109> communication<00:00:57.109> is<00:00:57.230> not<00:00:57.440> only<00:00:57.620> one<00:00:57.920> way

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
data communication is not only one way

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.340 
data communication is not only one way
but<00:00:58.399> communication<00:00:58.820> is<00:00:58.969> two-way<00:00:59.300> so<00:00:59.899> what<00:01:00.260> you

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
but communication is two-way so what you

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.590 
but communication is two-way so what you
can<00:01:00.499> do<00:01:00.649> is<00:01:00.800> also<00:01:01.159> you<00:01:01.249> can<00:01:01.550> check<00:01:01.789> the

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
can do is also you can check the

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.420 
can do is also you can check the
dialogue<00:01:03.079> status<00:01:03.499> for<00:01:03.679> instance<00:01:04.010> so<00:01:04.250> you're

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
dialogue status for instance so you're

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.800 
dialogue status for instance so you're
in<00:01:04.550> the<00:01:04.670> office<00:01:04.940> you<00:01:05.059> park<00:01:05.269> your<00:01:05.390> car<00:01:05.570> in<00:01:05.600> the

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
in the office you park your car in the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.380 
in the office you park your car in the
office<00:01:06.140> and<00:01:06.400> you<00:01:07.400> check<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:07.820> doors<00:01:08.030> and<00:01:08.300> if

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
office and you check the doors and if

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.880 
office and you check the doors and if
they<00:01:08.510> are<00:01:08.570> not<00:01:08.720> locked<00:01:08.990> you<00:01:09.410> don't<00:01:09.590> have<00:01:09.740> to

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
they are not locked you don't have to

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.370 
they are not locked you don't have to
walk<00:01:10.370> back<00:01:10.580> to<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:11.180> parking<00:01:11.450> space<00:01:11.720> but<00:01:12.260> what

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
walk back to the parking space but what

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.580 
walk back to the parking space but what
you<00:01:12.470> can<00:01:12.620> do<00:01:12.800> is<00:01:13.730> you<00:01:13.940> just<00:01:14.170> use<00:01:15.170> the<00:01:15.440> vehicle

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
you can do is you just use the vehicle

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.100 
you can do is you just use the vehicle
home<00:01:15.830> page<00:01:16.010> app<00:01:16.250> you<00:01:16.730> initiate<00:01:17.720> the<00:01:17.840> locking

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
home page app you initiate the locking

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.650 
home page app you initiate the locking
process<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:19.160> signals<00:01:19.580> can<00:01:19.790> be<00:01:19.850> transferred

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
process the signals can be transferred

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.600 
process the signals can be transferred
to<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:21.500> mercedes-benz<00:01:22.160> cloud

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
to the mercedes-benz cloud

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.980 
to the mercedes-benz cloud
infrastructure<00:01:23.150> and<00:01:23.540> from<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:23.870> other

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
infrastructure and from the other

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.630 
infrastructure and from the other
signals<00:01:24.410> can<00:01:24.530> be<00:01:24.590> transmitted<00:01:25.190> to<00:01:25.280> your<00:01:25.400> car

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
signals can be transmitted to your car

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.420 
signals can be transmitted to your car
so<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:26.150> car<00:01:26.330> locks<00:01:26.780> itself<00:01:27.080> down<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:27.650> gives

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
so the car locks itself down and gives

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.500 
so the car locks itself down and gives
feedback<00:01:28.700> on<00:01:29.090> the<00:01:29.300> wrist

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
feedback on the wrist

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.450 
feedback on the wrist
so<00:01:31.110> we<00:01:31.200> have<00:01:31.320> an<00:01:31.380> implementation<00:01:31.830> here<00:01:32.130> that

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
so we have an implementation here that

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.000 
so we have an implementation here that
you<00:01:32.580> see<00:01:32.730> for<00:01:32.910> the<00:01:32.970> Samsung<00:01:33.720> Galaxy<00:01:33.750> gear<00:01:34.320> we

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
you see for the Samsung Galaxy gear we

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.620 
you see for the Samsung Galaxy gear we
have<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.160> different<00:01:35.670> implementation<00:01:36.300> for<00:01:36.480> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
have a different implementation for the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.900 
have a different implementation for the
pebble<00:01:36.930> smartwatch<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.830> concept<00:01:38.370> again<00:01:38.700> is

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
pebble smartwatch the concept again is

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.960 
pebble smartwatch the concept again is
the<00:01:39.060> same<00:01:39.300> than<00:01:39.540> before<00:01:39.980> so<00:01:40.980> the<00:01:41.070> concept<00:01:41.460> is

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
the same than before so the concept is

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.520 
the same than before so the concept is
still<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.510> can<00:01:42.720> send<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.230> receive<00:01:43.500> data

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
still that you can send and receive data

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.400 
still that you can send and receive data
from<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.790> car<00:01:45.030> but<00:01:45.690> here<00:01:46.140> we<00:01:46.260> have<00:01:46.290> a

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
from the car but here we have a

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.270 
from the car but here we have a
different<00:01:46.740> implementation<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:49.890> data<00:01:50.070> you

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
different implementation the data you

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.010 
different implementation the data you
can<00:01:50.370> see<00:01:50.550> similar<00:01:51.000> so<00:01:51.240> he<00:01:51.360> can<00:01:51.540> check<00:01:51.660> the<00:01:51.720> tire

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
can see similar so he can check the tire

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.680 
can see similar so he can check the tire
pressure<00:01:52.380> for<00:01:52.770> instance<00:01:53.360> you<00:01:54.360> can<00:01:54.480> see

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
pressure for instance you can see

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.280 
pressure for instance you can see
information<00:01:55.050> about<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.560> next<00:01:55.830> service<00:01:57.290> you

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
information about the next service you

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.780 
information about the next service you
have<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.500> GU<00:01:58.680> position<00:01:59.190> of<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.430> vehicle

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
have to GU position of the vehicle

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.390

available and a bunch of other

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.070 
available and a bunch of other
information<00:02:02.580> so<00:02:03.060> here's<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.390> locking<00:02:03.690> signal

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
information so here's the locking signal

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.460 
information so here's the locking signal
again<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:05.180> again<00:02:06.180> charging<00:02:06.630> information<00:02:07.290> and

again and again charging information and

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.650 
again and again charging information and
the<00:02:07.650> range<00:02:07.800> of<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.040> vehicle<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.540> just

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
the range of the vehicle so this is just

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.120 
the range of the vehicle so this is just
one<00:02:09.929> example<00:02:09.960> how<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.649> show<00:02:11.660> how<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:13.130> access

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
one example how to show how to access

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.860 
one example how to show how to access
remote<00:02:14.700> data<00:02:14.970> from<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.360> vehicle<00:02:15.540> in<00:02:15.840> the
