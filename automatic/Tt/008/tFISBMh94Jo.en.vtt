camera was smaller it could go all the
way<00:02:45.329> around<00:02:45.480> this<00:02:45.780> tree<00:02:47.629> the<00:02:48.629> other<00:02:48.780> thing

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
way around this tree the other thing

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.289 
way around this tree the other thing
that<00:02:49.049> stick<00:02:49.980> and<00:02:50.129> pick<00:02:50.250> has<00:02:50.400> is<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.730> attic<00:02:51.150> and

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
that stick and pick has is the attic and

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.330 
that stick and pick has is the attic and
bracket<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:52.349> can<00:02:52.470> put<00:02:52.650> it<00:02:52.739> slide<00:02:52.919> and<00:02:52.950> attic

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
bracket you can put it slide and attic

you can have one camera say facing this

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.990 
you can have one camera say facing this
way<00:03:01.280> monitoring<00:03:02.280> this<00:03:02.400> side<00:03:02.639> of<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.819> field

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
way monitoring this side of the field

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.179 
way monitoring this side of the field
you<00:03:03.659> can<00:03:03.810> have<00:03:03.900> another<00:03:04.049> camera<00:03:04.500> on<00:03:04.650> this<00:03:04.919> side

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
you can have another camera on this side

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.000 
you can have another camera on this side
monitoring<00:03:05.849> that<00:03:05.939> side<00:03:06.180> of<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.419> field<00:03:07.010> maybe

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
monitoring that side of the field maybe

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.920 
monitoring that side of the field maybe
you<00:03:08.400> got<00:03:08.549> an<00:03:08.669> area<00:03:08.970> that<00:03:09.150> has<00:03:09.389> a<00:03:09.419> fence<00:03:09.750> line

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
you got an area that has a fence line

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.360 
you got an area that has a fence line
that<00:03:10.109> goes<00:03:10.139> right<00:03:10.409> through<00:03:10.650> both<00:03:10.889> fields<00:03:11.280> you

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
that goes right through both fields you

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.030 
that goes right through both fields you
have<00:03:11.459> permission<00:03:11.639> or<00:03:12.389> you<00:03:12.510> own<00:03:12.739> this<00:03:13.739> is<00:03:13.919> the
