recently while researching examples of
flood<00:00:13.590> geology<00:00:13.800> I<00:00:14.430> heard<00:00:14.700> about<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:14.910> particular

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
flood geology I heard about a particular

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.530 
flood geology I heard about a particular
fossilized<00:00:16.049> tree<00:00:16.410> in<00:00:16.619> northern<00:00:17.099> Tennessee

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:17.540 
fossilized tree in northern Tennessee

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.970 
fossilized tree in northern Tennessee
after<00:00:18.540> several<00:00:19.050> weeks<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.410> trying<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.680> track

and<00:00:57.119> through<00:00:57.299> brambles<00:00:57.780> brought<00:00:58.049> us<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.320> the

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
and through brambles brought us to the

mountain to one of the coal seams where

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.960 
mountain to one of the coal seams where
the<00:01:03.809> fossils<00:01:04.260> are<00:01:04.320> located<00:01:04.890> it's<00:01:05.640> been<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.790> lot

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
the fossils are located it's been a lot

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.870 
the fossils are located it's been a lot
of<00:01:06.119> rain<00:01:06.299> in<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.630> area<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.549> sort<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.700> rough

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
of rain in the area so I sort of rough

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.450 
of rain in the area so I sort of rough
around<00:01:09.030> here<00:01:09.359> a<00:01:09.750> lot<00:01:10.140> of<00:01:10.170> water<00:01:10.500> around<00:01:10.950> us<00:01:11.159> but

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
around here a lot of water around us but

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.599 
around here a lot of water around us but
we're<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.149> our<00:01:12.180> way<00:01:12.420> up<00:01:12.500> we'll<00:01:13.500> we'll<00:01:14.310> see<00:01:14.460> what

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:14.609 
we're on our way up we'll we'll see what

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:30.940 
we're on our way up we'll we'll see what
would

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.149 

Venera<00:01:31.880> alone<00:01:32.420> say<00:01:32.710> available<00:01:33.710> city<00:01:33.890> whole

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
Venera alone say available city whole

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.990 
Venera alone say available city whole
must<00:01:35.090> fulfill<00:01:35.570> hardness<00:01:36.049> strata<00:01:36.350> and<00:01:37.159> you<00:01:37.850> can

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
must fulfill hardness strata and you can

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.469 
must fulfill hardness strata and you can
see<00:01:38.240> these<00:01:38.390> muscles<00:01:38.810> precast

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
see these muscles precast

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.460 
see these muscles precast
so

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
so

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.050 
so
we've<00:01:43.680> been<00:01:43.830> hiking<00:01:44.010> for<00:01:44.190> a<00:01:44.340> little<00:01:44.550> ways<00:01:44.670> now

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
we've been hiking for a little ways now

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.210 
we've been hiking for a little ways now
it<00:01:45.960> was<00:01:46.080> raining<00:01:46.410> a<00:01:46.500> bit<00:01:46.620> before<00:01:46.920> when<00:01:47.100> we

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
it was raining a bit before when we

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.620 
it was raining a bit before when we
started<00:01:47.670> it's<00:01:48.360> cleared<00:01:49.200> up<00:01:49.320> we

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
started it's cleared up we

00:01:51.630 --> 00:02:10.910 
started it's cleared up we
good<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.290> we're<00:01:52.409> almost<00:01:52.560> there

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.710 

they're<00:02:11.920> perfectly<00:02:12.640> preserved<00:02:13.120> was<00:02:13.570> the

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
they're perfectly preserved was the

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.960 
they're perfectly preserved was the
massive<00:02:14.260> fossil<00:02:14.740> and<00:02:14.950> with<00:02:15.340> it<00:02:15.520> many<00:02:15.850> other

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
massive fossil and with it many other

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.200 
massive fossil and with it many other
fossilized<00:02:16.810> examples<00:02:17.410> of<00:02:17.590> these<00:02:17.710> trees

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
fossilized examples of these trees

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.850 
fossilized examples of these trees
although<00:02:19.210> similar<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.020> modern<00:02:20.200> horsetail

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
although similar to the modern horsetail

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.920 
although similar to the modern horsetail
these<00:02:21.190> like<00:02:21.460> APOD<00:02:21.820> specimens<00:02:22.420> are<00:02:22.600> much

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
these like APOD specimens are much

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.630 
these like APOD specimens are much
larger<00:02:23.440> than<00:02:23.590> anything<00:02:23.920> that<00:02:24.130> currently

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
larger than anything that currently

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.360 
larger than anything that currently
exists<00:02:25.210> but<00:02:26.110> there<00:02:26.410> are<00:02:26.620> a<00:02:26.650> few<00:02:26.800> things<00:02:27.160> that

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
exists but there are a few things that

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.480 
exists but there are a few things that
make<00:02:27.640> these<00:02:27.850> very<00:02:28.450> significant

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
make these very significant

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.340 
make these very significant
besides<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.730> excellent<00:02:31.270> preservation<00:02:31.510> even

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
besides the excellent preservation even

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.230 
besides the excellent preservation even
