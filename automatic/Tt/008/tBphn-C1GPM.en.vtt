legitimate money it's mainly something

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.010 
legitimate money it's mainly something
that<00:01:31.950> just<00:01:32.700> goes<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.180> bypasses<00:01:33.930> that

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
that just goes and bypasses that

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.590

legitimate<00:01:34.500> money<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.979> just<00:01:35.670> makes<00:01:35.939> us<00:01:36.150> more

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
legitimate money and just makes us more

how things work out if Rockstar decides

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.830 
how things work out if Rockstar decides
to<00:04:59.580> back<00:04:59.729> off<00:04:59.970> of<00:05:00.000> this<00:05:00.240> whole<00:05:00.450> thing<00:05:00.479> then

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
to back off of this whole thing then

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.330 
to back off of this whole thing then
I'll<00:05:00.960> go<00:05:01.139> back<00:05:01.260> to<00:05:01.320> glitches<00:05:01.800> and<00:05:01.950> hacks<00:05:02.130> but
