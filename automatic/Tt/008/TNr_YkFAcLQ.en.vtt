00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.600 
the figure and you know I think the head
sculpt<00:02:34.420> is<00:02:35.010> spectacular<00:02:36.010> or<00:02:36.070> anything<00:02:36.250> but<00:02:36.550> I

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
sculpt is spectacular or anything but I

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:37.949 
sculpt is spectacular or anything but I
think<00:02:36.730> it'll<00:02:37.180> be<00:02:37.269> better<00:02:37.480> than<00:02:37.660> their<00:02:37.810> lead

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
think it'll be better than their lead

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.970 
think it'll be better than their lead

so yeah get out and look at the figure
straight<00:02:53.709> out<00:02:53.860> of<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:53.980> box

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
straight out of the box

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.250

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
that's the real piece of these figures

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.470 
that's the real piece of these figures
you<00:03:01.150> know<00:03:01.209> just<00:03:01.600> posing<00:03:02.260> them<00:03:02.500> right<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:04.450> I

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
you know just posing them right and so I

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.970 
you know just posing them right and so I
make<00:03:04.810> each<00:03:04.930> other<00:03:05.110> everything<00:03:05.440> hangs<00:03:05.769> right

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
make each other everything hangs right

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.460 
make each other everything hangs right
so<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:07.480> can<00:03:07.570> make<00:03:07.720> this<00:03:07.840> figure<00:03:08.110> look<00:03:08.260> a<00:03:08.350> lot

the other two figures which is nice

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.560 
the other two figures which is nice
because<00:05:37.260> obviously<00:05:37.530> I'm<00:05:37.919> dolphin<00:05:38.400> tundra<00:05:38.669> and

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
because obviously I'm dolphin tundra and

then Flay's gunner and his tall guy

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.580 
then Flay's gunner and his tall guy
about<00:05:42.300> six<00:05:42.660> for<00:05:43.020> I<00:05:43.050> think<00:05:43.230> 65<00:05:43.860> son<00:05:44.160> like<00:05:44.310> that

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590

about six for I think 65 son like that
and<00:05:46.590> I<00:05:46.830> think<00:05:46.950> he<00:05:47.160> he<00:05:47.370> must<00:05:47.490> be<00:05:47.669> this<00:05:47.760> tall<00:05:47.820> to

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
and I think he he must be this tall to

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.290 
and I think he he must be this tall to
solve<00:05:48.300> all<00:05:48.450> the<00:05:48.540> Expendables<00:05:49.850> so<00:05:50.850> yeah<00:05:51.090> it's
