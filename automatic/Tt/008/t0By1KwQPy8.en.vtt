00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
need to be able to first of all identify

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.120 
need to be able to first of all identify
notes<00:00:14.610> for<00:00:15.599> instance<00:00:15.929> all<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.650> these<00:00:16.830> notes

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
notes for instance all of these notes

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.810 
notes for instance all of these notes
are<00:00:21.590> seized<00:00:22.590> now<00:00:23.010> they<00:00:23.279> should<00:00:23.430> they<00:00:23.789> should

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
are seized now they should they should

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.070 
are seized now they should they should
sound<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.510> same<00:00:24.960> each<00:00:25.230> one<00:00:25.590> will<00:00:25.800> be<00:00:25.980> higher

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
sound the same each one will be higher

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.230 
sound the same each one will be higher
as<00:00:28.080> we<00:00:28.109> go<00:00:28.470> up<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.890> keyboard<00:00:29.070> head<00:00:29.519> or<00:00:29.820> slower

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
as we go up the keyboard head or slower

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.590 
as we go up the keyboard head or slower
as<00:00:30.599> we<00:00:30.720> go

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.910 

so<00:00:34.600> match<00:00:34.990> should<00:00:35.230> being<00:00:35.380> able<00:00:35.650> to<00:00:35.710> match

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
so match should being able to match

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.740 
so match should being able to match
tones<00:00:36.370> it's<00:00:36.700> something<00:00:37.000> you'll<00:00:37.450> need<00:00:37.630> to

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
tones it's something you'll need to

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.990 
tones it's something you'll need to
develop<00:00:37.990> so<00:00:38.410> I'm<00:00:38.560> going<00:00:38.860> to<00:00:38.920> play<00:00:39.220> in<00:00:39.850> this

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
develop so I'm going to play in this

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
develop so I'm going to play in this
case<00:00:43.110> first<00:00:44.110> I'm<00:00:44.290> going<00:00:44.530> to<00:00:44.620> get<00:00:46.020> irregularity

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
case first I'm going to get irregularity

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.200 
case first I'm going to get irregularity
out<00:00:47.200> of<00:00:47.410> that<00:00:47.560> app<00:00:47.770> happens<00:00:48.370> to<00:00:48.520> be<00:00:48.670> in<00:00:48.880> one<00:00:49.180> of

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
out of that app happens to be in one of

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.380 
out of that app happens to be in one of
the<00:00:49.450> side<00:00:49.840> screens<00:00:50.350> so<00:00:53.129> as<00:00:54.129> I<00:00:54.580> place<00:00:54.820> a<00:00:54.850> mute<00:00:55.210> on

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
the side screens so as I place a mute on

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.180 
the side screens so as I place a mute on
the<00:00:55.600> Left<00:00:55.840> rein

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
the Left rein

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:58.670 
the Left rein
play<00:00:57.399> the<00:00:57.460> middle<00:00:57.789> you<00:00:57.879> survive<00:00:58.300> it's

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
play the middle you survive it's

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.009 
play the middle you survive it's
basically<00:00:59.680> fine<00:00:59.980> as<00:01:00.340> I<00:01:01.090> place<00:01:01.300> amusements<00:01:01.899> the

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
basically fine as I place amusements the

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:04.829 
basically fine as I place amusements the
right<00:01:02.170> string<00:01:02.670> there<00:01:03.670> is<00:01:03.850> the<00:01:04.030> refund<00:01:04.449> sound

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
right string there is the refund sound

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.950 
right string there is the refund sound
so<00:01:05.740> I<00:01:05.770> locate<00:01:06.280> the<00:01:06.430> tuning<00:01:06.759> kit<00:01:07.000> corresponding

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
so I locate the tuning kit corresponding

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:15.810 
so I locate the tuning kit corresponding
to<00:01:08.080> the<00:01:08.530> left<00:01:08.710> string<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:14.140> sounds<00:01:14.619> flat<00:01:14.890> or<00:01:15.549> too

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
to the left string it sounds flat or too

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.520 
to the left string it sounds flat or too
low<00:01:16.030> so<00:01:16.299> i'm<00:01:16.390> going<00:01:16.540> to<00:01:16.600> pull<00:01:16.810> the<00:01:17.320> hammer

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
low so i'm going to pull the hammer

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.860 
low so i'm going to pull the hammer
towards<00:01:17.920> me

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.290 

until<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.500> sound<00:01:22.950> goes<00:01:23.220> slightly<00:01:23.520> above<00:01:24.000> the

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
until the sound goes slightly above the

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:40.110 
until the sound goes slightly above the
previous<00:01:24.540> pitch<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.710> I'll<00:01:25.860> drop<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.160> down

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.760 

and<00:01:41.120> now<00:01:41.300> that<00:01:41.510> we've<00:01:41.600> equalized<00:01:42.110> that<00:01:42.380> we<00:01:42.620> can

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
and now that we've equalized that we can

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.640 
and now that we've equalized that we can
compare<00:01:43.100> it<00:01:43.190> to<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.400> next<00:01:43.520> step<00:01:47.470> so<00:01:48.470> I'm<00:01:48.530> going

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
compare it to the next step so I'm going

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.830 
compare it to the next step so I'm going
to<00:01:48.800> isolate<00:01:49.280> down<00:01:49.550> to<00:01:49.729> one<00:01:49.910> string<00:01:52.180> that<00:01:53.180> left

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
to isolate down to one string that left

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:05.899 
to isolate down to one string that left
three<00:01:54.080> despite<00:01:54.590> flat<00:01:56.020> pull<00:01:57.020> the<00:01:57.140> amatory

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.090 

and<00:02:06.909> now<00:02:07.090> that<00:02:07.240> I<00:02:07.300> have<00:02:07.510> one<00:02:08.140> string<00:02:08.410> in<00:02:08.560> tune<00:02:08.590> I

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
and now that I have one string in tune I

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:21.280 
and now that I have one string in tune I
can<00:02:09.399> listen<00:02:09.550> to<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:09.850> next<00:02:10.090> three<00:02:10.240> against<00:02:10.660> it

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.680 

until<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.440> equalizes<00:02:22.799> and<00:02:23.480> finally<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.659> last

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
until it equalizes and finally the last

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:32.950 
until it equalizes and finally the last
night

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.040 

and<00:02:33.080> then<00:02:34.010> we<00:02:34.190> have<00:02:34.220> all<00:02:34.640> three<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.420> try<00:02:35.690> board

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
and then we have all three and try board

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.380 
and then we have all three and try board
that<00:02:36.590> is<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.190> f4<00:02:38.380> to
