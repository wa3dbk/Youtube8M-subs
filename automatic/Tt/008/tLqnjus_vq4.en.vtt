the first part of training camp you know
we've<00:00:15.089> really<00:00:15.420> been<00:00:15.540> trying<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:15.900> keep<00:00:16.080> the

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
we've really been trying to keep the

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.500 
we've really been trying to keep the
session<00:00:16.650> short<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.130> sharp<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:18.119> think<00:00:18.420> it's

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
session short and sharp I think it's

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.269 
session short and sharp I think it's
very<00:00:18.600> important<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.260> we<00:00:19.439> we<00:00:19.859> get<00:00:20.039> as<00:00:20.160> much

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
very important that we we get as much

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.340 
very important that we we get as much
out<00:00:20.460> of<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.609> sessions<00:00:20.939> as<00:00:21.060> we<00:00:21.180> can<00:00:21.510> but<00:00:22.199> we

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
out of the sessions as we can but we

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.050 
out of the sessions as we can but we
don't<00:00:22.529> want<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.830> we<00:00:23.609> don't<00:00:23.670> want<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.910> grind

yesterday we focus mostly on the attack
you<00:00:40.020> know<00:00:40.140> building<00:00:40.530> slowly<00:00:41.120> numbers<00:00:42.120> up<00:00:42.379> but

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
you know building slowly numbers up but

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.979 
you know building slowly numbers up but
we<00:00:43.500> started<00:00:43.710> with<00:00:44.010> with<00:00:44.280> just<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.610> real<00:00:44.820> simple

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
we started with with just a real simple

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.660 
we started with with just a real simple
small<00:00:45.989> group<00:00:46.320> attacking<00:00:46.980> possession

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
small group attacking possession

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.540 
small group attacking possession
positioning<00:00:48.390> games<00:00:48.890> in<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.010> morning<00:00:50.309> ended

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
positioning games in the morning ended

positioning games in the morning ended
with<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.730> 4<00:00:51.239> before<00:00:51.600> that's<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.440> goal<00:00:52.649> in<00:00:52.829> the

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
with a 4 before that's a goal in the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.200 
with a 4 before that's a goal in the
evening<00:00:54.090> we<00:00:54.420> did<00:00:54.629> similar<00:00:55.110> idea<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:56.190> little<00:00:57.059> bit

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
evening we did similar idea a little bit

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.319 
evening we did similar idea a little bit
different<00:00:57.570> tweaks<00:00:58.280> but<00:00:59.280> but<00:00:59.520> again<00:00:59.760> focusing

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
different tweaks but but again focusing

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.500 
different tweaks but but again focusing
on<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.570> possession<00:01:01.370> concept<00:01:02.370> we<00:01:03.180> want<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.420> be

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
on the possession concept we want to be

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.600 
on the possession concept we want to be
able<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.719> control<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.409> ball<00:01:04.619> we<00:01:04.920> want<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.220> be

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
able to control the ball we want to be

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.310 
able to control the ball we want to be
able<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.939> we<00:01:06.150> have<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.479> ball<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.810> dictate<00:01:07.170> the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
able to we have the ball to dictate the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.840 
able to we have the ball to dictate the
rhythm<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.680> temple<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.610> we<00:01:08.729> emphasize

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
rhythm in the temple so we emphasize

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.210 
rhythm in the temple so we emphasize
that<00:01:09.360> yesterday<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.619> evening<00:01:10.890> building

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
that yesterday in the evening building

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.120 
that yesterday in the evening building
up<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.520> 6v<00:01:11.970> six<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.840> then<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.650> morning<00:01:13.830> we

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
up to a 6v six and then this morning we

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.289 
up to a 6v six and then this morning we
flipped<00:01:14.400> around<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> other<00:01:14.850> side<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.180> the

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
flipped around to the other side of the

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.670 
flipped around to the other side of the
ball<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.450> focus<00:01:15.900> more<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.259> defending

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
ball and focus more on the defending

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.450 
ball and focus more on the defending
side<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.140> transitioning<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.259> pressing<00:01:19.799> a

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
side and transitioning and pressing a

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.039 
side and transitioning and pressing a
little<00:01:20.759> bit<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.090> small<00:01:21.360> group<00:01:21.540> defending

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
little bit of the small group defending

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.320 
little bit of the small group defending
principles<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.830> then<00:01:23.369> we<00:01:23.460> ended<00:01:23.700> with<00:01:23.909> an<00:01:24.060> AV

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
principles and then we ended with an AV

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.140 
principles and then we ended with an AV
eight<00:01:24.890> even<00:01:25.890> though<00:01:26.009> it's<00:01:26.159> not<00:01:26.250> 10<00:01:26.610> B<00:01:26.729> 10<00:01:26.939> we

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
eight even though it's not 10 B 10 we

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.700 
eight even though it's not 10 B 10 we
can<00:01:27.299> still<00:01:27.540> put<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.750> together<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.320> way<00:01:28.470> where

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
can still put it together in a way where

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.700 
can still put it together in a way where
it's<00:01:28.829> functional<00:01:29.900> but<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.049> condition<00:01:31.530> in<00:01:31.619> the

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
it's functional but the condition in the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.370 
it's functional but the condition in the
first<00:01:31.920> five<00:01:32.100> minutes<00:01:32.570> was<00:01:33.570> seven<00:01:33.869> passes<00:01:34.290> you

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
first five minutes was seven passes you

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.770 
first five minutes was seven passes you
get<00:01:34.500> a<00:01:34.530> point<00:01:34.880> if<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.030> score<00:01:36.329> goal<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.630> get

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
get a point if you score goal you get

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.390 
get a point if you score goal you get
two<00:01:36.960> points<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.500> really<00:01:37.740> trying<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.070> find<00:01:38.280> that

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
two points so really trying to find that

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.460 
two points so really trying to find that
balance<00:01:38.460> between<00:01:39.000> possessing<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.869> ball<00:01:40.079> but

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
balance between possessing the ball but

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.260 
balance between possessing the ball but
ultimately<00:01:40.920> we<00:01:41.189> need<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.610> possession<00:01:42.060> needs

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
ultimately we need the possession needs

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.440 
ultimately we need the possession needs
to<00:01:42.420> lead<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:43.380> penetration<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.189> goals<00:01:44.850> but

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
to lead to to penetration and goals but

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.789 
to lead to to penetration and goals but
we<00:01:45.540> also<00:01:45.659> did<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.110> because<00:01:46.439> we<00:01:46.590> were<00:01:46.649> working

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
we also did that because we were working

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.120 
we also did that because we were working
on<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.100> pressure<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.500> discourage

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
on the pressure so it to and discourage

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.330 
on the pressure so it to and discourage
hopefully<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.960> pressing<00:01:52.500> team<00:01:52.710> are

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
hopefully the the pressing team are

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.770 
hopefully the the pressing team are
encouraging<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.909> impression<00:01:54.270> depressing

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
encouraging the impression depressing

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.810 
encouraging the impression depressing
team<00:01:54.990> from<00:01:55.259> pressing<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:55.890> not<00:01:56.369> letting<00:01:56.610> the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
team from pressing and not letting the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.090 
team from pressing and not letting the
other<00:01:56.969> team<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.360> get<00:01:57.509> seven<00:01:57.810> passes<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.979> was

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
other team to get seven passes so it was

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.219 
other team to get seven passes so it was
a<00:01:59.130> condition<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.240> little<00:02:00.509> small<00:02:01.020> condition

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
a condition a little small condition

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.130 
a condition a little small condition
within<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.820> know<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:02.969> bigger<00:02:03.240> group<00:02:03.479> activity

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
within you know a bigger group activity

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.740 
within you know a bigger group activity
that<00:02:04.920> hopefully<00:02:05.250> brings<00:02:05.520> out<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.750> balance

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
that hopefully brings out that balance

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.260 
that hopefully brings out that balance
of<00:02:06.930> pressure<00:02:07.259> in<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.740> possession<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.550> really

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
of pressure in and possession and really

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.059 
of pressure in and possession and really
if<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.479> look<00:02:09.509> at<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.810> style<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.170> play<00:02:10.410> it's

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
if you look at the style of play it's

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.320 
if you look at the style of play it's
it's<00:02:11.370> it's<00:02:11.970> not<00:02:12.150> just<00:02:12.390> one<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:13.020> possession<00:02:13.800> or

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
it's it's not just one the possession or

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.090 
it's it's not just one the possession or
just<00:02:14.450> one<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:14.780> pressure<00:02:15.020> it's<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.770> balance

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
just one the pressure it's the balance

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.250 
just one the pressure it's the balance
of<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.340> two<00:02:16.520> okay<00:02:17.210> and<00:02:17.450> it<00:02:17.540> only<00:02:17.660> works<00:02:17.990> if<00:02:18.230> you

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
of the two okay and it only works if you

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.300 
of the two okay and it only works if you
get<00:02:18.470> both<00:02:19.150> going<00:02:20.150> together
