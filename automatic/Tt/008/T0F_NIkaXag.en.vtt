hello and welcome simple scuba calm in

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:07.190 
hello and welcome simple scuba calm in
this<00:00:06.269> session<00:00:06.450> we'll<00:00:06.690> be<00:00:06.779> looking<00:00:06.899> at<00:00:07.140> the

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
this session we'll be looking at the

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.129 
this session we'll be looking at the

apex XTX 200 regulator the XCX 200 first

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.420 
apex XTX 200 regulator the XCX 200 first
stage<00:00:13.670> comes<00:00:14.670> with<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:15.650> balanced<00:00:16.650> diaphragm

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
stage comes with a balanced diaphragm

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.099 
stage comes with a balanced diaphragm
dry<00:00:18.240> sealed<00:00:19.100> mechanism<00:00:20.570> which<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.600> great<00:00:21.930> for

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
dry sealed mechanism which is great for

dry sealed mechanism which is great for
cold<00:00:22.320> water<00:00:22.410> use

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
cold water use

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.939 
cold water use
a<00:00:23.130> joy<00:00:23.670> seal<00:00:23.970> means<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.539> no<00:00:24.750> water<00:00:25.500> can

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
a joy seal means that no water can

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.599 
a joy seal means that no water can
interact<00:00:26.849> with<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.000> mechanism<00:00:27.480> inside<00:00:27.750> the

drama<00:01:20.970> Titus<00:01:21.330> woods<00:01:21.600> cobalt<00:01:21.960> again<00:01:22.440> you<00:01:23.040> can

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160 
drama Titus woods cobalt again you can

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.120 
drama Titus woods cobalt again you can
actually<00:01:23.280> see<00:01:23.580> on<00:01:24.500> this<00:01:25.500> connection<00:01:25.950> there's

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
actually see on this connection there's

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.070 
actually see on this connection there's
actually<00:01:26.370> some<00:01:26.550> fins<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:27.450> just<00:01:27.780> helps<00:01:27.900> with

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
actually some fins this just helps with

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.440 
actually some fins this just helps with
heat<00:01:28.320> transfer<00:01:28.760> again<00:01:29.760> preventing<00:01:30.330> any

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
heat transfer again preventing any

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.870 
heat transfer again preventing any
free-flowing<00:01:30.980> this<00:01:31.980> is<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> ban<00:01:32.370> at<00:01:32.520> second

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
free-flowing this is a ban at second

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.060 
free-flowing this is a ban at second
stage<00:01:33.030> as<00:01:33.270> well<00:01:33.480> so<00:01:34.170> performance<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.800> depth

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
stage as well so performance the depth

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.450 
stage as well so performance the depth
is<00:01:35.280> greater<00:01:35.850> than<00:01:36.150> unbalanced<00:01:37.130> on<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.159> side

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
is greater than unbalanced on a side

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.340 
is greater than unbalanced on a side
here<00:01:38.730> you<00:01:39.570> can<00:01:39.690> see<00:01:39.840> you've<00:01:39.960> got<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.080> number<00:01:40.320> of

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
here you can see you've got a number of

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.930 
here you can see you've got a number of
controls<00:01:40.770> this<00:01:41.700> first<00:01:42.060> one<00:01:43.580> controls<00:01:44.580> the

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
controls this first one controls the

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.810 
controls this first one controls the
flow<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.540> air<00:01:45.690> inside<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.409> regulator<00:01:46.800> in<00:01:47.400> its

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
flow of air inside the regulator in its

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.880 
flow of air inside the regulator in its
miners<00:01:48.210> position<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.960> air<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.380> forced<00:01:49.590> back

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
miners position that air is forced back

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.640 
miners position that air is forced back
against<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.340> diaphragm<00:01:50.670> which<00:01:51.500> will<00:01:52.500> help

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
against the diaphragm which will help

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.370 
against the diaphragm which will help
against<00:01:53.220> free<00:01:53.580> flying<00:01:53.820> as<00:01:54.390> any<00:01:54.630> free<00:01:55.110> flows

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
against free flying as any free flows

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.980 
against free flying as any free flows
will<00:01:55.860> force<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.310> diaphragm<00:01:56.790> back<00:01:57.450> out<00:01:57.659> and

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
will force the diaphragm back out and

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.630 
will force the diaphragm back out and
shut<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.920> valve<00:01:59.330> obviously<00:02:00.330> for<00:02:01.460> normal<00:02:02.460> use

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
shut the valve obviously for normal use

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.510 
shut the valve obviously for normal use
you'd<00:02:03.000> have<00:02:03.180> it<00:02:03.299> in<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.510> positive<00:02:03.900> position

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
you'd have it in the positive position

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.730 
you'd have it in the positive position
good<00:02:05.520> good<00:02:05.909> use<00:02:06.120> and<00:02:06.659> pre<00:02:06.900> dive<00:02:07.080> you<00:02:07.409> can<00:02:07.560> have

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
good good use and pre dive you can have

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.830 
good good use and pre dive you can have
it<00:02:07.860> on<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.429> -<00:02:08.640> position<00:02:09.119> just<00:02:09.330> prevents<00:02:09.690> any

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
it on the - position just prevents any

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.160 
it on the - position just prevents any

this chrome knob here just adjusts the
inhalation<00:02:21.210> effort<00:02:21.660> should<00:02:22.320> you<00:02:22.470> need<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.860> you

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
inhalation effort should you need to you

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.360 
inhalation effort should you need to you
can<00:02:23.730> wind<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.120> in<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.890> that<00:02:25.890> will<00:02:26.040> increase

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
can wind it in and that will increase

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.690 
can wind it in and that will increase
the<00:02:26.700> inhalation<00:02:27.150> effort<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:29.160> tension<00:02:29.610> on

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
the inhalation effort and the tension on

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.480 
the inhalation effort and the tension on
the<00:02:29.790> spring<00:02:30.650> whatever<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.740> needs<00:02:32.100> you<00:02:32.280> use

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
the spring whatever it needs you use

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.830 
the spring whatever it needs you use

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
that can actually change the deflector

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.940 
that can actually change the deflector
deflection<00:02:42.360> list<00:02:42.570> is<00:02:42.660> easy<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:43.020> take<00:02:43.170> off<00:02:43.410> it's
