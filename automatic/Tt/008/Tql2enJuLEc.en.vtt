00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.559
 functional galaxy and from the company 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.259
 samsung efficiency 1000 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.360
 What is remarkable about this tour book? 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.460
 she works with all these sarinas 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.350
 samsung supportive 3d 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.960
 Respectively and need to listen on 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.100
 smart migration now let's parse 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.730
 some details 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.410
 what is she like which 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.019
 pretty small size somewhere 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.230
 30 centimeters comfortably in your hand 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.020
 on the right side there is a touchpad with two 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.000
 our function buttons 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.460
 there is a power button on the back and 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.489
 from directly connecting button 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.590
 keyboard to the TV let's 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.750
 let's see a few details how is she 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.750
 still works turn on the TV 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:00.250
 Basically, in my opinion, the keyboard 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:03.870
 fully capable of replacing the path which 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.820
 There is a set that is, we entered 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.920
 directly smart itself in it that is 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.740
 see how the touchpad works 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.880
 that is, there is no retardation 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.160
 No, let's work on an example 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:27.630
 browser let's see how it all the same 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:30.520
 at work would say that 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:39.210
 the work of this keyboard we experience 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:41.950
 Now on the model 32 diagonal 68 2 0 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.310
 This model has 400 years 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.680
 slim alpha supports 3d 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.270
 according to martirias times 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.800
 I think TV is enough 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:59.100
 not bad let's see how is she 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:01.720
 Still working try to remove the garbage 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.520
 language switch th is a combination 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.520
 Alt and 6 keys 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.110
 Where 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:28.080
 Unfortunately, I would like to quickly but 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:32.080
 still braza on tv doesn't want 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.010
 make people ownership work as we 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.000

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:39.790

 Of course there is always the presence that is 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.150
 principle we went the way we searched 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.900
 product in my opinion pretty yet 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.700
 conveniently by the way I would like to note that 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:31.380
 again in my opinion there are no 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:36.900
 micro yusbi there is no charge work 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:39.330
