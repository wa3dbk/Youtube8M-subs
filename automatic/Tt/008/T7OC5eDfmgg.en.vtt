00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.539
 ah 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:21.990
 we are ready joaquin I know 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.140
 I was thinking how much it would take me to be 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.390
 my 32 thousand pieces of chess if I had 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.340
 than using the manual tournament as soon as 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.940
 true that it would take you pretty good 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.050
 that's why we're going to use the cnc but 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:38.220
 we have to learn to design the code 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.330
 that is to program them exact hands to the 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.330
 work we are going at the time 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:48.360
 joaquin based on what we saw which one 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.430
 would be the steps to follow to generate 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.830
 the project you are not testing 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.630
 I did not want to see if I'm understanding something 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.270
 everything you are teaching me is going to 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.920
 surprise everything starts with the design 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.470
 of the piece and its representation in the 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.610
 flat with this information we choose the 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.520
 productive processes that we are going to 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.930
 use turning milling and so on 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.090
 then we choose the machine that we are going to 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.620
 use and there the selection of the 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.380
 tool and parameters 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.030
 technological 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.180
 for prada do not tell me do not tell me no 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.189
 leave me alone is there we choose and 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.640
 we have to design the program for the 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:25.310
 cnc but that still we did not see it 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.899
 excellent joaquin you're right 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.850
 we have to talk now about the 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.890
 cnc programming to do the 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.470
 cnc program we have to align 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.049
 with what the iso or standard tells us 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.759
 also called code g this standard what 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.009
 that is defining us is the language 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:44.509
 of communication between the operator and the 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:47.090
 cnc in short is how the operator 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.920
 will communicate both the trajectory the 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.560
 coordinates and parameters 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.259
 cnc technology so that it can 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.700
 control the machine so joaquin in 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.159
 based on the selected tools 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.409
 let's define the trajectories the 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.330
 trajectories are going to be delimited 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.860
 by means of points and their coordinates 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.140
 associates 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.190
 then we must define the parameters 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.190
 technological tools 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.740
 will use between both points and 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.620
 finally we must select a code 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.930
 did it allow us to communicate to the cnc 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.650
 all this information manny joaquin 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.959
 Let's talk a little bit about the structure 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.510
 a cnc program is formed by 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.159
 instructions sequentially that 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.040
 describe the movement of the machine 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:32.140
 these instructions must contain all 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.030
 the information so that the machine can 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.239
 perform the machining and this that 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.269
 includes good and that includes functions of 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.129
 auxiliary functions movements like 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:44.470
 they are turning on or off the liquid 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.450
 refrigerant these functions continue in 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.180
 shape of numbered blocks in shape 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.970
 sequential and how a block is formed 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.950
 good question the blocks are 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.159
 trained here I can show you in 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.870
 screen are formed by a number 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:02.079
 initial that describes the number of the 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.720
 block and begin the functions as 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.159
 for example that 90 that define us 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.400
 coordinates if they are absolute or 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:12.280
 incremental lm 03 that is a function 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.940
 auxiliary a miscellaneous function 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.950
 turns the spindle rotation on or off 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:22.120
 then we have the g 00 which is a 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:24.100
 fast motion function m 0 5 turn off 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.780
 the spindle and we have n 30 that is a 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.510
 auxiliary function also to finish 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.850
 the jorge program I have some rule that 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.739
 follow when assembling the blocks if 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.580
 you should take into account the following 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:39.810
 restrictions should only contain 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.300
 a single movement of tool 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.110
 must contain a single speed of 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.350
 cut 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:50.320
 They must also contain only one 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:53.200
 tool or spindle speed and 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.980
 finally the number of blocks must be 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.260
 sequential 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.260
 zhen tang i am perfect 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:09.330
 and joaquim meditating 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.610
 it was not happening a little clean everything 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.930
 what we did today then we talk about 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.629
 the stages of program development 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.949
 we talk about the trajectory that is like 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:18.959
 the route that the 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:21.209
 cutting tool during all the 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.060
 I work this from your points and 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.800
 its coordinates we also talk about the 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.720
 technological parameters that are by 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.800
 example the cutting speed the 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:35.820
 depth of cut and advance and the 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:38.220
 advance because 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.530
 then we talk about the codes that is 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.600
 what information we are going to give you 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.250
 us to the cnc so that the machine 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.880
 perform the work sequentially 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.320
 block by block we saw will be perfect 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.760
 excellent summary 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.760
 let's go tomorrow let him eat 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.620
 ah
