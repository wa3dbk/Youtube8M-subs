00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
flowers and now what I'm going to do is

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.360 
flowers and now what I'm going to do is
position<00:01:38.190> there<00:01:38.580> one<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.700> think<00:01:39.980> so<00:01:40.980> it<00:01:41.130> for

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.370 
position there one I think so it for

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.750 
position there one I think so it for
this

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
this

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:48.590 
this
I've<00:01:42.330> got<00:01:42.600> out<00:01:45.740> under<00:01:46.740> flowers<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.360> wires

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
I've got out under flowers and the wires

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.690 
I've got out under flowers and the wires
we<00:01:49.350> bend<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.650> wire<00:01:49.890> into<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.700> stem<00:01:51.030> like<00:01:51.420> shape

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
we bend the wire into a stem like shape

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.320 
we bend the wire into a stem like shape
and<00:01:53.700> then<00:01:53.910> what<00:01:54.060> we<00:01:54.150> can<00:01:54.270> do<00:01:54.480> is<00:01:56.060> making<00:01:57.060> sure

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
and then what we can do is making sure

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.170 
and then what we can do is making sure
that<00:01:57.510> we're<00:01:57.660> at<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.810> fun<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.260> case<00:01:59.180> right

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
that we're at the fun of the case right

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:12.290 
that we're at the fun of the case right
so<00:02:02.090> we<00:02:03.090> then<00:02:03.410> gently<00:02:04.670> insert<00:02:08.810> the<00:02:09.810> wire<00:02:11.300> we

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
so we then gently insert the wire we

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.790 
so we then gently insert the wire we
spin<00:02:12.540> around<00:02:12.570> a<00:02:12.930> bit<00:02:13.110> so<00:02:13.260> what<00:02:13.410> I<00:02:13.440> can<00:02:13.560> do<00:02:13.709> is

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
spin around a bit so what I can do is

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.080 
spin around a bit so what I can do is
just<00:02:13.830> gently<00:02:14.100> push<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.520> down<00:02:16.489> into<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.850> cake

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
just gently push it down into the cake

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.900 
just gently push it down into the cake
and<00:02:18.470> secure<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.560> in<00:02:19.650> place<00:02:22.220> so<00:02:23.220> all<00:02:23.640> we<00:02:23.790> do

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
and secure it in place so all we do

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:29.120 
and secure it in place so all we do
let's<00:02:24.660> bend<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.050> wire<00:02:27.110> back<00:02:28.110> so<00:02:28.410> into<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:28.890> stem

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
let's bend the wire back so into a stem

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.490 
let's bend the wire back so into a stem
chain<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:31.860> try<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.280> use<00:02:33.020> three<00:02:34.020> each<00:02:34.170> side

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
chain and try and use three each side

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:41.420 
chain and try and use three each side
here<00:02:36.530> see<00:02:37.760> no<00:02:38.760> swimming<00:02:39.890> just<00:02:40.890> gently<00:02:41.190> push

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
here see no swimming just gently push

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.000 
here see no swimming just gently push
the<00:02:41.459> wiring
