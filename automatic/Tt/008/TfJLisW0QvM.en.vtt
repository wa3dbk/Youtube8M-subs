00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.880 

so<00:00:02.220> I<00:00:02.250> just<00:00:02.550> came<00:00:03.030> across<00:00:03.179> this<00:00:03.419> nice<00:00:04.259> four

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
so I just came across this nice four

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.220 
so I just came across this nice four
prong<00:00:05.190> right<00:00:05.220> here<00:00:05.790> it's<00:00:06.480> got<00:00:06.690> a<00:00:06.720> beautiful

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
prong right here it's got a beautiful

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.740 
prong right here it's got a beautiful
ripe<00:00:07.799> red<00:00:08.220> berries<00:00:08.700> on<00:00:08.880> it<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:09.510> there's

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
ripe red berries on it and there's

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.450 
ripe red berries on it and there's
another<00:00:09.929> little<00:00:10.139> three<00:00:10.440> prong<00:00:10.740> going<00:00:11.190> right

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
another little three prong going right

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.910 
another little three prong going right
out<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:11.759> the<00:00:11.969> same<00:00:12.210> spot<00:00:12.420> now<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:13.440> don't<00:00:13.559> know<00:00:13.889> if

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
out of the same spot now I don't know if

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.140 
out of the same spot now I don't know if
this<00:00:14.280> is<00:00:14.309> going<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:14.940> be<00:00:15.150> two<00:00:15.690> roots<00:00:16.020> or<00:00:16.910> one<00:00:17.910> big

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
this is going to be two roots or one big

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.710 
this is going to be two roots or one big
root<00:00:18.449> with<00:00:18.690> two<00:00:18.960> prongs<00:00:19.320> growing<00:00:19.770> out<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.130> it

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
root with two prongs growing out of it

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.150 
root with two prongs growing out of it
which<00:00:21.720> I've<00:00:21.900> never<00:00:22.080> dug<00:00:22.380> before<00:00:22.410> but<00:00:23.039> I've

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
which I've never dug before but I've

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.970 
which I've never dug before but I've
heard<00:00:23.400> of<00:00:23.720> so<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.990> have<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.320> feeling<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:25.800> is

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
heard of so I have a feeling this is

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.560 
heard of so I have a feeling this is
going<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.189> be<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.369> pretty<00:00:26.640> good-sized<00:00:27.150> root

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
going to be a pretty good-sized root

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.169 
going to be a pretty good-sized root
just<00:00:28.560> judging<00:00:28.830> from<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.220> size<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.730> this<00:00:29.910> big

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
just judging from the size of this big

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.780 
just judging from the size of this big
four<00:00:30.510> prong<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.109> if<00:00:31.410> this<00:00:31.679> three<00:00:32.369> prong<00:00:32.610> is

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
four prong and if this three prong is

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.310 
four prong and if this three prong is
going<00:00:33.059> out<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.360> same<00:00:33.600> root<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.200> it's

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
going out of the same root and it's

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.139 
going out of the same root and it's
probably<00:00:35.100> going<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.370> be<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.520> really<00:00:35.820> really

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
probably going to be a really really

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.959 
probably going to be a really really
nice<00:00:36.450> root<00:00:36.950> but<00:00:37.950> I'm<00:00:38.430> going<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.610> dig<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.879> up

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
nice root but I'm going to dig it up

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.500 
nice root but I'm going to dig it up
here<00:00:39.329> real<00:00:40.260> carefully<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.210> bigger<00:00:42.210> roots

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
here real carefully to the bigger roots

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.970 
here real carefully to the bigger roots
like<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.110> try<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.350> be<00:00:43.530> really<00:00:43.559> careful

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
like this I try to be really careful

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.619 
like this I try to be really careful
with<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.520> don't<00:00:44.579> want<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.969> mess<00:00:45.149> them<00:00:45.329> up<00:00:45.480> I

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
with I don't want to mess them up I

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.569 
with I don't want to mess them up I
don't<00:00:45.750> want<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.020> break<00:00:46.200> them<00:00:46.440> I'm<00:00:47.010> going<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.309> go

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
don't want to break them I'm going to go

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.279 
don't want to break them I'm going to go
ahead<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:47.850> take<00:00:48.030> these<00:00:48.210> berries<00:00:48.570> off<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.110> here

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
ahead and take these berries off of here

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.959 
ahead and take these berries off of here
and<00:00:49.320> set<00:00:49.590> them<00:00:49.710> aside<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.489> can<00:00:50.670> plant

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
and set them aside so that I can plant

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.250 
and set them aside so that I can plant
them<00:00:51.149> after<00:00:52.050> I'm<00:00:52.199> done<00:00:52.440> harvesting<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.160> plant

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
them after I'm done harvesting the plant

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.080 
them after I'm done harvesting the plant
and<00:00:55.260> it's<00:00:55.620> got<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.829> bunch<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.280> red<00:00:56.520> berries<00:00:56.879> on

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
and it's got a bunch of red berries on

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:21.140 
and it's got a bunch of red berries on
it<00:00:58.340> set<00:00:59.340> those<00:00:59.550> right<00:00:59.850> there

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.470 

well<00:01:21.660> there's<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.730> smaller<00:01:23.730> three-pronged

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
well there's the smaller three-pronged

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.250 
well there's the smaller three-pronged
plant<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:25.350> see<00:01:25.380> it's<00:01:25.680> not<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:25.890> very<00:01:26.160> big<00:01:26.250> root

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
plant you see it's not a very big root

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.830 
plant you see it's not a very big root
but<00:01:28.260> it<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.500> legal<00:01:28.740> plant<00:01:29.130> it's<00:01:29.370> got<00:01:29.840> three

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
but it is a legal plant it's got three

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.210 
but it is a legal plant it's got three
prongs<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:32.090> five<00:01:33.090> leaves<00:01:33.420> each<00:01:33.920> got<00:01:34.920> several

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
prongs of five leaves each got several

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.830 
prongs of five leaves each got several
growth<00:01:35.460> rings<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:36.030> there<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.360> looks<00:01:36.510> like<00:01:36.660> it's

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
growth rings on there it looks like it's

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.130 
growth rings on there it looks like it's
maybe<00:01:37.740> about<00:01:37.800> 10<00:01:38.250> years<00:01:38.550> maybe<00:01:39.150> 15<00:01:39.420> years<00:01:39.870> old

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
maybe about 10 years maybe 15 years old

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.650 
maybe about 10 years maybe 15 years old
or<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.530> I'll<00:01:41.430> set<00:01:41.670> that<00:01:41.820> one<00:01:42.030> over<00:01:42.240> here<00:01:42.480> and

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
or so I'll set that one over here and

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.480 
or so I'll set that one over here and
see<00:01:43.140> if<00:01:43.170> we<00:01:43.320> can<00:01:43.470> find<00:01:43.620> that<00:01:43.830> bigger<00:01:44.070> root<00:01:44.340> in

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
see if we can find that bigger root in

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:52.300 
see if we can find that bigger root in
this

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.719 

and<00:01:52.700> there's<00:01:52.940> the<00:01:53.890> root<00:01:54.890> on<00:01:55.070> the<00:01:55.100> four<00:01:55.400> prong

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.980 

and<00:01:58.729> I<00:01:58.850> wish<00:01:59.030> that<00:01:59.180> we've<00:01:59.270> got<00:01:59.479> some<00:01:59.720> more<00:01:59.840> the

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
and I wish that we've got some more the

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.420 
and I wish that we've got some more the
small<00:02:00.350> roots<00:02:00.619> off<00:02:00.860> of<00:02:01.070> it<00:02:01.220> but<00:02:03.009> didn't<00:02:04.009> dig<00:02:04.190> so

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
small roots off of it but didn't dig so

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.410 
small roots off of it but didn't dig so
well<00:02:04.670> but<00:02:05.509> that's<00:02:05.930> a<00:02:06.140> really<00:02:06.409> nice<00:02:06.590> root<00:02:07.420> it

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
well but that's a really nice root it

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.920 
well but that's a really nice root it
probably<00:02:08.840> weighs<00:02:09.020> close<00:02:09.890> to<00:02:10.600> half<00:02:11.600> an<00:02:11.810> ounce

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
probably weighs close to half an ounce

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:12.820 
probably weighs close to half an ounce
to<00:02:12.200> an<00:02:12.319> ounce

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
to an ounce

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.160 
to an ounce
now<00:02:13.280> that's<00:02:13.610> wet<00:02:14.060> weight<00:02:14.300> when<00:02:14.600> it<00:02:14.630> dries<00:02:14.959> out

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
now that's wet weight when it dries out

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.120 
now that's wet weight when it dries out
it's<00:02:15.410> been<00:02:15.530> away<00:02:15.739> a<00:02:15.770> lot<00:02:16.040> wet<00:02:16.250> a<00:02:16.520> lot<00:02:16.880> less

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
it's been away a lot wet a lot less

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.559 
it's been away a lot wet a lot less
found<00:02:19.130> quite<00:02:19.340> a<00:02:19.400> few<00:02:19.459> smaller<00:02:19.940> plants<00:02:20.420> out

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
found quite a few smaller plants out

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.930 
found quite a few smaller plants out
here<00:02:20.600> I<00:02:21.020> see<00:02:21.739> another<00:02:21.980> one<00:02:22.100> with<00:02:22.340> red<00:02:22.520> berries

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
here I see another one with red berries

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.220 
here I see another one with red berries
right<00:02:23.150> over<00:02:23.330> here<00:02:23.480> through<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:23.780> bushes<00:02:23.989> that
