left right ratchet launcher that came

00:03:54.829 --> 00:04:00.390 
left right ratchet launcher that came
with<00:03:55.040> Vera<00:03:55.430> Arras<00:03:56.140> so<00:03:57.370> just<00:03:58.370> check<00:03:58.640> here<00:03:58.970> oh

with Vera Arras so just check here oh

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.520 
with Vera Arras so just check here oh
actually<00:04:01.400> I<00:04:01.609> think<00:04:01.670> I<00:04:01.760> have<00:04:01.790> a<00:04:01.909> left<00:04:02.209> prawn

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
actually I think I have a left prawn

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.080 
actually I think I have a left prawn
look<00:04:03.530> at<00:04:03.620> that<00:04:03.739> one<00:04:03.859> right<00:04:03.890> now<00:04:04.129> I<00:04:04.340> just<00:04:04.849> look

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
look at that one right now I just look

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.479 
look at that one right now I just look
at<00:04:05.239> our<00:04:05.390> standard<00:04:05.959> right<00:04:06.500> spinning<00:04:06.920> part<00:04:07.280> here

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
at our standard right spinning part here

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.270 
at our standard right spinning part here
of<00:04:07.519> the<00:04:07.700> LR<00:04:08.299> launcher<00:04:08.930> see<00:04:09.739> if<00:04:09.829> it<00:04:09.920> fits<00:04:10.129> on

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
of the LR launcher see if it fits on

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.640 
of the LR launcher see if it fits on
there<00:04:10.810> it<00:04:11.810> does<00:04:13.060> so<00:04:14.060> I'll<00:04:14.989> probably<00:04:15.170> use<00:04:15.379> this

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
there it does so I'll probably use this

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.800 
there it does so I'll probably use this
for<00:04:15.889> the<00:04:15.950> battle<00:04:16.250> in<00:04:16.400> just<00:04:17.150> because<00:04:17.449> it's<00:04:17.750> a

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
for the battle in just because it's a

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.229 
for the battle in just because it's a
lot<00:04:17.989> more<00:04:18.260> easier<00:04:18.650> to<00:04:18.769> use<00:04:18.889> than<00:04:19.130> these<00:04:19.669> cheap

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
lot more easier to use than these cheap

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.950 
lot more easier to use than these cheap
ratchet<00:04:20.600> launchers<00:04:20.979> so<00:04:22.270> that<00:04:23.270> I<00:04:23.570> guess<00:04:23.750> we'll

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
ratchet launchers so that I guess we'll

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.350 
ratchet launchers so that I guess we'll
conclude<00:04:24.169> with<00:04:24.350> this<00:04:24.850> video<00:04:25.850> for<00:04:26.060> this<00:04:26.120> one

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.360 
conclude with this video for this one

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.879 
conclude with this video for this one
I'm<00:04:26.720> not<00:04:26.900> going<00:04:27.020> to<00:04:27.080> a<00:04:27.139> spin<00:04:27.320> test<00:04:27.500> because<00:04:27.860> I

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 
I'm not going to a spin test because I

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:30.010 
I'm not going to a spin test because I
may<00:04:28.039> be<00:04:28.130> battling<00:04:28.340> them<00:04:28.610> right<00:04:29.449> away<00:04:29.539> as<00:04:29.780> well

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
may be battling them right away as well

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.260 
may be battling them right away as well
so<00:04:30.680> you<00:04:31.160> can<00:04:31.310> use<00:04:31.430> that<00:04:31.550> as<00:04:31.669> a<00:04:31.760> spin<00:04:31.970> test<00:04:32.180> I

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
so you can use that as a spin test I

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.020 
so you can use that as a spin test I
guess<00:04:32.919> they're<00:04:33.919> actually<00:04:34.370> I<00:04:34.400> guess<00:04:34.520> a<00:04:34.610> new<00:04:34.789> one

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
guess they're actually I guess a new one

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.960 
guess they're actually I guess a new one
spin<00:04:35.300> test<00:04:35.539> so<00:04:36.470> camera<00:04:37.160> cut<00:04:37.340> away<00:04:37.490> while<00:04:37.699> I<00:04:37.729> get

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
spin test so camera cut away while I get

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.580 
spin test so camera cut away while I get
this<00:04:38.090> tape<00:04:38.240> in<00:04:38.389> place<00:04:38.419> and<00:04:39.229> we'll<00:04:39.410> show<00:04:39.560> you

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
this tape in place and we'll show you

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.670 
this tape in place and we'll show you
how<00:04:39.650> it<00:04:39.740> looks<00:04:39.800> in<00:04:40.190> the<00:04:40.250> bb10<00:04:40.820> attack<00:04:41.180> stadium

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
how it looks in the bb10 attack stadium

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.230 
how it looks in the bb10 attack stadium
alright<00:04:42.680> so<00:04:42.889> there's<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:43.370> bb10<00:04:43.760> attack

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
alright so there's the bb10 attack

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.890 
alright so there's the bb10 attack
Stadium<00:04:44.979> here's<00:04:45.979> our<00:04:46.280> tornado<00:04:46.789> Pegasus<00:04:47.479> and

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
Stadium here's our tornado Pegasus and

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.860 
Stadium here's our tornado Pegasus and
here<00:04:48.349> is<00:04:48.470> our<00:04:48.650> lr<00:04:49.130> strain<00:04:49.430> launcher<00:04:49.789> so<00:04:50.690> let's

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
here is our lr strain launcher so let's

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.420 
here is our lr strain launcher so let's
see<00:04:51.110> how<00:04:51.169> it<00:04:51.229> looks<00:04:51.380> in<00:04:51.500> the<00:04:51.620> bb10<00:04:52.010> state<00:04:52.280> I'm

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
see how it looks in the bb10 state I'm

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.890 
see how it looks in the bb10 state I'm
Shelly<00:04:52.789> in<00:04:53.270> three<00:04:53.599> two<00:04:53.750> one<00:04:53.780> lit<00:04:54.289> it<00:04:55.810> might<00:04:56.810> be

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
Shelly in three two one lit it might be

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.920 
Shelly in three two one lit it might be
a<00:04:56.930> little<00:04:57.050> too<00:04:57.289> strong<00:04:57.470> for<00:04:57.710> that<00:04:57.770> one

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.950 

in<00:05:01.930> there<00:05:02.110> very<00:05:02.290> well<00:05:02.350> but<00:05:03.600> it<00:05:04.600> started<00:05:04.870> off

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
in there very well but it started off

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.270 
in there very well but it started off
pretty<00:05:04.990> much<00:05:05.259> on<00:05:05.440> its<00:05:05.560> side<00:05:05.770> they<00:05:06.009> kind<00:05:06.220> of

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
pretty much on its side they kind of

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.120 
pretty much on its side they kind of
regains<00:05:06.880> its<00:05:07.030> balance<00:05:07.620> they<00:05:08.620> play<00:05:09.009> around

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
regains its balance they play around

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.710 
regains its balance they play around
with<00:05:09.310> how<00:05:09.520> strong<00:05:09.970> I<00:05:10.000> should<00:05:10.300> launch<00:05:10.449> them

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
with how strong I should launch them

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.300 
with how strong I should launch them
since<00:05:11.320> they<00:05:11.410> are<00:05:11.530> totally<00:05:11.889> different<00:05:11.949> kind<00:05:12.220> of

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
since they are totally different kind of

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:18.960 
since they are totally different kind of
bait<00:05:12.430> obviously<00:05:12.880> but<00:05:16.680> watching<00:05:17.680> it<00:05:17.770> was<00:05:17.970> just

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
bait obviously but watching it was just

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.120 
bait obviously but watching it was just
maintaining<00:05:19.539> spin<00:05:19.900> some<00:05:20.169> oh<00:05:20.289> let's<00:05:20.889> try<00:05:21.009> that

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
maintaining spin some oh let's try that

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.890 
maintaining spin some oh let's try that
one<00:05:21.430> more<00:05:21.490> time<00:05:21.639> I'll<00:05:22.150> try<00:05:22.300> to<00:05:22.389> do<00:05:22.479> it<00:05:22.600> a<00:05:22.630> little

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
one more time I'll try to do it a little

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.930 
one more time I'll try to do it a little
more<00:05:23.050> softly<00:05:23.740> this<00:05:23.860> time<00:05:24.130> see<00:05:24.520> how<00:05:24.580> it<00:05:24.699> goes

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
more softly this time see how it goes

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.590 
more softly this time see how it goes
three<00:05:25.509> two<00:05:25.660> one<00:05:25.690> with<00:05:26.169> it<00:05:27.270> that<00:05:28.270> was<00:05:28.330> a<00:05:28.389> much

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.600 
three two one with it that was a much

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.950 
three two one with it that was a much
more<00:05:28.630> gentle<00:05:29.320> and<00:05:29.410> more<00:05:29.620> controlled<00:05:30.220> launch

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
more gentle and more controlled launch

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.629 
more gentle and more controlled launch
so<00:05:31.960> that's<00:05:32.080> you<00:05:32.500> can<00:05:32.620> see<00:05:32.800> it's<00:05:32.919> a<00:05:33.010> lot<00:05:33.160> less

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 
so that's you can see it's a lot less

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:36.029 
so that's you can see it's a lot less
much<00:05:34.539> less<00:05:34.570> turbulent<00:05:35.260> on<00:05:35.410> the<00:05:35.560> first<00:05:35.800> launch

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:36.039 
much less turbulent on the first launch

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:42.719 
much less turbulent on the first launch
there<00:05:39.990> says<00:05:40.990> that<00:05:41.680> angled<00:05:41.979> Spain<00:05:42.190> action<00:05:42.639> for

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
there says that angled Spain action for

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:45.240 
there says that angled Spain action for
awesome<00:05:42.940> attack<00:05:43.000> moves<00:05:43.510> from<00:05:43.990> a<00:05:44.080> flat<00:05:44.350> tip<00:05:44.590> to

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
awesome attack moves from a flat tip to

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.730 
awesome attack moves from a flat tip to
generate<00:05:45.520> an<00:05:45.729> aggressive<00:05:46.210> spin<00:05:46.479> so<00:05:46.870> attack

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
generate an aggressive spin so attack

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.770 
generate an aggressive spin so attack
type<00:05:47.979> qualities<00:05:48.460> so<00:05:49.120> it's<00:05:49.210> not<00:05:49.300> going<00:05:49.479> to<00:05:49.570> stay

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
type qualities so it's not going to stay

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.659 
type qualities so it's not going to stay
in<00:05:49.900> the<00:05:49.990> middle<00:05:50.199> it's<00:05:50.949> not<00:05:51.099> doing<00:05:51.310> a<00:05:51.370> whole<00:05:51.400> lot

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:51.669 
in the middle it's not doing a whole lot

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:53.730 
in the middle it's not doing a whole lot
is<00:05:51.789> is<00:05:52.000> but<00:05:52.389> we'll<00:05:53.139> see<00:05:53.260> how<00:05:53.289> it<00:05:53.380> looks<00:05:53.500> when<00:05:53.650> it

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:53.740 
is is but we'll see how it looks when it

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.650 
is is but we'll see how it looks when it
does<00:05:53.889> battle<00:05:54.099> with<00:05:54.580> our<00:05:55.500> tornado<00:05:56.500> paddler
