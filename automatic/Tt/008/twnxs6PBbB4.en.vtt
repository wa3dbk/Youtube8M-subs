basically I'm using tan color just on
the<00:00:46.370> sides<00:00:46.610> as<00:00:47.080> those<00:00:48.080> parts<00:00:48.470> on<00:00:48.650> motion<00:00:49.040> have

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.560 
the sides as those parts on motion have
more<00:00:49.790> shadow<00:00:50.059> so<00:00:51.019> then<00:00:51.530> I<00:00:51.559> will<00:00:51.920> use<00:00:52.570> satin

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:53.570 
more shadow so then I will use satin

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.210

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
to draw stockings with the pattern with

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.570 
to draw stockings with the pattern with
a<00:03:07.920> fishnet<00:03:08.250> pattern<00:03:08.940> but<00:03:09.390> small<00:03:09.720> one<00:03:10.460> for<00:03:11.460> that

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
a fishnet pattern but small one for that

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.390 
a fishnet pattern but small one for that
we<00:03:11.880> need<00:03:12.120> to<00:03:12.360> draw<00:03:13.730> diagonal<00:03:14.900> stripes<00:03:16.400> like

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
we need to draw diagonal stripes like

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.700 
we need to draw diagonal stripes like
crossing<00:03:17.970> diagonal<00:03:18.540> stripes<00:03:18.870> just<00:03:19.290> follow<00:03:19.500> me

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
crossing diagonal stripes just follow me

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.840 
crossing diagonal stripes just follow me
and<00:03:19.890> that<00:03:19.980> will<00:03:20.460> add<00:03:20.730> shadows<00:03:21.300> with<00:03:21.660> a<00:03:22.850> black

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
and that will add shadows with a black

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.320 
and that will add shadows with a black
pencil<00:03:24.180> and<00:03:25.340> then<00:03:26.340> we<00:03:26.580> will<00:03:26.760> draw<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.000> other

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
pencil and then we will draw the other

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.120 
pencil and then we will draw the other
type<00:03:27.660> of<00:03:27.690> stockings

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
type of stockings

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:45.520 
type of stockings
you

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.270 

I<00:03:45.760> must<00:03:46.760> admit<00:03:46.940> that<00:03:47.120> here<00:03:47.690> this<00:03:48.590> pan<00:03:48.950> is<00:03:49.220> too

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
I must admit that here this pan is too

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.940 
I must admit that here this pan is too
has<00:03:50.030> to<00:03:50.270> white-naped<00:03:51.080> better<00:03:52.070> to<00:03:52.340> use<00:03:53.080> 0.1<00:03:54.080> so

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
has to white-naped better to use 0.1 so

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.410 
has to white-naped better to use 0.1 so
your<00:03:55.580> password<00:03:56.180> will<00:03:56.630> be<00:03:56.660> more<00:03:57.670> like<00:03:58.670> softer

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
your password will be more like softer

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.350 
your password will be more like softer
so<00:04:00.260> now<00:04:00.470> I'm<00:04:00.770> drawing<00:04:01.190> another<00:04:01.850> type<00:04:02.330> of

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 
so now I'm drawing another type of

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.660 
so now I'm drawing another type of
stockings<00:04:03.020> with<00:04:03.920> lace<00:04:04.580> pattern<00:04:06.160> for<00:04:07.160> that<00:04:07.370> I'm

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
stockings with lace pattern for that I'm

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.660 
stockings with lace pattern for that I'm
just<00:04:08.150> randomly<00:04:08.480> drawing<00:04:09.140> different<00:04:10.040> flowers

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
just randomly drawing different flowers

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.699 
just randomly drawing different flowers
and<00:04:12.130> like<00:04:13.130> leaves<00:04:14.350> basically<00:04:15.350> you<00:04:15.500> should

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
and like leaves basically you should

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.990 
and like leaves basically you should
draw<00:04:15.920> some<00:04:16.220> big<00:04:16.910> objects<00:04:17.600> and<00:04:17.750> have<00:04:18.109> and

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
draw some big objects and have and

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.659 
draw some big objects and have and
connect<00:04:20.000> them<00:04:20.150> with<00:04:20.390> some<00:04:20.690> lines<00:04:21.019> as<00:04:21.490> here<00:04:22.490> we

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
connect them with some lines as here we

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:26.640 
connect them with some lines as here we
have<00:04:22.880> some<00:04:23.210> natural<00:04:23.930> motifs<00:04:24.560> it's<00:04:25.400> like<00:04:25.669> and

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
have some natural motifs it's like and

have some natural motifs it's like and
just<00:04:27.650> it's<00:04:28.430> all<00:04:28.820> the<00:04:29.120> branches<00:04:30.250> and<00:04:31.250> stuff<00:04:31.640> so

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
just it's all the branches and stuff so

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.720 
just it's all the branches and stuff so
you<00:04:32.780> can<00:04:32.990> leave<00:04:33.230> it<00:04:33.350> like<00:04:33.380> this<00:04:33.800> it<00:04:34.220> will<00:04:34.430> be<00:04:34.610> an

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
you can leave it like this it will be an

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.010 
you can leave it like this it will be an
island<00:04:34.970> plus<00:04:36.730> plus<00:04:37.730> these<00:04:38.120> patterns<00:04:38.690> on<00:04:38.870> it

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
island plus plus these patterns on it

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.640 
island plus plus these patterns on it
but<00:04:39.890> you<00:04:40.040> can<00:04:40.250> also<00:04:40.430> add<00:04:40.850> some<00:04:40.910> net<00:04:41.480> and<00:04:42.050> I<00:04:42.410> will

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
but you can also add some net and I will

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.530 
but you can also add some net and I will
show<00:04:43.160> you<00:04:43.190> four<00:04:44.260> ways<00:04:45.260> of<00:04:45.650> drawing<00:04:46.540> stockings

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
show you four ways of drawing stockings

00:04:47.540 --> 00:05:11.260 
show you four ways of drawing stockings
with<00:04:47.900> the<00:04:48.230> lace<00:04:49.040> pattern

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.680 

okay<00:05:12.300> so<00:05:13.110> next<00:05:13.500> on<00:05:14.010> type<00:05:14.790> of<00:05:14.970> stockings<00:05:15.420> is

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
okay so next on type of stockings is

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.740 
okay so next on type of stockings is
also<00:05:16.350> like<00:05:16.500> fishnet<00:05:17.400> but<00:05:17.970> like<00:05:18.270> with<00:05:18.510> big

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
also like fishnet but like with big

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.910 
also like fishnet but like with big
pattern<00:05:19.230> and<00:05:19.470> first<00:05:20.370> I'm<00:05:20.580> adding<00:05:21.090> shadows

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
pattern and first I'm adding shadows

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.220 
pattern and first I'm adding shadows
always<00:05:22.920> black<00:05:23.250> pencil<00:05:24.150> then<00:05:24.750> I'm<00:05:24.960> using

really warm brie - and reducing the

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.520 
really warm brie - and reducing the
noise<00:05:29.700> of<00:05:30.000> pencil<00:05:30.540> and<00:05:32.120> and<00:05:33.120> like<00:05:34.050> covering

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
noise of pencil and and like covering

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.350 
noise of pencil and and like covering
everything<00:05:34.830> with<00:05:35.280> it<00:05:36.080> then<00:05:37.080> I<00:05:37.410> will<00:05:37.500> take

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
but like bigger with a big distance

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:56.770 
but like bigger with a big distance
between<00:05:46.530> stripes

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.100

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:04.409 
dots at the intersections of those

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:12.650 
dots at the intersections of those
stripes

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.860

some stockings with I don't know some
drawings<00:06:20.199> or<00:06:20.620> writings<00:06:21.280> for<00:06:22.120> that<00:06:22.330> I'm<00:06:22.750> again

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
drawings or writings for that I'm again

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.500 
drawings or writings for that I'm again
you<00:06:23.320> can<00:06:23.530> make<00:06:23.710> some<00:06:24.040> more<00:06:24.610> shadows<00:06:25.150> more

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:25.510 
you can make some more shadows more

you can make some more shadows more
contrast<00:06:26.050> using<00:06:26.800> black<00:06:27.040> pencil<00:06:27.460> as<00:06:27.580> in

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
contrast using black pencil as in

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.189 
contrast using black pencil as in
previous<00:06:28.419> example<00:06:28.960> I'm<00:06:29.740> using<00:06:30.210> it<00:06:31.210> afterwards

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:32.199 
previous example I'm using it afterwards

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:35.909 
previous example I'm using it afterwards
but<00:06:32.410> you<00:06:32.470> can<00:06:32.740> use<00:06:32.949> it<00:06:33.130> before<00:06:34.320> so<00:06:35.320> but<00:06:35.800> it

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 
but you can use it before so but it

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:37.680 
but you can use it before so but it
depends<00:06:36.370> which<00:06:36.639> effects<00:06:37.000> you<00:06:37.120> prefer<00:06:37.479> but<00:06:37.660> I

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:37.690 
depends which effects you prefer but I

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.070 
depends which effects you prefer but I
think<00:06:37.990> they<00:06:38.139> look<00:06:38.380> kind<00:06:38.770> of<00:06:38.860> similar<00:06:40.080> I'm

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 
think they look kind of similar I'm

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.950 
think they look kind of similar I'm
using<00:06:41.410> like<00:06:41.740> a<00:06:42.220> bead<00:06:42.580> setting<00:06:43.210> that<00:06:43.600> doesn't

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 
using like a bead setting that doesn't

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.580 
using like a bead setting that doesn't
give<00:06:44.110> that<00:06:44.320> much<00:06:44.530> color<00:06:44.800> but<00:06:45.639> it<00:06:45.790> makes<00:06:46.090> a

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:46.590 
give that much color but it makes a

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.159 
give that much color but it makes a
black<00:06:47.590> part<00:06:47.919> smoother<00:06:48.250> and<00:06:48.639> don't<00:06:49.090> forget<00:06:49.840> to

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:50.169 
black part smoother and don't forget to

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:53.909 
black part smoother and don't forget to
spread<00:06:50.560> your<00:06:50.919> marker<00:06:51.479> afterwards<00:06:52.479> on<00:06:53.260> some

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:53.919 
spread your marker afterwards on some

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:58.100 
spread your marker afterwards on some
paper<00:06:54.220> otherwise<00:06:55.210> it<00:06:55.570> will<00:06:55.780> become<00:06:55.990> dirty

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
paper otherwise it will become dirty

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.659 
paper otherwise it will become dirty
basically<00:06:59.110> you<00:06:59.200> just<00:06:59.229> draw<00:06:59.710> something<00:07:00.040> using

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:00.669 
basically you just draw something using

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:13.800 
basically you just draw something using
your<00:07:01.229> pen

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:13.810 

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:18.249 

okay<00:07:14.810> so<00:07:14.870> it's<00:07:15.530> less<00:07:15.800> drugs<00:07:16.509> I<00:07:17.509> hope<00:07:18.050> you
