00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 sheet girls of idiots will be alone 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.919
 sugar pop palette of to face 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:10.530
 this is the limited edition blade 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.410
 there are nine colors within three 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.599
 colors in the big pods and 6 colors 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.020
 in its small lines and as the says 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.970
 name is a little bit more colorful 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.590
 compared to the classic neutral the only one 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.289
 really dull color inside the 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.970
 this blackberry then there are some 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.500
 colors like these two that are here 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.359
 basically or basic parts though 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.210
 micro days then instead inside 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.329
 the others are more satiny or 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.850
 however pergolas so a bit of a mix 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.460
 the price of the palette of 36 euros vi 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.960
 I show on the hands colors we leave 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.289
 first it picks up more clear 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.960
 these are the three colors the first one this 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.820
 it's sweeter spicy so this is some 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.820
 clear then center we have lavender color 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.059
 and finally this is the end 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.699
 color that always butter though though 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.170
 more butter peach when the butter is counted 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.019
 with a peach in the eyes of this e 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.510
 color of this will put more colors 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.000
 clear as you can see so swatch 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.600
 ati are quite intense 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.729
 no moment and you can see anyway 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.590
 which are three cords that apart from that is good 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.250
 the one in the middle the first two are a lot 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.170
 similar are in a different tone, however, they are 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.240
 however, both on the garden do not 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.340
 the other is yes on pink anemone 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.670
 they look a lot like this but you 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.920
 the one in the center is a very lilac 3 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.729
 these are very light 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.710
 other colors bloomed on the hand then 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.650
 as you can see we have a bit of 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.150
 problems with purple which is slightly 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:48.230
 a copy everywhere completely 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.100
 completely homogeneous blackberry on the 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.690
 but no 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.640
 actually his mandate is still tried 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.470
 I have tried so much on my eyes 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.090
 I loved blackberry so much now 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.440
 hand does not make me crazy pro you will see 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.480
 instead very rich on hockey like 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:04.100
 as a result the most bronze color is 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.110
 cute very cute unique metallic 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.630
 metallic between all these two 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.620
 colors in the end then the purple and the 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.970
 green water are cute but not super 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.930
 super super pigmented food 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.760
 medium gray and orange is cute is more 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.820
 it looks more like an opaque even if it is not 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.680
 it is not one hundred percent however it seems 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.600
 more opaque than the others and all 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.300
 how much less evil they still have gods 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.130
 reflections inside apart from blackberry 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.560
 all of them especially in the glitter 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.050
 in sini click on gold 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.720
 on silver the first two have gods 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.120
 trini microbes on gold 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.250
 the violet of the trini microbes on the color 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.870
 silver green water has no 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.959
 type of micro glitter eno and is for 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.760
 this is opaque and in pink to micro 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.840
 this also seems riterini 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.489
 we are on silver 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.050
 so however most of the 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.640
 gym inside the small ones 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.860
 straws that look like calves say 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.769
 be careful because especially in the 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.269
 bronze colors tend to happen then 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.730
 make a little golden reflection underneath 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:07.310
 the eye we go to put under the 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:13.130
 primer we go to put some 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:16.070
 of the orange are quite dusty 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:18.170
 as you can see not all but in 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.480
 especially the blackberry also 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:25.760
 present dusty immediately after puts a 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:27.950
 bit of fuchsia puts some of the color 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.120
 ready as a practically color plan 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.190
 possible but it also does telecom is 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.260
 only on the eyes as you can see the 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.670
 made for ready 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.290
 lets her metallized what 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.250
 writes better 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.250
 and easier to apply 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.590
 and finally I finish with the black color 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.810
 berry then that dull color while 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:52.750
 best describes on the eye he has chosen 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:55.299
 ball in the inner corner put a little bit 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.750
 of the lightest color just to go 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:00.370
 slightly to illuminate and below 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.659
 the arch admits some of the color is 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:08.019
 always the clear one however that a little 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:10.030
 the more they fish for this then they are the 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.970
 various colors on the eye obviously goes 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.560
 well I didn't put these two here 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.410
 very beautiful water green on the eye 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.930
 tip easy to work while purple 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.930
 a little more difficult, not because anyway 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.479
 you have seen that it is not really super 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.530
 super homogeneous and not really much 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:30.039
 intense therefore a little more difficult 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.870
 work compared to water green like 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:34.600
 you can see the product is pretty 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.880
 almost all colors are dusty 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.680
 his ability is quite dusty 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.270
 rather easy, those are 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.460
 was the peace of fading even the one with 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:47.470
 the other in via 8 so for this 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:49.660
 product is of 6m jonico drums six in 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.669
 half because I have to tell the truth is not 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.590
 a paddle drove me crazy the 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:55.270
 fact that it is very dusty and done 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.470
 that many colors are like the first three 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.560
 I am very similar once together 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.330
 have work on the eyes you lose a 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.530
 therefore even with holland it is not noticed 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:07.780
 practically that while others like 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.000
 I said I find the purple a little poor 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.680
 and the other colors as far as they are 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.720
 better than purple are not 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.699
 just not really land 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.830
 dimensional hello they are a bit flat like 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:20.080
 you can see priest himself was that orange 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.970
 fuchsia 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.070
 I like the blackberry and much more 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.740
 the last with lucio and blackberry and the 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.090
 bronze color together with albert water sui 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.440
 favorite color glasses 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.480
 I do n't touch this palette 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.280
 it's just these three others due a little 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.320
 less so it's a bit of a shame because 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.460
 for those who are very cute anyway 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.650
 color inside are a lot 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.199
 interesting though I'm not really 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:45.600
 performing as usually chosen colors 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:45.600
 of the drum bass the beauty
