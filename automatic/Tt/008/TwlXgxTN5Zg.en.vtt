00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.179 
hello I'm storm from storm and Blackfoot
and<00:02:34.140> this<00:02:35.140> is<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.950> great<00:02:36.250> infestation<00:02:38.189> now

and this is the great infestation now

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:44.099 
and this is the great infestation now
that<00:02:39.489> was<00:02:39.670> some<00:02:39.819> freaky<00:02:40.060> intro<00:02:42.780> seems<00:02:43.780> like

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:44.109 
that was some freaky intro seems like

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.780 
that was some freaky intro seems like
that<00:02:44.349> could<00:02:44.620> help<00:02:44.980> myself

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.699 

let's<00:02:48.790> get<00:02:49.060> into<00:02:49.510> doubt

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.679 

so<00:02:53.310> this<00:02:53.939> map<00:02:54.540> is<00:02:54.810> made<00:02:55.590> from<00:02:55.829> NP<00:02:56.310> final<00:02:56.849> once

00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:57.689 
so this map is made from NP final once

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:01.880 
so this map is made from NP final once
again<00:02:58.319> and<00:02:59.719> not<00:03:00.719> read<00:03:00.959> from<00:03:01.290> him

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
again and not read from him

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:10.849 
again and not read from him
it<00:03:02.040> was<00:03:02.370> made<00:03:05.329> with<00:03:06.329> him<00:03:06.719> and<00:03:07.250> NP<00:03:08.269> Zilla<00:03:09.859> now

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
it was made with him and NP Zilla now

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:17.839 
it was made with him and NP Zilla now
it's<00:03:11.159> a<00:03:11.780> it's<00:03:12.780> a<00:03:12.900> really<00:03:15.260> great<00:03:16.260> process<00:03:16.980> made

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
it's a it's a really great process made

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.410 
it's a it's a really great process made
since<00:03:18.659> the<00:03:18.840> data<00:03:19.079> and<00:03:20.040> now<00:03:20.310> this<00:03:20.909> is<00:03:21.150> should<00:03:21.389> be

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
since the data and now this is should be

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.490 
since the data and now this is should be
the<00:03:21.540> stable<00:03:21.930> version<00:03:22.379> of<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.489> data<00:03:24.500> let's

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
the stable version of the data let's

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:37.350 
the stable version of the data let's
test<00:03:25.889> it<00:03:26.069> out<00:03:26.159> then<00:03:27.139> now<00:03:28.609> it's<00:03:30.590> ready<00:03:32.359> Presley

that's<00:03:57.310> some<00:03:57.550> big<00:03:57.760> gate

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
that's some big gate

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.970 
that's some big gate
we<00:04:00.800> now<00:04:02.540> hmm<00:04:03.630> I<00:04:03.750> know<00:04:03.810> what<00:04:04.230> you're<00:04:04.440> thinking
