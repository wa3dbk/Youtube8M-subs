00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.820 
here's one right here
I<00:02:06.189> have<00:02:07.030> makeup<00:02:07.659> in<00:02:07.840> this<00:02:07.990> but<00:02:08.200> it's<00:02:08.410> just<00:02:08.770> a

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
I have makeup in this but it's just a

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.190 
I have makeup in this but it's just a
little<00:02:09.069> char<00:02:09.310> and<00:02:09.940> you<00:02:10.090> can<00:02:10.240> just<00:02:10.420> you<00:02:11.170> know

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
little char and you can just you know

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.960 
little char and you can just you know
get<00:02:11.500> your<00:02:11.620> leavin<00:02:12.010> or<00:02:12.190> your<00:02:12.340> deep<00:02:12.580> conditioner

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970

whatever<00:02:13.209> just<00:02:13.450> put<00:02:13.600> in<00:02:13.690> here<00:02:13.810> I<00:02:13.870> think<00:02:14.080> it's

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
whatever just put in here I think it's

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.440 
whatever just put in here I think it's
about<00:02:14.319> two<00:02:14.470> ounces<00:02:14.910> so<00:02:15.910> you<00:02:16.000> can<00:02:16.120> take<00:02:16.270> it<00:02:16.390> with

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
about two ounces so you can take it with

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.699 
about two ounces so you can take it with
you<00:02:16.569> when<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:16.780> travel<00:02:16.840> so<00:02:17.290> I<00:02:17.319> might<00:02:17.560> have<00:02:17.680> to

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
you when you travel so I might have to

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.199 
you when you travel so I might have to
start<00:02:18.010> doing<00:02:18.130> that<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.640> prepping<00:02:19.060> more

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
start doing that and prepping more

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.540 
start doing that and prepping more
because<00:02:19.510> um<00:02:19.810> when<00:02:20.590> I<00:02:20.650> travel<00:02:21.069> I<00:02:21.130> kind<00:02:21.370> of<00:02:21.400> like

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
because um when I travel I kind of like

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.090 
because um when I travel I kind of like
to<00:02:21.730> just<00:02:22.050> not<00:02:23.050> think<00:02:23.080> about<00:02:23.380> my<00:02:23.650> hair<00:02:23.830> but<00:02:23.980> then

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100
