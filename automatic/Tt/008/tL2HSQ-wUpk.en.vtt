00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.319
 youtube and come to biotech city like that 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.920
 This time I use a new texture 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:15.240
 pack that I really liked and 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.949
 Here's how it works 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.859
 cinema will be presented in this episode 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:24.119
 and there I show you the back 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:28.289
 facade of another skyscraper so 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:32.040
 Let's start at the cinema of had 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.270
 Last week, such a little problem and 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.440
 Although I have from what you all 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.809
 I work without world and 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:44.610
 That's why I speak my rooms 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.829
 mostly free something went wrong so 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.700
 everything fixed again and the cinema can 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.329
 been opened 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.980
 we are here in the main entrance 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.719
 shelves to the right the boss does not 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.260
 Furnished because there is still an entrance way 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.730
 So probably in the disco 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.100
 He died then caught the actual cinema 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.180
 on 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.489
 and here you can see one 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.040
 TV wall shows you now to 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.110
 example, which film is running grad and 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:16.470
 trailer of movies and no idea what 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:18.270
 Everything is here for sale 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.549
 So here you can buy cake chips 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.110
 Bamboo just cake everything you want 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:28.890
 and after you bought the stuff 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.689
 You can overflow here and there 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.500
 comes to the movie theaters 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:37.140
 There are three pieces of format a trick 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.509
 First you have to get the one card 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.250
 Buy Sell ​​is a card and 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.009
 then put in here below and then 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.159
 you can go through 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:52.500
 so now we are almost in the cinema hall 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.600
 area left to 12 right-handed with the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.740
 3 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:01.700
 We start with number 112 which of the 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.729
 the smallest room is the special feature 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.740
 here is actually just the ceiling and 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:11.480
 Although the room is located directly below 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:13.040
 Never saw the sed before and that 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.300
 everything can turn the whole 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.700
 have lighting and so in the room 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:25.130
 it 56 people place 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:30.620
 it is the smallest number and somehow 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:34.660
 sprint-ass light as no other beats 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:41.360
 a sign at the place probably yes 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:44.900
 56 people have space here and again 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.989
 light that is called katar before for mode and 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.170
 now it's day mode so if you 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:55.370
 runs and so then we go to the 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:59.660
 number over the number is 1 which is 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:02.900
 twice as big almost twice that size 112 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.269
 he seats here but a number 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:11.989
 more and is a total of ten blocks 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:12.950
 continue to agree 10 551 yes another 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.310
 special feature is here 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.400
 He has boxes in the blanket and a box 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.390
 screening room so there then sits 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.100
 somebody inside and turn that on 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:29.000
 movies and sort it and 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:32.500
 turned off the light and in the 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.500
 background interpreter all the time 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.530
 above 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.510
 so dark from may and the floors 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.450
 way back and the show 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.569
 Mode here also have such indirect 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.299
 lighting 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:50.430
 I think that's very nice 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.650
 Do not bother them because I helped so much 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.709
 set steps and then it lights up 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.439
 not just it just shows that 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:01.049
 Back there the exit is for example 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:05.579
 So that's very realistic 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:06.450
 and yes that still was not the 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:10.260
 biggest room 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:13.799
 there are even bigger ones, but i have 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.579
 gave help if so as already mentioned 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.989
 I do not like to work with world at 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.539
 and that's why I speak my rooms 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.910
 however, the room was always free 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:26.990
 great that I almost made it on my own 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.599
 and that's why we ask 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:36.500
 lambo heads into the space when making purchases 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:41.210
 one can say a little bit to jump 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:43.919
 a big thank you to you 20 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.259
 and yes we are here now in the largest 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:48.800
 Cinema I really do not know how many 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:52.020
 seating all the things here have on 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:57.419
 each case a lot more than the hall 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:05:01.460
 1 this time also 15 blocks wider 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:05.990
 as the room 1 and he has much more 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:10.199
 boxing also so a curtain he has only 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:12.570
 and the best is 3d capable price 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:15.720
 kinostart her down but in addition still 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:16.820
 what boxing and yes up here again 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.050
 demonstration 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:23.120
 Here I have to start sitting down 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:25.520
 can be numbered and yes we see 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.130
 only alone in the left behind are already 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.449
 56 seats so when it's right behind 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.790
 nor his 156 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:35.240
 and then we are already as tall as that 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:40.389
 Room 1 and before that are probably only 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.389
 let's see how 150 seats look 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.350
 Here we are then in the screening room nothing 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:49.790
 special here you can the light 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:50.979
 turn off this time is so triangle 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:54.169
 moderately forward 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:59.150
 an idea of lambo sorry very nice 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:06:00.590
 made and it comes the 3d seen 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.810
 it could really be 3d 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:06.080
 It can be almost long if you like that 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:09.500
 get close so comes from Irish 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.960
 3d and roman 3d a fun that 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.970
 of course, the best of the 3d lettering 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:17.830
 express 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.830
 and yes I think it looks very cool 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:23.810
 and yes almost on the whole 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.550
 again with the cinema if it is you 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.710
 You could have liked that in me 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:30.050
 to write the comments 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:32.229
 I also hope that I am reasonably 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:38.060
 could satisfy 

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:39.320
 and if I get the texture pack more often 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.570
 should use then you can me that 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:44.300
 of course also completely write to otherwise 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:47.930
 namely my normal tv gen or again 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:49.610
 texture pack I like that, too 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:52.460
 I think it is still here 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:59.389

00:06:52.460 --> 00:07:02.030
