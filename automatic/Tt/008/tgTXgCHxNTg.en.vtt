00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:30.259 
did what I had to do um and my head was

00:04:30.259 --> 00:04:33.279 
did what I had to do um and my head was
just<00:04:30.530> in<00:04:30.949> it<00:04:31.129> so<00:04:31.970> again<00:04:32.360> this<00:04:32.539> is<00:04:32.720> just<00:04:32.930> a<00:04:33.110> prove

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
just in it so again this is just a prove

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:36.550 
just in it so again this is just a prove
a<00:04:33.319> point<00:04:33.620> that<00:04:34.210> what<00:04:35.210> once<00:04:35.780> you<00:04:36.080> really<00:04:36.409> have

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
a point that what once you really have

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.249 
a point that what once you really have
your<00:04:36.949> head<00:04:37.310> in<00:04:37.580> the<00:04:38.060> game<00:04:38.090> you<00:04:38.810> can<00:04:39.080> achieve

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:39.259 
your head in the game you can achieve

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:42.429 
your head in the game you can achieve
any<00:04:39.919> number<00:04:40.400> you<00:04:40.430> want<00:04:40.689> I<00:04:41.689> didn't<00:04:42.319> necessarily

00:04:42.429 --> 00:04:42.439 
any number you want I didn't necessarily

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:47.529 
any number you want I didn't necessarily
want<00:04:43.340> to<00:04:43.520> you<00:04:44.090> know<00:04:44.240> just<00:04:44.949> go<00:04:45.949> to<00:04:46.150> 150<00:04:47.150> pounds

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
want to you know just go to 150 pounds

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:50.529 
want to you know just go to 150 pounds
because<00:04:47.689> I'm<00:04:47.930> comfortable<00:04:48.379> between<00:04:48.770> 154<00:04:49.539> to

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
because I'm comfortable between 154 to

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.249 
because I'm comfortable between 154 to
156<00:04:51.349> but<00:04:52.129> um<00:04:52.430> again<00:04:53.090> I<00:04:53.270> said<00:04:53.900> it<00:04:54.020> I<00:04:54.080> was<00:04:54.229> like

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:54.259 
156 but um again I said it I was like

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:57.450 
156 but um again I said it I was like
I'm<00:04:54.650> doing<00:04:55.099> this<00:04:55.250> all<00:04:55.490> to<00:04:56.030> prove<00:04:56.180> a<00:04:56.210> point<00:04:56.300> and

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
I'm doing this all to prove a point and

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.689 
I'm doing this all to prove a point and
the<00:04:58.460> point<00:04:58.490> is<00:04:58.939> that<00:04:59.440> once<00:05:00.440> you<00:05:00.680> put<00:05:01.400> your<00:05:01.520> head

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
the point is that once you put your head

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:03.790 
the point is that once you put your head
in<00:05:01.849> it<00:05:01.969> and<00:05:02.150> once<00:05:02.870> you<00:05:03.020> start<00:05:03.259> doing<00:05:03.379> what<00:05:03.680> you

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
in it and once you start doing what you

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.110 
in it and once you start doing what you
have<00:05:03.979> to<00:05:04.009> do<00:05:04.569> you<00:05:05.569> could<00:05:05.750> do<00:05:05.870> it<00:05:06.020> and<00:05:06.229> obviously

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
have to do you could do it and obviously

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.890 
have to do you could do it and obviously
that's<00:05:08.120> what<00:05:08.389> I'm<00:05:08.509> doing<00:05:08.750> right<00:05:09.020> um<00:05:10.719> so<00:05:11.719> what

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
that's what I'm doing right um so what

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.499 
that's what I'm doing right um so what
else<00:05:12.080> is<00:05:12.289> new<00:05:12.379> guys<00:05:13.159> I<00:05:13.639> don't<00:05:14.180> really<00:05:14.300> have

sugar uh absolutely no snacking because
I<00:06:31.819> I<00:06:31.849> could<00:06:32.270> be<00:06:32.389> a<00:06:32.419> snapper<00:06:32.810> sometimes<00:06:33.409> which

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 
I I could be a snapper sometimes which

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.730 
I I could be a snapper sometimes which
really<00:06:34.849> is<00:06:35.029> my<00:06:35.209> downfall<00:06:35.270> of<00:06:35.990> not<00:06:36.560> losing

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:36.740 
really is my downfall of not losing

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:37.940 
really is my downfall of not losing
weight

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:37.950 
weight

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.710 
weight
and<00:06:38.040> that's<00:06:38.220> that's<00:06:38.580> basically<00:06:39.330> I'm<00:06:39.690> just

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 
and that's that's basically I'm just

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.050 
and that's that's basically I'm just
like<00:06:40.080> running<00:06:40.710> my<00:06:40.920> ass<00:06:40.950> off<00:06:41.130> to<00:06:41.460> tell<00:06:41.880> you<00:06:41.940> the

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060 
like running my ass off to tell you the

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:44.810 
like running my ass off to tell you the
truth<00:06:42.090> and<00:06:42.600> I<00:06:42.720> guess<00:06:43.380> that<00:06:44.130> has<00:06:44.310> a<00:06:44.340> big<00:06:44.580> factor

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:44.820 
truth and I guess that has a big factor

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.430 
truth and I guess that has a big factor
to<00:06:45.150> do<00:06:45.240> with<00:06:45.420> it<00:06:45.540> and<00:06:45.840> cutting<00:06:46.170> out<00:06:46.290> the

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 
to do with it and cutting out the

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.340 
to do with it and cutting out the
snacking<00:06:46.800> and<00:06:47.100> just<00:06:47.340> go<00:06:47.460> away<00:06:47.520> my<00:06:47.760> calories
