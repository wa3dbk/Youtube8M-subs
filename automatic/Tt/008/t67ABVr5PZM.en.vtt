00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.050 
okay now we're gonna try to show you how
the<00:01:35.259> stove<00:01:35.649> we're<00:01:36.249> gonna<00:01:36.369> work<00:01:36.640> we're<00:01:36.999> gonna

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
the stove we're gonna work we're gonna

00:01:37.060 --> 00:02:18.559 
the stove we're gonna work we're gonna
start<00:01:37.509> the<00:01:38.130> fire

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:27.229 

now<00:02:19.140> we<00:02:19.650> can<00:02:19.860> close<00:02:20.340> primary<00:02:21.090> air

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.800 

and<00:02:28.109> then<00:02:28.409> you're<00:02:28.769> gonna<00:02:28.920> see<00:02:29.189> the<00:02:29.370> fire

and then you're gonna see the fire

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.380 
and then you're gonna see the fire
burning<00:02:30.810> slower<00:02:31.349> because<00:02:32.310> that<00:02:32.760> preheated

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
burning slower because that preheated

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.780 
burning slower because that preheated
air<00:02:33.719> is<00:02:34.349> going<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.650> come<00:02:34.859> from<00:02:35.069> those<00:02:35.280> holes<00:02:35.579> on

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
air is going to come from those holes on

00:02:35.790 --> 00:03:11.100 
air is going to come from those holes on
the<00:02:35.879> back

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.490 

this<00:03:12.110> is<00:03:12.290> 20<00:03:12.709> minutes<00:03:13.040> later<00:03:14.080> one<00:03:15.080> is<00:03:15.200> ready

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
this is 20 minutes later one is ready

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.509 
this is 20 minutes later one is ready
for<00:03:15.590> baking

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
for baking

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:17.979 
for baking
we're<00:03:16.849> gonna<00:03:16.970> put<00:03:17.209> some<00:03:17.239> cinnamon<00:03:17.959> rolls

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
we're gonna put some cinnamon rolls

00:03:17.989 --> 00:04:22.430 
we're gonna put some cinnamon rolls
inside

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.760 

now<00:04:22.979> you<00:04:23.039> can<00:04:23.460> see<00:04:23.880> before<00:04:24.539> there<00:04:25.380> was<00:04:25.590> the

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
now you can see before there was the

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.640 
now you can see before there was the
smoke<00:04:26.220> on<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:26.789> side<00:04:27.060> of<00:04:27.240> the<00:04:27.389> fire<00:04:27.660> bricks<00:04:28.020> and

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
smoke on the side of the fire bricks and

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.810 
smoke on the side of the fire bricks and
now<00:04:29.130> after<00:04:29.370> half<00:04:29.729> hour<00:04:30.030> you<00:04:30.300> can<00:04:30.539> see<00:04:31.820> how

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
now after half hour you can see how

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:49.610 
now after half hour you can see how
queen<00:04:34.699> fire<00:04:35.699> bricks<00:04:36.000> are

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.279 

we<00:04:50.069> installed<00:04:50.460> a<00:04:50.639> stove<00:04:50.999> six<00:04:51.629> inches<00:04:52.080> away

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
we installed a stove six inches away

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:56.450 
we installed a stove six inches away
from<00:04:52.469> the<00:04:52.939> wall<00:04:53.939> because<00:04:54.719> the<00:04:55.439> wall<00:04:55.770> is<00:04:56.069> solid

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
from the wall because the wall is solid

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.499 
from the wall because the wall is solid
bricks<00:04:57.529> chimney<00:04:58.529> wall<00:04:58.740> and<00:04:59.520> then<00:04:59.999> you<00:05:00.120> can<00:05:00.300> see

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:00.509 
bricks chimney wall and then you can see

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:03.589 
bricks chimney wall and then you can see
the<00:05:00.629> temperature<00:05:01.349> behind<00:05:02.310> if<00:05:02.879> you<00:05:03.120> installed

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:03.599 
the temperature behind if you installed

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:06.619 
the temperature behind if you installed
a<00:05:03.810> drop<00:05:04.139> behind<00:05:04.409> the<00:05:04.680> drywall<00:05:05.180> that<00:05:06.180> you<00:05:06.419> have
