00:00:04.749 --> 00:00:09.620
 you called him an ashtray like 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:11.360
 put out the cigarette butts in it called him 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.070
 trash like to see it on their 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.279
 desk to throw him 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.169
 banana peel but I know whatever 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.759
 wanted to see him as your 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:22.339
 working computer 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:23.990
 new mac pro which apple announced 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:26.210
 at the end of 2013 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.609
 now selling it weighs only 5 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.640
 a kilo that is 13 kilos lighter 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.949
 predecessor and less he became eight 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.660
 once actually mac pro is possible 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:36.800
 put in a bag and carry from home to 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.199
 work and back 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.750
 it used to require one strong 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:44.510
 man and mac pro car ride 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.539
 graceful beautiful and very apple by tradition 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.980
 minimalist and he is also very small 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.690
 Mac pro looks compared to 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.760
 13 inch macbook air 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.559
 what is on the top of the case is 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.019
 ventilation system that made 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.999
 so cool that even scary like 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:00.800
 There is usually an apple icon under which 

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:02.660
 there are connectors and interfaces 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.970
 above all the entrances are located under 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.299
 headphones and speakers then go 4 ports 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.470
 usb 306 vanderbolt connectors below 2 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.420
 ethernet connector 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.210
 and here the next news will please many 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.920
 Now in mac pro there is an hdmi input and in fact 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.740
 last year's version only pleased 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.170
 marveling at the connector to the right of the hdmi button 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.479
 turning on and completes the entry 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.759
 for the power wire by the way this is exactly 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.640
 power supply wire is already built into itself 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:31.310
 mac pro its power is 450 watts 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.590
 active cooling is not all these connectors 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.899
 edged with white frames it's not easy 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.270
 so they shine and they shine 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.640
 if you move or shake it is very 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.710
 clever after all and on those stick something in yusbi 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.020
 sometimes a difficult task is very difficult and 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.969
 back to the body on it is still 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.039
 such a latch this button allows 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:51.369
 put the block on the removal of the external case 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.320
 and the case itself is removed very simply 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.689
 click and shoot under the cocoon is 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.030
 the dream of engineers perfectionists is smart and 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.219
 beautiful iron delivered big 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.350
 Part of the poppy video card takes MDF 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:04.130
 firepro of the three conditional sides they 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.810
 occupy two 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.939
 She is one of the video cards located 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.739
 ssd drive looks unusual and 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.170
 default its replacement is impossible 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.420
 about the same ssd is in mac 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.209
 air and retina but if you work 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.280
 head and handles you can take it off and 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.830
 put another plausible form 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.050
 ssd is almost impossible to find in others 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.989
 the sides are symmetrically mounted dies 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.330
 with 1806 RAM 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.489
 megahertz they easily change all major 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.380
 controllers and chipset intel xeon e5 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.420
 mounted inside a poppy on a round 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.190
 the motherboard on our mac review 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.560
 pro next configuration very 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.349
 expensive processor intel xeon e5 6 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.010
 nuclei clean and 35 gigahertz 16

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.910
 gigabytes of memory is already worth 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.100
 125,000 rubles is minimal salary naturally 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.470
 through apple site you can stuff mac pro 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.290
 more top iron maximum 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.329
 equipment is obtained such a 12 nuclear

 memory and 6 gigs and cards firepro d700 and 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:36.109
 such a monster is fabulous 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:38.180
 413 thousand two hundred seventy rubles worth 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:40.880
 also consider that the monitor is not 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.280
 keyboard no mouse not included 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.290
 all this needs to be bought in essence 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.359
 new mac pro is cheaper than the previous one 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.100
 generations yes it really is true but in 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.500
 previous versions let's mouse and 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.049
 the keyboards were included and the mac itself 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.690
 pro 2012 serves as complete sets was 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.829
 more powerful by 10 15 percent render though 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.260
 on tests inferior 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:02.060
 but first thing to consider 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.790
 Apple's professional program 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.799
 Logic pro rollers are working on a new 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.790
 about as fast or even faster for 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.980
 optimization account 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.139
 but programs from adob after 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.150
 effects example or photoshop work 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:16.760
 slightly slower than the old mac pro 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.789
 not really getting into the confusion of the state 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.680
 processor in various models 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:24.620
 a quad 3 7 gigahertz and a 12 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.070
 nuclear 27 will explain when you use 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.450
 about 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.040
 final program to work with 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.740
 graphics montage or music 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.350
 therefore all 12 cores are involved 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.090
 nuclear will be more effective 12th der even 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.680
 with fewer frequencies stronger 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.080
 quad chip with big 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.510
 in quantity but in everyday tasks 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.070
 like opening a chrome watching video or 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.390
 just climbing in the system will 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.670
 one core involved 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:49.070
 here the younger mac pro will work 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.500
 slightly faster surprising but fact 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.090
 I have conducted several tests of the new mac pro 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.340
 let's start with the most popular right now 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.560
 bincho performance geekbench 3 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.170
 Our magician pro shows three and a half 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.460
 thousands in a single-core test and 20 thousand 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.320
 multi-core glasses 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.090
 The next test is a new day. 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.290
 benchmark showed sixteen hundred 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.850
 thirty points 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.690
 well, the last performance test 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:15.680
 blue bench r15 about angel you reached 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:18.500
 79 fps results and the processor gave 967 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.510
 and the scorecards will now perform the ssd test on 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.060
 reading and writing this will help us 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.130
 black magic speedtest utility as you can 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.400
 see and create and it costs very quickly 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:30.770
 almost 800 megabytes per write and almost 1 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.500
 gigabyte per second reading is very 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.030
 quickly very quickly in this movie words 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.220
 sounds very very often 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:40.190
 but, no less, we go further 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:48.440
 its services will soon launch photoshop 1 and 7 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:51.140
 seconds now running after effects cc 7 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:54.040
 and 5 seconds so now turn on the premiere 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.040
 pro cs6 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.540
 4 and 6 seconds 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:06.280
 well, the last test run cad file about 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:07.990
 ten exactly four seconds 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.730
 let's look at now 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.100
 comparative table of tests with all 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:15.180
 versions of poppies last year’s magician chrome and 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.180
 let's summarize 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.520
 many will be interested in how mac pro 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:52.290
 will show itself in games honestly say if 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.050
 windows are not going to put that 

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:56.910
 I can’t show them very little 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.770
 tried to play new tom raider 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:00.780
 the graphics there are not the smartest 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.790
 but at the maximum settings the groups are not 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:04.800
 It was generally but it seems to me so 

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:07.470
 just can't be set yet 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.600
 bioshock infinite not disappointed game 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.880
 heavily trimmed settings can be set 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.950
 only average so let it look 

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:16.230
 all too square one can say 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:19.080
 just for the money for which mac pro 

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:20.040
 2013 hour sold can collect more 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.960
 powerful writing 

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.720
 but there will be windows and the computer itself 

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.550
 will be very big besides no 

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.950
 speech optimization cannot be 

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:30.990
 but with games everything will be much better but 

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:32.760
 mac pro is not for gaming 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:36.560
 it is designed to work on a professional 

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.560
 Software on this all bye
