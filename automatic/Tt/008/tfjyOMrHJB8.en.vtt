00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:26.100
 What would I do without your smart mouth? Drawing me in, and you kicking me out 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:34.100
 You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can not pin down 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:42.100
 What's going on in that beautiful mind I'm on your magical mystery ride 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:50.100
 And I'm so dizzy, do not know what hit me, but I'll be alright 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:58.100
 My head's under water But I'm breathing fine 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:05.100
 You're crazy and I'm out of my mind 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:19.100
 Cause all of me All your perfect imperfections 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:36.100
 Give your all to me I'll give you all my life Even when I lose I'm winning

 'Cause I give you all of me and you give me all of you, ohoh

 How many times do you know when you're crying you're beautiful too 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:14.100
 The world is beating you down, You're my downfall, you're my muse 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:25.100
 My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues I can not stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:40.900
 My head's under water But I'm breathing fine You're crazy and I'm out of my mind 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:56.900
 Cause all of me All your perfect imperfections 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:11.900
 Give your all to me I'll give you all my life Even when I lose I'm winning 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:27.900
 'Cause I give you all of me and you give me all of you, ohoh 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:42.900
