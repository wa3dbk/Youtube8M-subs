00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.070
 Hello Love 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.320
 Today there are cold dog also known 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.900
 as cold snout black peter or 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.680
 Lucullus all goes without we bake 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.020
 but do not prepare the 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:26.330
 standard execution but a colorful 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:30.769
 variant to we need for couverture 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:33.600
 whole milk and bittersweet cocoa fat cacau 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.340
 icing sugar perfectly butter biscuits 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.340
 but could also take normal 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.149
 It was best said the little ones too 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.430
 go big 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.930
 pistachios and dried cranberries 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.829
 First we had the curve door roughly 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.690
 the whole milk as well as the bitter did 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.090
 and then add it to a bowl 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.070
 something crushed coconut fat everything 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.260
 now comes from Wasserbad and will be there 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.660
 and occasionally stir melted 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.350
 then remove from the stove and cool slightly 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.809
 to let 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.049
 in a bowl we admit in eggs 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.390
 the powdered sugar the cocoa powder and 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.880
 stir everything with the whisk of the 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.070
 thoroughly and with each other 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.840
 please so long and that can already 45 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.119
 minutes to go until the mass of 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.400
 dark brown in light brown has discolored 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.860
 and now we add in a rather thin one 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.369
 beam the previously molten one 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.860
 chocolate and stir this one 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.420
 then the keys to keep warm 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.350
 low temperature again on the 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.780
 water bath 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.350
 we only prepare the biscuits to that 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.350
 means we crush and process 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.759
 then the same with the business 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.110
 and whether he does it with his hands or with his 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.770
 makes the knife is very quiet 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.030
 leave 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.760
 we put a box shape with front 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.050
 turn off the slide and notice that 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.380
 that is not so easy and 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.600
 That's why we make them wet and voila 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.970
 concluded afterwards it works 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.770
 much easier and what comes next is 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.170
 actually diligence we start with 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.700
 fill the layers to the underside 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.710
 layer the chocolate mass 1 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.080
 By the way, a short note should you 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.100
 This gets too thick is just something 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.990
 warm water 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.060
 Do not joke on the chocolate layer 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.720
 we distribute it then pieces of the then 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.489
 seen as well as cranberries and 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:24.550
 pistachios and then everything starts from 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:27.620
 biscuits the cranberries and 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.450
 pistachios and just a layer after 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.580
 the other to the last 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.560
 chocolate mass is distributed and also 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.390
 on the top we decorate the 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.950
 cold dog just like we do in the 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.110
 I made fresh layers 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.000
 I 'm happy because now the woman has to 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.470
 Merkel be made for 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.120
 at least four hours 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.280
 and then we have the 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.020
 fresh foil first on the edge and 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.860
 can then easily the cake 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.780
 single out 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.880
 We also remove the remaining film 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.010
 and then serve 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.200
 I really like this version very much 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.580
 everything fits well and also tastes good 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.950
 great for each other 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.030
 I wish you a lot of fun with the 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.380
 preparation and a pretty good appetite 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.030
 and if you have another variant 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.180
 rather, for example, a special one is preferable 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.040
 fruity or one with ios then looks 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.590
 but just into these videos 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.870
 and if not already done 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.540
 Of course, I am very happy about yours 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.370
 but I still have to say until the 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.430
 next time 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.430
 bye Bye
