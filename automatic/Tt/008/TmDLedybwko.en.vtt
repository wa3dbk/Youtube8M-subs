can choose between us here Japan and

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.430 
can choose between us here Japan and
Spain<00:00:34.940> basically<00:00:35.690> all<00:00:35.840> that<00:00:35.930> is<00:00:35.989> is<00:00:36.140> pretty

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
Spain basically all that is is pretty

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.840 
Spain basically all that is is pretty
much<00:00:36.620> the<00:00:36.770> language<00:00:36.950> of<00:00:37.250> the<00:00:37.310> game<00:00:37.430> and<00:00:37.700> stuff

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
much the language of the game and stuff

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.790 
much the language of the game and stuff
like<00:00:38.000> that<00:00:38.210> although<00:00:38.750> for<00:00:39.410> me<00:00:39.500> you<00:00:39.620> know<00:00:39.739> if

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
like that although for me you know if

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.260 
like that although for me you know if
the<00:00:39.950> spin<00:00:40.220> one<00:00:40.460> seems<00:00:40.790> to<00:00:40.940> come<00:00:41.090> up<00:00:41.120> with

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
the spin one seems to come up with

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:42.490 
the spin one seems to come up with
English<00:00:41.630> language<00:00:42.020> all<00:00:42.170> the<00:00:42.260> time<00:00:42.290> just

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
English language all the time just

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.060 
English language all the time just
Spanish<00:00:43.100> and<00:00:43.610> voice<00:00:43.880> actors<00:00:44.239> anyway<00:00:45.140> this<00:00:45.649> 15

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
Spanish and voice actors anyway this 15

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.680 
Spanish and voice actors anyway this 15
characters<00:00:46.520> to<00:00:46.579> choose<00:00:46.640> from<00:00:46.820> this<00:00:47.090> time<00:00:47.360> with

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
characters to choose from this time with

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.810 
characters to choose from this time with
one<00:00:47.870> extra<00:00:48.110> or<00:00:48.320> lock<00:00:48.590> using<00:00:49.070> the<00:00:49.160> chord<00:00:49.399> source

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
one extra or lock using the chord source

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.860 
one extra or lock using the chord source
that's<00:00:50.210> pretty<00:00:50.420> cool

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
that's pretty cool

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.380 
that's pretty cool
the<00:00:51.440> only<00:00:51.590> problem<00:00:51.950> is<00:00:52.100> this<00:00:52.399> time<00:00:52.670> around<00:00:52.700> the

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
the only problem is this time around the

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.420 
the only problem is this time around the
game<00:00:53.570> feels<00:00:53.930> very<00:00:54.200> unbalanced<00:00:55.040> a<00:00:55.130> lot<00:00:55.280> of<00:00:55.370> the

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
game feels very unbalanced a lot of the

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.580 
game feels very unbalanced a lot of the
characters<00:00:55.969> don't<00:00:56.300> feel<00:00:56.600> either<00:00:56.899> as<00:00:57.110> powerful

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
characters don't feel either as powerful

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.260 
characters don't feel either as powerful
as<00:00:57.680> what<00:00:57.829> they<00:00:57.920> used<00:00:58.100> to<00:00:58.250> be<00:00:58.370> or<00:00:58.910> it's<00:00:59.210> just

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
as what they used to be or it's just

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.700 
as what they used to be or it's just
that<00:00:59.570> the<00:00:59.660> new<00:00:59.809> characters<00:01:00.350> are<00:01:00.380> more

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
that the new characters are more

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.580 
that the new characters are more
powerful<00:01:00.920> so<00:01:01.550> it's<00:01:01.820> a<00:01:01.879> bit<00:01:02.000> annoying

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
powerful so it's a bit annoying

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.229 
powerful so it's a bit annoying
this<00:01:03.590> is<00:01:03.890> or<00:01:04.040> it's<00:01:04.280> pretty<00:01:04.519> much<00:01:04.610> a<00:01:04.670> CMV<00:01:05.210> and

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
this is or it's pretty much a CMV and

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.029 
this is or it's pretty much a CMV and
player<00:01:05.540> call<00:01:05.960> point<00:01:06.140> is<00:01:06.290> to<00:01:06.469> win<00:01:06.500> two<00:01:06.829> rounds

00:01:07.029 --> 00:01:07.039 
player call point is to win two rounds

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:08.410 
player call point is to win two rounds
if<00:01:07.340> you<00:01:07.459> win<00:01:07.609> -<00:01:07.759> why<00:01:07.939> don't<00:01:08.060> you<00:01:08.119> go<00:01:08.240> to<00:01:08.299> the

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
if you win - why don't you go to the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.179 
if you win - why don't you go to the
next<00:01:08.630> fight<00:01:08.840> you<00:01:09.079> get<00:01:09.229> some<00:01:09.350> story<00:01:09.679> scenes<00:01:10.009> if

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
next fight you get some story scenes if

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:11.770 
next fight you get some story scenes if

00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:15.499 
yeah that's pretty much the whole gist

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:17.469

the<00:01:30.380> same<00:01:30.590> reason<00:01:30.889> this<00:01:30.950> is<00:01:31.069> last<00:01:31.249> time<00:01:31.490> not

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
the same reason this is last time not

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.550 
the same reason this is last time not
only<00:01:32.179> is<00:01:32.270> it<00:01:32.359> too<00:01:32.539> hard<00:01:32.779> to<00:01:32.959> set<00:01:33.079> up<00:01:33.139> double

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
only is it too hard to set up double

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.410 
only is it too hard to set up double
cures<00:01:33.829> it's<00:01:34.429> the<00:01:34.700> type<00:01:34.880> of<00:01:34.909> thing<00:01:35.060> that's<00:01:35.299> a

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
cures it's the type of thing that's a

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.999 
cures it's the type of thing that's a
quite<00:01:35.779> cool<00:01:36.020> to<00:01:36.049> see<00:01:36.289> it<00:01:36.349> for<00:01:36.499> the<00:01:36.560> first<00:01:36.590> time

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
quite cool to see it for the first time

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:38.230 
quite cool to see it for the first time
like<00:01:37.279> through<00:01:37.490> your<00:01:37.609> own<00:01:37.729> eyes<00:01:37.880> whilst

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
like through your own eyes whilst

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.069 
like through your own eyes whilst
playing<00:01:38.479> again

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
playing again

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:41.679 
playing again
so<00:01:40.009> new<00:01:40.459> things<00:01:40.789> are<00:01:40.939> pretty<00:01:41.119> much<00:01:41.270> the<00:01:41.509> power

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
so new things are pretty much the power

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:43.899 
so new things are pretty much the power
meter<00:01:41.899> that's<00:01:42.590> slightly<00:01:43.039> different<00:01:43.520> now<00:01:43.639> the

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
meter that's slightly different now the

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.339 
meter that's slightly different now the
whole<00:01:44.060> point<00:01:44.270> of<00:01:44.389> the<00:01:44.479> power<00:01:44.689> meter<00:01:44.869> was<00:01:45.170> if

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:45.349 
whole point of the power meter was if

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:47.050 
whole point of the power meter was if
you've<00:01:45.469> got<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.740> crap<00:01:46.069> kicked<00:01:46.099> out<00:01:46.490> here<00:01:46.789> you

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
you've got the crap kicked out here you

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.609 
you've got the crap kicked out here you
get<00:01:47.299> angry<00:01:47.630> and<00:01:47.869> you<00:01:47.959> become<00:01:48.200> a<00:01:48.229> bit<00:01:48.439> more

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
get angry and you become a bit more

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.580 
get angry and you become a bit more
powerful<00:01:48.950> and<00:01:49.509> well<00:01:50.509> you'd<00:01:51.020> be<00:01:51.259> a<00:01:51.289> bit<00:01:51.439> more

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
powerful and well you'd be a bit more

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:52.599 
powerful and well you'd be a bit more
pop<00:01:51.770> up<00:01:51.919> a<00:01:52.039> little<00:01:52.189> bit

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:52.609 
pop up a little bit

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:54.459 
pop up a little bit
now<00:01:53.149> you<00:01:53.209> can<00:01:53.599> actually<00:01:53.719> pull<00:01:54.049> up<00:01:54.079> a<00:01:54.229> special

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469 
now you can actually pull up a special

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:55.779 
now you can actually pull up a special
move<00:01:54.799> which<00:01:55.069> if<00:01:55.219> you<00:01:55.310> look<00:01:55.429> in<00:01:55.549> the<00:01:55.639> bottom

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
move which if you look in the bottom

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.519 
move which if you look in the bottom
right<00:01:56.060> corner<00:01:56.090> even<00:01:56.719> though<00:01:56.959> he's<00:01:57.079> a<00:01:57.109> computer

00:01:57.519 --> 00:01:57.529 
right corner even though he's a computer

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:58.450 
right corner even though he's a computer
but

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
but

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.190 
but
or<00:01:58.760> that<00:01:58.909> he's<00:01:59.000> got<00:01:59.180> a<00:01:59.210> push<00:01:59.479> like<00:01:59.750> the<00:01:59.900> button

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
or that he's got a push like the button

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.750 
or that he's got a push like the button
press<00:02:00.440> ins<00:02:00.710> and<00:02:01.010> I<00:02:01.070> like<00:02:01.220> that<00:02:01.369> he's<00:02:01.520> got<00:02:01.700> a

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
press ins and I like that he's got a

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.670 
press ins and I like that he's got a
push<00:02:02.030> in<00:02:02.180> order<00:02:02.360> to<00:02:02.450> pull<00:02:02.600> it<00:02:02.690> off<00:02:02.810> come<00:02:03.110> on<00:02:03.140> and

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
push in order to pull it off come on and

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.680 
push in order to pull it off come on and
basically<00:02:04.130> if<00:02:04.670> you<00:02:04.790> manage<00:02:05.060> to<00:02:05.150> pull<00:02:05.360> that<00:02:05.479> off

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
basically if you manage to pull that off

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.600 
basically if you manage to pull that off
and<00:02:05.900> your<00:02:06.140> opponent<00:02:06.530> doesn't<00:02:06.680> block<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:06.979> then

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
and your opponent doesn't block it then

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.010 
and your opponent doesn't block it then
it<00:02:07.760> knocks<00:02:07.940> the<00:02:08.149> weapon<00:02:08.450> off<00:02:08.539> him<00:02:08.720> straight

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
it knocks the weapon off him straight

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.719 
it knocks the weapon off him straight
away<00:02:09.140> last<00:02:09.649> time<00:02:09.830> obviously<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.429> only<00:02:10.580> way

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
away last time obviously the only way

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.309 
away last time obviously the only way
are<00:02:10.910> really<00:02:11.150> not<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.420> weapon<00:02:11.690> outlet<00:02:11.990> was<00:02:12.170> the

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
are really not the weapon outlet was the

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.350 
are really not the weapon outlet was the
wheel<00:02:12.500> on<00:02:12.709> them<00:02:12.860> for<00:02:13.040> ages<00:02:13.160> now<00:02:13.910> you<00:02:13.970> can<00:02:14.209> just

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
wheel on them for ages now you can just

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.100 
wheel on them for ages now you can just
hear<00:02:14.480> that<00:02:14.660> move

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
hear that move

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.960 
hear that move
it's<00:02:15.739> wonderful<00:02:16.190> to<00:02:16.250> new<00:02:16.430> things<00:02:16.730> which<00:02:16.880> I

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
it's wonderful to new things which I

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.370 
it's wonderful to new things which I
don't<00:02:17.120> particularly<00:02:17.480> like<00:02:17.750> because<00:02:18.020> it<00:02:18.170> seems

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
don't particularly like because it seems

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.280 
don't particularly like because it seems
a<00:02:18.500> little<00:02:18.620> cheap<00:02:19.040> because<00:02:19.430> I<00:02:19.940> mean<00:02:20.600> why<00:02:20.989> should

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
a little cheap because I mean why should

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.930 
a little cheap because I mean why should
any<00:02:21.560> move<00:02:21.860> I<00:02:22.010> don't<00:02:22.069> care<00:02:22.489> if<00:02:22.580> you're<00:02:22.700> supposed

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
any move I don't care if you're supposed

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.330 
any move I don't care if you're supposed
to<00:02:23.060> be<00:02:23.209> angry<00:02:23.600> and<00:02:23.750> more<00:02:23.900> powerful<00:02:24.440> at<00:02:25.069> all

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
to be angry and more powerful at all

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.309 
to be angry and more powerful at all
it's<00:02:25.700> just<00:02:25.850> why<00:02:26.180> should<00:02:26.360> any<00:02:26.569> move<00:02:26.810> be<00:02:27.050> able<00:02:27.230> to

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
it's just why should any move be able to

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.340 
it's just why should any move be able to
do<00:02:27.440> that<00:02:27.730> just<00:02:28.730> a<00:02:28.819> little<00:02:29.030> cheap<00:02:29.270> but<00:02:29.630> as<00:02:30.080> I<00:02:30.110> see

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
do that just a little cheap but as I see

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.780 
do that just a little cheap but as I see
everyone's<00:02:30.709> different<00:02:31.130> so<00:02:31.160> mobile<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.640> type

wall jumps a hell of a lot easier now
like<00:03:05.480> it's<00:03:05.660> a<00:03:05.720> lot<00:03:05.870> more<00:03:06.019> sensitive<00:03:06.380> I'm

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829

like it's a lot more sensitive I'm
pretty<00:03:07.130> sure<00:03:07.280> you<00:03:07.370> could<00:03:07.489> do<00:03:07.640> walls<00:03:07.880> before<00:03:08.239> if

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
pretty sure you could do walls before if

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.569 
pretty sure you could do walls before if
not<00:03:08.840> they're<00:03:08.989> not<00:03:09.140> something<00:03:09.320> you<00:03:09.560> and<00:03:09.829> by<00:03:10.549> the

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
not they're not something you and by the

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.160 
not they're not something you and by the
way<00:03:10.760> it's<00:03:10.970> all<00:03:11.120> these<00:03:11.269> things<00:03:11.630> that<00:03:11.900> I<00:03:11.930> don't

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
way it's all these things that I don't

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.900 
way it's all these things that I don't
particularly<00:03:12.440> like<00:03:12.590> about<00:03:12.739> them<00:03:13.160> because

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
particularly like about them because

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.580 
particularly like about them because
sometimes<00:03:14.510> you're<00:03:14.750> palling<00:03:14.959> can<00:03:15.230> just<00:03:15.380> spend

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
sometimes you're palling can just spend

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.890 
sometimes you're palling can just spend
the<00:03:15.739> entire<00:03:16.100> match<00:03:16.340> crouching<00:03:16.880> and<00:03:17.000> when<00:03:17.810> the

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
the entire match crouching and when the

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.840 
the entire match crouching and when the
crouch<00:03:18.140> it's<00:03:18.470> hard<00:03:18.680> to<00:03:18.829> hit<00:03:19.010> them<00:03:19.220> when<00:03:19.760> you

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
crouch it's hard to hit them when you

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.310 
crouch it's hard to hit them when you
jump<00:03:20.090> at<00:03:20.269> them<00:03:20.390> and<00:03:20.540> try<00:03:20.660> to<00:03:20.690> attack<00:03:21.049> them<00:03:21.260> you

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
jump at them and try to attack them you

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.780 
jump at them and try to attack them you
pretty<00:03:21.680> much<00:03:21.799> can't<00:03:22.130> because<00:03:22.519> they're

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
pretty much can't because they're

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.550 
pretty much can't because they're
crouched<00:03:23.209> and<00:03:23.390> the<00:03:23.870> end<00:03:24.019> off<00:03:24.170> manage<00:03:24.410> and

just<00:03:28.760> cheapens<00:03:29.000> it

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
just cheapens it

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.900 
just cheapens it
the<00:03:29.930> running<00:03:30.260> and<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:30.739> wall<00:03:31.100> jumping<00:03:31.549> because

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
the running and the wall jumping because

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.460 
the running and the wall jumping because
it's<00:03:32.239> like<00:03:32.570> the<00:03:32.780> type<00:03:32.959> of<00:03:32.989> thing<00:03:33.260> that<00:03:33.290> you're

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
it's like the type of thing that you're

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.960 
it's like the type of thing that you're
gonna<00:03:33.590> accidentally<00:03:34.250> get<00:03:34.430> some<00:03:34.610> points

can actually jump up a Surya what can

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.680 
can actually jump up a Surya what can
London<00:03:48.740> do<00:03:48.830> a<00:03:48.860> fireball<00:03:49.400> and<00:03:49.670> on<00:03:50.060> this<00:03:50.270> you<00:03:50.480> try

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
London do a fireball and on this you try

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.240 
London do a fireball and on this you try
and<00:03:50.870> do<00:03:50.990> it<00:03:51.140> you<00:03:51.260> do<00:03:51.350> a<00:03:51.380> wall<00:03:51.620> jumping<00:03:52.010> you<00:03:52.100> end

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
and do it you do a wall jumping you end

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.370 
and do it you do a wall jumping you end
off<00:03:52.400> jumping<00:03:52.940> in<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:53.390> way<00:03:53.570> of<00:03:53.870> another<00:03:54.140> attack

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
off jumping in the way of another attack

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.800 
off jumping in the way of another attack
so<00:03:55.190> it's<00:03:55.340> just<00:03:55.430> a<00:03:55.580> few<00:03:55.730> things<00:03:55.790> that<00:03:56.300> I<00:03:56.330> don't

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
so it's just a few things that I don't

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.720 
so it's just a few things that I don't
like<00:03:56.990> about<00:03:57.140> the<00:03:57.380> p.m.<00:03:57.620> at<00:03:57.830> all<00:03:58.100> personally<00:03:58.670> I

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
like about the p.m. at all personally I

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.250 
like about the p.m. at all personally I
think<00:03:58.850> the<00:03:59.090> first<00:03:59.360> one<00:03:59.540> was<00:03:59.600> much<00:03:59.960> better

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
think the first one was much better

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.640 
think the first one was much better
especially<00:04:00.860> is<00:04:01.460> this<00:04:01.610> one<00:04:01.850> like<00:04:02.540> well<00:04:03.380> as<00:04:03.560> I

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
especially is this one like well as I

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.290 
especially is this one like well as I
said<00:04:03.830> not<00:04:03.980> only<00:04:04.040> does<00:04:04.250> it<00:04:04.400> change<00:04:04.760> all<00:04:05.120> the

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
said not only does it change all the

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:06.670 
said not only does it change all the
loads<00:04:05.690> of<00:04:05.750> things<00:04:05.930> and<00:04:06.230> personally<00:04:06.620> I<00:04:06.650> think

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
loads of things and personally I think

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.800 
loads of things and personally I think
the<00:04:06.920> for<00:04:07.040> the<00:04:07.100> bag<00:04:07.280> it<00:04:07.790> doesn't<00:04:08.180> fix<00:04:08.390> us<00:04:08.570> Lord

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
the for the bag it doesn't fix us Lord

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.720 
the for the bag it doesn't fix us Lord
I'll<00:04:08.900> probably<00:04:09.140> ask<00:04:09.530> one<00:04:09.770> heart<00:04:09.950> as<00:04:10.430> you<00:04:10.580> can

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
I'll probably ask one heart as you can

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
much slow down for that much damage it

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.690 
much slow down for that much damage it
should<00:04:20.690> be<00:04:20.810> less<00:04:21.020> but<00:04:21.890> anyway<00:04:22.220> like<00:04:22.400> pretty
