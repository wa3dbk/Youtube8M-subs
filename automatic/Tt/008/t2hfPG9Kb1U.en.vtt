00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 greetings to all the friends of news.it vi 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.330
 you will be wondering what for you today 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.900
 it's good I tell myself right away 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.200
 first nokia lumia 625 is not 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.089
 this is the video review but me 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.190
 it serves precisely to make you see a moment 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:21.119
 that this thing we have left 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:25.039
 it works it's a battery 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:29.880
 external of the verbatim you sent us 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:33.750
 kindly 5,200 milian capacity for 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.149
 so really a very long one 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.510
 autonomy when connected to one 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.649
 smartphone or tablet 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.600
 I'll immediately see what 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.079
 contains in the packaging first the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:51.000
 cable that allows the connection 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.469
 but precisely to the real battery e 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.039
 in the meantime we don't keep the 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:59.609
 pack that also contains the le 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.579
 instructions as you can see once 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.519
 connected lights up let's say one of 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.070
 these four little lights that 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.930
 they indicate 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.580
 let's say up and down the percentage of 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.470
 I'm uploading right now 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:17.000
 used to load my galaxy first 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:19.240
 s2 loaded me completely like 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.940
 you can see we have two usb ports 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.250
 and then a door to insert this 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:29.780
 cable in the case of charging 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.880
 connecting it to the PC 5,200 milian for real 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.140
 that is, they were really very useful 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.550
 I'll show you immediately how 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.810
 it works 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:41.869
 here it is here by clicking on this button 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:44.840
 let's say it serves to verify how much to 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:52.250
 what percentage is the battery you see 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:54.229
 by connecting it here the phone is on 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.759
 charge took a few seconds 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.289
 however, it is almost too low 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.759
 battery because I used it all 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:04.070
 the day 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:07.130
 what to tell you to top up 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.090
 it's complete so it really works 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.070
 well 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.040
 I went away the other day 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.110
 are carried below also works on 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.490
 galaxy s ii I'll show unless 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.320
 let's not discharge in the meantime we hope 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:24.530
 no as you can see it lights up 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:27.590
 right away and then you can see that yes 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.990
 is in charge is really one 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.630
 very long duration among other things yesterday in the 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.850
 I used it live while I was 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.600
 speaking and think that I had the aipa da 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:41.080
 about 20 percent of 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.370
 charge by connecting it secretly between 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.980
 Quotation marks have reached 60 percent 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:51.100
 so during the live really well 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:55.780
 done in verbatim very comfortable to carry 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:58.570
 around and I really liked it 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:02.830
 so this is all for this 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:05.440

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.110
 norton mobile security 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:21.670
