it's<00:00:44.370> good<00:00:44.579> because<00:00:44.760> otherwise<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.840> wouldn't

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
it's good because otherwise I wouldn't

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.840 
it's good because otherwise I wouldn't
be<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.289> team<00:00:46.410> if<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.680> was<00:00:46.829> JV<00:00:47.610> player

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
be on the team if I was JV player

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.950 
be on the team if I was JV player
initially<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.300> wouldn't<00:00:48.600> have<00:00:48.690> been<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:48.899> the

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
initially I wouldn't have been on the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.779 
initially I wouldn't have been on the
team<00:00:49.079> at<00:00:49.200> all<00:00:49.320> so<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.860> guess<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.550> wouldn't<00:00:50.730> be

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789
