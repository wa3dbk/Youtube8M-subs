00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:04.100 

hey<00:00:02.639> everybody<00:00:03.000> so<00:00:03.389> in<00:00:03.510> this<00:00:03.629> one<00:00:03.810> we're<00:00:03.990> going

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
hey everybody so in this one we're going

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.889 
hey everybody so in this one we're going
to<00:00:04.170> talk<00:00:04.350> about<00:00:04.529> some<00:00:04.830> fiber<00:00:05.069> optics<00:00:05.640> I've<00:00:06.629> got

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
to talk about some fiber optics I've got

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.770 
to talk about some fiber optics I've got
the<00:00:07.140> yellow<00:00:07.560> LED<00:00:07.890> wired<00:00:08.550> in<00:00:08.910> however<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.540> blue

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
the yellow LED wired in however the blue

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.009 
the yellow LED wired in however the blue
ones<00:00:10.050> are<00:00:10.500> only<00:00:10.889> temporary<00:00:11.639> just<00:00:12.540> see<00:00:12.870> how

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
ones are only temporary just see how

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.079 
ones are only temporary just see how
those<00:00:13.290> look<00:00:13.559> so<00:00:13.620> they<00:00:14.070> may<00:00:14.280> flicker<00:00:14.580> out<00:00:14.820> if<00:00:14.969> I

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
those look so they may flicker out if I

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.840 
those look so they may flicker out if I
move<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.450> model<00:00:15.809> around<00:00:16.340> so<00:00:17.340> here's<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.670> little

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
move the model around so here's a little

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.029 
move the model around so here's a little
strand<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.420> fiber<00:00:18.570> optic<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:19.590> cut<00:00:20.010> off

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
strand of fiber optic that I cut off

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.400 
strand of fiber optic that I cut off
this<00:00:20.400> huge<00:00:20.699> spool<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.480> got<00:00:21.869> this<00:00:22.080> from<00:00:22.350> the

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
this huge spool I got this from the

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.980 
this huge spool I got this from the
fiber<00:00:22.740> optics<00:00:23.250> store<00:00:23.490> on<00:00:23.699> eBay

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
fiber optics store on eBay

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.759 
fiber optics store on eBay
it's<00:00:25.350> also<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.890> fiber<00:00:26.160> optic<00:00:26.699> store.com<00:00:27.769> so

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
it's also the fiber optic store.com so

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.519 
it's also the fiber optic store.com so
this<00:00:29.220> was<00:00:29.400> seventy-five<00:00:30.150> feet<00:00:30.689> at<00:00:31.109> one

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
this was seventy-five feet at one

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.910 
this was seventy-five feet at one
millimeter<00:00:32.040> which<00:00:33.030> was<00:00:33.930> really<00:00:34.410> cheap<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
millimeter which was really cheap the

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.010 
millimeter which was really cheap the
same<00:00:35.160> amount<00:00:35.489> from<00:00:35.730> PLAs<00:00:36.059> truck<00:00:36.450> who<00:00:36.690> are<00:00:36.840> the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
same amount from PLAs truck who are the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.170 
same amount from PLAs truck who are the
only<00:00:37.170> other<00:00:37.590> provider<00:00:38.129> I<00:00:38.280> found<00:00:38.730> would<00:00:39.030> have

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
only other provider I found would have

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.319 
only other provider I found would have
cost<00:00:39.420> three<00:00:40.079> or<00:00:40.170> four<00:00:40.379> times<00:00:40.680> as<00:00:40.950> much<00:00:41.300> so<00:00:42.300> a

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
cost three or four times as much so a

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.380 
cost three or four times as much so a
really<00:00:43.230> good<00:00:43.410> deal<00:00:43.620> on<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.370> guess<00:00:45.030> fiber

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
really good deal on that I guess fiber

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.350 
really good deal on that I guess fiber
optic<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:45.989> fiber<00:00:46.260> optic<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.070> works<00:00:47.360> and

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
optic is fiber optic and it works and

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.920 
optic is fiber optic and it works and
that's<00:00:48.510> what<00:00:48.750> matters<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:50.600> basically<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
that's what matters so basically the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.660 
that's what matters so basically the
idea<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.770> put<00:00:52.949> light<00:00:53.160> at<00:00:53.309> one<00:00:53.489> end

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
idea is that you put light at one end

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.540 
idea is that you put light at one end
comes<00:00:54.329> out<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.690> other<00:00:54.809> end<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.460> depending<00:00:56.460> on

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
comes out the other end and depending on

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.209 
comes out the other end and depending on
where<00:00:56.969> on<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.750> light<00:00:57.930> source<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.559> get<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:59.039> and

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
where on the light source you get it and

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.569 
where on the light source you get it and
how<00:00:59.370> close<00:00:59.820> will<00:01:00.420> change<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.989> intensity<00:01:01.579> so

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
how close will change the intensity so

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.280 
how close will change the intensity so
here's<00:01:02.910> off<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.480> side<00:01:03.719> at<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.080> base<00:01:04.260> of

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
here's off to the side at the base of

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.190 
here's off to the side at the base of
the<00:01:04.619> LED<00:01:05.070> as<00:01:05.339> opposed<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.150> directly<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.900> the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
the LED as opposed to directly on the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.050 
the LED as opposed to directly on the
front<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:10.220> what<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.250> found<00:01:11.520> also<00:01:11.850> in

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
front of it what I found also in

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.450 
front of it what I found also in
previous<00:01:12.689> uses<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.860> if<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.220> put<00:01:14.430> a

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
previous uses is that if you put a

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.340 
previous uses is that if you put a
little<00:01:14.610> sharpie<00:01:15.240> on<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.600> edge<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:16.080> will

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
little sharpie on the edge that will

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.600 
little sharpie on the edge that will
change<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:17.009> color

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
change the color

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.749 
change the color
I<00:01:17.720> discovered<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.869> because<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:20.340> was<00:01:20.490> using

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
I discovered that because I was using

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.090 
I discovered that because I was using
some<00:01:21.210> shrink<00:01:21.630> tube<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.259> hold<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:22.770> which<00:01:23.070> is

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
some shrink tube to hold it on which is

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.120 
some shrink tube to hold it on which is
the<00:01:23.369> basic<00:01:23.729> idea<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:25.080> had<00:01:25.229> used<00:01:25.470> yellow<00:01:25.950> on

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
the basic idea and I had used yellow on

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.280 
the basic idea and I had used yellow on
white<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.939> lights<00:01:27.600> were<00:01:27.810> coming<00:01:27.840> out

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
white and the lights were coming out

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.969 
white and the lights were coming out
kind<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.710> yellowish<00:01:29.240> so<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:31.049> only<00:01:31.439> have<00:01:31.590> white

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
kind of yellowish so you only have white

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.830 
kind of yellowish so you only have white
LEDs<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:32.790> want<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.090> change<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.509> color<00:01:33.720> of

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
LEDs and you want to change the color of

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.380 
LEDs and you want to change the color of
your<00:01:33.990> fiber<00:01:34.290> optics<00:01:34.829> go<00:01:35.759> ahead<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.180> put<00:01:36.360> some

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
your fiber optics go ahead and put some

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.050 
your fiber optics go ahead and put some
sharpie<00:01:36.990> on<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.290> edges<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.220> that<00:01:38.880> will

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
sharpie on the edges of it and that will

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.620 
sharpie on the edges of it and that will
transmit<00:01:39.540> along<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.229> length<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.270> basic

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
transmit along the length so the basic

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.700 
transmit along the length so the basic
idea<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:44.810> pulled<00:01:45.810> out<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.170> model<00:01:46.560> so

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
idea is to I pulled out this model so

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.649 
idea is to I pulled out this model so
I've<00:01:46.799> done<00:01:47.009> some<00:01:47.070> more<00:01:47.460> fiber<00:01:47.759> optics<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.420> this

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
I've done some more fiber optics on this

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.910 
I've done some more fiber optics on this
then<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.710> have<00:01:49.740> on<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.310> cylon<00:01:50.790> here

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
then I have on the cylon here

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.630 
then I have on the cylon here
so<00:01:52.520> the<00:01:52.640> idea<00:01:52.940> is<00:01:53.120> that<00:01:53.650> and<00:01:54.650> here's<00:01:55.280> a<00:01:55.370> bunch

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
so the idea is that and here's a bunch

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.520 
so the idea is that and here's a bunch
all<00:01:56.270> rolled<00:01:56.870> up<00:01:57.110> right<00:01:57.590> here<00:01:59.050> get<00:02:00.050> as<00:02:00.170> much<00:02:00.320> as

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
all rolled up right here get as much as

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.270 
all rolled up right here get as much as
you<00:02:00.560> can<00:02:01.119> twist<00:02:02.119> it<00:02:02.300> up<00:02:02.420> put<00:02:03.320> an<00:02:03.440> LED<00:02:03.590> at<00:02:04.040> one

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
you can twist it up put an LED at one

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.760 
you can twist it up put an LED at one
end<00:02:04.460> put<00:02:05.330> a<00:02:05.360> piece<00:02:05.570> of<00:02:05.600> shrink<00:02:05.990> tube<00:02:06.200> over<00:02:06.619> it

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
end put a piece of shrink tube over it

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.130 
end put a piece of shrink tube over it
shrink<00:02:07.430> the<00:02:07.580> shrink<00:02:07.610> tube<00:02:08.060> and<00:02:08.420> you'll<00:02:08.929> get

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
shrink the shrink tube and you'll get

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.920 
shrink the shrink tube and you'll get
power<00:02:09.440> I<00:02:09.860> don't<00:02:10.520> have<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:11.060> power<00:02:11.240> supply<00:02:11.480> for

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930

this<00:02:12.020> one<00:02:12.260> handy<00:02:13.750> another<00:02:14.750> technique<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:15.260> do

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
this one handy another technique you do

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.550 
this one handy another technique you do
is<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:16.490> stick<00:02:16.970> it<00:02:17.120> all<00:02:17.240> out<00:02:17.480> of<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.750> edges<00:02:18.140> here

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
is to stick it all out of the edges here

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.010 
is to stick it all out of the edges here
after<00:02:19.520> you've<00:02:19.670> fully<00:02:19.910> painted<00:02:20.300> your<00:02:20.600> model

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
after you've fully painted your model

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.110 
after you've fully painted your model
you're<00:02:21.739> going<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:21.980> trim<00:02:22.250> this<00:02:22.430> down<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:23.000> the

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
you're going to trim this down to the

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.660 
you're going to trim this down to the
edge<00:02:23.270> so<00:02:24.050> this<00:02:24.650> will<00:02:24.860> protect<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.430> light

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
edge so this will protect the light

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.400 
edge so this will protect the light
source<00:02:26.000> from<00:02:26.209> getting<00:02:26.570> any<00:02:26.720> paint<00:02:27.020> on<00:02:27.230> it

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
source from getting any paint on it

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.490 
source from getting any paint on it
until<00:02:27.709> you're<00:02:27.860> absolutely<00:02:28.070> ready<00:02:29.290> and<00:02:30.290> see

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
until you're absolutely ready and see

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.320 
until you're absolutely ready and see
here<00:02:30.739> that<00:02:30.920> these<00:02:31.130> kind<00:02:31.430> of<00:02:31.489> curled<00:02:31.820> up<00:02:32.060> and

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
here that these kind of curled up and

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.180 
here that these kind of curled up and
that's<00:02:32.510> because<00:02:32.930> I<00:02:33.110> was<00:02:33.260> using<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.709> heat<00:02:33.920> gun

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
that's because I was using the heat gun

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.530 
that's because I was using the heat gun
to<00:02:34.840> on<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:36.830> shrink<00:02:37.100> tube<00:02:37.310> here<00:02:37.670> and<00:02:37.880> basically

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
to on the shrink tube here and basically

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.840 
to on the shrink tube here and basically
I<00:02:38.870> got<00:02:39.200> a<00:02:39.230> little<00:02:39.530> extra<00:02:39.709> seat<00:02:40.220> around<00:02:40.519> and<00:02:40.760> it

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
I got a little extra seat around and it

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.780 
I got a little extra seat around and it
just<00:02:40.880> curled<00:02:41.330> it<00:02:41.510> all<00:02:41.630> over<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:42.050> place<00:02:42.200> I<00:02:42.790> may

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
just curled it all over the place I may

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.820 
just curled it all over the place I may
actually<00:02:44.000> pull<00:02:44.510> all<00:02:44.690> this<00:02:44.900> out<00:02:45.110> because<00:02:45.620> I've

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
actually pull all this out because I've

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.979 
actually pull all this out because I've
got<00:02:46.040> some<00:02:46.310> better<00:02:46.519> white<00:02:46.850> LEDs<00:02:47.390> that<00:02:47.420> I<00:02:47.720> want

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
got some better white LEDs that I want

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.560 
got some better white LEDs that I want
to<00:02:48.080> use<00:02:48.260> these<00:02:48.830> are<00:02:49.100> a<00:02:49.489> white<00:02:49.940> that<00:02:50.239> kind<00:02:50.510> of

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
to use these are a white that kind of

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.440 
to use these are a white that kind of
goes<00:02:50.750> blue<00:02:51.110> on<00:02:51.290> video<00:02:51.709> I<00:02:52.040> now<00:02:52.760> have<00:02:53.000> some<00:02:53.269> white

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
goes blue on video I now have some white

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.900 
goes blue on video I now have some white
LEDs<00:02:53.989> that<00:02:54.019> called<00:02:54.530> warm<00:02:54.890> white<00:02:55.160> which<00:02:55.610> don't

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
LEDs that called warm white which don't

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.390 
LEDs that called warm white which don't
go<00:02:56.209> quite<00:02:56.510> as<00:02:56.840> blue<00:02:57.380> on<00:02:57.650> video<00:02:58.269> so<00:02:59.269> a<00:03:00.130> lot<00:03:01.130> of

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
go quite as blue on video so a lot of

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.460 
go quite as blue on video so a lot of
this<00:03:01.820> was<00:03:01.970> probably<00:03:02.180> like<00:03:02.450> three<00:03:02.840> hours<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.350> do

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
this was probably like three hours to do

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.250 
this was probably like three hours to do
this<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:03.950> I'll<00:03:04.430> tell<00:03:04.640> you<00:03:04.760> now<00:03:04.940> that<00:03:05.269> working

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
this and I'll tell you now that working

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.289 
this and I'll tell you now that working
with<00:03:06.290> a<00:03:06.410> lot<00:03:06.650> of<00:03:06.680> fiber<00:03:06.980> optic<00:03:07.519> is<00:03:07.700> a<00:03:07.730> total

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
with a lot of fiber optic is a total

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.390 
with a lot of fiber optic is a total
pain<00:03:08.540> because<00:03:09.019> it<00:03:09.170> wants<00:03:09.470> to<00:03:09.620> slip<00:03:09.890> all<00:03:10.070> over

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
pain because it wants to slip all over

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.860 
pain because it wants to slip all over
the<00:03:10.519> place

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
the place

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.020 
the place
the<00:03:12.170> way<00:03:12.320> I<00:03:12.350> sealed<00:03:12.829> these<00:03:13.040> in<00:03:13.310> was<00:03:13.579> to<00:03:13.790> just

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
the way I sealed these in was to just

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.720 
the way I sealed these in was to just
dump<00:03:14.239> a<00:03:14.390> pile<00:03:14.630> of<00:03:14.660> white<00:03:15.079> glue<00:03:15.380> in<00:03:15.590> there<00:03:15.769> so<00:03:16.700> I

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
dump a pile of white glue in there so I

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.199 
dump a pile of white glue in there so I
may<00:03:17.030> not<00:03:17.209> even<00:03:17.390> be<00:03:17.630> able<00:03:17.750> to<00:03:17.959> pull<00:03:18.170> them<00:03:18.260> out

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
may not even be able to pull them out

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.180 
may not even be able to pull them out
that<00:03:20.209> might<00:03:20.420> be<00:03:20.540> fixed<00:03:20.870> forever<00:03:21.200> but<00:03:21.650> I<00:03:21.890> may<00:03:22.160> be

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
that might be fixed forever but I may be

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.340 
that might be fixed forever but I may be
able<00:03:22.430> to<00:03:22.579> change<00:03:22.910> out<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:23.269> LEDs<00:03:23.750> with<00:03:24.230> the

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
able to change out the LEDs with the

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.580 
able to change out the LEDs with the
relative<00:03:24.890> ease<00:03:25.070> and<00:03:25.970> see<00:03:26.180> how<00:03:26.269> that<00:03:26.329> goes

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
relative ease and see how that goes

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.360 
relative ease and see how that goes
you<00:03:28.590> never<00:03:28.769> want<00:03:29.069> to<00:03:29.159> use<00:03:29.219> any<00:03:29.760> kind<00:03:30.030> of

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
you never want to use any kind of

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.709 
you never want to use any kind of
superglue<00:03:32.370> or<00:03:32.459> anything<00:03:32.879> like<00:03:33.180> that<00:03:33.239> that

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:33.719 
superglue or anything like that that

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:35.869 
superglue or anything like that that
will<00:03:33.930> just<00:03:34.170> simply<00:03:34.560> make<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:35.010> fiber<00:03:35.280> optics

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
will just simply make the fiber optics

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:41.839 
will just simply make the fiber optics
brittle<00:03:36.389> and<00:03:37.069> useless<00:03:39.349> so<00:03:40.349> over<00:03:41.010> here<00:03:41.280> I<00:03:41.459> get

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
brittle and useless so over here I get

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:46.309 
brittle and useless so over here I get
I'll<00:03:42.180> attach<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.810> points<00:03:43.260> and<00:03:44.840> the<00:03:45.840> two<00:03:46.049> holes

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
I'll attach the points and the two holes

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.379 
I'll attach the points and the two holes
that<00:03:46.530> I'm<00:03:46.769> putting<00:03:47.219> in<00:03:47.430> the<00:03:47.519> front<00:03:47.790> here<00:03:50.389> this

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
that I'm putting in the front here this

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:53.629 
that I'm putting in the front here this
is<00:03:51.599> one<00:03:51.810> millimeter<00:03:52.200> it's<00:03:52.889> a<00:03:53.040> little<00:03:53.430> too

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
is one millimeter it's a little too

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:56.209 
is one millimeter it's a little too
small<00:03:53.849> the<00:03:54.629> LED<00:03:55.019> is<00:03:55.169> three<00:03:55.469> millimeter<00:03:55.950> which

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:56.219 
small the LED is three millimeter which

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:58.699 
small the LED is three millimeter which
is<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:56.400> little<00:03:56.730> too<00:03:56.909> big<00:03:57.150> so<00:03:57.480> that's<00:03:58.200> got<00:03:58.499> me

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
is a little too big so that's got me

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.659 
is a little too big so that's got me
wishing<00:03:58.889> that<00:03:59.219> I<00:03:59.280> had<00:03:59.370> some<00:04:01.099> two<00:04:02.099> millimeter

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:02.669 
wishing that I had some two millimeter

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:05.209 
wishing that I had some two millimeter
fiber<00:04:03.569> optics<00:04:04.139> because<00:04:04.349> that<00:04:04.799> would<00:04:04.950> probably

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:05.219 
fiber optics because that would probably

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:11.390 
fiber optics because that would probably
fit<00:04:05.639> this<00:04:05.819> drill<00:04:06.120> hole<00:04:06.359> perfectly<00:04:10.069> so<00:04:11.069> let's

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
fit this drill hole perfectly so let's

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:18.229 
fit this drill hole perfectly so let's
put<00:04:11.730> this<00:04:11.879> in<00:04:12.120> here<00:04:12.359> as<00:04:12.510> well<00:04:16.759> so<00:04:17.759> because<00:04:17.940> it's

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
put this in here as well so because it's

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.890 
put this in here as well so because it's
only<00:04:18.419> two<00:04:18.750> wires<00:04:19.049> on<00:04:19.669> here<00:04:20.669> it's<00:04:21.329> not<00:04:21.630> really

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
only two wires on here it's not really

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.689 
only two wires on here it's not really
going<00:04:22.169> to<00:04:22.259> hold<00:04:22.410> too<00:04:22.680> well<00:04:22.889> with<00:04:23.099> heat<00:04:23.340> shrink

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
going to hold too well with heat shrink

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.600 
going to hold too well with heat shrink
so<00:04:24.660> what<00:04:25.050> I've<00:04:25.169> got<00:04:25.470> our<00:04:25.800> thought<00:04:26.009> here<00:04:26.400> it<00:04:26.490> is

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
so what I've got our thought here it is

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.490 
so what I've got our thought here it is
and<00:04:26.880> just<00:04:26.910> going<00:04:27.690> to<00:04:27.750> use<00:04:27.930> a<00:04:27.960> little<00:04:28.259> black

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
and just going to use a little black

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.810 
and just going to use a little black
tape<00:04:29.150> to<00:04:30.150> hold<00:04:30.330> these<00:04:30.599> down<00:04:30.960> and<00:04:31.580> let's<00:04:32.580> see

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
tape to hold these down and let's see

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.270 
tape to hold these down and let's see
how<00:04:33.030> that<00:04:33.060> works<00:04:33.650> I've<00:04:34.650> never<00:04:34.889> really<00:04:35.250> used

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
how that works I've never really used

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.930 
how that works I've never really used
black<00:04:35.759> tape<00:04:36.030> to<00:04:36.270> hold<00:04:37.159> fiber-optic<00:04:38.159> onto<00:04:38.520> LEDs

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
black tape to hold fiber-optic onto LEDs

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.439 
black tape to hold fiber-optic onto LEDs
before<00:04:39.949> if<00:04:40.949> my<00:04:41.159> hands<00:04:41.490> get<00:04:41.669> in<00:04:41.820> the<00:04:41.940> way<00:04:42.030> sorry

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:42.449 
before if my hands get in the way sorry

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.480 
before if my hands get in the way sorry
about<00:04:42.750> that<00:04:42.780> all<00:04:43.259> I'm<00:04:43.500> doing<00:04:43.830> is<00:04:43.919> wrapping

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
about that all I'm doing is wrapping

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.600 
about that all I'm doing is wrapping
this<00:04:44.820> up<00:04:45.050> so<00:04:46.050> get<00:04:46.259> the<00:04:46.470> two<00:04:46.740> ends<00:04:46.919> nice<00:04:47.370> and

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
this up so get the two ends nice and

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.110 
this up so get the two ends nice and
close<00:04:48.090> together

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.510 

let's<00:04:52.110> put<00:04:52.320> this<00:04:52.470> tape<00:04:52.830> on<00:04:53.070> the<00:04:53.220> LED<00:04:53.730> first<00:04:54.180> I

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
let's put this tape on the LED first I

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.770 
let's put this tape on the LED first I
don't<00:04:56.520> even<00:04:56.610> know<00:04:56.850> if<00:04:56.970> black<00:04:57.180> tape<00:04:57.449> is<00:04:57.630> going

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
don't even know if black tape is going

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.540 
don't even know if black tape is going
to<00:04:57.870> hold<00:04:58.080> on<00:04:58.260> this<00:04:58.440> because<00:04:58.680> usually<00:04:59.280> it<00:04:59.400> works

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
to hold on this because usually it works

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:06.469 
to hold on this because usually it works
best<00:04:59.880> on<00:05:00.150> wire<00:05:00.600> itself<00:05:04.790> but<00:05:05.790> if<00:05:05.910> I<00:05:06.030> dump<00:05:06.300> this

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
best on wire itself but if I dump this

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.170 
best on wire itself but if I dump this
whole<00:05:06.540> thing<00:05:06.990> with<00:05:07.199> some<00:05:07.380> white<00:05:07.590> glue<00:05:08.180> that

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
whole thing with some white glue that

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.210 
whole thing with some white glue that
might<00:05:09.479> work<00:05:09.690> out<00:05:09.930> well

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:20.860 

alright<00:05:14.870> and<00:05:16.160> with<00:05:17.160> this<00:05:17.400> over<00:05:17.940> without

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.290 

fiberoptic<00:05:21.530> doesn't<00:05:22.190> have<00:05:22.310> a<00:05:22.340> lot<00:05:22.610> of<00:05:22.639> flex<00:05:23.030> to

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
fiberoptic doesn't have a lot of flex to

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.360 
fiberoptic doesn't have a lot of flex to
it<00:05:23.330> so<00:05:23.960> that's<00:05:24.620> one<00:05:24.830> of<00:05:24.860> the<00:05:24.980> other<00:05:25.160> reasons

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
it so that's one of the other reasons

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:31.480 
it so that's one of the other reasons
why<00:05:25.639> it's<00:05:25.970> a<00:05:26.120> pain<00:05:26.780> to<00:05:26.810> work<00:05:27.200> with

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.490 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.700 

if<00:05:31.940> anyone<00:05:32.330> has<00:05:32.480> any<00:05:32.690> ideas<00:05:32.780> for<00:05:33.320> handling

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
if anyone has any ideas for handling

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:40.200 
if anyone has any ideas for handling
this<00:05:33.980> stuff<00:05:34.160> and<00:05:34.700> I<00:05:34.850> definitely<00:05:35.180> let<00:05:35.660> me<00:05:35.690> know

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.550 

against<00:05:41.210> ours<00:05:41.360> probably<00:05:41.750> isn't<00:05:42.170> getting<00:05:42.440> on

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
against ours probably isn't getting on

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.190 
against ours probably isn't getting on
camera<00:05:42.590> here<00:05:43.250> but<00:05:43.780> basically<00:05:44.780> I'm<00:05:44.990> just

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
camera here but basically I'm just

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:50.530 
camera here but basically I'm just
wrapping<00:05:45.440> it<00:05:45.770> up<00:05:48.280> I'm<00:05:49.280> hoping<00:05:49.910> that<00:05:50.090> it<00:05:50.330> will

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:50.540 
wrapping it up I'm hoping that it will

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:57.370 
wrapping it up I'm hoping that it will
stay<00:05:54.670> so<00:05:55.670> the<00:05:55.880> chances<00:05:56.240> are<00:05:56.360> not<00:05:56.540> too<00:05:56.720> bad<00:05:57.020> this

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
stay so the chances are not too bad this

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.030 
stay so the chances are not too bad this
could<00:05:57.590> flip<00:05:57.860> out<00:05:58.040> easily<00:05:58.520> enough<00:05:59.740> let<00:06:00.740> me<00:06:00.860> get

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:01.040 
could flip out easily enough let me get

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.530 
could flip out easily enough let me get
some<00:06:01.220> power<00:06:01.430> going<00:06:01.730> again<00:06:02.090> here<00:06:04.180> you<00:06:05.180> can<00:06:05.360> see

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:05.540 
some power going again here you can see

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.570 
some power going again here you can see
the<00:06:05.660> light<00:06:05.810> transmitting<00:06:06.530> down<00:06:06.710> the<00:06:06.890> line<00:06:07.100> and

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
the light transmitting down the line and

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.190 
the light transmitting down the line and
it<00:06:07.700> looks<00:06:07.910> like<00:06:08.090> this<00:06:08.240> one<00:06:08.480> is<00:06:08.600> stronger<00:06:08.930> than

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.200 
it looks like this one is stronger than

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.780 
it looks like this one is stronger than
that<00:06:09.410> one<00:06:11.560> let<00:06:12.560> me<00:06:12.590> get<00:06:13.100> these<00:06:13.250> blue<00:06:13.580> lights

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:13.790 
that one let me get these blue lights

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:29.080 
that one let me get these blue lights
out<00:06:14.030> of<00:06:14.180> here<00:06:14.330> that<00:06:14.510> will<00:06:14.660> help<00:06:14.810> out

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.090 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:30.920 

because<00:06:30.090> we're<00:06:30.300> having<00:06:30.479> some<00:06:30.780> little

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
because we're having some little

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:36.320 
because we're having some little
alligator<00:06:31.319> clips<00:06:31.860> is<00:06:32.220> a<00:06:32.610> useful<00:06:33.060> thing<00:06:35.330> there

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330 
alligator clips is a useful thing there

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.100 
alligator clips is a useful thing there
we<00:06:36.479> go<00:06:37.940> hey<00:06:38.940> I'd<00:06:39.090> say<00:06:39.330> this<00:06:39.509> one's<00:06:39.750> a<00:06:39.840> little

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.110 
we go hey I'd say this one's a little

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:46.490 
we go hey I'd say this one's a little
stronger<00:06:43.729> but<00:06:44.729> not<00:06:45.090> by<00:06:45.300> much<00:06:45.539> and<00:06:45.930> that<00:06:46.319> can

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500 
stronger but not by much and that can

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:51.529 
stronger but not by much and that can
probably<00:06:46.710> be<00:06:46.949> changed<00:06:47.550> just<00:06:49.669> by<00:06:50.669> manipulating

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:51.539 
probably be changed just by manipulating

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:54.260 
probably be changed just by manipulating
the<00:06:52.259> block<00:06:52.500> tape<00:06:52.800> here<00:06:53.099> so<00:06:53.789> now<00:06:54.030> they're

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:54.270 
the block tape here so now they're

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.129 
the block tape here so now they're
pretty<00:06:54.930> close<00:06:55.199> to<00:06:55.379> as<00:06:55.530> strong<00:06:55.889> as<00:06:56.069> each<00:06:56.220> other

00:06:57.129 --> 00:06:57.139 
pretty close to as strong as each other

00:06:57.139 --> 00:06:59.899 
pretty close to as strong as each other
so<00:06:58.139> I'll<00:06:58.349> just<00:06:58.590> try<00:06:58.830> and<00:06:58.979> fix<00:06:59.159> these<00:06:59.430> in<00:06:59.639> place

00:06:59.899 --> 00:06:59.909 
so I'll just try and fix these in place

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:02.570 
so I'll just try and fix these in place
with<00:07:00.180> some<00:07:00.389> white<00:07:00.569> glue<00:07:01.190> then<00:07:02.190> I'll<00:07:02.370> just

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:02.580 
with some white glue then I'll just

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.969 
with some white glue then I'll just
leave<00:07:02.789> them<00:07:02.970> alone<00:07:03.180> for<00:07:03.509> a<00:07:03.539> while<00:07:03.979> so

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:04.979 
leave them alone for a while so

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:06.980 
leave them alone for a while so
unfortunately<00:07:05.520> I<00:07:05.580> cut<00:07:05.849> a<00:07:05.880> lot<00:07:06.180> more<00:07:06.419> than<00:07:06.630> I

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:06.990 
unfortunately I cut a lot more than I

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.680 
unfortunately I cut a lot more than I
cut<00:07:07.919> more<00:07:08.190> than<00:07:08.400> I<00:07:08.490> needed<00:07:08.759> so<00:07:09.389> I'll<00:07:09.509> probably

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:09.690 
cut more than I needed so I'll probably

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.839 
cut more than I needed so I'll probably
just<00:07:09.900> trim<00:07:10.319> another<00:07:10.590> inch<00:07:10.889> or<00:07:11.039> so<00:07:11.220> off<00:07:11.250> of<00:07:11.639> that

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:11.849 
just trim another inch or so off of that

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:18.080 
just trim another inch or so off of that
once<00:07:12.419> this<00:07:12.630> white<00:07:12.870> glue<00:07:13.169> dries<00:07:15.380> and<00:07:17.090> basically

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:18.090 
once this white glue dries and basically

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:24.820 
once this white glue dries and basically
I<00:07:18.120> can't<00:07:18.509> touch<00:07:18.750> this<00:07:19.050> until<00:07:19.650> this<00:07:19.919> is<00:07:20.099> dry

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:24.830 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.439 

what<00:07:25.830> I'm<00:07:25.949> going<00:07:26.069> to<00:07:26.129> do<00:07:26.279> here<00:07:26.520> is<00:07:26.789> cover<00:07:27.240> up

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:27.449 
what I'm going to do here is cover up

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:30.010 
what I'm going to do here is cover up
some<00:07:27.719> of<00:07:27.749> the<00:07:27.900> fiber<00:07:28.169> with<00:07:28.620> the<00:07:28.800> glue<00:07:29.039> itself

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:30.020 
some of the fiber with the glue itself

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:33.909 
some of the fiber with the glue itself
I've<00:07:31.020> got<00:07:31.259> an<00:07:31.409> idea<00:07:31.800> I<00:07:31.860> want<00:07:32.159> to<00:07:32.249> try<00:07:32.520> on<00:07:32.699> this

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:33.919 
I've got an idea I want to try on this

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:37.820 
I've got an idea I want to try on this
like<00:07:34.919> I<00:07:35.099> said<00:07:35.309> super<00:07:35.610> glue<00:07:35.969> will<00:07:36.830> destroy

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:37.830 
like I said super glue will destroy

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:43.189 
like I said super glue will destroy
fiber<00:07:38.189> optics<00:07:39.589> what<00:07:40.589> I'm<00:07:40.710> thinking<00:07:41.159> is<00:07:42.110> and<00:07:43.110> if

00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:43.199 
fiber optics what I'm thinking is and if

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:46.249 
fiber optics what I'm thinking is and if
I<00:07:43.319> protect<00:07:43.830> it<00:07:44.039> with<00:07:44.639> this<00:07:44.819> white<00:07:45.089> glue<00:07:45.419> kind

00:07:46.249 --> 00:07:46.259 
I protect it with this white glue kind

00:07:46.259 --> 00:07:50.239 
I protect it with this white glue kind
of<00:07:46.349> sheath<00:07:46.589> it<00:07:48.289> I'll<00:07:49.289> be<00:07:49.469> able<00:07:49.589> to<00:07:49.860> put<00:07:50.039> some

00:07:50.239 --> 00:07:50.249 
of sheath it I'll be able to put some

00:07:50.249 --> 00:07:52.610 
of sheath it I'll be able to put some
super<00:07:50.460> glue<00:07:50.639> on<00:07:51.120> there<00:07:51.569> along<00:07:52.229> with<00:07:52.259> some

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:52.620 
super glue on there along with some

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:55.219 
super glue on there along with some
baking<00:07:53.039> soda<00:07:53.279> and<00:07:53.789> that<00:07:54.449> will<00:07:54.629> give<00:07:54.839> it<00:07:54.870> a

00:07:55.219 --> 00:07:55.229 
baking soda and that will give it a

00:07:55.229 --> 00:07:59.389 
baking soda and that will give it a
completely<00:07:56.129> rock-hard<00:07:56.699> surface
