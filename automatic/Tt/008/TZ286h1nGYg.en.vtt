00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.920
 October 31 the game very special date 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.880
 the plan was to be found 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.059
 and alone 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.959
 and we stand and want to act 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:14.190
 the film philipe gilbert is so special 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.190
 in October 30, 2009 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:19.310
 Yes that is true 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.480
 don't say no I work 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.439
 I had a lesser day 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.369
 two years ago 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.960
 when asked 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.310
 I'm back there again 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.979
 the world btz 

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:34.520
 I can do everything to him I notice myself but the midfielder only arrived 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:36.340
 I for only the 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.930
 but yes to see 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.530
 i am i think 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.650
 where you put everything 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:43.870
 I can do everything 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.380
 I do not want everything he goes every week to be able to stand alone next to said 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.900
 he runs from doctors to facts away to the enemy's life 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.790
 We certainly have what happened to natural products 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.100
 delivered 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.680
 finally to 7 in the min 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.190
 I'm with a lower opening 

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.010
 getting a lugene lays six months 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.330
 trained hard for myself to close every mecca, including Dutch 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.930
 team with training professionals 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.860
 and after nine months 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.330
 I really am a member of Chelsea 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.740
 mid-August 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.930
 that also says something again for you t you know that you just teammates at 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.910
 windesheim the blazer 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.910
 yes yes that's right end of may oare grab 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.650
 I thought he was right with it also managed to not get along with them 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.800
 had your contact 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.370
 After the news the kids would love to have it and he said that too 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.730
 did everything to ensure that I could have kept borrowing no 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.730
 we now play the same as back then 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.580
 the Tour de France 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.400
 where i have not really everything to do especially myself that the team of arsenal though 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.360
 avoids nonsense 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.750
 form the lord saltless bearing action against a hedge of honor and the multiyear yes 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.840
 yet again its own way 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.390
 by our a little careful 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.660
 say hln.be 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.319
 but maybe that's not it unwise 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.599
 are you as good as before the injury? 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.939
 before that no no I am 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:17.079
 I have to work the last Monday night to get to the boss 

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:23.059
 and really stand in October 30 but this is something else nice that everything is so broken 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:24.639
 being in charge 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:25.739
 I hope and fear 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.619
 actually just a well and 

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:32.229
 and yes i'm assuming a bit but that will be fine the last month 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:35.579
 but there is no hair better such an injury-sensitive Munich 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.579
 yes yes yes I was right with my life and my 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.219
 I have stamps in our country, Bert van Marwijk 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:46.759
 but i am only 23 years old 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:50.879
 we have been playing for so many years for many people is the ex 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.049
 president for myself 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.299
 I also drive that I have had my chances and that I can actually do something about it 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.759
 to learn 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:02.300
 Health can come through are welcome 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.819
 the clipper city of amsterdam 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.569
 what is this is the toughest 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.149
 I'm not really me 

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:13.549
 maybe that is because in our LA training I am just very good 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.249
 management too much to learn 

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:17.419
 I just think so 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:22.790
 i give every trifle there are very many of these vehicles after the us 

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:25.809
 nineteen seasons and the phone hangs 

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:29.140
 previously it was 5 since it was one of them 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.979
 what others think of caring and empathizing 

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:35.539
 contests with a so-called five ago thought they were ladies 

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:38.619
 I have no idea actually 

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:42.009
 we didn't get a point closed for the driver 

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:43.709
 Clues 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.469
 weeping became the speed 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:46.119
 he had in April
