still scheduled for a summer release
sometime<00:00:10.429> doing<00:00:11.429> some<00:00:11.580> acoustic<00:00:11.759> guitars

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
sometime doing some acoustic guitars

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.530 
sometime doing some acoustic guitars
this<00:00:12.509> song<00:00:12.750> has<00:00:12.960> been<00:00:13.370> kind<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.580> difficult<00:00:15.450> to

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
this song has been kind of difficult to

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.429 
this song has been kind of difficult to
finish<00:00:16.199> because<00:00:17.180> the<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.539> sections<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:19.260> I

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
finish because the the sections that I

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.029 
finish because the the sections that I
had<00:00:19.710> recorded<00:00:20.400> originally<00:00:21.350> didn't<00:00:22.350> really

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
had recorded originally didn't really

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.550 
had recorded originally didn't really
work<00:00:23.369> together<00:00:23.670> anymore<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:25.050> moved<00:00:25.380> things

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
work together anymore so I moved things

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.490 
work together anymore so I moved things
around<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.369> think<00:00:26.609> I'm<00:00:26.760> at<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.910> point<00:00:27.119> where

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
around and I think I'm at a point where

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.929 
around and I think I'm at a point where
things<00:00:28.500> are<00:00:28.650> going<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.830> make<00:00:28.949> more<00:00:29.130> sense<00:00:29.429> in

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
things are going to make more sense in

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.970 
things are going to make more sense in
this<00:00:30.510> song<00:00:30.779> for<00:00:30.810> this<00:00:31.170> song<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.590> we<00:00:31.679> record

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
but i like this guitar because it's

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.410 
but i like this guitar because it's
smaller<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:46.500> fits<00:00:47.719> it<00:00:48.719> fits<00:00:48.780> my<00:00:49.320> hand

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
better maybe then the faith guitar which

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.840 
better maybe then the faith guitar which
is<00:00:54.210> over<00:00:55.170> there<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:56.160> fifth<00:00:56.370> guitar<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.789> a

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
is over there the fifth guitar is a

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.490 
is over there the fifth guitar is a
great<00:00:57.059> guitar<00:00:57.449> it's<00:00:57.570> maybe<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.870> brighter<00:00:58.140> but

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
great guitar it's maybe a brighter but

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.799 
great guitar it's maybe a brighter but
it's<00:00:58.649> bigger<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.640> for<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.570> particular

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809
