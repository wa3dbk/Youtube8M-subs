00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 Welcome to the end form here 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.080
 and today I want to show you how 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.910
 It's easy after a long winter 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.580
 to get fit again 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.830
 Now I'm just 50 minutes 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.170
 Ran come back and it feels 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.449
 It was great that it was good 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.300
 fantastic and it does the health 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.789
 and the head so well because everyone cares 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.029
 have disappeared only by 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.580
 run a few minutes and today so to speak 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.560
 the first day of the spring is just beginning 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.960
 at the end of february, but finally 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.090
 on short sleeves it seems the sun and 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.610
 it literally pulled me out 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.920
 and after I'm not a big fan of 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.090
 I am still running 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.129
 it must overcome for some hours 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.969
 but to do and last I have 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.090
 then done too 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.879
 well I do not know everyone is leading it 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.219
 Not everyone can work half an hour at a time 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.199
 quarter of an hour or even an hour 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.539
 run and that's why I want you here 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.120
 take a tip as you possibly do 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.880
 getting back into shape quickly and that is 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.880
 quite simply you would be for three 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.939
 minutes on then you run as fast as you 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.210
 can for 30 seconds and then again 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.479
 for one and a half minutes slowly 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.549
 you can go too it does not have to 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.409
 so run back down so 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.290
 that the bulls rate comes down again 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.450
 after one and a half minutes again for 30 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.700
 seconds as fast as possible 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.710
 and reduce again for one and a half 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.570
 minutes all you repeat 6 times 6 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.810
 Repeat once and for statements yet 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.220
 totally relaxed cooldown by you 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.470
 maybe another three to five 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.920
 minutes passed on that's all 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.079
 already 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.970
 and repeat that three times 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.700
 week you'll see how fast you get in 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.399
 form comes i give all the details here 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.049
 down into the benefits you understood what 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.060
 you have to take care then again 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.520
 the sequence how to do that best 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.009
 I hope you can take the best 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.930

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.930
