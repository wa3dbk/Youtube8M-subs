00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.230
 Hello 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:15.809
 Today, I think I want to talk about the commute of training 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:19.070
 I think that there is something called super recovery in a well-known story, but I am conscious there as well 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:24.890
 At the Shiteya' Well if not Ika after all 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:30.140
 Well I 'm just sluggish because my muscles are no longer strengthened 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:33.849
 Strength away I would like to specifically the bottom of the story Nde look state 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.849
 I would like to see one's head 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:45.330
 This is also good, but it goes well 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:45.330
 The upper axis is both muscle strength , and here the horizontal axis is time 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:53.980
 Well, the place where this is falling is the place where I did training 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:58.329
 When it was put to it 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:04.890
 It feels like the interest rates are growing and growing 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:11.050
 I think that some people cause the illusion that money is increasing. 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:13.500
 When trained, muscle strength is basically destroyed and snakes 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.520
 And then 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.490
 The Well this time 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:26.390
 Although it is recovering gradually like this under two 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.390
 Here too, the original muscle strength of 8 seconds 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.520
 So many 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.380
 The part that is getting stronger 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:37.430
 We have to Fu that between ultra-recovery thing 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.430
 From the training 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:49.570
 Than original strength second 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:52.000
 It takes 24 to 48 hours for a time to have a small recovery with strong muscle recovery 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.940
 It is said that 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:01.520
 Why a training trip 2 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:04.820
 The muscle mass decreases a little but after that I put it for 24 to 48 hours 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:09.280
 It means that the original strength circle will also be strong 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.509
 So you have to do it in such a cycle 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.500
 Well this 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:20.200
 It means that you should give it roughly twice during the training . 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:22.030
 Then I think that I am worried about the training week when I say twice at most twice a week 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:28.180
 I think it will come 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:30.400
 In the weak, it happens that this cycle is not kept 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:36.270
 It fell to the training 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:39.340
 Since it becomes Fu that but the door is also fell before recovering to its original state 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.140
 Staying like this 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.030
 I will go 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.610
 Daily incense 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.850
 At all and are or something same place training 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.830
 Nai' change say the strength in energy is 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.780
 Right 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:03:01.210
 By changing the site to train in the case that if every day 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:05.950
 In Well feeling doing the force actually foot When was the day to do the arm the next day, such want to do sit-ups 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:11.990
 There is no problem even if you do it every day if you separate the parts to be trained 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:17.000
 Yes this will talk about training cycles and super recovery 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:22.010
 It is fine to write small stakes more and more in jal case, but I talked before 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:27.739
 Now to get some growth muscle to get growth hormone to some extent 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:31.659
 I need to go to small muscles after training so I think so every day 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:32.870
 I think it will be a bit more difficult to do it 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:37.879
 Battalion 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:39.040
 Or divided upper half of the body of the one-act Hanshin day to is good, even once a week 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.140
 Collection 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:48.120
 Insert two times alternately 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:54.360
 I think that good even say Rutte try to put the fire to the Shun'yon four days training 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:55.660
 I look forward to See you in I would like to increase the story it training hall 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.910
 Please give me 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.910
 Thank you for watching to the end today
