note<00:00:24.869> like<00:00:25.439> if<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.680> broke<00:00:25.859> up<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.189> C<00:00:26.340> chord<00:00:26.580> like

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
note like if I broke up the C chord like

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.009 
note like if I broke up the C chord like
that<00:00:28.490> that's<00:00:29.490> just<00:00:29.699> a<00:00:29.970> regular<00:00:30.660> broke<00:00:30.810> in<00:00:30.960> the

would do this one two three four in
other<00:00:51.780> words<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.110> hit<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.530> note<00:00:52.829> again<00:00:53.120> one

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120

three four one two three four now

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.700 
three four one two three four now
obviously<00:01:06.570> some<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.140> have<00:01:07.350> much<00:01:07.530> bigger

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
obviously some of you have much bigger

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.109 
obviously some of you have much bigger
hands<00:01:08.070> than<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.369> do<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:08.700> it's<00:01:08.820> going<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.000> be

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
hands than I do so it's going to be

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.240 
hands than I do so it's going to be
easier<00:01:09.540> some<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.380> got<00:01:10.530> even<00:01:10.920> smaller

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
easier some of you got even smaller

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.460 
easier some of you got even smaller
hands<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.670> suppose<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.299> that'll<00:01:13.170> be<00:01:13.320> more

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
hands I suppose so that'll be more

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.580 
hands I suppose so that'll be more
detail<00:01:13.950> it'll<00:01:14.820> more<00:01:14.970> tricky<00:01:15.570> but<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:16.290> can<00:01:16.440> do

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
detail it'll more tricky but you can do

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.100 
detail it'll more tricky but you can do
it<00:01:16.619> again<00:01:17.039> you<00:01:17.369> may<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.759> use<00:01:18.630> your<00:01:18.780> pedal

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
it again you may have to use your pedal

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.260 
it again you may have to use your pedal
to<00:01:19.229> jump<00:01:19.500> off<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.710> note<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.759> get<00:01:20.880> up<00:01:21.030> there<00:01:21.240> I

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
to jump off that note to get up there I

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.539 
to jump off that note to get up there I
hope<00:01:21.539> not<00:01:21.720> but<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.590> may<00:01:22.799> be<00:01:22.860> that<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.340> have<00:01:23.460> to

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
hope not but it may be that you have to

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.060 
hope not but it may be that you have to
do<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.990> now<00:01:24.990> if<00:01:25.110> it's<00:01:25.229> in<00:01:25.320> three<00:01:25.590> four<00:01:25.830> times

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
do that now if it's in three four times

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.289 
do that now if it's in three four times
the<00:01:26.430> song<00:01:26.610> you're<00:01:26.789> playing<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.030> two<00:01:27.119> three

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
the song you're playing is two three

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.710 
the song you're playing is two three
four<00:01:27.450> damage<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:27.869> simply<00:01:28.170> one<00:01:28.409> two<00:01:29.130> three<00:01:30.119> and

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
four damage is simply one two three and

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.490 
four damage is simply one two three and
then<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:30.990> repeat<00:01:31.289> it<00:01:31.320> one<00:01:31.680> two<00:01:32.369> three<00:01:33.080> one<00:01:34.080> two

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
then you repeat it one two three one two

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.450 
then you repeat it one two three one two
three<00:01:35.750> okay<00:01:36.750> let's<00:01:37.140> say<00:01:37.979> you're<00:01:38.130> playing<00:01:38.159> in

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
three okay let's say you're playing in

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.809 
three okay let's say you're playing in
4/4<00:01:38.880> time<00:01:41.659> let's<00:01:42.659> say<00:01:42.810> your<00:01:43.049> second<00:01:43.440> chord<00:01:43.819> is

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819 
4/4 time let's say your second chord is

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:47.559 
4/4 time let's say your second chord is
a<00:01:45.030> minor<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.720> I'm<00:01:46.319> playing<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> minor<00:01:47.220> chord

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:47.569 
a minor so I'm playing the a minor chord

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:52.290 
a minor so I'm playing the a minor chord
but<00:01:48.569> an<00:01:48.690> open<00:01:49.020> voicing

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.870 

see<00:01:53.300> that<00:01:53.510> so<00:01:54.110> the<00:01:54.260> first<00:01:54.500> the<00:01:54.800> first<00:01:55.490> chord

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
see that so the first the first chord

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.300 
see that so the first the first chord
was<00:01:56.030> see

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.679 

now<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.369> let<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.790> pedal<00:02:00.090> up<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.390> play<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:02.540> if<00:02:03.540> the

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
now I let the pedal up and play a if the

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.740 
now I let the pedal up and play a if the
next<00:02:03.930> chord<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.200> D<00:02:04.409> minor<00:02:05.540> D<00:02:07.280> 1/2<00:02:08.420> C<00:02:09.420> exactly

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
next chord is D minor D 1/2 C exactly

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.330 
next chord is D minor D 1/2 C exactly
the<00:02:09.989> same<00:02:10.170> principle<00:02:10.400> G

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
the same principle G

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.600 
the same principle G
that<00:02:14.340> chord<00:02:14.580> progression<00:02:14.640> I<00:02:15.090> just<00:02:15.300> played<00:02:15.510> was

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.770 

it's<00:02:20.610> called<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:21.030> blue<00:02:21.240> moon<00:02:21.450> chord

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
it's called a blue moon chord

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.390 
it's called a blue moon chord
progression<00:02:22.260> or<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.500> heart<00:02:22.710> or<00:02:22.830> soul<00:02:23.040> chord

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
progression or the heart or soul chord

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.400 
progression or the heart or soul chord
progression<00:02:23.910> or<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.660> we<00:02:24.780> want<00:02:24.990> canter

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
progression or the we want canter

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.500 
progression or the we want canter
there's<00:02:25.620> lots<00:02:25.800> of<00:02:25.890> names<00:02:26.040> for<00:02:26.190> it<00:02:26.520> okay<00:02:26.880> but

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
there's lots of names for it okay but

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.290 
there's lots of names for it okay but
it's<00:02:27.660> it's<00:02:28.170> widely<00:02:28.500> used<00:02:28.890> in<00:02:29.100> music<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:29.580> I<00:02:29.820> just

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
it's it's widely used in music so I just

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.660 
it's it's widely used in music so I just
thought<00:02:30.390> I'd<00:02:30.510> use<00:02:30.720> that<00:02:30.750> as<00:02:31.110> an<00:02:31.290> illustration

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
thought I'd use that as an illustration

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:45.580 
thought I'd use that as an illustration
okay<00:02:32.700> again<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.390> four<00:02:33.570> top<00:02:33.750> or<00:02:34.050> four<00:02:34.260> time

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.170 

and<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:46.950> on<00:02:47.099> like<00:02:47.250> that<00:02:47.310> whatever<00:02:47.670> whatever

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
and so on like that whatever whatever

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.440 
and so on like that whatever whatever
the<00:02:48.269> song<00:02:48.510> is<00:02:48.689> it<00:02:48.840> applies<00:02:49.109> to<00:02:49.260> all<00:02:49.379> songs<00:02:49.709> okay

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
the song is it applies to all songs okay

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.170 
the song is it applies to all songs okay
now<00:02:51.450> I<00:02:52.439> guess<00:02:53.280> that's<00:02:53.459> all<00:02:53.640> you<00:02:53.760> need<00:02:53.939> to<00:02:54.030> know

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
now I guess that's all you need to know

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.569 
now I guess that's all you need to know
about<00:02:54.299> that<00:02:54.659> yeah<00:02:55.109> you<00:02:55.409> just<00:02:55.620> push<00:02:56.099> your<00:02:56.219> pedal

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
about that yeah you just push your pedal

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:57.920 
about that yeah you just push your pedal
down<00:02:56.700> as<00:02:56.909> you<00:02:57.030> play<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.269> load<00:02:57.599> on<00:02:57.780> you

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
down as you play the load on you

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.750 
down as you play the load on you
pressure<00:02:58.200> your<00:02:58.680> damper<00:02:59.129> pedal<00:02:59.159> the<00:02:59.459> pedal<00:02:59.489> on

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
pressure your damper pedal the pedal on

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.259 
pressure your damper pedal the pedal on
the<00:02:59.790> right

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
the right

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.020 
the right
keep<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:00.870> down<00:03:01.079> as<00:03:01.319> you<00:03:01.470> play<00:03:01.680> the<00:03:01.819> all<00:03:02.819> the

keep it down as you play the all the

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.640 
keep it down as you play the all the
notes<00:03:03.209> of<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.510> chord<00:03:03.540> but<00:03:03.959> then<00:03:04.170> let<00:03:04.379> it<00:03:04.409> up

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
notes of the chord but then let it up

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.890 
notes of the chord but then let it up
before<00:03:05.609> you<00:03:05.730> start<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.180> next<00:03:06.359> chord<00:03:06.659> or<00:03:06.750> push

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
before you start the next chord or push

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.390 
before you start the next chord or push
it<00:03:06.930> down<00:03:07.200> on<00:03:07.439> that<00:03:07.500> modern<00:03:08.010> meltdown

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
it down on that modern meltdown

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.970 
it down on that modern meltdown
up<00:03:11.400> down

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.339 

like<00:03:14.550> so

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.099 

now<00:03:18.060> sometimes<00:03:19.060> you'll<00:03:19.390> you'll<00:03:19.780> have<00:03:19.930> two

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
sometimes you have four note chord such

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.190 
sometimes you have four note chord such
as<00:03:48.820> C<00:03:49.030> seventh<00:03:49.480> and<00:03:50.110> when<00:03:50.290> you<00:03:50.410> do<00:03:50.530> that<00:03:51.420> at<00:03:52.420> if

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
as C seventh and when you do that at if

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.300 
as C seventh and when you do that at if
you're<00:03:53.380> a<00:03:53.410> beginner<00:03:53.740> you<00:03:53.950> just<00:03:54.100> leave<00:03:54.280> that

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
you're a beginner you just leave that

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.260 
you're a beginner you just leave that
out<00:03:54.640> for<00:03:54.970> now<00:03:55.030> but<00:03:55.990> later<00:03:56.790> you<00:03:57.790> can<00:03:57.940> use<00:03:58.060> what's

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
out for now but later you can use what's

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.410 
out for now but later you can use what's
called<00:03:58.360> a<00:03:58.570> hand<00:03:58.840> over<00:03:59.140> arpeggio<00:03:59.800> and<00:04:00.270> get<00:04:01.270> the

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
called a hand over arpeggio and get the

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.180 
called a hand over arpeggio and get the
upper<00:04:01.780> intervals<00:04:02.230> like<00:04:02.440> that<00:04:02.650> if<00:04:02.800> you<00:04:02.890> had<00:04:02.980> C

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
upper intervals like that if you had C

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:14.030 
upper intervals like that if you had C
7th<00:04:03.640> I<00:04:03.730> would<00:04:03.880> probably<00:04:04.270> do<00:04:04.420> it<00:04:04.510> that<00:04:04.660> way

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040
