it's cleaner more efficient future is
shaping<00:00:15.850> up<00:00:16.740> now<00:00:17.740> the<00:00:18.340> car<00:00:18.550> driving<00:00:18.910> might

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
shaping up now the car driving might

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.060 
shaping up now the car driving might
look<00:00:19.390> like<00:00:19.449> the<00:00:19.810> current<00:00:20.050> generation<00:00:20.470> Mazda<00:00:20.830> 6

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
look like the current generation Mazda 6

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.970 
look like the current generation Mazda 6
but<00:00:21.850> it's<00:00:22.000> not<00:00:22.270> it's<00:00:23.020> a<00:00:23.200> prototype<00:00:23.590> which

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
but it's not it's a prototype which

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.220 
but it's not it's a prototype which

power<00:00:26.590> plants<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:29.650> engine<00:00:29.950> is<00:00:30.070> more

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.190 
power plants the engine is more

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.609 
power plants the engine is more
responsive<00:00:30.789> and<00:00:30.970> it's<00:00:31.150> quicker<00:00:31.390> direct<00:00:31.840> an

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
responsive and it's quicker direct an

responsive and it's quicker direct an
overall<00:00:33.100> there's<00:00:33.309> more<00:00:33.460> power

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:34.059 
overall there's more power

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.739

so<00:00:34.960> how<00:00:35.170> has<00:00:35.680> master<00:00:36.070> achieved<00:00:36.370> this<00:00:36.749> well

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:37.749 
so how has master achieved this well

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:41.729 
so how has master achieved this well
first<00:00:38.710> off<00:00:38.949> cutting<00:00:39.489> weight<00:00:40.289> next<00:00:41.289> it<00:00:41.469> is<00:00:41.649> how

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
first off cutting weight next it is how

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.169 
first off cutting weight next it is how
to<00:00:41.800> completely<00:00:42.249> rethink<00:00:42.579> and<00:00:42.999> how<00:00:43.120> the

00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:43.179 
to completely rethink and how the

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:44.790 
to completely rethink and how the

racecar light compression ratio this

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.840 
racecar light compression ratio this
ensures<00:00:50.109> the<00:00:50.379> most<00:00:50.890> efficient<00:00:51.399> firm<00:00:51.609> and

ensures the most efficient firm and

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.729 
ensures the most efficient firm and
makes<00:00:52.149> the<00:00:52.329> car<00:00:52.539> more<00:00:52.569> responsive<00:00:53.319> down<00:00:53.499> low

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
makes the car more responsive down low

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.129 
makes the car more responsive down low
and<00:00:54.069> helps<00:00:54.850> give<00:00:55.030> it<00:00:55.059> the<00:00:55.269> pure<00:00:55.479> consumption

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:56.139
