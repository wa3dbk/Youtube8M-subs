00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:05.600
 it is better to ask for rolandia what he has not yet moved on the south fusca niagra 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.330
 the game had 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.080
 the boy sort of lost count of how many he spent doing a 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.539
 little thing there, another little thing, come and study it 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.030
 to get closer to the king they can not get in 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:24.169
 this one looking for perfection - details the good pieces ars ne 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.710
 The truth is that the ball is a fighter in love. 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.000
 in the garage there are two while one is already well in the style of him the other awaits 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.059
 to begin to be tidy the passion began at the age of five when the father 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.899
 had a 'car' shape on the back and simplicity 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.210
 all this was good the boy and stay so 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.620
 something normal 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.910
 I do not even put the bug in the rain. 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.190
 It's a lot of women in the car in Sweden. 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.280
 so I like to maintain performance 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.540
 cleanin 'uniqueness just for me enjoy the energy of meeting 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.560
 take a walk on a sunny Sunday in the 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.560
 the fusca was the best selling vehicle in the world 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.930
 the last model was produced in 2003 in mexico here in brazil began to be 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.080
 manufactured in 1951 and soon thereafter became one of the most sold 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.649
 stopped being manufactured in 86 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.080
 but seven years later it was produced again 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.470
 at the request of then-president Franco-itamar in 96 was retired from time to time 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.469
 almost three and a half million units sold 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:38.270
 when you see a beetle around 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.619
 people always remember a story I think the fusca has that 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.560
 story that is a passion 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.780
 and everyone here looks to teach 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.230
 who does not sleep a fag 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.130
 but the point is that time does not stop and modernity has even reached the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.750
 beetle 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.190
 the new fully reformulated version is produced in Mexico and is different from 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.690
 old known 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.070
 and this is not at all popular 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.079
 very interested in the old fusca c 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:06.940
 if approved 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.799
 in the background are being contemplated in our contract the director 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:12.639
 sixty six thousand reais 

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:15.009
 has no way 

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:16.499
 same 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:17.660
 the standard 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.660
 visually the new model is pure costs today 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.420
 our the steering wheel there is much difference the car is to see it if it owns 'motor' 2 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.230
 zero point at first glance this seems to be much larger 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.320
 but in fact both the old and the newer version 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.940
 It is the same size as the trunk is that it has been on the back side different 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.660
 from before he was in front 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.069
 now it is asked now to see what he thinks 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.030
 and he left a little of the line and the car 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.990
 popular fox car that wants the people's car so I guess this new and not 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.680
 It's so down to the people.
