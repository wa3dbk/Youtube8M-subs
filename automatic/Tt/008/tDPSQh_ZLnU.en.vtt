I'm<00:01:56.560> going<00:01:56.680> to<00:01:56.740> be<00:01:56.860> sharing<00:01:57.070> with<00:01:57.220> you<00:01:57.340> how<00:01:57.790> I

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.150 
I'm going to be sharing with you how I

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.750 
I'm going to be sharing with you how I
got<00:01:58.660> over<00:01:58.720> my<00:01:59.110> first<00:01:59.350> breakup<00:01:59.800> my<00:02:00.190> first<00:02:00.550> break

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:00.760 
got over my first breakup my first break

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.150 
got over my first breakup my first break
that<00:02:00.910> was<00:02:01.060> the<00:02:01.210> most<00:02:01.420> painful<00:02:01.660> for<00:02:02.290> sure<00:02:02.620> so<00:02:03.130> I

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
that was the most painful for sure so I

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.250 
that was the most painful for sure so I
think<00:02:03.370> the<00:02:03.700> first<00:02:03.940> thing<00:02:04.120> about<00:02:04.360> breakups<00:02:04.960> is

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
think the first thing about breakups is

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.620 
think the first thing about breakups is
that<00:02:05.560> we<00:02:05.770> tend<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.220> take<00:02:06.430> them<00:02:06.670> personally<00:02:07.360> and

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
that we tend to take them personally and

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.260 
that we tend to take them personally and
what<00:02:08.619> I<00:02:08.649> realized<00:02:09.100> along<00:02:09.280> my<00:02:09.520> journey<00:02:09.580> is<00:02:10.030> that

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
what I realized along my journey is that

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.840 
what I realized along my journey is that
breakups<00:02:10.840> are<00:02:10.960> never<00:02:11.020> really<00:02:12.010> personal

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
breakups are never really personal

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.880 
breakups are never really personal
what<00:02:13.150> I<00:02:13.180> realized<00:02:13.630> also<00:02:13.840> along<00:02:14.140> my<00:02:14.380> journey<00:02:14.650> is

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
what I realized also along my journey is

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.410 
what I realized also along my journey is
that<00:02:15.450> rejections<00:02:16.450> or<00:02:16.690> breakups<00:02:17.500> are<00:02:18.030> for<00:02:19.030> a

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
that rejections or breakups are for a

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.540 
that rejections or breakups are for a
specific<00:02:19.930> reason<00:02:20.320> and<00:02:20.890> they're<00:02:21.070> valid

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
specific reason and they're valid

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.610 
specific reason and they're valid
reasons<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.180> you<00:02:22.570> know<00:02:22.660> a<00:02:22.690> lot<00:02:22.810> of<00:02:23.020> people<00:02:23.230> tend

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
reasons to you know a lot of people tend

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.290 
reasons to you know a lot of people tend
to<00:02:23.680> say<00:02:23.890> what's<00:02:24.100> wrong<00:02:24.340> with<00:02:24.400> me<00:02:24.820> whoever

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
to say what's wrong with me whoever

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.120 
to say what's wrong with me whoever
rejected<00:02:25.870> you<00:02:25.990> or<00:02:26.110> whoever<00:02:26.260> they<00:02:26.680> ends<00:02:27.040> up

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
rejected you or whoever they ends up

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.710 
rejected you or whoever they ends up
with<00:02:27.400> you're<00:02:27.760> going<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:27.970> compare<00:02:28.270> yourself

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
with you're going to compare yourself

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.810 
with you're going to compare yourself
with<00:02:28.900> them<00:02:29.260> but<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.770> thing<00:02:29.800> is<00:02:30.160> you<00:02:30.550> can't

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
with them but the thing is you can't

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.790 
with them but the thing is you can't
really<00:02:31.000> compare<00:02:31.480> your<00:02:31.840> value<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.650> them

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
really compare your value to them

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.440 
really compare your value to them
because<00:02:33.100> there's<00:02:33.280> nothing<00:02:33.550> wrong<00:02:33.970> with<00:02:34.030> you

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
because there's nothing wrong with you

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.330 
because there's nothing wrong with you
the<00:02:34.690> only<00:02:34.930> reason<00:02:35.260> they<00:02:35.500> didn't<00:02:35.830> choose<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:36.160> be

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
the only reason they didn't choose to be

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.610 
the only reason they didn't choose to be
with<00:02:36.610> you<00:02:36.790> is<00:02:37.060> because<00:02:37.270> you<00:02:37.810> two<00:02:38.050> don't<00:02:38.290> really

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
with you is because you two don't really

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.710 
with you is because you two don't really
have<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:39.070> right<00:02:39.220> chemistry<00:02:39.730> but<00:02:40.240> things<00:02:40.450> are

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
have the right chemistry but things are

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.930 
have the right chemistry but things are
not<00:02:40.959> aligned<00:02:41.440> for<00:02:41.860> you<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.190> be<00:02:42.280> together<00:02:42.459> you

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
not aligned for you to be together you

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.510 
not aligned for you to be together you
have<00:02:43.450> to<00:02:43.630> realize<00:02:44.350> that<00:02:44.380> relationships<00:02:45.340> and

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
have to realize that relationships and

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.830 
have to realize that relationships and
in<00:02:45.610> order<00:02:45.910> to<00:02:46.030> make<00:02:46.150> a<00:02:46.180> relationship<00:02:46.660> work

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
in order to make a relationship work

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.740 
in order to make a relationship work
it's<00:02:47.500> not<00:02:47.680> just<00:02:47.739> about<00:02:48.280> what<00:02:48.640> certain<00:02:49.330> value

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
it's not just about what certain value

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.110 
it's not just about what certain value
people<00:02:50.470> represent<00:02:51.190> of<00:02:51.400> themselves<00:02:51.880> in

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
people represent of themselves in

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.449 
people represent of themselves in
society<00:02:52.239> but<00:02:52.690> it's<00:02:52.840> also<00:02:53.050> about<00:02:53.290> how<00:02:53.950> you<00:02:54.010> two

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
society but it's also about how you two

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.610 
society but it's also about how you two
get<00:02:54.760> along<00:02:54.880> so<00:02:55.120> I<00:02:55.690> guess<00:02:55.930> what<00:02:56.110> I'm<00:02:56.200> truly

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
get along so I guess what I'm truly

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.350 
get along so I guess what I'm truly
trying<00:02:56.830> to<00:02:56.950> tell<00:02:57.100> you<00:02:57.220> is<00:02:57.370> number<00:02:57.820> one<00:02:58.000> stop

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
trying to tell you is number one stop

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.240 
trying to tell you is number one stop
comparing<00:02:58.720> yourself<00:02:58.930> to<00:02:59.290> anyone<00:02:59.500> because<00:03:00.130> the

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
comparing yourself to anyone because the

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.890 
comparing yourself to anyone because the
reason<00:03:00.519> you<00:03:00.610> feel<00:03:00.790> that<00:03:01.060> about<00:03:01.209> yourself<00:03:01.450> is

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
reason you feel that about yourself is

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.420 
reason you feel that about yourself is
because<00:03:02.170> you're<00:03:02.320> looking<00:03:02.440> at<00:03:02.709> your<00:03:02.860> own<00:03:03.010> value

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
because you're looking at your own value

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.009 
because you're looking at your own value
and<00:03:03.550> you're<00:03:03.670> telling<00:03:03.910> yourself<00:03:04.120> that<00:03:04.420> you<00:03:04.720> are

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
and you're telling yourself that you are

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.500 
and you're telling yourself that you are
less<00:03:05.350> than<00:03:05.380> them<00:03:06.040> see<00:03:06.550> the<00:03:06.670> way<00:03:06.790> I<00:03:06.820> dealt<00:03:07.330> with
