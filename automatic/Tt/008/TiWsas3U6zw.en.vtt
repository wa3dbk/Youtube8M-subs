some<00:00:49.700> top<00:00:50.700> reasons<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.500> hyperpigmentation

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
some top reasons of hyperpigmentation

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.220 
some top reasons of hyperpigmentation
are<00:00:53.280> melasma<00:00:53.640> which<00:00:54.360> happens<00:00:54.809> because<00:00:55.110> of

are melasma which happens because of

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.099 
are melasma which happens because of
hormonal<00:00:55.730> shifts<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:56.879> women<00:00:57.360> particularly

number two overexposure to sunlight
which<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.649> reversible<00:01:02.219> as<00:01:02.520> your<00:01:02.730> exposure

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
which is reversible as your exposure

which is reversible as your exposure
decreases<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.379> type<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.680> hyperpigmentation

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280
