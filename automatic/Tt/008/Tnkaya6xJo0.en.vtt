00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:15.980
 Mouth and tess soup 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:18.740
 Attracting a lot of attention to the furnishings has become a hot topic 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.489
 Forest when actual part 2 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:26.270

 Wipe it off, it's making the treatment diet 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:40.780
 So spread the word to find the one you can see the excavation to increase 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.260
 It's a suit. 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:48.940
 Often at 20, 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:55.899
 First, the kidney function is fairly strong 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:01:01.510
 The second is to promote the healing of damaged cells 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:06.729
 It has the function of boosting the immune system. 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:13.390
 But now there's a lot of recipes . 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:16.420
 I'm a little bit in the way of convenience, so I'll explain the recipe briefly 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:20.649
 I'll give it to you . 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:24.729
 The first is to keep only a few principles. 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:29.770
 The first principle is stale within seuna 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:39.130
 There is music to pack a porcelain bowl, then the next second, 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:40.240
 Will be the most slow cooking is your third place malraneun not water 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.180

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:48.620
 uh 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:52.460
 When touching the minimum, it is best not to keep the shell 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:55.610
 The next is very easy if you keep it. 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:59.390
 There are a lot of ingredients. 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:02.960

 Medium size limit of roots 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:13.940
 If it does not exist, I would like Cellar Lee to have a command. 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:17.720
 Do not throw away just when it was cutting the leaves 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:22.760
 The second , 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:26.600
 There are two smaller ones. The link is probably the original 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.630

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:36.860
 When I was in the West, I wanted to talk. 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:38.490
 We dig it and it's a little different, but you can use two big ones. 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:44.900
 Then, 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:50.760

 When you release control about one is to be good if you can be there too parsley 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:12.990

 Oh, then Jack ingredients are garlic as moderate 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:26.430
 But that's probably because I do not like the people of the world . 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:31.020
 I hope we can put a little bit more 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:35.820

 So it's like a very weak fire for over two hours. 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:53.190
 Google is supposed to counter the time until you just have a potato that flows 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:59.480
 It will be no more than a shape.

 I'm afraid to get rid of the rough parts 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:26.050
 I can keep it in the fridge for a long day. 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:30.010
 You can have a cup of tea in the morning and evening. 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:33.850

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:36.940
