00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:10.209
 hello good let's start applying the 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:12.879
 bicrim perfect green half this is the 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:15.340
 tone number 23 and has the factor of 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.920
 Sunscreen number 42 which 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.170
 quite high we are going to start applying 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.300
 all over the face previously I already 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.420
 I had applied moisturizer you 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.130
 You can use the one you use and I 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.140
 always fourth the area where I have more 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.119
 imperfections that in this case is in the 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.449
 chin and in some area of ​​the 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:38.109
 cheeks that I have quite redness and 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:40.300
 pretty marquitas like of acne because 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:42.249
 you can blur it usually 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.530
 I always do it with my hands with my 

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:47.649
 own fingers because that way he avoided losing 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.809
 both products with a brush or sponge 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.559
 I feel like I lose a lot of life instead 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.960
 with my fingers I can spread the best 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.670
 try to blur all over the face and 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.289
 can do a little more emphasis on 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.969
 the area where they have the most companies you have 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.209
 but generally I use only one 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.209
 cap 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.590
 the idea of ​​applying all over the face 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.720
 and the next step is to use a 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.640
 corrector 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.890
 I'm going to use the salmon corrector 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.530
 give skin food councils 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.570
 this is tone number 01 there are two 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.720
 tones 1 is the lightest and 2 is 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.970
 for medium tone love skin is this 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.110
 Corrector is made based on protein 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.369
 of salmon and its solid guide texture as well 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.430
 that they have to apply it with a lot 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:38.119
 careful not to take out as much product is 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.160
 important to apply it with little force in 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.200
 the area of ​​dark circles because as 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.780
 you know those areas is very delicate 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.450
 on the skin and well thin is important 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.729
 apply it with a lot of caution and I 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.740
 I recommend other videos of others well 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.600
 tutorials do as once 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.759
 a v 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.590
 as the cross first down and 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.150
 after the other side and so we can 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.880
 apply it you have to do so much pressure 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.369
 It is very simple 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.380
 this proofreader I not only used it 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.149
 for ulcers but also what 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.459
 used to cover other imperfections 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.459
 like the ones I mentioned at the beginning 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.990
 let's cover everything you want 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:26.750
 to hide and someone's texture makes 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.750
 that does not look like a layer as a base 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.160
 then we are going to seal all these steps 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.490
 so that they remain fixed during the 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.950
 day and they last us with a translucent powder 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:44.510
 Of the brand 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:47.330
 les w click this is a translucent powder 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.310
 it is white brings its own 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.290
 sponge applicators and as a 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.690
 doser so you do not miss so much 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.940
 powder 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.560
 what we are going to do is apply for 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.830
 the whole face as if it were a powder 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.830
 compact 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.610
 at the beginning they will be a bit white 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.610
 but then the tiniest ones can be 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:10.120
 blur the texture left by this dust 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.739
 it's super cool because it's like texture 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.910
 wax 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.700
 you can blur it with the 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.680
 own sponge or with your fingers 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.000
 reality is to blur it well so that it does not 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.000
 there are some parts so white 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.780
 This step is very simple and helps 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.430
 seal everything you have done now 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.210
 let's apply the tony mask 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:34.210
 mo'nique gatwick eyelash mask and 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:37.180
 the capital is very beautiful and this mask 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:40.480
 is the number one the number one to give 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.820
 volume and number two is to give as 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.470
 curved shape to our eyelashes the 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.530
 brush does not have anything special but if 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:50.350
 it is finite and the texture of this mask 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.850
 of eyelashes is as well and so 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.160
 they have to be careful because they 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.450
 can stain it takes time to dry I think 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.280
 that one or two minutes 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.670
 then we started to apply from the 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.020
 base of the tabs up 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.090
 always from the base 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.870
 and very carefully I had already 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:12.200
 I scolded my tabs previously as 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.510
 it is liquid tends if you do not know 3 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.400
 when it was more complicated to circulate 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.430
 first in what after and then apply 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.380
 the mask 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.110
 a lot of caution not to stain 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.460
 this mask is very good because it gives a 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.460
 tax tab feel 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:46.560
 but that happens to anyone 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.560
 as I told him of the decisions and the 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.560
 liquigás so they can stain 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.640
 and these 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.610
 and wait 12 minutes to dry 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:06.800
 now we are going to apply in 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.870
 our lips the famous belt of tom and 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.000
 molise this ink is made on the basis of 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.620
 natural pigments and you have to apply it 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.300
 very cautiously so that it does not remain 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.300
 so red as wide 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.280
 this is the tone up 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:27.420
 at the beginning red red proposal that 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.060
 Absorb comes to color lips 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.300
 fiddle 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:35.590
 your mind do so to blur well 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.590
 they have a color 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:49.360
 good is more comfortable 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.169
 Y 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:05:58.169
 It is the darkest but 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.580
