center same with the other side so once

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.680 
center same with the other side so once
it's<00:00:59.250> line<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.879> center<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:01.309> grab<00:01:02.690> the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
it's line to the center you grab the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.600 
it's line to the center you grab the
bottom<00:01:04.080> one<00:01:04.589> sheet<00:01:04.920> from<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.220> bottom<00:01:06.380> and

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
then you fold it can also fold these

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:38.179 
then you fold it can also fold these
corners<00:01:36.290> and<00:01:37.290> that's<00:01:37.590> how<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.829> meet<00:01:38.009> the
