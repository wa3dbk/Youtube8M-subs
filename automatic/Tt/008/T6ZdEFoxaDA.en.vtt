protein<00:00:02.250> is<00:00:02.280> one<00:00:02.550> of<00:00:02.639> the<00:00:02.850> most<00:00:03.030> important

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
protein is one of the most important

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.480 
protein is one of the most important
things<00:00:03.720> for<00:00:03.929> everybody<00:00:04.170> to<00:00:04.500> know<00:00:04.529> about<00:00:04.799> we're

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
things for everybody to know about we're

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.639 
things for everybody to know about we're
really<00:00:05.779> what<00:00:06.779> kind<00:00:06.899> of<00:00:06.990> got<00:00:07.109> out<00:00:07.140> of<00:00:07.290> whack

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
really what kind of got out of whack

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.440 
really what kind of got out of whack
when<00:00:07.919> we<00:00:08.069> got<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.280> whole<00:00:08.429> act<00:00:08.670> in<00:00:08.910> is<00:00:09.059> in<00:00:09.210> South

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
when we got the whole act in is in South

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.450 
when we got the whole act in is in South
Beach<00:00:09.719> thing<00:00:10.080> going<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:10.500> that<00:00:10.559> everybody<00:00:11.160> was

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
Beach thing going and that everybody was

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.430 
Beach thing going and that everybody was
I<00:00:11.730> had<00:00:12.240> this<00:00:12.330> idea<00:00:12.480> that<00:00:12.719> you<00:00:12.900> needed<00:00:13.170> vast

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
I had this idea that you needed vast

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.289 
I had this idea that you needed vast
amounts<00:00:14.009> of<00:00:14.009> protein<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.820> particularly

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
amounts of protein and particularly

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.330 
amounts of protein and particularly
animal<00:00:15.780> protein<00:00:16.139> every<00:00:16.320> day<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.949> actual

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
animal protein every day the actual

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.849 
animal protein every day the actual
needs<00:00:17.820> change<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.720> that's<00:00:19.260> important<00:00:19.770> to

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
needs change and that's important to

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.880 
needs change and that's important to
know<00:00:20.010> when<00:00:20.910> you're<00:00:21.090> healthy<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.890> you're

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
know when you're healthy and you're

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.820 
know when you're healthy and you're
active<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:24.210> need<00:00:24.390> roughly<00:00:24.660> 60<00:00:25.289> grams<00:00:25.560> of

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
active you need roughly 60 grams of

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.220 
active you need roughly 60 grams of
protein<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.250> day<00:00:26.340> that's<00:00:26.939> not<00:00:27.090> very<00:00:27.269> much<00:00:27.539> we're

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
protein a day that's not very much we're

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.320 
protein a day that's not very much we're
talking<00:00:28.590> about<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:29.340> know<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.460> handful<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.000> nuts

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330

a chicken breast and a piece of fish for
dinner<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.899> mean<00:00:34.140> we're<00:00:34.320> not<00:00:34.500> talking<00:00:34.920> about<00:00:35.010> a

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
dinner I mean we're not talking about a

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.729 
dinner I mean we're not talking about a
lot<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.460> protein<00:00:35.910> every<00:00:36.149> day<00:00:36.530> if<00:00:37.530> you're

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
lot of protein every day if you're

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.760 
lot of protein every day if you're
vegetarian<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.520> would<00:00:38.610> be<00:00:38.760> beans<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.210> rice<00:00:39.390> in

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
vegetarian it would be beans and rice in

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.680 
vegetarian it would be beans and rice in
approximate<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.920> know<00:00:41.040> one<00:00:41.399> cup<00:00:41.730> amounts<00:00:42.540> at

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
approximate you know one cup amounts at

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.479 
approximate you know one cup amounts at
each<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.989> those<00:00:43.140> meals<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:43.710> it's<00:00:44.160> not<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.399> huge

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
each of those meals so it's not a huge

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.760 
each of those meals so it's not a huge
amount<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:45.090> protein<00:00:45.300> but<00:00:46.260> there<00:00:46.469> are<00:00:46.590> times

your lean mass lean mass being muscles
we<00:01:38.520> think<00:01:38.729> about<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:38.939> as<00:01:39.270> being<00:01:39.390> muscles<00:01:39.840> but

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
we think about that as being muscles but

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.350 
we think about that as being muscles but
remember<00:01:40.619> your<00:01:40.770> heart<00:01:40.979> as<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.189> muscle<00:01:41.579> your

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
remember your heart as a muscle your

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.660 
remember your heart as a muscle your
liver<00:01:42.689> has<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.079> lot<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.380> protein<00:01:43.770> your<00:01:43.979> brain<00:01:44.280> is

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
liver has a lot of protein your brain is

this nice little protein bag filled with
that<00:01:47.070> by<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.369> way<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:49.020> need<00:01:49.259> protein<00:01:49.590> in

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
that by the way so you need protein in

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.560 
that by the way so you need protein in
the<00:01:50.070> appropriate<00:01:50.549> amounts<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.240> can't

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
or a meal if you can identify those

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.060 
or a meal if you can identify those

three big food groups protein fat and
carbohydrate<00:02:17.940> you're<00:02:18.420> doing<00:02:18.690> pretty<00:02:18.930> well

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
carbohydrate you're doing pretty well

carbohydrate you're doing pretty well
try<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:19.950> make<00:02:20.190> sure<00:02:20.220> that<00:02:20.610> protein<00:02:21.000> is<00:02:21.030> in

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
try to make sure that protein is in

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.510 
try to make sure that protein is in
every<00:02:21.540> time<00:02:21.780> but<00:02:22.050> at<00:02:22.140> least<00:02:22.410> in<00:02:22.770> three<00:02:23.100> times<00:02:23.340> a

every time but at least in three times a

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.330 
every time but at least in three times a
day<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:24.240> you'll<00:02:24.750> do<00:02:24.870> pretty<00:02:25.080> well<00:02:25.290> if<00:02:26.100> you're

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
day and you'll do pretty well if you're

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.580 
day and you'll do pretty well if you're
trying<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:26.640> build<00:02:26.970> muscle<00:02:27.360> mass<00:02:27.750> you<00:02:28.080> need

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
trying to build muscle mass you need

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.310 
trying to build muscle mass you need
more<00:02:28.830> if<00:02:29.100> you're<00:02:29.730> sick<00:02:30.000> or<00:02:30.030> injured<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:31.140> need

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
more if you're sick or injured you need

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.580 
more if you're sick or injured you need
more<00:02:31.650> but<00:02:32.460> basically<00:02:32.850> we<00:02:33.450> need<00:02:33.480> roughly<00:02:33.930> 60

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
more but basically we need roughly 60

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.770 
more but basically we need roughly 60
great
