 Some time ago I do not feel like it 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.549

 you will see this file or a rare 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:39.600
 you want to do and so you go 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.580
 in the folder same animators and you 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.880
 go to 20 actually have an executable 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.500
 wrongly manu 0.7 and 11 o'clock so in 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.380
 must be done 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.620
 downloaded the old version 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:54.870
 finally the basic version to be able to 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.180

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:06.450
 So I'll personally I go I want 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:09.480
 export that file to 1 is in 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.880
 done so that's gonna ask you that all 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.820
 simply it will have to merge the 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.850
 two folders for this morning magne 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.140

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.210
 so I'm firmly because I 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:24.750
 has already merged you to export it 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:28.800
 also the executable and the executable is 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:31.080
 this one here and so flow workers in 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.980
 general it works except at the limit for 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.900
