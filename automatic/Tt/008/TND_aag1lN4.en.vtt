00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.799
 we are back and what a good question 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.589
 insist on mcal before going to court 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.750
 eric tell us this part of now with 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:19.970
 all this boom of social networks of 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.830
 soon there are people who say I'm not going to 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.840
 take advantage with a full body 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.630
 but there are people who put in their profile a 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.790
 photo well in theory yours but it's more 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.890
 well of what you want to appear to be 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.020
 that what you really are is clear 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.059
 notice there is something very curious also in 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.130
 that part of physiognomy there is a bit of 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.440
 nonverbal language something very common and 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.329
 now you will know the photos where the 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.760
 girls look up and they take 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.350
 this way teaching a little bit is already 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.600
 well it is a development not 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.280
 inhibition but that I believe when I see 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.920
 up speaks of his mission of my 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.480
 part 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.820
 however a photo down speaks 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.070
 to rain on others with a sense of 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.559
 inferiority towards them I of 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.989
 superiority then the people in 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.259
 their profiles like that they feel 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.909
 less although before that then the 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:11.360
 front photos to the best to three 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:15.009
 rooms et cetera etcetera slightly a 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.009
 little bit up 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.550
 we already talked about my personality 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.690
 I'm dying and surely many 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.640
 followers of vivia to know all those 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.720
 polka dots you have if you can read 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.720
 especially those of the back 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:47.360
 because look at the technique or the 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.310
 reading of that technique is called melanoma 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.409
 ncoa then also has a 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.990
 antecedent in the east and its 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.110
 positioning if it's in the face if it's 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.090
 on one right side of the body 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.890
 the part of the hands or the torso I 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.750
 specifically oriented him a little bit 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.670
 more to what is the face but also 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.830
 in the body has a meaning there 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.110
 what to see in positioning that through a 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.290
 chronological time to my twenties 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.180
 thirty something and see what the 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.860
 example from the side of having to the side 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.150
 I'm the gironÃ¨s apart from the 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.490
 divisions that I mentioned a moment ago 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.290
 has the sides and has to do with 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.000
 family and society then 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.920
 someone who has one more side 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.350
 developed to the other works more his 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.850
 social family what is the mole is 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.709
 in your family part and talk about your 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.360
 emotions and talk about your family the 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.810
 interval that you want to be in the 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:37.390
 threshold of 57 to 60 years is a mole 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.130
 nice is not a dark place or with another 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.770
 kind of features once beautiful are 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.360
 whites and reds there are some rural too 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.910
 little reds that come out or in the 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.430
 back on the arms are good polka dots 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.470
 augury so it is said come to your moles 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.989
 these especially me this way the 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.030
 of the first arm are like blackberry and I see the 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.370
 Big bear and lion 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:02.470
 to grab the same go one by one 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.830
 and name it and suddenly it comes up 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.959
 poetry 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:11.770
 but just talking about that 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.080
 compatibility that we must see to for 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.390
 know what we are going to just take us 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.100
 very clear there are very fundamentals 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.420
 important and someone has a forehead 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.760
 close talking about your intellect 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.709
 creativity and other kinds of causes if 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.600
 there does not have very developed then 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.940
 naturally that bulge or that 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.820
 skin tone is going to be flashy is going to be 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.620
 clean if it is more reduced with hair u 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.360
 other obstructions that person watch 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.850
 intellectual for the best has a 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.769
 chin or jaw developed and of 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.660
 this part and look and also what 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.700
 wide then you have to see those features 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.709
 in compatibility where the 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.840
 affinities not only is that 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:49.420
 appear one person to another is not only 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.340
 that but the proportions although a 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.500
 nose sunk a nose by having before 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:55.390
 a coldness and remember something there is 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.220
 analyze a face in its entirety 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.440
 a trait does not mean only that 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.180
 it's good for this bad for the other that 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.690
 set is going to give a reaffirmation that 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.670
 person 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.940
 It is more complex as we are 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.500
 it 's nothing else this and it's isolated and by 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.180
 what happens that suddenly there are couples who 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.030
 over time they start to 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:16.180
 appear an interesting question 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.030
 notice there are couples where they know each other and 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.180
 you start to mimic your brother you 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.890
 Real brother is my partner they come to 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.750
 times until tele kicking of certain 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.750
 traits in certain of thoughts 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.900
 it only happens until the 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.940
 intimate partner when this happens 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.340
 the traits begin to change is this 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.500
 therefore when couples are in 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.020
 their own scope and they get to have that 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.390
 issue come to exchange that part 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.610
 energy comes to mimic because 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.810
 they know friends when they start to see 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.810
 they lived more bold 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:04.470
 wrinkles and think what they do they say 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.470
 its mouth 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:14.490
 in this topic we are going to talk about 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:17.170
 the children that I want to take advantage of because 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.900
 it's like in a hurry but I want to know 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.970
 why do we sometimes want I do not know about 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.340
 soon there is a lot of frustration with the 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.850
 children you suddenly say is not that my son 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.530
 if it's my copy, because suddenly it 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.240
 He inclines and does something else than I do 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.070
 I would expect him to do the same 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.660
 commented on compatibility you have to see 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.910
 which has developed a part in 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.100
 As for the others of the face, I want 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.690
 be as me as a father or mother and my 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.280
 son has to be he has his own 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.050
 essence and I will have to locate it from the 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.940
 most appropriate way today we are 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.040
 speaking of wisdom then I think that 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.840
 we all have that wisdom so 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:55.950
 innate but how nice that we can 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:06:00.100
 study and develop thank you very much 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:02.110
 for now call me if not but good 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.910
 we can also continue talking about 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:08.280
 graphology as an interesting treasurer 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:11.529
 everything is for twitter in graphology here 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:14.349
 to follow you in this moment 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:16.899
 by the way, do you know what rumbology does 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:19.049
 so if you do not talk with another coffee with 

00:06:16.899 --> 00:06:19.049
 milk 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:25.269
 Thank you 

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:28.289
 thank you thank you for coming to visit 

00:06:25.269 --> 00:06:28.289
 thanks thanks 

00:06:31.709 --> 00:06:39.099
 I think we are predicting a future 

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:41.739
 together I do not know I do not know you cotillones 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:43.799
 you left me without a word that is not something 

00:06:41.739 --> 00:06:47.169
 very interesting loaded it seems to me 

00:06:43.799 --> 00:06:50.229
 fascinating the subject I find interesting 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:54.609
 that beyond knowing us for what 

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:57.699
 we say we can just like a little 

00:06:54.609 --> 00:07:00.759
 this intuitive part and that if you 

00:06:57.699 --> 00:07:03.939
 attracts or not know more I find 

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:05.799
 totally and even grandmothers always 

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:08.049
 they said it look like a guy so 

00:07:05.799 --> 00:07:10.029
 crazy face has accumulated such a look 

00:07:08.049 --> 00:07:12.909
 the face that then I believe this one that 

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:15.830
 gave me the face truth there is also the 

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:17.960
 they spend watching the face 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:21.110
 I think that if there is a deep 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.790
 ancestral knowledge that we're not 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.110
 discovering nothing new suddenly 

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:27.290
 It has always been there and it is very 

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:29.000
 remember important again if you 

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:31.190
 I invited him to return the please me 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.280
 pass your data pass to your no contact and 

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:38.140
 that of dollars look at that mole that has 

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.140
 cute sky next to your mouth 

00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:43.239
 we are also interested in knowing your opinion 

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:44.859
 for that we have our social networks 

00:07:43.239 --> 00:07:47.409
 so they can share with us that 

00:07:44.859 --> 00:07:49.209
 little moon that nobody knows and what of 

00:07:47.409 --> 00:07:51.849
 Soon they want to share it in 

00:07:49.209 --> 00:07:53.379
 a picture for them hammock the nothing else 

00:07:51.849 --> 00:07:56.229
 your appetite opens up when we do 

00:07:53.379 --> 00:07:59.129
 this show true mechanize the movie 

00:07:56.229 --> 00:07:59.129
 Appears pain 

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:04.750
 like the window
