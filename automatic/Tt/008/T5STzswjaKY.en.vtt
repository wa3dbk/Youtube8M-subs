00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.369
 It was from youtube that the speaker is Ross 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.699
 It was a lot today. I was here for you. 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.260
 of the automatic torch stoner that goes 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.029
 put the torch of your whole world 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.220
 automatically lighting so you do not 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.540
 no mobi appears and stay all 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.660
 illuminated 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.120
 the command is simple it is in the 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.149
 description of it is very large only that 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:48.260
 it gave a very good functionality 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:51.770
 for the good game it 's just you come here in na 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.270
 description copy this command and place 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.059
 somewhere in the world you want 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.829
 light it has a radius of ten thousand 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.950
 blocks so he sometimes goes there 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:07.600
 circulate throughout this area 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:07.600
 the block gives a team 7 19 thousand 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.750
 It's not talking furniture because it's the 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.200
 lock in options for now 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.420
 After you delete everything, I'll show you the 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.170
 first time will put the hand put 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:24.009
 of bloch and paste the command here ok 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.849
 after that you will turn to using a 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.470
 history 

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:29.470
 He will start putting torches. 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.150
 good after it stops putting the 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.350
 first phase you want more torches you 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:44.550
 repeating the process has been putting 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:48.080
 continue to put it is realized that it is 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.080
 responding too much touch there in the background is 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.560
 well do you continue this until when you? 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.340
 need but as you can see it is already 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.630
 well lit all over this area 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.920
 it has some small bugs that per 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.479
 example if it falls on top of some 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.280
 half block with a repression plus one in 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.200
 torch will break will fall on the ground then 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.900
 I'm going to look for a place here goes always 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.000
 There are some spots you have if you have played 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.800
 on the ground and knowing a little depends on the 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.290
 biome that you put for example here 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.970
 has a biomas torch that has many 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.200
 so the rate will break well 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.880
 easy but rest is a system that is 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.340
 a hand on the wheel for you that does not want 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.110
 get kicking torch and wasting time 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.019
 illuminating a very large area of â€‹â€‹your 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.560
 map 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:44.790

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.200
 the last three weeks to the 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.970
 time to make video because I
