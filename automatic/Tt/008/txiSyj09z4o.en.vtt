 tunick and the origin of the mini that if you 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.849
 day ago and left my first and last name 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.220
 and fusion in the two in the same word 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:31.220
 what is your style in your videos loquendo 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.770
 my style is to make stories like 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.840
 yours but not for copying me but that 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.150
 just when I do the videos I 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.069
 I inspire with yours what is more 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.890
 it costs you to do in this type of videos 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.870
 that you do good one of the things that most 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.819
 they cost me two are the first is the 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.069
 change of cameras and recordings 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.230
 within the game and the second is to do 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.790
 the voice with the story 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.280
 some secret to reveal about your 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.739
 practice like what January the truth does not 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.660
 I have almost no secrets either 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.790
 I would like to reveal the things that you 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.730
 I would ask you 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.739
 you are not obligated xd in which you are inspired 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.040
 or are you looking for motivation to continue day to 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.989
 day your series good if you allow me I'll 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.689
 to name a couple of users that I 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.299
 inspire the first one that inspired me was 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:19.099
 clown and then I saw some videos that I 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.620
 They liked it but I do not remember what 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:23.480
 users were and then I saw your series and 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.170
 the truth says the series that recently 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.720
 Youtube up a magic a story that 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.079
 I may have several imperfections but 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.939
 good so you learn wrong if 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.010
 You could choose something that is 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:40.159
 automatically do in your videos 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:42.470
 that would be a good question haha 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:44.540
 would like done automatically 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.090
 voices loquendo and camera changes 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.549
 recordings in the game we talked a little 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.859
 of your next series projects that 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:55.010
 your series is your favorite which one do you think 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:57.439
 is the most famous good I do not have almost 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.250
 series I only have one this I named 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:03.590
 previously a magic a story 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.450
 one of my next projects is to do 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.880
 a series better and longer than a 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:13.760
 magic a story in my cows 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:15.650
 of winter 15 07 31 07 I think the most 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.290
 famous is going to be the one I'm going to do in 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.410
 vacation but I currently think that a 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.150
 magic a story some advice for 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.700
 that your followers can follow your 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.010
 road to stardom good the truth 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.380
 I have two tips one is to make a 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.510
 series and that if you really do not like 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.670
 erase everything they did for more than 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.460
 it has cost them a lot because that's how it 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.920
 learn and redo all and my other 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.200
 advice is to practice practicing 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.930
 and practice because that's how one 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.390
 learn new things and how to improve day 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.430
