knocking<00:02:51.290> up<00:02:51.470> day<00:02:52.040> they<00:02:53.000> can't<00:02:53.239> flush<00:02:53.420> away<00:02:53.569> if

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
knocking up day they can't flush away if

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.660 
knocking up day they can't flush away if
they<00:02:53.930> term<00:02:54.440> enough<00:02:54.709> enough<00:02:54.980> don't<00:02:55.250> flash<00:02:55.489> away

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
they term enough enough don't flash away

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.550 
they term enough enough don't flash away
then<00:02:56.000> you<00:02:56.090> will<00:02:56.209> just<00:02:56.239> kill<00:02:56.690> them<00:02:56.780> but<00:02:57.349> if<00:02:57.500> they

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
then you will just kill them but if they

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.880 
then you will just kill them but if they
do<00:02:57.769> flash<00:02:58.010> away<00:02:58.190> you<00:02:58.760> can<00:02:58.970> grab<00:02:59.030> them

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
do flash away you can grab them

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.150 
do flash away you can grab them
easy<00:03:00.040> p<00:03:00.460> and<00:03:01.000> then<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:02.020> second<00:03:02.440> he<00:03:02.890> just

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
easy p and then the second he just

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.670 
easy p and then the second he just
grabbed<00:03:03.700> them<00:03:03.940> but<00:03:04.630> the<00:03:04.930> second<00:03:05.260> is<00:03:05.350> much

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
grabbed them but the second is much

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.090 
grabbed them but the second is much
harder<00:03:06.069> because<00:03:06.400> it's<00:03:07.209> hard<00:03:07.540> to<00:03:07.720> grab<00:03:08.100> the

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
harder because it's hard to grab the

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.490 
harder because it's hard to grab the
first<00:03:09.550> ones<00:03:09.790> much<00:03:10.060> much<00:03:10.300> safer<00:03:10.569> but<00:03:11.260> you<00:03:11.410> know

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
first ones much much safer but you know

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.350 
first ones much much safer but you know
you<00:03:11.560> can<00:03:11.800> also<00:03:11.980> do<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.340> segment<00:03:12.550> and<00:03:13.090> grab

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
you can also do the segment and grab

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.080 
you can also do the segment and grab
them<00:03:13.569> you<00:03:14.200> en<00:03:14.530> they<00:03:15.220> get<00:03:15.370> knocked<00:03:15.610> up<00:03:15.790> it<00:03:15.970> in

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
them you en they get knocked up it in

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.480 
them you en they get knocked up it in
terms<00:03:16.360> of<00:03:16.480> them<00:03:16.660> and<00:03:16.840> you<00:03:16.900> just<00:03:17.080> use<00:03:17.650> your<00:03:17.680> w

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
terms of them and you just use your w

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.330 
terms of them and you just use your w
ultimate<00:03:19.030> then<00:03:19.660> you<00:03:20.380> know<00:03:20.500> their<00:03:20.770> pyramids

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
ultimate then you know their pyramids

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.370 
ultimate then you know their pyramids
are<00:03:21.400> going<00:03:21.580> to<00:03:21.670> die<00:03:21.850> because<00:03:21.880> that<00:03:22.420> combo<00:03:22.870> just

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
are going to die because that combo just

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.050 
are going to die because that combo just
turns<00:03:23.680> to<00:03:23.830> them<00:03:24.010> yes<00:03:24.310> special<00:03:24.430> when<00:03:24.910> your

turns to them yes special when your

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.170 
turns to them yes special when your
ultimate<00:03:25.570> is<00:03:25.810> a<00:03:26.080> silence<00:03:26.739> what<00:03:27.220> I<00:03:27.250> say<00:03:27.670> it's<00:03:27.940> a
