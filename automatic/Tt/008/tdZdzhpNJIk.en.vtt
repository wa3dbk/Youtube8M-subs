little<00:07:19.350> bit<00:07:19.470> i<00:07:19.560> use<00:07:19.770> salt<00:07:20.040> tablets

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:25.040 

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.370 

every<00:07:25.700> race<00:07:25.880> is<00:07:26.120> so<00:07:26.390> different<00:07:26.720> the

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:27.380 
every race is so different the

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.290 
every race is so different the
conditions<00:07:28.130> are<00:07:28.250> so<00:07:28.430> different<00:07:28.730> in<00:07:29.060> because

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:29.300 
conditions are so different in because

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.719 
conditions are so different in because
this<00:07:29.450> is<00:07:29.570> a<00:07:29.600> nighttime<00:07:29.950> discovery

00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:31.729 
this is a nighttime discovery

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:33.189 
this is a nighttime discovery
and<00:07:32.180> I<00:07:32.240> don't<00:07:32.449> really<00:07:32.599> know<00:07:32.809> what<00:07:32.990> to<00:07:33.169> expect

00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:33.199 
and I don't really know what to expect

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:34.999 
and I don't really know what to expect
because<00:07:33.740> I<00:07:34.039> have

00:07:34.999 --> 00:07:35.009 
because I have

00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:37.820 
because I have
quiet<00:07:35.639> by<00:07:35.879> the<00:07:35.939> rules<00:07:36.270> that<00:07:36.449> I<00:07:36.599> know<00:07:36.710> but<00:07:37.710> it

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:37.830 
quiet by the rules that I know but it

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.190
