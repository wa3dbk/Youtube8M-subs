 secure mazda mx-5 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.119
 now come to werner's apartment as it passes 

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:11.589
 I'm sorry, but it ended and died 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:16.299
 exact photo and I have no time to lose or half paris on my trail I believe that 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:17.749
 I owe you an explanation first 

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:19.359
 it's all so confusing 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.990
 I arrived today belluno - weer in a full panic crisis 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.650
 he told me that the fabi contacted did it and I did not expect it not after the 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.259
 Painted Egypt You give me your life 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.880
 accepted an order 5 weeks ago 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.880
 sometimes he behaved very much 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.870
 marco because i keep it 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.200
 his current portable address 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.789
 who got the job from 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:45.830
 from a wine market customer 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.110
 quality that must go 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.110
 basic price of the paintings called dark eyes 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.010

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:56.650
 - czeta 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.550
 what does a large part 1 offer? 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.140
 I wonder why 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.920
 he believed he was being followed 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.320
 it could also be 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.380
 according to the European press our messiah goes around the streets of paris 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.240
 but a little while ago mentioned the diary of verne 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.380
 and in the diary of the discharges. that you were her and you must ad hoc in case there was 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.380
 something happened 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.250
 petrified 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.770
 so it happened 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.370
 what fell to him 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.700
 unfortunately I don't know 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.700
 I remember a Turin cyst discussion 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.190
 when he was killed 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.659
 I don't remember everything is so blurry 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.000
 I hurt myself 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.870
 I really think he should talk to the police 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.260
 if I wanted to get rid of vermeer I would have done it in Egypt 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.110
 don't be convinced even her 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.330
 here I have already lost enough time 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.520
 you have the diary 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.090
 it's time is safe 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.250
 I suggest you give 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.060
 someone there stingy and the flame of not remembering what happened 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.060
 maybe the police injury to suspect her 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.290
 I didn't kill him 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.129
 what about the laptop 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.819
 earth cares for her 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.249
 and neither am I not 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:14.360
 What are you doing 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.389
 no 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:19.179
 I believe it would not be right handed the laptop I called the police 

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:23.319
 I can see you think but I am convinced that this would be what it would have 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.119
 wanted you too
