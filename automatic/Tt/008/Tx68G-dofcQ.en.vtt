circles which are combined on the left

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.480 
circles which are combined on the left
hand<00:02:54.390> side<00:02:54.510> this<00:02:54.840> one's<00:02:55.080> called<00:02:55.260> stereo<00:02:55.920> this

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
hand side this one's called stereo this

good<00:03:06.510> next<00:03:07.470> we<00:03:07.860> twist<00:03:08.130> it<00:03:08.280> man<00:03:08.640> if<00:03:08.880> you<00:03:09.030> score<00:03:09.270> a

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
good next we twist it man if you score a

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.300 
good next we twist it man if you score a
standard<00:03:09.900> little<00:03:10.110> circle<00:03:10.500> this<00:03:10.890> one's<00:03:11.130> called

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
standard little circle this one's called

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.020 
standard little circle this one's called
omnidirectional<00:03:11.970> now<00:03:13.250> which<00:03:14.250> it's<00:03:14.580> almost

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
omnidirectional now which it's almost

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.780 
omnidirectional now which it's almost
exactly<00:03:15.270> the<00:03:15.630> same<00:03:15.750> as<00:03:16.170> stereo<00:03:16.860> but<00:03:17.340> stereo

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
exactly the same as stereo but stereo

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.900 
exactly the same as stereo but stereo
kind<00:03:18.150> of<00:03:18.769> it<00:03:19.769> records<00:03:20.190> everything<00:03:20.250> around<00:03:20.700> you

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
kind of it records everything around you

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.040 
kind of it records everything around you
but<00:03:21.090> kind<00:03:21.330> of<00:03:21.450> distorts<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.670> sound<00:03:24.050> directly

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
but kind of distorts the sound directly

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.600 
but kind of distorts the sound directly
behind<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.769> microphone<00:03:25.950> but<00:03:26.459> what

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
behind the microphone but what

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.699 
behind the microphone but what
omnidirectional<00:03:27.150> does<00:03:27.720> it<00:03:28.110> records

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
omnidirectional does it records

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.090 
omnidirectional does it records
everything<00:03:28.890> at<00:03:29.400> a<00:03:29.430> perfect<00:03:29.760> volume<00:03:30.300> whereas

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
everything at a perfect volume whereas

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.310 
everything at a perfect volume whereas
stereo<00:03:32.100> kind<00:03:32.400> of<00:03:32.459> distorts<00:03:32.970> what's<00:03:33.690> behind<00:03:33.930> it

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
stereo kind of distorts what's behind it

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.830 
stereo kind of distorts what's behind it
slightly<00:03:34.620> so<00:03:35.400> this<00:03:36.030> is<00:03:36.330> perfect<00:03:36.510> for

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
slightly so this is perfect for

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.630 
slightly so this is perfect for
