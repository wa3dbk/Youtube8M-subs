00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.590
 I do not know what the percentage is but 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:26.860
 we arrived well I think the team is 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.030
 committed very involved taking the idea 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:33.410
 of what we are looking for 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:35.300
 and I think today comes with a good time 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.220
 to this party that is fundamental to 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.410
 start of the championship of course 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.580
 nothing to do with the campus past today 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.190
 we have a campus where there is a 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.430
 much more important internal competition 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.890
 where nobody has an insured position 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.750
 where the one that loosens a little bit is going to 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.330
 there is someone behind who is so skilled 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.550
 conditions to play today if we have a 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.190
 much more numerous 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:02.270
 where I repeat the competition again 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:06.620
 internal makes it better and better 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.240
 there will be no names men 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.040
 footballingly speaking but if I play 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.930
 It is important that they know what I want and 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.810
 that they have worked very well is 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.130
 preseason we will compete sides 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:21.460
 to compete sides now 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.950
 there are not so many people there are more people 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.329
 experience that will play the cup and that 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.899
 in that cup they will also win a 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:32.079
 place in the first team so let's go 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:36.759
 to go and look to compete in the two new 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:38.770
 tournaments if you smoke cold driving in a 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.760
 match one standing in our party I 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.330
 he left another stopped 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.400
 and of course it will serve as a test to know 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.880
 what are the scopes to know that 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.340
 we have equipment to compete and that of 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.680
 have won motivates us that we can go to 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.170
 Holly to make an important match 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.450
 knowing that it's different than playing 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.800
 the three points that there are not as many 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.830
 tests that will appear to them 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.070
 some new young people but that the idea 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.830
 and the work we did is based on 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.930
 what we could do in Pachuca to that 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.750
 we're going to throw that we're going to look for 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.220
 Of course, before weighing a 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.810
 championship can not say let's go to 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.640
 qualify you have to play match 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.900
 match as the 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.940
 parties we are going to realize 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.500
 but I feel that today the team is very 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.500
 more strengthened than last season 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.560
 how would you define 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.770
 a team that handles the ball well 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.930
 has a lot of dynamics 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.360
 and that the team has understood 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.200
 perfectly movements that make 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.880
 the opponent has to work hard 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.100
 because the team handles the ball well 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.120
 knows the spaces where you have to 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.590
 look for them and when we do that and what 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.480
 we carry out I think the team looks 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.970
 very well I'm satisfied and happy and 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.340
 happy with the work of the players 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.870
 especially that they have made an effort 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.060
 bigger in this preseason than 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.160
 they are working very well they are 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.260
 working hard and there is good right now 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.940
 that play the games the parties do not 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.610
 can be won or lost before playing 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.620
 we're going to play we will raise it 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.740
 and let's see what is the best way 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.140
 to start with the right foot and 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.750
 returns try to get the team to achieve 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.870
 after so long they entered an area 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.970
 we automatically round robin 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.770
 I would move away from the percentage but we return 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.600
 himself is talk now of liguilla 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.090
 of all that are championships and you have to 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.150
 pass match to match we can not 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.470
 think something else and in that way go 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.470
 growing as a team
