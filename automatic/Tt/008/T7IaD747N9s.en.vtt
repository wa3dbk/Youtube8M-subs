00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.170

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.840
 and pantoja south and tell me about the game 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.640
 it was relatively comfortable how it feels 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.359
 I was in winning this championship on 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:19.070
 first of the year because we never had 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.900
 won these last two years since 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.760
 I've been in school 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.830
 won and this is the first three 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.390
 versions the first championship as you see 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.690
 the competition how you feel 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.130
 there is emea to move forward with the 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.410
 good act we felt super safe 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.699
 because we go to us and you know 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.500
 we have been winning for two consecutive years 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:42.110
 the cup and that is not the last 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.510
 we hope in God that we win in the cup 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.930
 for me, I am proud of the fact 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.940
 a program that we have been working 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.790
 for years even she started before I 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.220
 will arrive cristian military academy and then 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.750
 gives much satisfaction berbel to this that 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.540
 the fruits of work are being seen 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.480
 the development of the mines that we have 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:06.320
 caught from fifth or sixth grade 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.510
 It is a matter of pride to tell me about the 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.460
 start of the year and tell me how it 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.960
 feel because now tournament is missing as 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.659
 crazy so we talked a little bit more 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.369
 about how they are going to do to be able to 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.619
 stay up well to be able to 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.720
 keep us up we will continue 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.700
 playing hard from the beginning with 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.090
 let's keep practicing and give what 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.090
 best of us 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.660
 we will continue practicing and we will be able to win 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.580
 the next tournaments if we keep playing 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.190
 as we are they have a large group 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.750
 there in san ignacio the players like 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.090
 we know almost all of them remained 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.500
 most the regular box 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.720
 we can with them we can 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.180
 win him I think we can all 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.740
 groups now from San Francisco to 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.900
 But we are all equal that all 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.850
 We can give the payment to anyone this 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.650
 year we come to raze we want to win 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.800
 all possible tournaments and give what 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.210
 best of us always good in 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.130
 comparison last year I had a 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.080
 group and a pretty good level 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.790
 this the senior had some players 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.040
 key but we could never fathom 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.500
 I believe that the mixture of the two groups 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.770
 now we have maintained a good balance 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.459
 within the program and then we hope 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.740
 We hope to continue improving in the 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.810
 good year I feel very 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.210
 happy so you did like that 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.070
 work 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.830
 and a lot of sadness because the latter 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.690
 yes, but I'm happy because in the 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.640
 last year but and we could enjoy 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.040
 the game I think this season 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.890
 be very good good competitive a lot 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.050
 much guita was but nothing we follow 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.210
 this we are going to work hard and we hope 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.550
 winning in the strange cup is not 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.620
 guaranteeing the cup and wait I'm going to 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.700
 my team is already a very victory 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.800
 refreshing the first of the year against a 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.710
 excellent team the champions of the 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.410
 last cup disciple 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.930
 the eternal rivals of Carmen school 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.700
 are we defend the house and I think that's 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.880
 the most important thing but this just 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.880
 begins
