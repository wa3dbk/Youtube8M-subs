00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
shoot with my LCD screen especially when

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.539 
shoot with my LCD screen especially when
it's<00:00:12.509> bright<00:00:12.750> out<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.230> stuff<00:00:14.009> like<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:14.309> I

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
it's bright out and stuff like that I

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.720 
it's bright out and stuff like that I
always<00:00:15.059> shoot<00:00:15.240> at<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.949> really<00:00:16.949> low<00:00:16.980> aperture

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
always shoot at a really low aperture

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.560 
always shoot at a really low aperture
like<00:00:18.000> 2.8<00:00:18.720> or<00:00:19.140> three-year<00:00:20.300> whatever

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
like 2.8 or three-year whatever

like 2.8 or three-year whatever
1.4<00:00:22.410> right<00:00:22.680> now<00:00:22.800> I've<00:00:22.920> got<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.189> 50<00:00:23.490> millimeter

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
1.4 right now I've got the 50 millimeter

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.200 
1.4 right now I've got the 50 millimeter
1.4<00:00:24.539> on<00:00:24.660> here<00:00:24.869> I'm<00:00:25.650> going<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.800> show<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:26.180> how<00:00:27.180> I

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
1.4 on here I'm going to show you how I

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.130 
1.4 on here I'm going to show you how I
use<00:00:27.689> my<00:00:27.900> LCD<00:00:28.439> screen<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.710> get<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.039> perfect

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
use my LCD screen to get the perfect

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.350 
use my LCD screen to get the perfect
sharpness<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:32.040> eyes<00:00:32.369> or<00:00:32.820> whatever<00:00:33.180> you're

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
sharpness of the eyes or whatever you're

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.840 
sharpness of the eyes or whatever you're
shooting<00:00:33.660> at<00:00:33.899> as<00:00:34.219> opposed<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.309> using<00:00:35.730> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
shooting at as opposed to using the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.350 
shooting at as opposed to using the
autofocus<00:00:36.420> system<00:00:36.780> which<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:38.360> basically

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
autofocus system which is basically

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.360 
autofocus system which is basically
worthless<00:00:40.050> when<00:00:40.500> you're<00:00:40.649> using<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:40.950> shallow

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
worthless when you're using that shallow

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.799 
worthless when you're using that shallow
depth<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.760> field<00:00:42.410> but<00:00:43.410> I'll<00:00:43.530> show<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.739> how<00:00:44.160> I

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
depth of field but I'll show you how I

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.350 
depth of field but I'll show you how I
have<00:00:45.809> my<00:00:45.989> screen<00:00:46.230> set<00:00:46.500> up<00:00:46.910> if<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.059> can<00:00:48.120> just

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
have my screen set up if I can just

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.479 
have my screen set up if I can just
focus<00:00:48.570> here<00:00:50.270> so<00:00:51.270> right<00:00:51.690> now<00:00:51.870> I've<00:00:52.829> got<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
focus here so right now I've got the

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:02.090 
focus here so right now I've got the
grids<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.800> I've<00:00:55.800> got<00:00:56.190> my<00:00:57.289> histogram<00:00:58.340> and<00:01:01.100> I'm

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
grids on I've got my histogram and I'm

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.469 
grids on I've got my histogram and I'm
going<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.309> put<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.520> back<00:01:02.609> on<00:01:02.670> manual<00:01:03.239> focus<00:01:03.270> so

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
going to put it back on manual focus so

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.480 
going to put it back on manual focus so
to<00:01:06.479> get<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.689> those<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:07.500> go<00:01:08.159> into<00:01:08.310> your

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
to get to those you just go into your

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.179 
to get to those you just go into your
info<00:01:09.030> when<00:01:09.720> you're<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.049> live<00:01:10.229> view<00:01:10.409> and

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
info when you're on the live view and

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.550 
info when you're on the live view and
you're<00:01:11.310> going<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.490> cycle<00:01:11.850> through<00:01:12.470> but<00:01:13.470> the

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
you're going to cycle through but the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.740 
you're going to cycle through but the
histogram<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.070> going<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.340> show<00:01:14.490> you<00:01:14.549> if<00:01:14.970> you're

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
histogram is going to show you if you're

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.870 
histogram is going to show you if you're
blowing<00:01:16.290> out<00:01:16.439> your<00:01:16.470> highlights<00:01:17.009> if<00:01:17.700> you're

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
blowing out your highlights if you're

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.109 
blowing out your highlights if you're
blowing<00:01:18.210> out<00:01:18.360> your<00:01:18.590> darks<00:01:19.640> see<00:01:20.640> if<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:20.820> move<00:01:21.000> it

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
blowing out your darks see if I move it

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.330 
blowing out your darks see if I move it
to<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.360> light<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:22.020> can<00:01:22.049> see<00:01:22.229> these<00:01:22.380> spikes<00:01:23.130> on

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
to the light you can see these spikes on

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.990 
to the light you can see these spikes on
the<00:01:23.430> right<00:01:23.610> here<00:01:25.100> if<00:01:26.100> they're<00:01:26.400> if<00:01:26.580> there's<00:01:26.790> big

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
the right here if they're if there's big

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.789 
the right here if they're if there's big
spikes<00:01:27.360> on<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.630> right<00:01:27.810> or<00:01:28.049> big<00:01:28.320> spikes<00:01:28.560> on<00:01:28.710> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
spikes on the right or big spikes on the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.069 
spikes on the right or big spikes on the
left<00:01:29.040> you're<00:01:29.549> going<00:01:29.670> to<00:01:29.759> get<00:01:29.939> lose<00:01:30.420> detail<00:01:30.840> in

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
left you're going to get lose detail in

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.499 
left you're going to get lose detail in
the<00:01:31.290> lights<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.310> darks<00:01:32.340> lights<00:01:33.299> are<00:01:33.479> on

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
the lights and the darks lights are on

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.020 
the lights and the darks lights are on
this<00:01:33.750> side<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:35.280> darks<00:01:35.549> are<00:01:35.640> on<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.820> left

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
this side and the darks are on the left

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.280 
this side and the darks are on the left
but<00:01:36.990> what<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.229> want<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.560> nice<00:01:38.009> even

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
but what you want is a nice even

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
but what you want is a nice even
histogram<00:01:40.290> everything<00:01:40.740> kind<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.189> the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
histogram everything kind of in the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.319 
histogram everything kind of in the
middle<00:01:42.409> so<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.890> reason<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.399> switch<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.030> is

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
middle so the reason I switch to that is

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.090 
middle so the reason I switch to that is
because<00:01:45.780> sometimes<00:01:46.079> I'm<00:01:46.530> shooting<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.009> the

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
because sometimes I'm shooting in the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.520 
because sometimes I'm shooting in the
sunlight<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:48.140> ooh<00:01:49.140> I'm<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.100> defocusing<00:01:51.530> but

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
sunlight and ooh I'm a defocusing but

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.170 
sunlight and ooh I'm a defocusing but
yeah<00:01:52.649> I'm<00:01:52.770> shooting<00:01:53.220> in<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.399> sunlight<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.820> lot

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
yeah I'm shooting in the sunlight a lot

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.060 
yeah I'm shooting in the sunlight a lot
of<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.360> times<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:55.189> I<00:01:57.439> mean<00:01:58.439> wouldn't<00:01:58.710> when

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
of the times and I mean wouldn't when

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.950 
of the times and I mean wouldn't when
it's<00:01:59.219> really<00:02:00.119> bright<00:02:00.360> out<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.869> you're

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
it's really bright out and you're

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.410 
it's really bright out and you're
looking<00:02:01.229> at<00:02:01.290> your<00:02:01.350> LCD<00:02:02.210> you're<00:02:03.210> going<00:02:03.360> to

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
looking at your LCD you're going to

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.819 
looking at your LCD you're going to
think<00:02:03.719> oh<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.079> looks<00:02:04.290> good

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
think oh it looks good

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.800 
think oh it looks good
but<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.579> could<00:02:05.820> be<00:02:05.939> like<00:02:06.119> super<00:02:06.570> bright

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
but it could be like super bright

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.999 
but it could be like super bright
because<00:02:08.390> when<00:02:09.390> it's<00:02:09.509> bright<00:02:09.750> out<00:02:09.959> your<00:02:10.500> LCDs

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
because when it's bright out your LCDs

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.030 
because when it's bright out your LCDs
bright<00:02:11.280> you're<00:02:11.520> thinking<00:02:11.879> wow

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
bright you're thinking wow

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.580 
bright you're thinking wow
nice<00:02:13.310> exposure<00:02:13.700> but<00:02:14.629> when<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:15.019> bring<00:02:15.290> it<00:02:15.469> back

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
nice exposure but when you bring it back

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.819 
nice exposure but when you bring it back
into<00:02:15.769> your<00:02:15.920> computer<00:02:16.400> it's<00:02:17.180> going<00:02:17.239> to<00:02:17.420> look

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 
into your computer it's going to look

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.770 
into your computer it's going to look
probably<00:02:18.829> a<00:02:18.859> little<00:02:18.950> blown<00:02:19.219> out<00:02:19.430> so<00:02:19.780> this

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
probably a little blown out so this

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.459 
probably a little blown out so this
histogram<00:02:21.079> will<00:02:21.379> give<00:02:21.500> you<00:02:21.620> a<00:02:21.650> good<00:02:21.799> idea<00:02:21.859> of

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:23.469 
histogram will give you a good idea of

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:26.110 
histogram will give you a good idea of
how<00:02:24.469> to<00:02:24.530> read<00:02:24.920> that<00:02:25.159> in<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.640> bright<00:02:25.819> sunlight

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
how to read that in the bright sunlight

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.830 
how to read that in the bright sunlight
and<00:02:26.569> stuff<00:02:26.870> so<00:02:27.769> you<00:02:27.859> don't<00:02:28.329> get<00:02:29.329> worthless

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
and stuff so you don't get worthless

close close close there we go what I do
is<00:03:04.939> I'll<00:03:05.889> zoom<00:03:06.889> in<00:03:07.129> which<00:03:07.879> is<00:03:08.090> this<00:03:08.419> button

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:08.689 
is I'll zoom in which is this button

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:14.559

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
right here you can zoom in boom boom

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.430 
right here you can zoom in boom boom
then<00:03:15.230> you'll<00:03:15.620> manually<00:03:16.310> focus<00:03:16.760> on<00:03:17.720> the

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
then you'll manually focus on the

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.030 
then you'll manually focus on the
quarter<00:03:18.829> right<00:03:19.400> now<00:03:19.549> I'm<00:03:19.699> at<00:03:19.790> 1.4<00:03:21.699> okay<00:03:22.699> and

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
quarter right now I'm at 1.4 okay and

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.189 
quarter right now I'm at 1.4 okay and
then<00:03:25.040> I<00:03:25.310> take<00:03:25.639> the<00:03:25.790> shot<00:03:26.000> see<00:03:26.479> my<00:03:26.629> histogram<00:03:27.049> is

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:27.199 
then I take the shot see my histogram is

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:29.619 
then I take the shot see my histogram is
kind<00:03:27.379> of<00:03:27.470> all<00:03:27.590> in<00:03:27.739> the<00:03:27.829> middle<00:03:28.510> adjust<00:03:29.510> your

00:03:29.619 --> 00:03:29.629 
kind of all in the middle adjust your

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:33.580 
kind of all in the middle adjust your
shutter<00:03:29.659> speed<00:03:30.940> back<00:03:31.940> and<00:03:32.120> forth<00:03:32.409> until<00:03:33.409> it's

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
shutter speed back and forth until it's

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.189 
shutter speed back and forth until it's
in<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.769> middle<00:03:34.010> there<00:03:34.159> but<00:03:34.870> nothing<00:03:35.870> is<00:03:35.959> blown

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:36.199 
in the middle there but nothing is blown

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:38.409 
in the middle there but nothing is blown
out<00:03:36.229> I<00:03:36.739> got<00:03:37.099> my<00:03:37.250> focus<00:03:37.489> right<00:03:37.879> where<00:03:38.030> I<00:03:38.060> want<00:03:38.299> it

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:38.419 
out I got my focus right where I want it

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:44.789 
out I got my focus right where I want it
and<00:03:40.209> now<00:03:41.209> I'm<00:03:41.359> going<00:03:41.510> to<00:03:41.569> take<00:03:41.720> the<00:03:41.840> picture

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.550 

okay<00:03:45.799> nice<00:03:46.459> exposure<00:03:47.229> everything<00:03:48.229> looks<00:03:48.379> good

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
okay nice exposure everything looks good

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.469 
okay nice exposure everything looks good
and<00:03:48.739> I'll<00:03:48.919> pop<00:03:49.129> these<00:03:49.310> up<00:03:49.519> on<00:03:49.669> the<00:03:49.699> the<00:03:50.180> screen

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:50.479 
and I'll pop these up on the the screen

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:57.339 
and I'll pop these up on the the screen
-<00:03:52.060> all<00:03:53.060> right<00:03:53.209> now<00:03:53.389> let<00:03:54.049> me<00:03:54.139> switch<00:03:54.409> to<00:03:56.349> manual

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
- all right now let me switch to manual

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.390 
- all right now let me switch to manual
focus<00:03:57.919> and<00:03:59.109> we'll<00:04:00.109> see<00:04:00.290> how<00:04:00.530> or<00:04:00.799> I<00:04:00.829> mean<00:04:01.040> auto

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
focus and we'll see how or I mean auto

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.939 
focus and we'll see how or I mean auto
focus<00:04:01.790> and<00:04:01.939> we'll<00:04:02.120> see<00:04:02.269> how<00:04:03.139> that<00:04:03.379> works<00:04:03.620> with

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:03.949 
focus and we'll see how that works with

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:07.830 
focus and we'll see how that works with
the<00:04:04.449> system<00:04:05.449> and<00:04:05.629> how<00:04:05.780> well<00:04:06.049> it<00:04:06.169> does<00:04:06.349> with<00:04:06.560> 1.4

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
the system and how well it does with 1.4

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.479 
the system and how well it does with 1.4
aperture<00:04:09.609> so<00:04:10.609> I'm<00:04:10.759> going<00:04:10.909> to<00:04:10.970> just<00:04:12.310> move<00:04:13.310> in

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
aperture so I'm going to just move in

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.270 
aperture so I'm going to just move in
like<00:04:13.669> this<00:04:13.939> I'm<00:04:14.239> going<00:04:14.359> to<00:04:14.419> put<00:04:14.509> my<00:04:14.750> square<00:04:15.280> my

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
like this I'm going to put my square my

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.810 
like this I'm going to put my square my
focusing<00:04:16.759> point<00:04:17.000> right<00:04:17.389> on<00:04:17.539> the<00:04:17.630> quarter

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
focusing point right on the quarter

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.390 
focusing point right on the quarter
right<00:04:19.820> now<00:04:19.970> my<00:04:20.239> metering<00:04:20.930> system<00:04:21.500> inside<00:04:22.039> is

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
right now my metering system inside is

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.839 
right now my metering system inside is
going<00:04:23.330> up<00:04:23.510> and<00:04:23.659> down<00:04:23.810> so<00:04:24.349> it's<00:04:24.580> really<00:04:25.580> tough

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:25.849 
going up and down so it's really tough

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:26.410 
going up and down so it's really tough
to<00:04:25.909> know

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
to know

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.410 
to know
what<00:04:26.600> my<00:04:26.930> exposure<00:04:27.350> is<00:04:28.030> it's<00:04:29.030> just<00:04:29.120> like

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
what my exposure is it's just like

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.050 
what my exposure is it's just like
moving<00:04:29.810> with<00:04:29.990> every<00:04:30.290> little<00:04:30.440> shake<00:04:30.800> of<00:04:31.220> me<00:04:31.790> you

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
moving with every little shake of me you

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.960 
moving with every little shake of me you
know<00:04:32.150> going<00:04:32.480> back<00:04:32.630> and<00:04:32.780> forth<00:04:33.130> so<00:04:34.130> I'm<00:04:34.790> just

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
know going back and forth so I'm just

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.220 
know going back and forth so I'm just
going<00:04:35.090> to<00:04:35.150> try<00:04:35.450> and<00:04:35.630> wing<00:04:35.840> it

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:36.230 
going to try and wing it

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.640 
going to try and wing it
even<00:04:37.190> at<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:37.370> quarter<00:04:37.960> at<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.020> focusing

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
even at the quarter at the focusing

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:46.540 
even at the quarter at the focusing
square<00:04:39.920> there<00:04:40.160> and<00:04:41.140> take<00:04:42.140> it<00:04:42.290> right<00:04:44.440> there<00:04:45.550> you

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
square there and take it right there you

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.080 
square there and take it right there you
can<00:04:46.700> see<00:04:46.970> my<00:04:47.600> camera<00:04:47.660> put<00:04:48.200> a<00:04:48.230> little<00:04:48.500> loud<00:04:49.090> red

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
can see my camera put a little loud red

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.650 
can see my camera put a little loud red
square<00:04:50.510> right<00:04:51.230> where<00:04:51.440> the<00:04:51.590> quarter<00:04:51.920> was<00:04:52.070> and

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
square right where the quarter was and
