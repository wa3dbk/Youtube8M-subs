00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.900
 the bluetooth speaker is on a huge 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.420
 advance almost every manufacturer 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.130
 brings such a compact device from that 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.289
 you can operate with your smartphone for 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.240
 nice a mess of music but unfortunately 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.910
 are not all manufacturers 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.539
 equally good not the samsung level 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.539
 boxing 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.120
 Samsung Level Boxing is the content of the 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.580
 you a flower 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.190
 bose soundlink mini a version of sony 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.250
 and even a version of the unknown 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.920
 now notice audio and that means 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.050
 small easy to operate and reasonable 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.030
 sound but unfortunately it lacks in one 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.100
 number of planes in this device is so 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.710
 the range is quite limited I think the bass 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.630
 not so very good and the battery is smoke 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.360
 fairly moderate 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.070
 hey let him order the via micro usb cable 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.570
 samsung level book should take 15 hours 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.970
 but we tried 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.430
 He does not therefore often charge via 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.170
 micro-usb you control this samsung level 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.180
 box so via blood you can do that 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.590
 by pairing one yourself, but that is also possible 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.479
 via nfc 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.680
 you have a connection faster 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.259
 only four buttons on the device 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.460
 namely a harder softer or switch 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.020
 button well we all know that 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.970
 then have about all specifications 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.400
 of one thing he did see is over 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.229
 pretty nice that you can not say anything about 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.650
 with a matte green are aluminum 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.650
 housing 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.210
 and well tobias with it 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.620
 yes well with a big understood tobias 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.979
 overall well such a beat i still have 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.979
 we must go 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.060
 you 're live on how to break wire 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:54.140
 spectacular is that hello i want to go there 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:55.430
 once say hello to this then 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.250
 of course demand and you must buy it 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.080
 I just say no why not 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.940
 there is one in almost every area 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.010
 competitor that performs better 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.140
 you see a flower better the sound 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.280
 the above link mobile mini something 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.649
 nicer 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.090
 and now the audio is yes do it is audio 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.900
 just weird brand and as always nice to 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.299
 to have 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.820
 so then this gadget can only cost 180 euros 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:18.049
 costs I think it is wasted money 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.360
 personally I would always be for you 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.959
 bomb because it is splashproof and 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.959
 can take a beating
