00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.700
 Today I want to tell you how we are 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.470
 our high build a little 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.950
 Individual steps were taken to enable him to do so 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.570
 are also certain details to build 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:25.480
 we made the ground and that 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.250
 was easy even in wet weather 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.730
 can come in without muddy feet too 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.609
 to get 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.290
 it is important that the distance from 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.510
 one side to the other is not bigger 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.090
 as the length of the poor of each 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.130
 position off even the end 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.360
 the plants can be reached for 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.309
 the good editing certainly 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.660
 stones have been decided on 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.559
 miter cut so that they are beautiful too 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.559
 fit each other 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.930
 a very elaborate job 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.300
 but in turn first the 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.210
 foundations give 80 centimeters deep and 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.710
 40 centimeters wide you can see 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.710
 Here even the contours of the high-way 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.990
 Now the concrete in the fundament 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.380
 give introduced here you can see 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.270
 the probation 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.280
 The basic scarf boards are finished in 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:20.470
 background just give to the 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:24.119
 slope the gaps for the later 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.119
 are filled up with earth 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.479
 also be in the raised bed housing uninvited 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.069
 Guests 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.979
 That's why we're adding wire 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:34.810
 protect the plants from the tracks 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.940
 are laid crosswise so that also the 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.940
 smallest camp is no loophole 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.670
 despite the fine-meshed network remains 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.270
 the contact to the popular ground zone 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.270
 receive 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.770
 The first stone row is in the mortar 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.659
 bed disassembled to eventual 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.390
 irregularities in the level of 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.560
 to be able to compensate for 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:09.140
 at the same time, that's how the grave gets 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.910
 Fabric fixed around the shown by all 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.069
 good for the plants 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.870
 we have a somewhat intricate shape 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.769
 chosen 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.150
 That's why almost every stone has to 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.150
 be cut accordingly 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.440
 the following series are with frost 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.280
 a tile adhesive together 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.290
 each stone is connected individually 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.819
 the already hammer and the spirit level in 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.819
 brought his final position 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.180
 finished a whole week we have 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.180
 worked this artwork 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.930
 for the ground we have our rest 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.420
 Concrete stone with a border 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:53.220
 greywacke lent that holds the feet 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.220
 moist weather much free 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.850
 Now we bring in the upper frieze 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:05.820
 an old celtic sundial to which we 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:08.010
 found on the flea market place 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.740
 we make out the side walls with nap foil 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.770
 Separate concrete stone and earth 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.330
 So can the cement out of the stone 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.780
 and the good ground not with each other 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.790
 after we connect the bottom 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.260
 area with traveling for better drainage 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.290
 and have filled aeration 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.220
 simple bottom of the soil introduced 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.530
 Finally , we fill the last ten 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.300
 meter with bio special earth for the 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.300
 organic gardeners are getting high 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.760
 Now our raised bed is ready for use 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.710
 and we can start planting 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:47.930
 and soon our raised bed will look like that 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:50.340
 i feel well in my book 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.110
 Everything can be easily reached and 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.930
 to work on and the plants you see 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.120
 it thrive may need 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.130
 after all, if it did 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.620
 then send me a picture 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:05.780
 so that i can show to others too 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.780
 until then see you
