00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.559
 the frame will practically stay down there 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:43.330
 a little bit to go along with the base with the whole 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:48.440
 nonsense already and with 3 walls 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:53.690
 I'll show you a little warming 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:58.160
 that is, the bottom row here it is the bottom 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:03.280
 the row has already been warmed up 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:07.630
 top of the rest and then put the frame 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.630
 decided to take off is not quite dark yet 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.000

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:18.680
 let me finish there this one 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.010
 a falcon here and here and this wall 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:28.190
 will be ready jo gras you can start already 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:32.330
 on the mounting plates here 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.120
 corner stands me just took two 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.590
 profile 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.870
 bent them bent welding youtube by 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.450
 grabbed inhaled 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.560
 up to 90 degrees the angles turned out so 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.820
 enough 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.960
 rigid construction the same thing done 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.560
 from this side i mean rotten very 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.340
 tough 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:58.970
 strong well and so live it just 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.990
 welding tacks are small then this 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.700
 all zinc primer welding don then 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.940
 will fall and get such a hard angle 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.239
 which keeps only here on these 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:16.370
 here are guides and here on these 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:19.489
 crossbar stenochka looks like this all 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.950
 wonderful rovnenko from this side then 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.170
 we have the same thing 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:28.880
 if you look 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:34.580
 all cool here hung up now 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:37.580
 remove the three legs here this panel which 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.580
 will stand on the foundation on the base here 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.209
 she hung such panels for a couple 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:50.840
 screws here just to see what 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:53.840
 This gap is obtained which 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.239
 below it will be covered with metal 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.000
 brown just then there 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.910
 will be installed as well 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.709
 starting bar on this metal and already 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.760
 it will be mounted on the bottom panel because 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:09.290
 which is not reinforcement from the back side 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:14.930
 I can't see it later, I'll show you when I start 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:19.040
 mount an agenda here will ebb 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:21.830
 which will close the attachment points and then 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.790
 start bar again and went mounting 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.549
 already all panels 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:33.350
 wall they will be somewhat different so 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:36.799
 that tomorrow I plan to start making sokal 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.829
 the whole is also here 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:43.609
 angles will be special set 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:45.890
 plastic panels on vinyl-type 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:50.390
 siding something just a little bit well 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.530
 stronger stronger as if not for durability 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.780
 they liked 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.700
 I do not know how about the fragility will be in winter 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.340
 Well, in principle, this is probably no one 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:03.260
 actual hammer no one will 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:06.430
 thresh so now is not yet 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:10.910
 it got dark yes here you will make another corner 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:14.680
 surely here and not quite yet 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:18.739
 it's dark now I will quickly finish 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:22.780
 This part of the cap is literally here. 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:25.250
 left three trims 2 Alla put and 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:29.530
 everything 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:32.870
 and you can begin to do the very base 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:36.890
 also made of framed windows 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:39.710
 separately all at 90 degrees right here 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:42.290
 regarding the window there will still be 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:47.420
 additionally insulate it while here 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:50.260
 wrapped up in general all hello bye till 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.260
