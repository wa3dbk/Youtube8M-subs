00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:49.240 
good idea you could create absolutely

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.420

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
has to be online so it works by doing

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.930 
has to be online so it works by doing
this<00:01:14.020> and<00:01:14.320> these<00:01:14.590> both<00:01:14.920> have<00:01:15.159> to<00:01:15.310> go<00:01:15.430> off<00:01:15.610> for

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
this and these both have to go off for

this and these both have to go off for
it<00:01:15.970> to<00:01:16.150> activate<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:17.710> can<00:01:17.860> also<00:01:18.010> create

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
it to activate you can also create

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.640 
it to activate you can also create
piston<00:01:19.000> doors<00:01:19.270> so<00:01:19.659> for<00:01:19.840> instance<00:01:19.900> your<00:01:20.440> base

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
piston doors so for instance your base

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.530 
piston doors so for instance your base
will<00:01:20.950> close<00:01:21.159> up<00:01:21.190> when<00:01:21.640> you're<00:01:21.790> offline<00:01:22.240> and

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
will close up when you're offline and

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.990 
will close up when you're offline and
you<00:01:23.470> can<00:01:23.620> also<00:01:23.740> create<00:01:24.040> things<00:01:24.340> like<00:01:24.580> this<00:01:24.729> rip

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
you can also create things like this rip

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.149 
you can also create things like this rip
dispenser<00:01:25.690> minecart<00:01:26.229> when<00:01:26.409> you<00:01:26.530> login<00:01:26.740> and

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
dispenser minecart when you login and

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:28.590 
dispenser minecart when you login and
that<00:01:27.430> way<00:01:27.580> you<00:01:27.640> can<00:01:27.940> actually<00:01:28.090> use<00:01:28.299> the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
that way you can actually use the

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.180 
that way you can actually use the
minecart<00:01:29.080> to<00:01:29.229> get<00:01:29.350> to<00:01:29.470> your<00:01:29.530> base<00:01:29.710> or<00:01:29.979> things

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
minecart to get to your base or things

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.340 
minecart to get to your base or things
like<00:01:30.310> that<00:01:30.430> and<00:01:31.420> then<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:31.690> final<00:01:31.840> one<00:01:32.049> I've

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
like that and then the final one I've

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.440 
like that and then the final one I've
got<00:01:32.560> an<00:01:32.680> iron<00:01:32.830> door<00:01:33.130> here<00:01:33.430> so<00:01:33.700> inside<00:01:34.120> there's

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
got an iron door here so inside there's

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.600 
got an iron door here so inside there's
a<00:01:34.510> redstone<00:01:34.780> circuit<00:01:35.200> when<00:01:36.130> you<00:01:36.159> are<00:01:36.400> flying

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
a redstone circuit when you are flying

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.880 
a redstone circuit when you are flying
it's<00:01:36.940> closed<00:01:37.270> so<00:01:38.110> I<00:01:38.140> think<00:01:38.409> this<00:01:38.470> plugin<00:01:38.710> is

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
it's closed so I think this plugin is

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.530 
it's closed so I think this plugin is
really<00:01:39.280> good<00:01:39.430> i'll<00:01:39.580> quickly<00:01:39.790> login<00:01:40.180> just<00:01:40.420> to

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
really good i'll quickly login just to

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.830 
really good i'll quickly login just to
show<00:01:40.690> you<00:01:40.720> everything<00:01:41.080> activating<00:01:42.690> as<00:01:43.690> you

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
show you everything activating as you

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.899 
show you everything activating as you
can<00:01:43.930> see<00:01:44.110> the<00:01:44.260> doors<00:01:44.500> have<00:01:44.680> activated<00:01:45.070> mine

redstone circuit for the door so down

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.380 
redstone circuit for the door so down
here<00:01:58.360> I've<00:01:58.600> got<00:01:58.810> my<00:01:58.930> online<00:01:59.260> sign<00:01:59.680> and<00:02:00.330> just<00:02:01.330> to

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
here I've got my online sign and just to

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.760 
here I've got my online sign and just to
prove<00:02:01.510> that<00:02:01.630> it<00:02:01.869> can<00:02:02.020> all<00:02:02.170> be<00:02:02.200> covered<00:02:02.560> up

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
prove that it can all be covered up

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.550 
prove that it can all be covered up
under<00:02:03.040> the<00:02:03.130> house

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.560

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
so as you can see the red stone door

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.330 
so as you can see the red stone door
works<00:02:07.810> you<00:02:08.200> can<00:02:08.319> have<00:02:08.440> your<00:02:08.530> chest<00:02:08.830> everything

is protected as soon as you log off your
door<00:02:11.230> closes<00:02:12.569> so<00:02:13.569> this<00:02:14.020> one's<00:02:14.260> obviously

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
door closes so this one's obviously

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.800 
door closes so this one's obviously
activated<00:02:15.220> now<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.700> as<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.239> can<00:02:16.390> see<00:02:16.420> it's

activated now and as you can see it's

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.470 
activated now and as you can see it's
messaged<00:02:17.410> so<00:02:18.310> I<00:02:18.340> didn't<00:02:18.880> type<00:02:19.030> that<00:02:19.060> in<00:02:19.330> it

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
messaged so I didn't type that in it

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.940 
messaged so I didn't type that in it
just<00:02:19.660> had<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:20.020> message<00:02:20.349> from<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.650> command

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
just had the message from the command

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.190 
just had the message from the command
block<00:02:21.069> and<00:02:21.400> this<00:02:22.300> one's<00:02:22.540> now<00:02:22.720> come<00:02:22.900> on<00:02:22.959> which

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
block and this one's now come on which

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.500 
block and this one's now come on which
was<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.500> first<00:02:23.680> one<00:02:23.860> we've<00:02:24.010> created<00:02:24.360> so<00:02:25.360> now

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
was the first one we've created so now

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.449 
was the first one we've created so now
this<00:02:25.690> one<00:02:25.930> if<00:02:26.050> I<00:02:26.170> activate<00:02:26.590> that<00:02:26.769> should

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
this one if I activate that should

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.940 
this one if I activate that should
actually<00:02:27.610> activate<00:02:28.269> it<00:02:28.450> as<00:02:28.599> you<00:02:28.690> can<00:02:28.810> see<00:02:31.950> so

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
actually activate it as you can see so

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.089 
actually activate it as you can see so
that<00:02:32.980> worked<00:02:33.849> perfectly<00:02:34.620> so<00:02:35.620> I<00:02:35.650> really<00:02:35.950> like

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
that worked perfectly so I really like

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.320 
that worked perfectly so I really like
this<00:02:36.250> plug-in<00:02:36.519> I<00:02:36.700> think<00:02:36.910> it'd<00:02:37.000> be<00:02:37.090> great<00:02:37.300> for

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
this plug-in I think it'd be great for

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.600 
this plug-in I think it'd be great for
VIP<00:02:37.780> users<00:02:38.440> they<00:02:38.650> can<00:02:38.830> use<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.130> to<00:02:39.250> lock<00:02:39.400> their

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
VIP users they can use it to lock their

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.309 
VIP users they can use it to lock their
doors<00:02:39.880> they<00:02:40.239> can<00:02:40.390> only<00:02:40.510> create<00:02:40.720> signs<00:02:41.080> for

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
doors they can only create signs for

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.660 
doors they can only create signs for
themselves<00:02:41.680> as<00:02:41.860> well<00:02:42.100> which<00:02:42.280> is<00:02:42.310> a<00:02:42.489> good

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
themselves as well which is a good

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.390 
themselves as well which is a good
feature<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.330> I<00:02:44.230> think<00:02:44.530> it'd<00:02:44.620> just<00:02:44.950> be<00:02:45.160> used

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
feature and I think it'd just be used

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.160 
feature and I think it'd just be used
for<00:02:45.580> saving<00:02:45.850> different<00:02:46.180> features<00:02:46.600> I<00:02:46.810> mean

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
for saving different features I mean

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.780 
for saving different features I mean
I've<00:02:47.380> only<00:02:47.470> showed<00:02:47.799> a<00:02:47.890> few<00:02:48.100> of<00:02:48.220> them<00:02:48.370> here<00:02:48.580> I've

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
I've only showed a few of them here I've

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.460 
I've only showed a few of them here I've
just<00:02:48.970> add<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.150> little<00:02:49.209> mess<00:02:49.510> about<00:02:49.690> but<00:02:50.410> I'm

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470
