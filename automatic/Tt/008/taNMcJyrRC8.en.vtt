00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.859 
are the pros and cons if Microsoft takes
an<00:01:33.979> over<00:01:34.310> well<00:01:34.670> of<00:01:34.759> course<00:01:34.790> Microsoft<00:01:35.659> is<00:01:35.810> a

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
an over well of course Microsoft is a

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.469 
an over well of course Microsoft is a
much<00:01:36.170> much<00:01:36.500> much<00:01:36.979> bigger<00:01:37.310> company<00:01:37.880> than<00:01:38.270> that

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
much much much bigger company than that

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.420 
much much much bigger company than that
of<00:01:38.689> Minecraft<00:01:39.560> so<00:01:39.710> therefore<00:01:40.100> they<00:01:40.189> will<00:01:40.220> be

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
of Minecraft so therefore they will be

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.340 
of Minecraft so therefore they will be
able<00:01:40.549> to<00:01:40.670> give<00:01:40.820> more<00:01:41.180> fun<00:01:41.600> into<00:01:41.930> it<00:01:41.960> they<00:01:42.259> will

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
able to give more fun into it they will

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.660 
able to give more fun into it they will
have<00:01:42.500> more<00:01:42.680> people<00:01:42.890> working<00:01:43.159> on<00:01:43.369> the<00:01:43.490> game

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
have more people working on the game

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.760 
have more people working on the game
which<00:01:44.090> means<00:01:44.329> updates<00:01:44.840> all<00:01:45.049> that<00:01:45.290> stuff<00:01:45.530> will

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
which means updates all that stuff will

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.830 
which means updates all that stuff will
be<00:01:45.920> out<00:01:46.040> much<00:01:46.430> quicker<00:01:46.600> hopefully<00:01:47.600> we<00:01:47.720> get

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
be out much quicker hopefully we get

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.480 
be out much quicker hopefully we get
some<00:01:47.899> clarity<00:01:48.350> about<00:01:48.530> this<00:01:48.860> in<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:49.250> coming

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
some clarity about this in the coming

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.700 
some clarity about this in the coming
weeks<00:01:49.909> and<00:01:50.270> I<00:01:50.600> myself<00:01:50.930> think<00:01:51.259> it<00:01:51.409> would<00:01:51.560> be<00:01:51.680> a

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
weeks and I myself think it would be a

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.530 
weeks and I myself think it would be a
great<00:01:51.950> thing<00:01:52.189> if<00:01:52.369> Microsoft<00:01:52.939> took<00:01:53.149> over

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
great thing if Microsoft took over

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.450 
great thing if Microsoft took over
Microsoft<00:01:54.259> obviously<00:01:54.740> does<00:01:54.950> have<00:01:55.130> a<00:01:55.159> lot<00:01:55.310> more

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
Microsoft obviously does have a lot more

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.999 
Microsoft obviously does have a lot more
funding<00:01:55.939> than<00:01:56.119> you<00:01:56.869> know<00:01:56.990> that<00:01:57.320> of<00:01:57.500> an<00:01:57.649> indie
