 the keys the keys to fight against 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.600

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.480
 artists praying and not 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.310

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.270
 hands why 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.859
 I did not notice that I never 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.420
 I do not know what's hard, I know there are many 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:34.710
 brother congregations that are 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.450
 closing its doors for not being able to do 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.950
 against the expenses but not for that there 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.929

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.820
 thinking that they are right that they have won 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.799
 the battle 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.300

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.880
 lashes and the struggles of the world the 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.260
 injustice of the tyrant the affront of 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.420

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.739

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.620
 Arrogance of the powerful and humiliation 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:30.680

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.990
