00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.240 
well hey youtubers today we're gonna
take<00:00:12.519> a<00:00:12.580> look<00:00:12.820> at<00:00:12.910> compare

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
take a look at compare

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.670 
take a look at compare
the<00:00:14.400> deep-end<00:00:14.700> eggs<00:00:15.000> with<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.690> machines<00:00:16.560> that

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
the deep-end eggs with the machines that

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.200 
the deep-end eggs with the machines that
have<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.190> target<00:00:18.090> ID<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:19.140> tone<00:00:19.470> ID<00:00:20.210> so

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
have the target ID and tone ID so

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.470 
have the target ID and tone ID so
there's<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.450> lot<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.660> be<00:00:21.780> said<00:00:22.110> about<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.440> simple

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
there's a lot to be said about a simple

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.990 
there's a lot to be said about a simple
deep<00:00:24.480> intake<00:00:24.779> type<00:00:25.020> machine<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.910> finding<00:00:26.910> the

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
deep intake type machine and finding the

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.540 
deep intake type machine and finding the
good<00:00:27.150> stuff<00:00:27.450> so<00:00:28.410> we're<00:00:28.529> gonna<00:00:28.619> start<00:00:29.010> with

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
good stuff so we're gonna start with

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.569 
good stuff so we're gonna start with
taking<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.060> look<00:00:30.180> at<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.619> white<00:00:31.619> mx-5<00:00:32.220> here

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.020 

excellent<00:00:35.579> deep<00:00:36.800> machine<00:00:37.800> no<00:00:38.250> doubt<00:00:38.489> but

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
excellent deep machine no doubt but

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.410 
excellent deep machine no doubt but
we're<00:00:39.270> gonna<00:00:39.650> see<00:00:40.650> where<00:00:40.890> these<00:00:41.210> IV<00:00:42.210> type

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
we're gonna see where these IV type

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.090 
we're gonna see where these IV type
machines<00:00:42.780> can<00:00:43.079> fail<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:44.399> what<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.579> have<00:00:44.820> here<00:00:44.850> is

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
machines can fail so what I have here is

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.730 
machines can fail so what I have here is
my<00:00:47.100> little<00:00:47.280> test<00:00:47.580> board<00:00:47.820> big<00:00:48.660> ol<00:00:48.810> rusty<00:00:49.020> nail

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:49.740

my little test board big ol rusty nail
take<00:00:50.130> the<00:00:50.280> right<00:00:50.400> next<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.790> a<00:00:51.200> 1/4<00:00:52.790> so<00:00:53.790> this<00:00:53.910> is

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.060 
take the right next to a 1/4 so this is

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.120 
take the right next to a 1/4 so this is
what<00:00:54.240> you<00:00:54.570> should<00:00:54.840> hear<00:00:55.080> when<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.770> get<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.950> good

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.130 
what you should hear when you get a good

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.460 
what you should hear when you get a good
target<00:00:56.370> but<00:00:56.730> we<00:00:56.850> all<00:00:56.970> know<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.330> the<00:00:57.540> ground

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
target but we all know that the ground

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.070 
target but we all know that the ground
is<00:00:58.710> just<00:00:58.920> loaded<00:00:59.490> with<00:00:59.670> garbage<00:01:00.240> so<00:01:00.870> there's

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
is just loaded with garbage so there's

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.280 
is just loaded with garbage so there's
always<00:01:01.260> gonna<00:01:01.560> be<00:01:01.650> garbage<00:01:02.160> in<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.370> ground

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
always gonna be garbage in the ground

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.999 
always gonna be garbage in the ground
and<00:01:04.290> it's<00:01:04.790> the<00:01:05.790> best<00:01:06.210> tool<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.509> pick<00:01:06.780> out<00:01:07.009> the

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
and it's the best tool to pick out the

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:09.980 
and it's the best tool to pick out the
good<00:01:08.220> stuff<00:01:08.250> from<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.090> trash<00:01:09.330> target<00:01:09.810> so

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
good stuff from the trash target so

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.929 
good stuff from the trash target so
here's<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.259> just<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.100> regular<00:01:11.520> old<00:01:11.670> quarter

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
here's a just a regular old quarter

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.760 
here's a just a regular old quarter
black<00:01:14.939> board<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.869> sound<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.290> makes<00:01:16.500> when

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
black board and the sound it makes when

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:25.370 
black board and the sound it makes when
the<00:01:16.950> ground<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:19.220> perfect<00:01:22.550> perfect<00:01:23.550> ground<00:01:24.380> and

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
the ground is perfect perfect ground and

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.440 
the ground is perfect perfect ground and
get<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> nice<00:01:25.800> consistent<00:01:26.460> tone<00:01:26.640> first<00:01:27.270> you're

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
get a nice consistent tone first you're

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.620 
get a nice consistent tone first you're
gonna<00:01:27.510> dig<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:30.170> shows<00:01:32.030> 83<00:01:33.030> or<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.540> the

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
gonna dig that shows 83 or so on the

already have so here's that same quarter
from<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.740> mx-5<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:57.150> TIG<00:02:57.480> machine<00:02:58.310> nice<00:02:59.310> solid

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.090 

here's<00:03:09.480> kind<00:03:09.810> of<00:03:09.900> an<00:03:09.990> example<00:03:10.290> of<00:03:10.560> some

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
here's kind of an example of some

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.900 
here's kind of an example of some
garbage<00:03:11.510> some<00:03:12.510> foil<00:03:12.920> got<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.100> discrimination

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
garbage some foil got the discrimination

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.690 
garbage some foil got the discrimination
just<00:03:15.390> right<00:03:15.660> at<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.930> ring<00:03:16.140> range<00:03:16.460> so<00:03:17.460> should

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
just right at the ring range so should

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.430 
just right at the ring range so should
just<00:03:17.910> be<00:03:18.060> knocking<00:03:18.420> out<00:03:18.540> foil<00:03:18.870> so<00:03:19.140> it<00:03:19.170> was<00:03:19.320> just

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
just be knocking out foil so it was just

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:27.770 
just be knocking out foil so it was just
a<00:03:19.730> glob<00:03:20.730> of<00:03:20.760> foil<00:03:21.950> gone<00:03:22.950> nothing<00:03:26.540> so<00:03:27.540> here's

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
a glob of foil gone nothing so here's

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.330 
a glob of foil gone nothing so here's
our<00:03:27.870> little<00:03:28.080> test

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.970 

piece<00:03:31.940> here<00:03:32.209> with<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:32.810> nail<00:03:33.020> and<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:33.590> quarter

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
piece here with the nail and the quarter

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.520 
piece here with the nail and the quarter
tape<00:03:34.610> the<00:03:34.730> real<00:03:34.880> close<00:03:35.090> together<00:03:35.300> and<00:03:35.750> you

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
tape the real close together and you

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.630 
tape the real close together and you
know<00:03:36.680> that<00:03:36.920> there's<00:03:37.069> this<00:03:37.160> kind<00:03:37.430> of

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
know that there's this kind of

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.720 
know that there's this kind of
environment<00:03:38.390> in<00:03:38.720> the<00:03:38.780> groan<00:03:39.400> we<00:03:40.400> know<00:03:40.550> what

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
environment in the groan we know what

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.449 
environment in the groan we know what
the<00:03:40.880> TIG<00:03:41.420> machines<00:03:41.930> we<00:03:42.860> would<00:03:43.010> have<00:03:43.100> ignored

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
the TIG machines we would have ignored

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.190 
the TIG machines we would have ignored
this<00:03:43.700> but<00:03:44.830> with<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:45.980> beep<00:03:46.130> endings<00:03:46.520> and<00:03:46.880> the

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
this but with the beep endings and the

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.340 
this but with the beep endings and the
discrimination<00:03:48.200> of<00:03:48.620> these<00:03:48.890> little<00:03:49.700> classics

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
discrimination of these little classics

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:57.449 
discrimination of these little classics
classic<00:03:51.350> series<00:03:52.060> you're<00:03:53.060> gonna<00:03:53.180> get<00:03:53.330> this

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:05.940 

definitely<00:04:00.430> completely<00:04:01.430> ignoring<00:04:01.819> the<00:04:01.910> nail

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.520 

so<00:04:06.950> if<00:04:07.010> you<00:04:07.130> find<00:04:07.340> one<00:04:07.459> of<00:04:07.580> these<00:04:07.730> machines

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
so if you find one of these machines

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.420 
so if you find one of these machines
grab<00:04:09.530> it<00:04:09.709> and<00:04:09.800> keep<00:04:10.040> it
