keeping whoever's in there a little bit
more<00:01:02.620> comfortable<00:01:02.950> and<00:01:03.250> obviously<00:01:03.520> these<00:01:03.730> can

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
more comfortable and obviously these can

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.670 
more comfortable and obviously these can
be<00:01:04.059> closed<00:01:04.689> down<00:01:04.930> if<00:01:05.170> it<00:01:05.259> does<00:01:05.409> get<00:01:05.560> a<00:01:05.619> little

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
be closed down if it does get a little

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.859

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
bit too chilly and there is another one

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:09.209 
bit too chilly and there is another one
of<00:01:07.929> these<00:01:08.109> on<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.499> other<00:01:08.530> side<00:01:08.829> of<00:01:08.979> the<00:01:09.039> tent

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:09.219

as<00:01:09.369> well<00:01:09.539> so<00:01:10.539> you'll<00:01:10.659> see<00:01:10.780> here<00:01:10.959> that<00:01:10.990> there<00:01:11.350> is

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
as well so you'll see here that there is

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.529 
as well so you'll see here that there is
a<00:01:11.469> one<00:01:12.009> entrance<00:01:12.310> on<00:01:12.459> the<00:01:12.490> side<00:01:12.729> and<00:01:12.999> then

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
a one entrance on the side and then

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.690 
a one entrance on the side and then
there's<00:01:13.780> a<00:01:13.869> large<00:01:14.079> front<00:01:14.350> entrance<00:01:14.770> and<00:01:14.950> there

is another entrance on the other side as

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.959 
is another entrance on the other side as
well<00:01:17.499> so<00:01:17.679> certainly<00:01:17.979> plenty<00:01:18.189> of<00:01:18.459> fertility

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:18.969 
well so certainly plenty of fertility

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:21.690 
well so certainly plenty of fertility
here<00:01:19.389> you<00:01:20.380> see<00:01:20.529> that<00:01:20.770> we<00:01:20.920> have<00:01:21.100> a<00:01:21.130> good-size

front door here and it's a good height

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.849 
front door here and it's a good height
as<00:01:23.950> well<00:01:24.130> and<00:01:24.450> once<00:01:25.450> you<00:01:25.719> step<00:01:25.929> inside<00:01:26.139> the

as well and once you step inside the
tent<00:01:27.130> itself<00:01:27.549> and<00:01:27.929> it's<00:01:28.929> quite<00:01:29.079> apparent<00:01:29.289> just

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.919 
tent itself and it's quite apparent just
how<00:01:29.709> much<00:01:29.889> space<00:01:30.159> arose<00:01:30.490> thanks<00:01:30.909> to<00:01:31.090> I<00:01:31.359> can<00:01:31.810> say

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929 
how much space arose thanks to I can say

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:33.629 
how much space arose thanks to I can say
this<00:01:32.109> dome<00:01:32.439> style<00:01:32.709> at<00:01:33.069> the<00:01:33.130> top<00:01:33.399> here

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:37.749 
about 185 centimeters tall and you'll

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:39.569 
about 185 centimeters tall and you'll
see<00:01:37.959> that<00:01:38.619> as<00:01:38.829> I<00:01:38.950> say<00:01:39.069> there's<00:01:39.249> plenty<00:01:39.549> of

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
see that as I say there's plenty of

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:41.339 
see that as I say there's plenty of
space<00:01:39.849> just<00:01:40.599> while<00:01:40.719> we're<00:01:40.869> here<00:01:40.990> I'll<00:01:41.170> point

00:01:41.339 --> 00:01:41.349 
space just while we're here I'll point

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:44.129 
space just while we're here I'll point
out<00:01:41.560> that<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.729> the<00:01:42.759> mesh<00:01:43.539> panels<00:01:43.899> that<00:01:44.020> we

00:01:44.129 --> 00:01:44.139 
out that the the mesh panels that we

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:45.719 
out that the the mesh panels that we
talked<00:01:44.409> about<00:01:44.499> earlier<00:01:44.889> on<00:01:45.039> and<00:01:45.189> there's<00:01:45.670> a

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
talked about earlier on and there's a

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.999 
talked about earlier on and there's a
lantern<00:01:46.060> hanging<00:01:46.299> point<00:01:46.630> at<00:01:47.139> the<00:01:47.289> top<00:01:47.499> here<00:01:47.799> as

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
lantern hanging point at the top here as

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.980 
lantern hanging point at the top here as
well<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.939> ground<00:01:52.149> sheet<00:01:52.329> that<00:01:52.450> we've<00:01:52.599> got<00:01:52.779> in

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
well the ground sheet that we've got in

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.069 
well the ground sheet that we've got in
here<00:01:53.229> is<00:01:53.409> a<00:01:54.329> polyethylene<00:01:55.329> material<00:01:55.450> so<00:01:55.929> it's

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:56.079 
here is a polyethylene material so it's

00:01:56.079 --> 00:01:58.709 
here is a polyethylene material so it's
very<00:01:56.289> tough<00:01:56.499> and<00:01:56.679> durable<00:01:57.009> and<00:01:57.369> it's<00:01:58.329> totally

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 
very tough and durable and it's totally

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.779 
very tough and durable and it's totally
waterproof<00:01:58.840> as<00:01:59.289> well<00:01:59.469> and<00:01:59.770> it<00:02:00.039> is<00:02:00.069> sawn<00:02:00.399> in<00:02:00.549> all

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
waterproof as well and it is sawn in all

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:02.129 
waterproof as well and it is sawn in all
the<00:02:00.909> way<00:02:00.999> around<00:02:01.299> so<00:02:01.419> it's<00:02:01.719> going<00:02:01.810> to<00:02:01.869> give<00:02:02.049> you

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:02.139 
the way around so it's going to give you

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:03.899 
the way around so it's going to give you
great<00:02:02.349> protection<00:02:02.919> from<00:02:03.159> the<00:02:03.340> elements<00:02:03.429> and

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
great protection from the elements and

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.309 
great protection from the elements and
hopefully<00:02:04.239> keep<00:02:04.359> out<00:02:04.539> those<00:02:04.689> unwanted<00:02:04.989> bugs

00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:05.319 
hopefully keep out those unwanted bugs

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:10.589 
hopefully keep out those unwanted bugs
as<00:02:05.499> well<00:02:06.179> just<00:02:07.179> at<00:02:07.569> the<00:02:07.689> back<00:02:07.869> here<00:02:09.420> from<00:02:10.420> that

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
well there are three different ways of

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.289 
well there are three different ways of
attaching<00:02:35.590> this<00:02:35.920> tent<00:02:36.159> to<00:02:36.730> a<00:02:36.760> vehicle<00:02:37.180> like

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
attaching this tent to a vehicle like

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.809 
attaching this tent to a vehicle like
this<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:38.650> can<00:02:38.769> see<00:02:38.920> here<00:02:39.099> that<00:02:39.250> we<00:02:39.370> have<00:02:39.400> used

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
this you can see here that we have used

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:41.729 
this you can see here that we have used
the<00:02:40.239> beading<00:02:40.569> which<00:02:41.079> is<00:02:41.260> already<00:02:41.560> pre

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
attached to the fly sheet which then

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.259 
attached to the fly sheet which then
just<00:02:43.659> threads<00:02:44.109> through<00:02:44.439> on<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:45.549> on<00:02:46.120> the

you're<00:02:48.370> then<00:02:48.549> maybe<00:02:48.760> see<00:02:48.939> across<00:02:49.239> the<00:02:49.480> top

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:49.659 
you're then maybe see across the top

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.809 
you're then maybe see across the top
here<00:02:49.689> that<00:02:50.109> we<00:02:50.200> have<00:02:50.409> these<00:02:51.010> velcro<00:02:51.310> straps

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
here that we have these velcro straps

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.789 
here that we have these velcro straps
which<00:02:52.389> would<00:02:52.569> be<00:02:52.689> able<00:02:52.870> to<00:02:52.959> wrap<00:02:53.200> around<00:02:53.230> any
