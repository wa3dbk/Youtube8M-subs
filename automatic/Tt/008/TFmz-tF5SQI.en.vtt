00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
most even our budget deck the land was a

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.120 
most even our budget deck the land was a
majority<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:14.520> price<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.200> and<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.830> course

if<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.520> want<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.759> make<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:17.970> even<00:01:18.090> better<00:01:18.330> you

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
if you want to make it even better you

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.570 
if you want to make it even better you
got<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.900> add<00:01:18.990> in<00:01:19.170> even<00:01:19.530> more<00:01:19.710> expensive<00:01:19.979> lands

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
got to add in even more expensive lands

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.380 
got to add in even more expensive lands
so<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.780> make<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:22.020> better<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.500> would<00:01:22.590> cost<00:01:22.830> us

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
so to make this better it would cost us

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.450 
so to make this better it would cost us
673<00:01:24.390> dollars<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.380> 83<00:01:25.799> cents<00:01:26.040> on<00:01:26.250> coal

stuffing<00:01:26.820> calm<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.630> that's<00:01:27.810> because<00:01:27.930> we<00:01:28.170> need

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
stuffing calm and that's because we need

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.560 
stuffing calm and that's because we need
more<00:01:29.159> fetch<00:01:29.820> lands<00:01:30.740> with<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.770> fetch<00:01:32.009> lands

more fetch lands with the fetch lands
you<00:01:33.570> can<00:01:34.310> put<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.549> Dryad<00:01:35.880> Arbor

because you can fetch work because it's

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.130 
because you can fetch work because it's
a<00:01:38.009> forest<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.700> it's<00:01:39.240> another<00:01:39.450> creature<00:01:39.869> that

turn<00:01:44.030> boggle<00:01:45.030> or<00:01:45.200> clay<00:01:46.200> cover<00:01:46.470> scalp<00:01:47.030> so

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
turn boggle or clay cover scalp so

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.230 
turn boggle or clay cover scalp so
that's<00:01:48.899> why<00:01:49.430> try<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.490> arbors<00:01:50.820> good<00:01:50.970> we<00:01:51.119> could

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
that's why try it arbors good we could

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.539 
that's why try it arbors good we could
have<00:01:51.329> played<00:01:51.509> with<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.049> but<00:01:52.860> it's<00:01:53.070> only<00:01:53.250> good

board<00:04:20.450> wipe<00:04:20.860> most<00:04:21.860> versions<00:04:22.100> only<00:04:22.490> play<00:04:22.640> three

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
board wipe most versions only play three

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.820 
board wipe most versions only play three
unflinching<00:04:23.300> courage<00:04:23.450> because<00:04:23.780> they<00:04:24.530> want<00:04:24.710> to

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
unflinching courage because they want to

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.920 
unflinching courage because they want to
curve<00:04:25.010> a<00:04:25.160> little<00:04:25.190> low<00:04:25.550> degree<00:04:26.030> is<00:04:26.450> probably

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
curve a little low degree is probably

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.160 
curve a little low degree is probably
the<00:04:27.050> highest<00:04:27.260> because<00:04:27.860> these<00:04:28.760> decks<00:04:29.120> want<00:04:29.990> a

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
the highest because these decks want a

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.080 
the highest because these decks want a
low<00:04:30.380> curve<00:04:30.650> because<00:04:31.190> they're<00:04:31.310> running<00:04:31.610> 20

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
low curve because they're running 20

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.250 
low curve because they're running 20
lands<00:04:32.590> sometimes<00:04:33.590> 22<00:04:34.160> at<00:04:34.340> most<00:04:34.610> and<00:04:35.110> then<00:04:36.110> the

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
lands sometimes 22 at most and then the

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.070 
lands sometimes 22 at most and then the
last<00:04:36.380> card<00:04:36.800> I<00:04:37.040> guess<00:04:37.700> if<00:04:38.120> you<00:04:38.300> don't<00:04:38.480> like<00:04:38.630> idle

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
last card I guess if you don't like idle

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.520 
last card I guess if you don't like idle
on<00:04:39.200> accounts<00:04:39.650> battles<00:04:40.010> you<00:04:40.160> can<00:04:40.310> remove<00:04:40.640> both

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
on accounts battles you can remove both

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.680 
on accounts battles you can remove both
but<00:04:42.530> let's<00:04:43.070> say<00:04:43.220> if<00:04:43.340> we<00:04:43.460> keep<00:04:43.610> one<00:04:43.910> I<00:04:44.120> like<00:04:44.510> the

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
but let's say if we keep one I like the

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.560 
but let's say if we keep one I like the
one<00:04:44.840> of<00:04:45.080> its<00:04:45.680> a<00:04:45.740> great<00:04:45.920> card<00:04:46.220> actually<00:04:46.430> and<00:04:46.790> if

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
one of its a great card actually and if

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.900 
one of its a great card actually and if
you<00:04:47.660> can<00:04:47.780> fit<00:04:47.990> two<00:04:48.230> even<00:04:49.010> in<00:04:49.130> your<00:04:49.280> non<00:04:49.520> budget

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
you can fit two even in your non budget

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.600 
you can fit two even in your non budget
version<00:04:50.060> I<00:04:50.390> recommend<00:04:51.320> it<00:04:51.470> it's<00:04:52.100> really<00:04:52.430> good

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
version I recommend it it's really good

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.240 
version I recommend it it's really good
because<00:04:53.030> it's<00:04:53.570> another<00:04:53.720> if<00:04:54.320> your<00:04:54.860> armor

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
because it's another if your armor

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.190 
because it's another if your armor
because<00:04:56.060> it<00:04:56.180> counts<00:04:56.450> for<00:04:56.480> each<00:04:56.690> or<00:04:56.990> you

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
because it counts for each or you

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.230 
because it counts for each or you
control<00:04:57.590> and<00:04:57.830> if<00:04:58.190> it's<00:04:58.340> bestowed<00:04:58.790> it's<00:04:59.120> an

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
control and if it's bestowed it's an

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.810 
control and if it's bestowed it's an
aura<00:04:59.510> and<00:05:00.130> it<00:05:01.130> also<00:05:01.280> counts<00:05:01.520> for<00:05:01.730> each

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
aura and it also counts for each

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.940 
aura and it also counts for each
creature<00:05:02.060> you<00:05:02.210> control<00:05:02.240> so<00:05:02.690> it's<00:05:03.230> basically<00:05:03.410> a

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
creature you control so it's basically a

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.890 
creature you control so it's basically a
better<00:05:04.310> etheral<00:05:04.790> armor<00:05:05.090> because<00:05:05.240> i'll<00:05:05.570> count

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
better etheral armor because i'll count

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.290 
better etheral armor because i'll count
for<00:05:06.140> each<00:05:06.230> aura<00:05:06.530> and<00:05:06.770> the<00:05:07.280> creature<00:05:07.550> that<00:05:07.820> the

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
for each aura and the creature that the

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.120 
for each aura and the creature that the
Chairman<00:05:08.780> or<00:05:08.900> is<00:05:09.050> attached<00:05:09.380> to<00:05:09.590> plus<00:05:09.950> other

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
Chairman or is attached to plus other

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.120 
Chairman or is attached to plus other
creatures<00:05:10.550> if<00:05:10.670> you<00:05:10.760> have<00:05:10.880> more<00:05:11.090> in<00:05:11.210> play<00:05:12.130> but

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
creatures if you have more in play but

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.940 
creatures if you have more in play but
it<00:05:13.370> costs<00:05:13.730> four<00:05:13.970> dabest<00:05:14.090> oh<00:05:14.450> so<00:05:15.110> if<00:05:15.530> you<00:05:15.680> kind

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
it costs four dabest oh so if you kind

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.870 
it costs four dabest oh so if you kind
of<00:05:16.150> want<00:05:17.150> a<00:05:17.360> lower<00:05:17.660> curve<00:05:18.020> then<00:05:18.350> I<00:05:18.880> understand

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
of want a lower curve then I understand

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.850 
of want a lower curve then I understand
