00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.740
 Good day, welcome to the stand 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.130
 the annaburger commercial vehicle of the year 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.070
 here to utah 2005 14 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.130
 We are very happy here on the second 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.810
 to take part in this event 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.460
 yes have a new vehicle to bring 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.560
 brought to the exhibition 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.650
 The background is that there is here 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.899
 already about two decades hamburger too 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.450
 bring technology with 21 cubic meters 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.700
 but capacity in the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.660
 in the meantime, there has been a need 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.320
 developed to the effect that many 24 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.600
 Bitterfeld vehicles are on the market 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.489
 we need transporters more and more 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.750
 gain meaning and therefore we too 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.379
 appropriate transport technology 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.940
 We wanted to develop here today 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.059
 bring vehicle stand with 24 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.379
 cubic meters capacity 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.540
 air suspension chassis and dolly axa 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.060
 that these requirements 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.740
 The vehicle is filled with one 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.190
 jersey in the promo of vogelsang 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.980
 equipped the circa 5600 over pro 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:17.280
 realized in a minute and so on 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.350
 short time impossible makes it part of it 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.720
 the corresponding to the system with 8 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.450
 inch so many field vehicles 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.300
 easily get out of this vehicle 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:30.330
 can fill with the dolly axis 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.580
 one is able to both the vehicle per 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.710
 Tug to move as well as the dolly 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.900
 Axis to remove and with a 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.950
 semi-trailer of this vehicle 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.930
 transport 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.729
 you can see that we have a container here 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.800
 from gfk use 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.140
 this is characterized in particular by 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.690
 its lightweight construction and high strength 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.729
 So I have to steel containers 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.160
 a weight advantage and form 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.080
 Corrosion free one advantage we 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.869
 for a very long time use this 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.170
 vehicle like here for the exhibition 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.660
 comes has a net weight of 72 tons 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.570
 this means with the planned load 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.850
 of 24 cubic meters and a tractor 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.130
 weight of nine tons I hold the in 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.590
 Germany required total weight 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.600
 of 40 tons 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.180
 the reactions here at the booth on today 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.190
 day show that we actually there on 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.799
 We are very interested and we 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.660
 hope to sell accordingly 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.420
 possibilities in the future 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.010
