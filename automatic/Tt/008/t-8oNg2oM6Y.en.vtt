with anything else because I think

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.070 
with anything else because I think
that's<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.060> recent<00:01:21.420> trend<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.750> they're<00:01:21.930> doing

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
that's a recent trend that they're doing

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.590 
that's a recent trend that they're doing
with<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.439> hiatus<00:01:22.890> thing<00:01:23.150> but<00:01:24.150> usually<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
with the hiatus thing but usually the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.390 
with the hiatus thing but usually the
hiatus<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.110> are<00:01:25.229> planned<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.799> one<00:01:25.979> was<00:01:26.189> not

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
hiatus is are planned that one was not

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.510 
hiatus is are planned that one was not
planned<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.180> it's<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.600> bit<00:01:27.750> unusual<00:01:28.400> could<00:01:29.400> be

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
planned so it's a bit unusual could be

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.280 
planned so it's a bit unusual could be
due<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.670> low<00:01:29.909> ratings<00:01:30.150> I'm<00:01:30.540> not<00:01:30.810> exactly<00:01:31.049> sure

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
due to low ratings I'm not exactly sure

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.530 
due to low ratings I'm not exactly sure

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
basically I just said how the boy the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.380 
basically I just said how the boy the
Batman<00:01:49.770> was<00:01:50.490> cancelled<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.119> just<00:01:51.299> my

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
Batman was cancelled and just my

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.330 
Batman was cancelled and just my
thoughts<00:01:51.600> on<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.899> but<00:01:52.229> now<00:01:52.439> it's<00:01:53.100> interesting

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
thoughts on it but now it's interesting

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.480 
thoughts on it but now it's interesting
because<00:01:54.079> where<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.229> Batman<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.649> nowhere<00:01:56.189> on

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
because where the Batman is nowhere on

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.190 
because where the Batman is nowhere on
Cartoon<00:01:57.119> Network's<00:01:57.420> January<00:01:57.930> Calendar<00:01:58.729> so

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
Cartoon Network's January Calendar so

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.270 
Cartoon Network's January Calendar so
honestly<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.290> didn't<00:02:01.500> expect<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.009> thought

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
honestly I didn't expect that I thought

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.639 
honestly I didn't expect that I thought
it<00:02:02.399> would<00:02:02.520> come<00:02:02.700> back<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.090> TV<00:02:03.270> but<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.439> fact

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
it would come back to TV but the fact

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.050 
it would come back to TV but the fact
that<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.950> didn't<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.579> little<00:02:05.909> bit

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
that it didn't is a little bit

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.350 
that it didn't is a little bit
surprising<00:02:06.719> because<00:02:07.789> it's<00:02:08.789> just<00:02:09.000> it's<00:02:09.209> just

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
surprising because it's just it's just

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.790 
surprising because it's just it's just
weird<00:02:09.599> they<00:02:09.780> usually<00:02:09.929> let<00:02:10.289> their<00:02:10.500> shows

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
weird they usually let their shows

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.670 
weird they usually let their shows
finish<00:02:11.340> before<00:02:11.520> they<00:02:11.790> cancel<00:02:12.000> them<00:02:12.270> some

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
finish before they cancel them some

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.740 
finish before they cancel them some
the<00:02:12.799> Batman<00:02:13.159> is<00:02:13.189> definitely<00:02:13.849> done<00:02:14.060> I<00:02:14.239> mean<00:02:14.480> if

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
the Batman is definitely done I mean if

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.319 
the Batman is definitely done I mean if
they<00:02:14.900> have<00:02:15.079> yet<00:02:15.409> to<00:02:15.439> explain<00:02:16.010> anything<00:02:16.329> that

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329 
they have yet to explain anything that

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:18.849 
they have yet to explain anything that
shows<00:02:17.540> done<00:02:17.780> they<00:02:17.989> might<00:02:18.140> not<00:02:18.290> even<00:02:18.349> finish

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:18.859 
shows done they might not even finish

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:20.289 
shows done they might not even finish
airing<00:02:19.310> it<00:02:19.459> which<00:02:19.700> is<00:02:19.849> kind<00:02:20.060> of<00:02:20.090> odd

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
airing it which is kind of odd

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.149 
airing it which is kind of odd
considering<00:02:21.260> that<00:02:21.379> I<00:02:21.439> already<00:02:21.620> ordered<00:02:21.859> it

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159 
considering that I already ordered it

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.030 
considering that I already ordered it
but<00:02:22.939> they<00:02:23.299> might<00:02:23.450> not<00:02:23.569> even<00:02:23.629> finish<00:02:24.140> airing<00:02:24.920> it

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
but they might not even finish airing it

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.670 
but they might not even finish airing it
now<00:02:25.189> which<00:02:25.489> is<00:02:25.840> kind<00:02:26.840> of<00:02:26.959> strange<00:02:27.290> but

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
now which is kind of strange but

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.819 
now which is kind of strange but
interesting<00:02:29.170> reasons<00:02:30.170> of<00:02:30.319> course<00:02:30.530> could<00:02:30.799> be

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:30.829 
interesting reasons of course could be

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:32.649 
interesting reasons of course could be
the<00:02:31.010> ratings<00:02:31.459> could<00:02:31.849> be<00:02:32.030> that<00:02:32.269> there's<00:02:32.480> some

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:32.659 
the ratings could be that there's some

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:34.479 
the ratings could be that there's some
special<00:02:33.200> thing<00:02:33.409> Cartoon<00:02:33.799> Network's<00:02:34.069> doing<00:02:34.370> in

a<00:02:51.799> hate<00:02:51.980> it's<00:02:52.250> because<00:02:52.579> gosh<00:02:52.849> that<00:02:53.180> would<00:02:53.299> be

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
a hate it's because gosh that would be

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.250 
a hate it's because gosh that would be
that<00:02:54.230> would<00:02:54.290> be<00:02:54.349> very<00:02:54.739> bad<00:02:56.079> but<00:02:57.079> yeah

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260

basically the end of the day it is
canceled<00:03:00.950> it's<00:03:01.129> done<00:03:01.370> I<00:03:01.760> don't<00:03:02.450> even<00:03:02.540> know<00:03:02.780> if

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
canceled it's done I don't even know if

it's gonna finish airing its episodes

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.159 
it's gonna finish airing its episodes
but<00:03:04.819> it<00:03:04.969> looks<00:03:05.150> like<00:03:05.299> I<00:03:05.419> did<00:03:05.569> guess<00:03:05.780> correctly

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:06.169 
but it looks like I did guess correctly

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:08.949 
but it looks like I did guess correctly
that<00:03:06.379> it<00:03:06.530> would<00:03:06.739> be<00:03:06.889> canceled<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:08.060> this<00:03:08.810> is

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
that it would be canceled and this is

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.750 
that it would be canceled and this is
kind<00:03:09.200> of<00:03:09.230> a<00:03:09.319> good<00:03:09.530> thing<00:03:09.709> because<00:03:09.889> for<00:03:10.639> me

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
kind of a good thing because for me

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.580 
kind of a good thing because for me

personally I didn't like the way the
Batman<00:03:13.010> and<00:03:13.450> I<00:03:15.219> hope<00:03:16.219> that<00:03:16.489> this<00:03:16.639> gives<00:03:16.879> an

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
Batman and I hope that this gives an

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:07.639 
skill so they watch just utter crap and

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:10.929

think<00:04:07.849> it's<00:04:07.970> good<00:04:08.180> I<00:04:08.509> don't<00:04:08.780> know<00:04:09.049> but<00:04:09.939> that

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:10.939 
think it's good I don't know but that

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:12.699 
think it's good I don't know but that
since<00:04:11.239> boy<00:04:11.419> the<00:04:11.599> Batman<00:04:11.959> has<00:04:12.079> opened<00:04:12.439> up<00:04:12.530> a

since boy the Batman has opened up a
slot<00:04:13.569> this<00:04:14.569> could<00:04:14.959> be<00:04:15.229> and<00:04:15.560> this<00:04:16.099> is<00:04:16.250> what<00:04:16.370> I'm

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
slot this could be and this is what I'm

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:17.140 
slot this could be and this is what I'm
thinking

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
thinking

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.149 
thinking
it's<00:04:17.479> gonna<00:04:17.630> be<00:04:17.780> one<00:04:17.989> of<00:04:18.109> two<00:04:18.259> things<00:04:18.289> it's

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:19.159 
it's gonna be one of two things it's

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:22.149 
it's gonna be one of two things it's
either<00:04:19.459> going<00:04:19.729> to<00:04:19.820> be<00:04:19.940> a<00:04:20.389> new<00:04:21.139> what<00:04:21.859> actually

00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:22.159 
either going to be a new what actually

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:23.560 
either going to be a new what actually
could<00:04:22.310> be<00:04:22.340> three<00:04:22.669> things<00:04:22.849> but<00:04:23.150> there's<00:04:23.360> two

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
could be three things but there's two

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.089 
could be three things but there's two
possible<00:04:24.139> ones<00:04:24.349> I'm<00:04:24.500> thinking<00:04:24.800> you're<00:04:24.919> most

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:25.099 
possible ones I'm thinking you're most

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:26.260 
possible ones I'm thinking you're most
likely

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
likely

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.820 
likely
the<00:04:26.479> least<00:04:26.690> likely<00:04:26.960> I<00:04:27.169> think<00:04:27.229> would<00:04:27.560> be<00:04:27.650> a<00:04:27.680> new

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
the least likely I think would be a new

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.890 
the least likely I think would be a new

project he does when you want to know

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.550 
project he does when you want to know
about<00:04:40.180> so<00:04:41.180> we<00:04:41.330> I<00:04:41.360> have<00:04:41.630> no<00:04:41.840> idea<00:04:42.139> what<00:04:42.259> that<00:04:42.289> is

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
about so we I have no idea what that is

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.610 
about so we I have no idea what that is
and<00:04:43.240> no<00:04:44.240> one<00:04:44.389> else<00:04:44.539> does<00:04:44.690> either<00:04:44.840> so<00:04:45.229> it's<00:04:45.470> just

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
and no one else does either so it's just

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.439 
and no one else does either so it's just
speculation<00:04:45.860> that<00:04:46.310> would<00:04:46.639> be<00:04:46.729> cool<00:04:46.940> if<00:04:47.120> we<00:04:47.180> did

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
speculation that would be cool if we did

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:49.900 
speculation that would be cool if we did
get<00:04:47.599> that<00:04:47.840> and<00:04:48.050> the<00:04:48.710> third<00:04:49.009> thing<00:04:49.370> which<00:04:49.759> is

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
League so I wouldn't be surprised if

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:30.399 
League so I wouldn't be surprised if
there<00:05:29.300> was<00:05:29.449> a<00:05:29.479> new<00:05:29.690> Justice<00:05:30.050> League<00:05:30.139> animated

there was a new Justice League animated
series<00:05:31.039> coming<00:05:31.250> soon<00:05:31.990> because<00:05:32.990> the<00:05:33.320> movie<00:05:33.800> is

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:37.639 
going to be coming soon assuming that

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:40.680 
going to be coming soon assuming that
Batman<00:05:38.210> vs<00:05:38.509> Superman<00:05:38.539> is<00:05:39.110> not<00:05:39.259> Justice<00:05:39.949> League

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
Batman vs Superman is not Justice League

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.240 
Batman vs Superman is not Justice League
you<00:05:41.690> can<00:05:41.870> probably<00:05:42.169> expect<00:05:42.620> it<00:05:42.800> anywhere<00:05:43.099> from

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
you can probably expect it anywhere from

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:48.790 
you can probably expect it anywhere from
2016<00:05:44.240> 2017<00:05:44.870> maybe<00:05:45.560> 2018<00:05:46.840> unless<00:05:47.840> they<00:05:48.110> branch

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
2016 2017 maybe 2018 unless they branch

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.589 
2016 2017 maybe 2018 unless they branch
out<00:05:48.979> the<00:05:49.130> characters<00:05:49.580> which<00:05:50.180> would<00:05:50.330> be<00:05:50.449> a<00:05:50.479> good

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:50.599 
out the characters which would be a good

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:52.450 
out the characters which would be a good
idea<00:05:50.900> but<00:05:51.169> doesn't<00:05:52.009> look<00:05:52.070> like<00:05:52.250> they're<00:05:52.370> gonna

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
idea but doesn't look like they're gonna

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:54.939 
idea but doesn't look like they're gonna
be<00:05:52.639> doing<00:05:52.849> that<00:05:53.000> so<00:05:53.500> expected<00:05:54.500> anywhere<00:05:54.830> from

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:54.949 
be doing that so expected anywhere from

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:56.350 
be doing that so expected anywhere from
then<00:05:55.159> so<00:05:55.460> of<00:05:55.580> course<00:05:55.759> the<00:05:55.969> Justice<00:05:56.270> League

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
then so of course the Justice League

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.879 
then so of course the Justice League
animated<00:05:56.509> series<00:05:56.990> again<00:05:57.199> to<00:05:57.320> come<00:05:57.530> some<00:05:57.860> time

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:57.889 
animated series again to come some time

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:02.080 
animated series again to come some time
in<00:05:58.520> order<00:05:58.669> to<00:05:58.789> build<00:05:58.969> a<00:05:59.150> pipe<00:05:59.479> and<00:06:00.250> it<00:06:01.250> could<00:06:01.639> be

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
in order to build a pipe and it could be

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.089 
in order to build a pipe and it could be
