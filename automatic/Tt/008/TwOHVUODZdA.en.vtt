00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.030 
it like super-quick the maps are pretty
linear<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:17.940> know<00:02:18.090> they<00:02:18.540> put<00:02:18.780> like<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.440> lot<00:02:19.920> of

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
linear you know they put like a lot of

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.490 
linear you know they put like a lot of
co<00:02:20.220> ways<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.670> move<00:02:20.819> to<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.150> methanol<00:02:21.720> but<00:02:22.379> the

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
co ways to move to the methanol but the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.309 
co ways to move to the methanol but the
maps<00:02:22.739> are<00:02:23.010> like<00:02:23.370> average<00:02:23.730> size<00:02:24.450> on<00:02:24.930> every

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
maps are like average size on every

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.080 
maps are like average size on every
single<00:02:25.470> map<00:02:25.799> there's<00:02:26.099> not<00:02:26.280> one<00:02:26.340> map<00:02:26.760> that's

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
single map there's not one map that's

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.000 
single map there's not one map that's
too<00:02:27.450> small<00:02:27.599> to<00:02:27.959> big<00:02:28.110> they're<00:02:28.379> like<00:02:28.560> all<00:02:28.829> the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
too small to big they're like all the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.460 
too small to big they're like all the
same<00:02:29.190> size<00:02:29.489> and<00:02:29.849> where<00:02:30.840> they<00:02:30.989> lay<00:02:31.140> out<00:02:31.260> their

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
same size and where they lay out their

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.430 
same size and where they lay out their
objectives<00:02:32.040> isn't<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:32.849> know<00:02:32.959> too<00:02:33.959> well<00:02:33.989> it's

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
objectives isn't you know too well it's

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.830 
objectives isn't you know too well it's
just<00:02:34.709> like<00:02:35.010> really<00:02:35.670> straight<00:02:36.090> for<00:02:36.329> easy<00:02:36.480> and

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
just like really straight for easy and

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.690 
just like really straight for easy and
if<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.049> just<00:02:37.290> play<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:37.560> for<00:02:37.980> just<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.310> half<00:02:38.459> an

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
if you just play it for just a half an

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.089 
if you just play it for just a half an
hour<00:02:38.879> you're<00:02:39.629> just<00:02:39.900> gonna<00:02:40.049> really<00:02:40.440> wish<00:02:40.769> that

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
hour you're just gonna really wish that

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.410 
hour you're just gonna really wish that
it<00:02:41.159> but<00:02:41.549> don't<00:02:41.760> get<00:02:41.849> the<00:02:41.970> cookies<00:02:42.269> this

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
it but don't get the cookies this

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.180 
it but don't get the cookies this
doesn't<00:02:42.810> mean<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.109> game<00:02:43.260> exists<00:02:43.590> the

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
doesn't mean that the game exists the

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.979 
doesn't mean that the game exists the
game<00:02:44.370> is<00:02:44.549> basically<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.359> play<00:02:45.629> by<00:02:45.840> yourself

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
game is basically you play by yourself

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.319 
game is basically you play by yourself
it<00:02:46.440> gets<00:02:46.650> really<00:02:47.010> hard<00:02:47.340> if<00:02:47.670> you<00:02:47.849> put<00:02:48.090> with<00:02:48.299> the

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
it gets really hard if you put with the

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.979 
it gets really hard if you put with the
AI<00:02:48.660> your<00:02:49.530> AAA<00:02:49.709> sucks<00:02:50.250> but<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.060> enemy<00:02:51.239> AI<00:02:51.780> is

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
AI your AAA sucks but the enemy AI is

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.250 
AI your AAA sucks but the enemy AI is
always<00:02:52.470> grouped<00:02:52.920> up<00:02:53.160> and<00:02:53.599> what<00:02:54.599> kind<00:02:54.840> of<00:02:54.989> sucks

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
always grouped up and what kind of sucks

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.470 
always grouped up and what kind of sucks
is<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.799> can<00:02:56.010> really<00:02:56.340> give<00:02:56.609> your<00:02:56.819> AI<00:02:57.000> any

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
is that you can really give your AI any

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.690 
is that you can really give your AI any
orders<00:02:57.930> so<00:02:58.620> you're<00:02:58.829> the<00:02:59.040> only<00:02:59.159> one<00:02:59.459> that's

ass<00:03:52.819> basically<00:03:53.819> on<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.510> controls<00:03:55.139> now<00:03:55.560> how<00:03:55.680> is

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
ass basically on the controls now how is

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.520 
ass basically on the controls now how is
RK<00:03:56.190> dish<00:03:56.400> like<00:03:56.639> so<00:03:57.449> when<00:03:57.720> you<00:03:57.930> would<00:03:58.230> try<00:03:58.470> to

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
RK dish like so when you would try to

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.890 
RK dish like so when you would try to

they have like a health bar and you have
to<00:04:05.459> get<00:04:05.609> the<00:04:05.730> health<00:04:05.970> down<00:04:06.379> so<00:04:07.379> that<00:04:07.799> part<00:04:08.430> was

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
to get the health down so that part was

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.550 
to get the health down so that part was
a<00:04:08.609> little<00:04:08.970> bit<00:04:09.090> like<00:04:09.239> borderlands<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:10.199> what<00:04:10.530> I

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
a little bit like borderlands and what I

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.069 
a little bit like borderlands and what I
had<00:04:10.799> to<00:04:10.829> do<00:04:11.099> is<00:04:11.310> actually<00:04:11.599> turn<00:04:12.599> down<00:04:12.840> the

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
had to do is actually turn down the

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.710 
had to do is actually turn down the
sensitivity<00:04:13.859> quite<00:04:14.129> a<00:04:14.160> bit<00:04:14.430> because<00:04:14.699> on<00:04:15.239> how

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
sensitivity quite a bit because on how

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.750 
sensitivity quite a bit because on how
the<00:04:15.780> adoptions<00:04:16.349> move<00:04:16.530> around<00:04:17.190> along<00:04:17.549> the

the adoptions move around along the

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.190 
the adoptions move around along the

arcade game of roulette game and I think
that<00:05:37.670> would<00:05:37.760> be<00:05:37.910> a<00:05:37.940> good<00:05:38.150> idea<00:05:38.240> for<00:05:38.450> them<00:05:38.720> to

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
that would be a good idea for them to

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.930 
that would be a good idea for them to
just<00:05:38.870> put<00:05:39.140> it<00:05:39.230> as<00:05:39.320> an<00:05:40.070> arcade<00:05:40.400> game<00:05:40.430> later<00:05:40.790> on

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
just put it as an arcade game later on

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.110 
just put it as an arcade game later on
when<00:05:41.150> they<00:05:41.270> don't<00:05:41.390> sell<00:05:41.660> any<00:05:41.870> of<00:05:41.930> them<00:05:42.080> my<00:05:42.260> hope
