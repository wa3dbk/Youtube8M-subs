00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
lengthened now inside of the trick pony

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.510 
lengthened now inside of the trick pony
is<00:00:54.600> going<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.780> be<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> super<00:00:55.199> fly<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.520> dual-zone

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
is going to be a super fly to dual-zone

wood<00:00:59.699> laminates<00:01:00.210> combined<00:01:00.600> together<00:01:00.750> that's

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
wood laminates combined together that's

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.799 
wood laminates combined together that's
wrapped<00:01:01.739> in<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.100> Triax<00:01:02.579> fiberglass<00:01:02.809> what's

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
wrapped in a Triax fiberglass what's

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.410 
wrapped in a Triax fiberglass what's
cool<00:01:04.050> about<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:05.039> the<00:01:05.700> combination<00:01:06.270> of

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
cool about that and the combination of

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.660 
cool about that and the combination of
the<00:01:06.570> carbon<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.080> beam<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.130> fact<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.490> this

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
the carbon I beam is the fact that this

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.490 
the carbon I beam is the fact that this
board<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.090> like<00:01:09.210> torsionally<00:01:09.930> pretty<00:01:10.200> soft

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
board is like torsionally pretty soft

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.380 
board is like torsionally pretty soft
but<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.100> still<00:01:11.280> has<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.460> lot<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.729> longitude<00:01:12.360> oh

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
but it still has a lot of longitude oh

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.630 
but it still has a lot of longitude oh
snap<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.439> can<00:01:13.740> if<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.040> want<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.250> pop<00:01:14.400> all

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
snap so you can if you want to pop all

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.310 
snap so you can if you want to pop all
these<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.880> can<00:01:15.000> pop<00:01:15.180> Ollie's<00:01:15.600> now<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.110> trick

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
these you can pop Ollie's now the trick

freestyle oriented all-terrain snowboard

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.120 
freestyle oriented all-terrain snowboard
it<00:01:20.580> has<00:01:20.790> pro<00:01:21.180> tips<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:22.200> cores<00:01:22.500> actually<00:01:22.950> been

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
it has pro tips the cores actually been

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.859 
it has pro tips the cores actually been
thinned<00:01:23.490> out<00:01:23.670> on<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.970> nose<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.360> tail<00:01:24.570> to

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
thinned out on the nose of the tail to

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.179 
thinned out on the nose of the tail to
reduce<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.259> amount<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.530> Swing<00:01:25.830> weight<00:01:26.040> and

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
reduce the amount of Swing weight and

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.359 
reduce the amount of Swing weight and
keep<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.460> board<00:01:26.700> overall<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.990> lot<00:01:28.229> lighter<00:01:28.530> but

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
keep the board overall a lot lighter but

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.340 
keep the board overall a lot lighter but
what's<00:01:29.970> cool<00:01:30.150> about<00:01:30.210> this<00:01:30.570> board<00:01:30.780> as<00:01:30.930> well<00:01:31.049> is

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
what's cool about this board as well is

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.929 
what's cool about this board as well is
the<00:01:31.500> jumper<00:01:31.770> cables<00:01:31.799> high<00:01:32.250> voltage<00:01:32.700> they're

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
the jumper cables high voltage they're

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.580 
the jumper cables high voltage they're
carbonate<00:01:33.390> rods<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.840> run<00:01:33.900> from<00:01:34.229> underneath

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.480 
the channel into the nose and the tail
that<00:01:37.200> give<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.500> board<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.040> little<00:01:38.130> bit<00:01:38.280> more

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
that give the board a little bit more

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.880 
that give the board a little bit more
snap<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:39.090> little<00:01:39.479> bit<00:01:39.570> more<00:01:39.720> pop<00:01:39.990> now<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.650> truth
