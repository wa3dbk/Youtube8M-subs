 but they agree that I can not come 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.389
 to the circus without popcorn and there is a person 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.310
 look, there's cotton candy, 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.090

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.830

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.220
 then the perry cow decided to lose 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.890
