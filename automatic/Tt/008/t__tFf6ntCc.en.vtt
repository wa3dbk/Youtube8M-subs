00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
let's see we've got a tech lab here as

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.900 
let's see we've got a tech lab here as
well<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.230> giving<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.890> Raven<00:01:56.370> so<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.580> lot<00:01:56.880> of

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
well so giving the Raven so a lot of

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.940 
well so giving the Raven so a lot of
unity<00:01:57.330> I'm<00:01:57.510> trying<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.990> find<00:01:58.290> out<00:01:58.380> let's<00:01:58.620> see

shields<00:02:30.600> because<00:02:31.080> of<00:02:31.200> course<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.530> tour<00:02:31.920> is

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
shields because of course the tour is

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.870 
shields because of course the tour is
Mel<00:02:32.370> release<00:02:32.670> cutting<00:02:33.240> about<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.980> yeah<00:02:34.980> so

expansion<00:02:36.870> is<00:02:37.290> going<00:02:37.830> up<00:02:38.040> let's<00:02:38.610> see<00:02:38.910> what<00:02:39.060> I

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
expansion is going up let's see what I

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.390 
expansion is going up let's see what I
can<00:02:39.420> figure<00:02:40.290> out<00:02:40.440> what<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:40.920> hell<00:02:40.950> is

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
can figure out what the hell is

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.000 
can figure out what the hell is
happening<00:02:41.430> here<00:02:41.880> we've<00:02:42.570> don't<00:02:43.320> have<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.530> mule

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
happening here we've don't have a mule

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.940 
happening here we've don't have a mule
however<00:02:44.580> but<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.660> orbital<00:02:46.290> command<00:02:46.560> i<00:02:46.740> think

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
however but that orbital command i think

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.790 
however but that orbital command i think
was<00:02:47.130> only<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.520> recently<00:02:47.940> built<00:02:48.500> or<00:02:49.500> else<00:02:49.650> he's

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
was only and recently built or else he's

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.440 
was only and recently built or else he's
been<00:02:50.010> using<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.490> for<00:02:50.520> something<00:02:50.820> else<00:02:51.120> maybe

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
been using it for something else maybe

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.199 
been using it for something else maybe
for<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:51.900> scanner<00:02:52.709> sweep<00:02:53.040> or<00:02:53.280> something<00:02:53.640> why

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
for a scanner sweep or something why

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.430 
for a scanner sweep or something why

comes the probe I love doing this do
your<00:04:18.020> stuff<00:04:18.140> broke<00:04:19.330> right<00:04:20.330> when<00:04:20.570> you<00:04:20.630> got<00:04:20.780> 400

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
your stuff broke right when you got 400

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:31.510 
your stuff broke right when you got 400
now<00:04:21.380> do<00:04:21.860> it<00:04:22.010> do<00:04:22.280> it<00:04:22.310> now<00:04:22.460> oh<00:04:22.730> oh<00:04:23.470> fuck<00:04:24.470> you<00:04:30.520> and

now do it do it now oh oh fuck you and

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.640 
now do it do it now oh oh fuck you and
it's<00:04:31.700> gonna<00:04:31.820> get<00:04:32.030> scanned<00:04:32.420> this<00:04:33.110> is<00:04:33.320> scan

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
it's gonna get scanned this is scan

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.490 
it's gonna get scanned this is scan
right<00:04:34.040> here<00:04:34.280> gonna<00:04:35.000> get<00:04:35.270> scanned<00:04:35.720> right<00:04:36.140> away

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
right here gonna get scanned right away

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.260 
right here gonna get scanned right away
so<00:04:36.560> sine<00:04:37.130> knows<00:04:37.550> where<00:04:37.850> he<00:04:37.940> needs<00:04:38.150> to<00:04:38.270> go<00:04:40.270> but

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
so sine knows where he needs to go but

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.760 
so sine knows where he needs to go but
it<00:04:41.330> might<00:04:41.510> actually<00:04:41.690> be<00:04:41.900> site<00:04:42.260> might<00:04:42.530> not<00:04:42.650> be

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
it might actually be site might not be

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:43.870 
it might actually be site might not be
able<00:04:42.920> to<00:04:43.100> someone<00:04:43.370> else<00:04:43.520> because<00:04:43.610> they're

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
able to someone else because they're

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.060 
able to someone else because they're
sharing<00:04:44.210> the<00:04:44.300> count<00:04:44.540> in<00:04:44.780> the<00:04:45.260> in<00:04:45.590> the<00:04:45.620> house<00:04:45.860> I

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
sharing the count in the in the house I

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.830 
sharing the count in the in the house I
think<00:04:46.340> so<00:04:46.520> several<00:04:47.030> people<00:04:47.060> might<00:04:47.630> actually

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
think so several people might actually

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.490 
think so several people might actually
play<00:04:48.380> on<00:04:48.530> it<00:04:48.760> not<00:04:49.760> it<00:04:50.180> in<00:04:50.540> the<00:04:50.720> house<00:04:50.900> to<00:04:51.320> tell

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
play on it not it in the house to tell

play on it not it in the house to tell
me<00:04:51.770> I<00:04:51.980> think<00:04:52.460> but<00:04:53.150> not<00:04:53.360> over<00:04:53.810> the<00:04:53.840> Internet<00:04:54.230> of

course

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.180

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
but probably say because he sent me to

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:04.000 
but probably say because he sent me to

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
you go so you've got other and almost

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.740 
you go so you've got other and almost
well<00:05:49.460> a<00:05:50.020> lot<00:05:51.020> more<00:05:51.700> almost<00:05:52.700> 60<00:05:53.150> more<00:05:53.300> supply

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
well a lot more almost 60 more supply

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.780 
well a lot more almost 60 more supply
but<00:05:53.960> that's<00:05:54.110> in<00:05:54.260> the<00:05:54.290> void<00:05:54.650> rays<00:05:54.980> and<00:05:55.280> the

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:55.790 
but that's in the void rays and the

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.360 
but that's in the void rays and the
stalkers<00:05:56.480> and<00:05:56.630> they<00:05:57.140> can<00:05:57.350> also<00:05:57.500> be<00:05:57.650> taken<00:05:58.250> out

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
stalkers and they can also be taken out

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.130 
stalkers and they can also be taken out
rather<00:05:58.610> quickly<00:05:58.760> because<00:05:59.330> starkers<00:05:59.750> have<00:05:59.870> 80

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.140 
rather quickly because starkers have 80

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.370 
rather quickly because starkers have 80
80<00:06:00.620> right<00:06:01.490> they<00:06:01.970> have<00:06:02.150> actually<00:06:02.480> have<00:06:03.230> the

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
80 right they have actually have the

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.210 
80 right they have actually have the
same<00:06:03.710> amount<00:06:04.040> of<00:06:04.190> our<00:06:04.400> God

try

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:13.540 

I<00:06:12.130> think

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
I think

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.670 
I think
thanks<00:06:13.850> to<00:06:13.940> a<00:06:13.970> trade<00:06:14.420> you've<00:06:14.720> got<00:06:14.930> one<00:06:15.170> diamond

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.080 

from<00:06:22.280> sigh<00:06:23.500> and<00:06:24.500> it's<00:06:24.889> not<00:06:25.250> going<00:06:25.430> to<00:06:25.550> work<00:06:25.699> I

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
from sigh and it's not going to work I

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.909 
from sigh and it's not going to work I
think<00:06:26.389> you<00:06:26.509> might<00:06:26.690> actually<00:06:26.930> get<00:06:27.319> completely

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 
think you might actually get completely

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:30.430 
think you might actually get completely
clobber<00:06:28.430> there<00:06:28.729> it<00:06:29.330> didn't<00:06:29.780> have<00:06:29.870> a<00:06:29.900> supply<00:06:30.289> it

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
clobber there it didn't have a supply it

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.700 
clobber there it didn't have a supply it
wasn't<00:06:30.979> using<00:06:31.340> it<00:06:32.169> experimenting<00:06:33.169> too<00:06:33.319> much<00:06:33.530> I

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:33.710 
wasn't using it experimenting too much I

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:36.370 
wasn't using it experimenting too much I
guess<00:06:33.740> but<00:06:34.699> the<00:06:34.819> thought<00:06:35.120> has<00:06:35.419> been<00:06:35.449> used<00:06:36.110> and

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:36.380 
guess but the thought has been used and

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:43.690 
guess but the thought has been used and
he's<00:06:36.530> now<00:06:36.770> gonna<00:06:36.979> get

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:43.700
