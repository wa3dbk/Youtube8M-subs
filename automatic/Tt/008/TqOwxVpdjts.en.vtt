business development director and this
is<00:00:11.220> the<00:00:11.340> extra<00:00:11.670> 500<00:00:12.300> spirit<00:00:12.780> behind<00:00:13.200> me<00:00:13.380> and

is the extra 500 spirit behind me and

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.030 
is the extra 500 spirit behind me and
think<00:00:14.760> a<00:00:14.850> special<00:00:15.090> about<00:00:15.540> our<00:00:15.600> airplane<00:00:16.230> is

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:17.040 
think a special about our airplane is

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.910 
think a special about our airplane is
that<00:00:17.340> it's<00:00:17.520> all<00:00:17.880> carbon<00:00:18.420> fiber<00:00:18.619> all<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.800> other

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
that it's all carbon fiber all the other

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.040 
that it's all carbon fiber all the other
term<00:00:20.220> remove<00:00:20.490> props<00:00:20.759> that<00:00:20.970> are<00:00:21.060> built<00:00:21.390> around

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
term remove props that are built around

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.160 
term remove props that are built around
the<00:00:22.230> world<00:00:22.259> today<00:00:22.740> are<00:00:22.890> made<00:00:23.070> of

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:24.170 
the world today are made of

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.440 
the world today are made of
instead<00:00:24.890> of<00:00:24.980> the<00:00:25.070> special<00:00:25.550> properties<00:00:26.150> of

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.450 
instead of the special properties of

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.320 
instead of the special properties of
carbon<00:00:26.930> fiber<00:00:27.230> are<00:00:27.590> this<00:00:27.830> lighter<00:00:28.610> airplane

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
carbon fiber are this lighter airplane

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.530 
carbon fiber are this lighter airplane
innocent<00:00:31.230> toughness<00:00:31.620> a<00:00:31.740> very<00:00:31.980> strong

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
innocent toughness a very strong

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.770 
innocent toughness a very strong
airframe

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
airframe

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.500 
airframe
so<00:00:34.260> because<00:00:34.740> it's<00:00:34.920> lighter<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.610> stronger

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
so because it's lighter and stronger

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.890 
so because it's lighter and stronger
were<00:00:36.900> able<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.290> build<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.770> larger<00:00:38.250> fuselage

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
were able to build a larger fuselage

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.330 
were able to build a larger fuselage
because<00:00:39.900> this<00:00:40.080> is<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.230> pressurized<00:00:40.800> airplane

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
because this is a pressurized airplane

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.360 
because this is a pressurized airplane
so<00:00:41.970> we<00:00:42.090> have<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.360> build<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.660> pressure<00:00:42.900> vessel<00:00:43.370> so

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
so we have to build a pressure vessel so

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.100 
so we have to build a pressure vessel so
because<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.910> materials<00:00:45.390> were<00:00:45.570> using<00:00:45.989> we

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
because of the materials were using we

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.619 
because of the materials were using we
can<00:00:46.290> build<00:00:46.470> a<00:00:46.590> bigger<00:00:46.830> pressure<00:00:47.190> vessel<00:00:47.700> fly

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
can build a bigger pressure vessel fly

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.470 
can build a bigger pressure vessel fly
higher<00:00:49.010> so<00:00:50.010> we<00:00:50.129> can<00:00:50.309> go<00:00:50.430> up<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.690> 25,000<00:00:51.690> feet

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
higher so we can go up to 25,000 feet

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.990 
higher so we can go up to 25,000 feet
and<00:00:52.840> havin<00:00:53.440> a<00:00:53.560> dozen

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
and havin a dozen

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.660 
and havin a dozen
so<00:00:56.180> basta<00:00:56.870> because<00:00:57.230> it's<00:00:57.440> so<00:00:57.620> light<00:00:57.920> we<00:00:58.520> can

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
so basta because it's so light we can

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.970 
so basta because it's so light we can
use<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:58.970> lighter<00:00:59.180> engine<00:00:59.500> we<00:01:00.500> use<00:01:00.710> the

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
use the lighter engine we use the

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.299 
use the lighter engine we use the
rolls-royce

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.300 

250<00:01:05.119> which<00:01:06.110> is<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:07.009> same<00:01:07.250> engine<00:01:07.490> that's<00:01:07.820> used

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
250 which is the same engine that's used

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.639 
250 which is the same engine that's used
helicopter<00:01:10.270> and<00:01:10.540> there<00:01:11.079> are<00:01:11.200> hundreds<00:01:11.530> of

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
helicopter and there are hundreds of

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:15.910 
helicopter and there are hundreds of
that

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.980 

but<00:01:16.369> because<00:01:16.759> we<00:01:16.970> have<00:01:17.060> a<00:01:17.090> light<00:01:17.330> airframe<00:01:17.810> we

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
but because we have a light airframe we

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.740 
but because we have a light airframe we
can<00:01:18.140> use<00:01:18.290> it<00:01:18.439> to<00:01:18.470> underground

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
can use it to underground

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:31.680 
can use it to underground
and<00:01:20.110> so<00:01:20.380> we<00:01:21.130> don't<00:01:22.950> 20-gallon<00:01:27.780> have<00:01:30.690> that

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
and so we don't 20-gallon have that

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:38.460 
and so we don't 20-gallon have that
sense<00:01:31.990> it's<00:01:32.200> been<00:01:32.380> a<00:01:32.410> bit<00:01:32.620> green<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:38.140> we<00:01:38.170> can

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
sense it's been a bit green so we can

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:46.980 
sense it's been a bit green so we can
take<00:01:38.650> off<00:01:38.860> with<00:01:39.040> more<00:01:39.250> weight

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.940 

that's<00:01:47.560> almost<00:01:47.799> twice<00:01:48.189> as<00:01:48.400> far<00:01:48.640> as<00:01:48.820> their<00:01:49.000> ears

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
that's almost twice as far as their ears

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.620 
that's almost twice as far as their ears
with<00:01:50.950> all<00:01:51.100> that<00:01:51.310> going<00:01:51.520> for<00:01:51.850> us<00:01:52.060> for<00:01:52.299> several

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
with all that going for us for several

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.249 
with all that going for us for several
hundred<00:01:52.869> thousand<00:01:53.259> dollars<00:01:53.560> less<00:01:53.830> in<00:01:54.130> price

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
hundred thousand dollars less in price

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.880 
hundred thousand dollars less in price
so<00:01:56.259> it's<00:01:56.470> it's<00:01:56.770> a<00:01:56.860> great<00:01:57.009> fly<00:01:57.369> it's<00:01:58.270> also

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
so it's it's a great fly it's also

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:10.199 
so it's it's a great fly it's also
unusual<00:02:08.100> that's<00:02:09.100> about<00:02:09.429> half<00:02:09.729> of<00:02:09.880> what<00:02:10.060> our

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
unusual that's about half of what our

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.800 
unusual that's about half of what our
competitor<00:02:10.780> needs<00:02:11.019> what<00:02:11.769> that<00:02:11.950> means<00:02:12.190> is

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
competitor needs what that means is

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.790 
competitor needs what that means is
someone<00:02:13.810> who<00:02:13.900> owns<00:02:14.080> one<00:02:14.349> of<00:02:14.380> these<00:02:14.590> airplanes

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
someone who owns one of these airplanes

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.370 
someone who owns one of these airplanes
and<00:02:15.430> keep<00:02:15.670> it<00:02:15.819> on<00:02:15.910> a<00:02:15.940> local<00:02:16.360> airport<00:02:16.510> or<00:02:17.110> even<00:02:17.319> a

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
and keep it on a local airport or even a

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.309 
and keep it on a local airport or even a
grass<00:02:17.680> strip<00:02:18.330> since<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.450> wingspan<00:02:19.810> is<00:02:20.170> only

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
grass strip since the wingspan is only

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:26.100 
grass strip since the wingspan is only
38<00:02:20.860> foot<00:02:21.220> branches<00:02:21.880> rather<00:02:24.660> you<00:02:25.660> can<00:02:25.810> put<00:02:25.989> it

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
38 foot branches rather you can put it

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.590 
38 foot branches rather you can put it
down<00:02:26.230> a<00:02:26.260> standard<00:02:29.610> so<00:02:30.610> it's<00:02:30.760> a<00:02:30.910> very<00:02:31.239> very

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
down a standard so it's a very very

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.470 
down a standard so it's a very very
versatile<00:02:32.019> airplane<00:02:36.209> what<00:02:37.209> do<00:02:37.269> you<00:02:37.360> find

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
versatile airplane what do you find

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.670 
versatile airplane what do you find
