00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:14.250

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:17.430

 that means we have the herb garden like that 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.730
 insight into it for our guests 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.310
 helper children that return to nature 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.619
 the students find their way back 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.540
 learn everything about the nurturing and 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:39.000
 healing effect of herbs 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:48.260
 be valuable natural resources 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:49.739
 skincare products manufactured and with 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.870
 essential oils 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.920
 that was really great, that's what I have 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.629
 users then after the shower or 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:02.100
 but I am happy now 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:07.220
 especially on the face cream coconut 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:10.380
 cream with yoga oil cocoa butter 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.670
 essential rose oil to collect the 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.530
 gives a fragrant face cream 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.689
 of course I am very sympathetic 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.570
 The products are that there are few ingredients 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:26.880
 are the natural ingredients are 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.970
 which one of bands and are simple 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.770
 many things are not in there in 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.270
 conventional cosmetics otherwise used 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.250
 These are paraffin emulsifiers 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.460
 synthetic emulators which then still 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.450
 rather controversial are in deus 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.310
 aluminum salts and so on and in 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.649
 own products that not so long 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.820
 You have to be durable on something like that 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.820
 sift through design 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.810
 selected ingredients and targeted 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.980
 dosage the body something good to do that 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.990
 is the goal of the course 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:11.260
 I find it quite interesting and how 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:15.400

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:19.330
 brings important because in a saarburg 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.760

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.710
 the chemistry thinks it's great that one 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.090

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.420
 Maybe then the wrestling fight then 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.840
 but the lip balm succeeds positively 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.390
 I think it's great to make that gift 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.850

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:44.230

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.760
