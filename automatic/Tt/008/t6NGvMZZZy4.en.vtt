00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
a really no chance but um also actually

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.399 
a really no chance but um also actually
another<00:01:37.710> one<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.159> can<00:01:38.900> another<00:01:39.900> thing<00:01:40.290> you

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
another one you can another thing you

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.910 
another one you can another thing you
can<00:01:40.590> kill<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.899> they<00:01:42.899> ran<00:01:43.110> past<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.530> minute<00:01:43.799> go

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
can kill is they ran past a minute go

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.910 
can kill is they ran past a minute go
aah<00:01:44.130> Thunder<00:01:45.060> Mors<00:01:45.500> because<00:01:46.500> they're<00:01:46.649> quite

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
aah Thunder Mors because they're quite

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.090 
aah Thunder Mors because they're quite
easy<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.369> kill<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.140> they<00:01:50.600> also<00:01:51.649> can<00:01:52.649> drop<00:01:52.920> the

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
easy to kill and they also can drop the

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.940 
easy to kill and they also can drop the
sky<00:01:53.310> shards<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:54.060> lot<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.079> mobs<00:01:55.259> can<00:01:55.530> drop<00:01:55.740> them

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
sky shards a lot of mobs can drop them

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.149 
sky shards a lot of mobs can drop them
it's<00:01:56.159> just<00:01:56.570> chance<00:01:57.570> really

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
it's just chance really

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.999 
it's just chance really
stuff<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.490> be<00:01:59.609> lucky<00:01:59.939> I<00:01:59.969> guess<00:02:03.619> so<00:02:04.619> just<00:02:04.799> kill

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
stuff to be lucky I guess so just kill

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.460 
stuff to be lucky I guess so just kill
this<00:02:05.219> guy<00:02:06.649> you<00:02:07.649> go<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.780> nope<00:02:09.780> still<00:02:10.140> nothing

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
this guy you go and nope still nothing

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.940 
this guy you go and nope still nothing
but<00:02:11.160> eventually<00:02:11.930> if<00:02:12.930> you're<00:02:13.140> lucky<00:02:13.470> you'll

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
but eventually if you're lucky you'll

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.520 
but eventually if you're lucky you'll
find<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.340> skyshard<00:02:14.819> like<00:02:15.690> I<00:02:15.780> said<00:02:15.959> you<00:02:16.080> need<00:02:16.200> 10

I'm<00:02:24.750> recording<00:02:24.989> this<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.500> would<00:02:25.590> be<00:02:25.680> nice

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 
I'm recording this that would be nice

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:31.130 
I'm recording this that would be nice
come<00:02:26.519> on<00:02:27.379> ok<00:02:28.379> maybe<00:02:28.980> not<00:02:29.099> but<00:02:30.090> this<00:02:31.080> is

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
come on ok maybe not but this is

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.960 
come on ok maybe not but this is
basically<00:02:31.590> all<00:02:31.769> you<00:02:31.890> do<00:02:32.069> you<00:02:32.430> just<00:02:33.049> kill<00:02:34.049> these

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
basically all you do you just kill these

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.319 
basically all you do you just kill these
for<00:02:35.970> hours<00:02:36.329> and<00:02:36.569> hours<00:02:36.930> hoping<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.829> get

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
for hours and hours hoping you get

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:43.610 
for hours and hours hoping you get
skyshard<00:02:39.379> so<00:02:40.849> just<00:02:41.849> do<00:02:42.000> that<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:43.170> eventually

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
skyshard so just do that and eventually

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.650 
skyshard so just do that and eventually
you'll<00:02:43.739> be<00:02:43.829> able<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:44.099> get<00:02:44.220> them<00:02:44.340> out<00:02:44.459> now<00:02:44.700> I

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
you'll be able to get them out now I

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.569 
you'll be able to get them out now I

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
don't even have quite separate and

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.750 
don't even have quite separate and
riding<00:02:47.970> yet<00:02:48.209> because<00:02:48.540> I<00:02:48.660> just<00:02:49.200> I<00:02:49.609> haven't<00:02:50.609> done

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760

on the timeless Isle and I got a man and
I'm<00:03:43.079> not<00:03:43.200> sure<00:03:43.380> if<00:03:43.470> it<00:03:43.560> is<00:03:43.590> 100%<00:03:44.040> chance<00:03:44.519> I'll

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
I'm not sure if it is 100% chance I'll

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.909 
I'm not sure if it is 100% chance I'll
probably<00:03:44.940> look<00:03:45.359> it's<00:03:45.510> probably<00:03:45.780> like<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:45.919> low

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
probably look it's probably like a low

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:49.819 
probably look it's probably like a low
chance<00:03:47.220> but<00:03:48.079> we<00:03:49.079> have<00:03:49.169> to<00:03:49.260> do<00:03:49.349> is<00:03:49.470> just<00:03:49.620> keep

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
chance but we have to do is just keep

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.629 
chance but we have to do is just keep
killing<00:03:50.220> these<00:03:50.370> and<00:03:50.819> eventually<00:03:52.190> be<00:03:53.190> amazing
