00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:07.439
 hello to all I introduce myself this is 

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:09.360
 crazy bandido so rather on the name of 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:10.910
 boyne tells the president a video that's 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.240
 the name of the youtube channel 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:17.250
 so today is my first video 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.910
 on my youtube channel 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.180
 so my first video on August 30, 2011 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.849
 night soon back to school unfortunately 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:30.060
 so this is a little tutorial on the red 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:40.920
 stone or there two years ago b that is 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:44.550
 available born in lewai listen to the crisis no 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.280
 water damage because it's not a said oh I 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.590
 going to do the first video so is 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:55.140
 it is on it carries piston so 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:58.800
 this is an example of course there is a lot 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.760
 more systems to do but 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:07.440
 me it's a simple system if there is 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:10.860
 no need for many two circuits 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:15.030
 it's a small example to go back to 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:18.450
 well on a button and that's all about 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.200
 suite and to go out you put on the 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.970
 staffing plates it closes 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:28.140
 excuse me if a few lags 40 moment 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:31.250
 my freebox the east station so yes it 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.020
 it's my skin that I made myself 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:38.940
 with suspenders that is a little 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:42.360
 peasants that's what I like everything 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:45.780
 which is the heart culture view 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.690
 explained how does this circuit 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.750
 you need redstone tasks 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:55.560
 of redstone sticks and pistons and 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.860
 pressure plates and a breton so 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.540
 light pressure pack then back on 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.820
 a server I think I'm going to them 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:11.060
 mouse I have a permission do this 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.060
 video a loan that can drift 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:22.389
 so here on the server we have stuff 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:28.540
 we have buildings but I specify 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:34.870
 we do not neglect it's sorry 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:37.599
 live does not exist because it's 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.439
 just for the tutorials I'm doing this so 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.439
 so we will start 

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:49.659
 no when I dropped a little bit are 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:56.439
 because we hear spiders have 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:59.489
 already maybe ferhat heindel me I 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.489
 go down flat they are 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:06.280
 here are some music markets 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:09.510
 here it is, so we start by doing a 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.790
 tetris so if you know the game 20 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.280
 years 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.019
 then you dig four blocks into 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.500
 the right 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:24.280
 that's 2 1 2 3 4 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:28.989
 so yes I used a super pic ex that 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:32.620
 it's a faster and where you are in 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:40.269
 do here they will find here if you 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:44.379
 dig everywhere deep except here 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:49.930
 here and here it is what we will expose 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:53.290
 here the redstone torch here is the 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.620
 powder is also you need some 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.680
 repeaters excuse me I meant 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:02.939
 so we put repeaters like these 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.939
 an inquiry and the click 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:13.370
 and hop not follow I go so 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:21.500
 that one you put on zero and this 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:25.940
 on four then connect you this 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:29.000
 torch there at this gold fla so now 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:32.139
 what are we doing in the heart we have finished 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.110
 which is what below the pistons 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:39.320
 so where are you putting two blocks for 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:44.860
 not custom the redstone torch you 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.860
 put a poor guy on top like this if 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:56.360
 then you make a small passage to 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:59.780
 that you can go through 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:04.610
 simply you see there the 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:13.190
 pistons salute so we'll put the 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:16.750
 mock up so could not do a job he puts 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:26.180
 pressure sores when a lag 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:31.910
 excuse me so do migdal coming 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:40.090
 pressure plates currently and 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:40.090
 a boot a button so 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:53.580
 no it's because I have a little taste 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:06:00.389
 wii so you not take what you 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:06:03.449
 want to put a button here see here it 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:07.080
 opens and closes and of course for 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:10.800
 go out well you put two plates 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.690
 of pressure hop and rock 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.479
 so especially what I find good 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:18.030
 sitting on this system 

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:25.620
 it's a first you can hide it 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:28.530
 easily and it takes for me finally 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:33.720
 that's it huh 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:37.259
 1 2 3 74th place and its practices 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:38.940
 I did one in five on his 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:42.650
 waiters I will show you now 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:46.440
 we are back in front of montfort so 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:47.840
 the entrance lends itself to you see it's the 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:53.099
 same system 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:07:05.990
 this button is the enemy of allah for 

00:06:53.099 --> 00:07:05.990
 stand out so separate the same wildlife so 

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:12.240
 you make a little way of middle and one 

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:17.909
 ticket I think it makes good because 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:21.509
 that our olam death in high school and well the 

00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:24.330
 build so he is not yet 

00:07:21.509 --> 00:07:28.349
 I do not have all the time 

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:30.690
 not going to be reproduced no because 

00:07:28.349 --> 00:07:36.110
 it was bandido why this first 

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:40.460
 minecraft video so a tutorial so 

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.460
 it's him all and good luck
