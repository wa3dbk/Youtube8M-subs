try<00:03:42.320> and<00:03:42.410> get<00:03:42.530> more<00:03:42.709> one<00:03:42.950> drops<00:03:43.280> but<00:03:44.090> as<00:03:44.239> far<00:03:44.390> as

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
try and get more one drops but as far as

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.150 
try and get more one drops but as far as
that<00:03:44.660> I<00:03:44.720> mean<00:03:44.930> my<00:03:45.019> mana<00:03:45.500> curve<00:03:45.739> was<00:03:45.950> pretty

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
that I mean my mana curve was pretty

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.830 
that I mean my mana curve was pretty
good<00:03:46.340> other<00:03:46.489> than<00:03:46.640> the<00:03:46.700> one<00:03:46.910> drops<00:03:47.209> and<00:03:47.480> I'd

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
good other than the one drops and I'd

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.020
