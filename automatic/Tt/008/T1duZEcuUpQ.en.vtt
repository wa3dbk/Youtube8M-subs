the<00:01:32.780> hole<00:01:32.960> for<00:01:33.230> humanity<00:01:33.770> it<00:01:34.190> was<00:01:34.310> just

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
the hole for humanity it was just

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.580 
the hole for humanity it was just
amazing<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:34.940> I<00:01:35.240> want<00:01:35.600> to<00:01:35.660> talk<00:01:35.810> about<00:01:35.930> the

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
amazing and I want to talk about the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.570 
amazing and I want to talk about the
theme<00:01:36.800> of<00:01:36.830> this<00:01:36.980> episode<00:01:37.190> pretty<00:01:37.460> much<00:01:37.690> was

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
theme of this episode pretty much was

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.000 
theme of this episode pretty much was
emotional<00:01:40.580> aspects<00:01:41.030> versus<00:01:41.810> being<00:01:42.140> practical

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 
emotional aspects versus being practical

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.580 
emotional aspects versus being practical
and<00:01:43.190> with<00:01:43.580> that<00:01:43.610> practicality<00:01:44.360> came<00:01:44.870> a<00:01:45.110> loss

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
and with that practicality came a loss

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.520 
and with that practicality came a loss
in<00:01:46.150> humanity<00:01:47.150> and<00:01:47.330> then<00:01:47.870> the<00:01:48.020> balance<00:01:48.410> between

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
in humanity and then the balance between

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.900 
in humanity and then the balance between
that<00:01:48.860> I<00:01:48.890> think<00:01:49.070> that's<00:01:49.190> really<00:01:49.370> highlighted

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
that I think that's really highlighted

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.510 
that I think that's really highlighted
in<00:01:50.060> the<00:01:50.210> scene<00:01:50.450> with<00:01:50.660> Jean<00:01:51.050> Jean<00:01:51.740> he<00:01:52.220> comes

they know who they lost so she's very

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.819 
they know who they lost so she's very
practical<00:02:32.329> but<00:02:32.689> at<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.810> same<00:02:33.019> time<00:02:33.290> that
