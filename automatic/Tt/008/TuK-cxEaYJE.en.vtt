00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.070 
tankers are either elliptical

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.690 
tankers are either elliptical
cylindrical<00:05:34.000> or<00:05:34.180> double<00:05:34.930> conical<00:05:35.700> the

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
cylindrical or double conical the

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.180 
cylindrical or double conical the
advantage<00:05:37.210> of<00:05:37.480> an<00:05:37.750> elliptical<00:05:38.320> or<00:05:38.470> oval<00:05:38.920> tank

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
advantage of an elliptical or oval tank

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.030 
advantage of an elliptical or oval tank
is<00:05:39.400> that<00:05:39.550> it<00:05:39.700> has<00:05:39.880> a<00:05:39.910> lower<00:05:40.300> center<00:05:40.780> of<00:05:40.810> gravity

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
is that it has a lower center of gravity

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.740 
is that it has a lower center of gravity
which<00:05:42.040> contributes<00:05:42.550> to<00:05:42.640> less<00:05:43.000> load<00:05:43.270> movement

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
which contributes to less load movement

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.680 
which contributes to less load movement
therefore<00:05:44.350> offering<00:05:44.710> better<00:05:45.010> handling<00:05:45.460> on

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
therefore offering better handling on

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.270 
therefore offering better handling on
the<00:05:46.690> other<00:05:46.840> hand<00:05:47.140> the<00:05:47.560> cylindrical<00:05:48.040> or

the other hand the cylindrical or
circular<00:05:48.820> tank<00:05:49.060> is<00:05:49.360> stronger<00:05:49.900> than<00:05:50.020> quite

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320
