actually<00:02:38.380> have<00:02:38.770> three<00:02:38.980> different<00:02:39.420> melons<00:02:40.420> in

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
actually have three different melons in

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.630 
actually have three different melons in

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
that line of the cantaloupe or muskmelon

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.480 
that line of the cantaloupe or muskmelon
line<00:02:43.260> what<00:02:44.260> I<00:02:44.290> have<00:02:44.590> here<00:02:44.830> is<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.100> first<00:02:45.280> one

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490

this<00:02:46.420> isn't<00:02:46.750> an<00:02:47.440> Athena<00:02:47.860> must<00:02:48.670> melon<00:02:49.060> and<00:02:49.630> you

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
this isn't an Athena must melon and you

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.570 
this isn't an Athena must melon and you
can<00:02:49.930> tell<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.290> difference<00:02:50.680> by<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:50.920> ridges<00:02:51.400> on

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
can tell the difference by the ridges on

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.420 
can tell the difference by the ridges on
the<00:02:51.610> melon<00:02:52.000> itself<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:53.050> then<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.920> themas

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
the melon itself and then the themas

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.100 
the melon itself and then the themas
tend<00:02:54.850> to<00:02:54.910> be<00:02:55.000> a<00:02:55.030> little<00:02:55.180> bit<00:02:55.420> sweeter<00:02:55.840> than

tend to be a little bit sweeter than

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.470 
tend to be a little bit sweeter than
your<00:02:56.260> regular<00:02:56.470> cantaloupe<00:02:57.310> then<00:02:58.030> they<00:02:58.239> tend

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
your regular cantaloupe then they tend

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.690 
your regular cantaloupe then they tend
to<00:02:58.570> break<00:02:58.810> down<00:02:59.080> faster<00:02:59.709> because<00:03:00.489> of<00:03:00.610> that

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
to break down faster because of that

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.580 
to break down faster because of that
sweetness<00:03:01.270> the<00:03:01.450> sugars<00:03:01.810> allow<00:03:02.110> them<00:03:02.260> to<00:03:02.380> break

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
sweetness the sugars allow them to break

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.920 
sweetness the sugars allow them to break
down<00:03:02.770> a<00:03:02.800> bit<00:03:03.070> quicker<00:03:03.400> in<00:03:04.150> picking<00:03:04.570> a<00:03:04.750> good
