the<00:00:05.450> immune<00:00:05.779> system<00:00:06.230> of<00:00:06.380> the<00:00:06.590> human<00:00:06.890> body<00:00:07.040> acts

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:07.700 
the immune system of the human body acts

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.350 
the immune system of the human body acts
as<00:00:08.330> a<00:00:08.360> protector<00:00:09.050> from<00:00:09.349> harmful<00:00:09.590> substances

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:10.360 
as a protector from harmful substances

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.180 
as a protector from harmful substances
these<00:00:11.360> harmful<00:00:11.750> substances<00:00:12.469> when<00:00:12.830> entering

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
these harmful substances when entering

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.699 
these harmful substances when entering
the<00:00:13.250> body<00:00:13.490> are<00:00:13.790> then<00:00:14.209> known<00:00:14.540> as<00:00:14.719> antigens<00:00:15.440> if

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:15.709 
the body are then known as antigens if

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:18.430 
the body are then known as antigens if
we<00:00:16.550> use<00:00:16.760> the<00:00:17.000> example<00:00:17.480> of<00:00:17.690> a<00:00:17.750> bank<00:00:17.990> robbery

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:18.440 
we use the example of a bank robbery

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.710 
we use the example of a bank robbery
with<00:00:18.740> multiple<00:00:19.250> perpetrators<00:00:19.580> as<00:00:20.119> the<00:00:20.420> attack

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
with multiple perpetrators as the attack

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.259 
with multiple perpetrators as the attack
on<00:00:20.990> the<00:00:21.170> body<00:00:21.349> then<00:00:22.310> the<00:00:22.490> robbers<00:00:22.939> would<00:00:23.150> be

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 
on the body then the robbers would be

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:25.240 
on the body then the robbers would be
considered<00:00:23.689> the<00:00:23.720> antigens<00:00:24.320> and<00:00:24.529> the<00:00:24.980> police

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
considered the antigens and the police

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.859 
considered the antigens and the police
officers<00:00:25.760> would<00:00:26.119> be<00:00:26.150> part<00:00:26.480> of<00:00:26.539> the<00:00:26.599> immune

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
officers would be part of the immune

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:27.460 
officers would be part of the immune
