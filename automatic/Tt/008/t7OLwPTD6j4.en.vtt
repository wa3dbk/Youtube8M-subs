me<00:00:25.369> the<00:00:26.369> sounds<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.210> light<00:00:27.449> everything<00:00:28.050> was

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
me the sounds the light everything was

really<00:00:28.880> irritating<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.090> me<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.330> think<00:00:30.390> it

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
really irritating to me and I think it

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.790 
really irritating to me and I think it
was<00:00:30.900> because<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:33.200> that<00:00:34.200> stuff<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.530> put<00:00:34.649> you

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800

anesthesia<00:00:38.719> I<00:00:39.719> thought<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.290> would<00:00:40.379> be<00:00:40.469> really

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620
