00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:16.350
 Everyone who knows me knows that I am in 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.390
 catastrophic football later I am 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.439
 can barely play football 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.029
 I still enjoy doing it and football 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.199
 does not matter which sport helps you 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.019
 in muscle building 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.730
 may you be wondering how 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.340
 with football as muscle building goes 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.000
 the so many of my customers I 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.880
 train 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.440
 People especially ask me when 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.050
 Muscle building training in the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.040
 longer breaks 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.660
 I always have the feeling I still want 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.920
 what to do and then try the 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.469
 really at home a little bit too 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.329
 train a bit because of that 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.270
 activate the muscles because they are 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.070
 feeling have more helps but is more 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.000
 not correct 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.860
 important is that the muscles will 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.710
 in peace, the muscles grow 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.899
 in the resting phase not during training and 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.890
 For example, I know there is help 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.879
 you want a little something to do with you 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.890
 be active in sports 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.840
 Does a sport really do that with the 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.979
 with the muscle training with the 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.600
 repetition number at the 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.490
 Muscle building training is not used 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.240
 really have a lot to do football is 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.790
 an example 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.500
 that's why the title football is becoming 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.130
 Football actually helps 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.119
 muskelaufbau 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.650
 yes, because I protect against it or because 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.270
 then practically no exercise does that 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.549
 would virtually prevent muscle development 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.619
 even if it can not play 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.540
 football it's great fun 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.400
 a little jogging makes a little carlo 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.710
 on the weekend but the muscles last 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.900
 really let her grow there 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.060
 in an intense good strong 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.299
 trainingsreiz and gives the afterwards 40 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.299
 Quiet
