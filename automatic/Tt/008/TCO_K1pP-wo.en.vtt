see about this new applicator that is

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.730 
see about this new applicator that is
very<00:00:21.359> revolutionary<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.350> hopefully<00:00:22.560> will

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
very revolutionary and it hopefully will

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.769 
very revolutionary and it hopefully will
solve<00:00:23.189> some<00:00:23.820> of<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.000> problems<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.480> we<00:00:24.660> have

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
solve some of the problems that we have

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.900 
solve some of the problems that we have
with<00:00:24.810> mixing<00:00:25.470> color<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.039> storing<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.640> at<00:00:26.760> home

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
with mixing color and storing it at home

00:00:26.910 --> 00:01:01.819 
with mixing color and storing it at home
so<00:00:27.359> let's<00:00:27.599> try<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.170> out

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.439 

okay<00:01:02.829> so<00:01:02.890> I<00:01:03.039> think<00:01:03.160> I<00:01:03.460> have<00:01:03.640> the<00:01:03.820> color<00:01:04.030> evenly

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
okay so I think I have the color evenly

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.660 
okay so I think I have the color evenly
applied<00:01:04.839> when<00:01:05.199> I'm<00:01:05.350> really<00:01:05.680> easy<00:01:05.920> because

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
applied when I'm really easy because

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.330 
applied when I'm really easy because
it's<00:01:06.939> a<00:01:07.030> foam<00:01:07.360> but<00:01:08.170> because<00:01:08.470> it's<00:01:08.619> not<00:01:08.770> drippy

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
it's a foam but because it's not drippy

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.730 
it's a foam but because it's not drippy
and<00:01:09.369> his<00:01:09.790> watery<00:01:10.180> as<00:01:10.360> some<00:01:10.630> colors<00:01:11.049> it<00:01:11.439> almost

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
and his watery as some colors it almost

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.770 
and his watery as some colors it almost
soaked<00:01:12.130> into<00:01:12.340> the<00:01:12.520> hair<00:01:12.729> so<00:01:13.149> quickly<00:01:13.509> I<00:01:13.540> had<00:01:13.750> a

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
soaked into the hair so quickly I had a

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.039 
soaked into the hair so quickly I had a
hard<00:01:14.049> time<00:01:14.110> determining<00:01:14.729> if<00:01:15.729> I<00:01:15.939> indeed<00:01:16.570> gotten

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
hard time determining if I indeed gotten

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:19.050 
hard time determining if I indeed gotten
every<00:01:17.320> strand<00:01:17.680> so<00:01:18.009> it'll<00:01:18.460> be<00:01:18.549> interesting<00:01:18.729> to

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
every strand so it'll be interesting to

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.139 
every strand so it'll be interesting to
see<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:20.350> went<00:01:20.799> over<00:01:21.009> my<00:01:21.070> entire<00:01:21.280> head<00:01:21.729> and

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149 
see I went over my entire head and

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.149 
see I went over my entire head and
really<00:01:22.330> worked<00:01:22.570> it<00:01:22.720> in<00:01:22.840> and<00:01:23.170> I<00:01:23.530> just<00:01:23.770> hope<00:01:23.950> that

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
really worked it in and I just hope that

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.850 
really worked it in and I just hope that
I<00:01:24.220> got<00:01:24.940> even<00:01:25.270> color<00:01:25.479> so<00:01:25.720> we'll<00:01:25.840> find<00:01:25.990> out<00:01:26.229> so

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
I got even color so we'll find out so

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.590 
I got even color so we'll find out so
what<00:01:27.009> do<00:01:27.070> I<00:01:27.130> think<00:01:27.159> of<00:01:27.430> the<00:01:27.520> color<00:01:27.729> as<00:01:27.970> you<00:01:28.479> can

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
what do I think of the color as you can

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.679 
what do I think of the color as you can
see<00:01:28.869> really<00:01:29.409> great<00:01:29.799> as<00:01:29.979> far<00:01:30.159> as<00:01:30.310> tone<00:01:30.689> coverage

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
see really great as far as tone coverage

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:34.230 
see really great as far as tone coverage
we<00:01:31.990> got<00:01:32.140> about<00:01:32.350> 80%<00:01:32.830> of<00:01:33.220> the<00:01:33.340> Grays<00:01:33.520> covered<00:01:33.970> 80

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
we got about 80% of the Grays covered 80

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.540 
we got about 80% of the Grays covered 80
to<00:01:34.420> 85<00:01:34.810> which<00:01:35.020> is<00:01:35.170> really<00:01:35.649> probably<00:01:36.039> the<00:01:36.250> best

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
to 85 which is really probably the best

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.850 
to 85 which is really probably the best
I've<00:01:36.819> seen<00:01:36.850> with<00:01:37.630> a<00:01:37.659> home<00:01:37.899> color<00:01:38.170> product<00:01:38.649> and
