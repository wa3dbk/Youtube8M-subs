00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
little bit and once you get to the end

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.060 
little bit and once you get to the end
instead<00:03:52.720> of<00:03:52.900> going<00:03:53.200> to<00:03:53.320> the<00:03:53.410> right<00:03:53.620> you<00:03:53.830> want

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
instead of going to the right you want

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:59.790 
instead of going to the right you want
to<00:03:54.160> go<00:03:54.310> left<00:03:57.900> so<00:03:58.900> go<00:03:59.020> ahead<00:03:59.110> and<00:03:59.230> pick<00:03:59.440> up<00:03:59.590> that

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
to go left so go ahead and pick up that

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.250 
to go left so go ahead and pick up that
totem<00:04:00.220> if<00:04:01.090> that's<00:04:01.480> the<00:04:01.630> only<00:04:01.840> thing<00:04:02.020> you<00:04:02.110> want

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
totem if that's the only thing you want

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.660 
totem if that's the only thing you want
