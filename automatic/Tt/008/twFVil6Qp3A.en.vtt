the<00:00:30.740> last<00:00:31.740> milestone<00:00:32.369> was<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.480> game<00:00:34.200> design

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
the last milestone was the game design

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.049 
the last milestone was the game design
document<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.070> GDD<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:37.160> that<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.489> basically

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
document the GDD and that is basically

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.889 
document the GDD and that is basically
the<00:00:39.300> result<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:39.750> was<00:00:40.260> kind<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.899> focusing

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
the result of that was kind of focusing

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.229 
the result of that was kind of focusing
down<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.410> getting<00:00:43.590> lobbing<00:00:44.489> things<00:00:44.820> out<00:00:45.090> and

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
down and getting lobbing things out and

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.819 
down and getting lobbing things out and
adding<00:00:45.510> things<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.930> changing<00:00:46.230> things<00:00:46.530> from

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
adding things and changing things from

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.510 
adding things and changing things from
the<00:00:47.010> previous<00:00:47.820> most<00:00:48.059> earnest<00:00:48.420> pre-production

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
the previous most earnest pre-production

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.959 
the previous most earnest pre-production
so<00:00:50.520> we<00:00:50.640> took<00:00:51.829> all<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.890> their<00:00:53.129> ideas<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.789> there

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
so we took all of their ideas in there

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.310 
so we took all of their ideas in there
and<00:00:54.239> kind<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.480> figured<00:00:54.690> out<00:00:54.750> what<00:00:54.870> we<00:00:54.960> can<00:00:55.110> and

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
and kind of figured out what we can and

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.420 
and kind of figured out what we can and
can't<00:00:55.379> do<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:57.199> focused<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.320> into<00:00:58.590> one<00:00:59.070> one

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
can't do and focused it into one one

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.860 
can't do and focused it into one one
kind<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.820> document<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.420> i<00:01:00.480> worked<00:01:00.600> out<00:01:00.750> really

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
kind of document so i worked out really

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.080 
kind of document so i worked out really
