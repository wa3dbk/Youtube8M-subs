you're<00:01:34.430> doing<00:01:34.670> this<00:01:34.789> fast<00:01:35.450> you<00:01:35.780> might<00:01:35.990> want<00:01:36.289> to

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
you're doing this fast you might want to

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.850 
you're doing this fast you might want to
pop<00:01:36.590> on<00:01:36.860> the<00:01:37.100> there<00:01:37.670> is<00:01:37.759> a<00:01:37.789> turbo<00:01:38.390> option<00:01:38.960> so

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
pop on the there is a turbo option so

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.650 
pop on the there is a turbo option so
that's<00:01:40.039> going<00:01:40.160> to<00:01:40.220> make<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:41.030> vacuum<00:01:41.390> much

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
that's going to make the vacuum much

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.440 
that's going to make the vacuum much
faster<00:01:42.200> it's<00:01:42.500> going<00:01:42.649> to<00:01:43.009> make<00:01:43.820> the<00:01:43.970> trimmer

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
faster it's going to make the trimmer

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.020 
faster it's going to make the trimmer
fast<00:01:44.810> or<00:01:45.020> too<00:01:45.050> so<00:01:45.530> you<00:01:46.009> can<00:01:46.070> use<00:01:46.399> that<00:01:46.580> turbo

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030

fast or too so you can use that turbo
option<00:01:47.479> there<00:01:47.660> all<00:01:48.590> in<00:01:48.800> all<00:01:48.890> I<00:01:48.920> think<00:01:49.039> this<00:01:49.280> is

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
option there all in all I think this is
