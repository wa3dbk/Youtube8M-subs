00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.750
 Hello everyone, again , I have a kilovolt 

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:07.819
 today i got to 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:16.219
 right rear lights decided it before 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:22.810
 shine on these are the LEDs here 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:22.810
 Dear pretty powerful 7 9 watts 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:31.400
 Whether here a bitch compatible about bulbs about 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:36.730
 Of course I congratulated this brand 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.730
 small and and here here 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:45.969
 soldered just in case here in this 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:51.320
 this place soldered the central posting 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:56.170
 Here you have a wonderful night and see how 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:59.170
 they shine let's start in order 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.170
 stop signal 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:03.730
 envelope mode 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:17.250
 wait for me 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.250
 brightness 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:27.590
 stop light mode is even brighter than choosing 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:35.630
 brake light try it from afar 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:38.110
 better you will see the size and 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:46.840
 stop signal 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:46.840
 says stop signal says stop signal 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:02:00.010
 turn signal repeater so orange 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.010
 return such a yellow light 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:10.000
 amber reverse 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:25.410
 and rear fog light red 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:37.099
 cool yes let's see how it will be 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.920
 yes I forgot to say to the repeater 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:43.010
 turns if the LEDs change 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.099
 regular lamps will have to do the snag 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:55.959
 snag i will do from soviet 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:03:01.849
 resistors here such resistors 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:05.780
 bf-21 such a resistor of the order of 25-30 watts 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:08.780
 And glass on resistance 10 ohm 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:12.440
 but it can be due to this open 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.239
 parts can be changed to lower 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.930
 to guess at all according to calculations somewhere 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.760
 about six seven it should be but 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.590
 try with a dozen first if not 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:28.340
 roll then we will get drunk and 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:31.660
 do a single-leg runner 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:37.299
 from the slider and the other edge will not take 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:43.660
 resistance okay everybody for now 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:43.660
 see then what will be bye bye
