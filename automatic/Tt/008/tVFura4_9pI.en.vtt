now<00:00:01.770> that<00:00:01.920> we<00:00:02.010> filtered<00:00:02.429> out<00:00:02.520> oil<00:00:02.550> we're<00:00:03.000> now

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
now that we filtered out oil we're now

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:04.999 
now that we filtered out oil we're now
gonna<00:00:03.300> make<00:00:03.570> a<00:00:03.600> batch<00:00:03.899> of<00:00:03.929> biodiesel<00:00:04.470> we<00:00:04.799> want

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
gonna make a batch of biodiesel we want

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.220 
gonna make a batch of biodiesel we want
to<00:00:05.100> show<00:00:05.310> you<00:00:05.370> what<00:00:06.029> you<00:00:06.150> do<00:00:06.359> we<00:00:06.779> now<00:00:06.930> have<00:00:07.200> a

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
to show you what you do we now have a

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.240 
to show you what you do we now have a
filter<00:00:07.589> oil

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
filter oil

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.919 
filter oil
I<00:00:08.280> have<00:00:08.820> oil<00:00:09.150> in<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.540> 55-gallon<00:00:10.410> drum<00:00:11.450> and<00:00:12.450> I'm

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
I have oil in a 55-gallon drum and I'm

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.160 
I have oil in a 55-gallon drum and I'm
going<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.290> put<00:00:13.559> oil<00:00:13.799> in<00:00:14.160> this<00:00:14.490> machine<00:00:15.170> inside

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
going to put oil in this machine inside

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.260 
going to put oil in this machine inside
this<00:00:16.440> machine<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:16.980> has<00:00:17.010> marks<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:17.730> tell<00:00:18.029> me

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
this machine it has marks that tell me

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.960 
this machine it has marks that tell me
the<00:00:18.720> different<00:00:19.170> sizes<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:20.220> so<00:00:20.580> I<00:00:20.789> will

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
the different sizes and so I will

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.070 
the different sizes and so I will
transport<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.720> oil<00:00:21.960> in<00:00:22.609> using<00:00:23.750> this<00:00:24.750> big

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
transport this oil in using this big

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.550 
transport this oil in using this big
behemoth<00:00:26.420> click<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.539> on<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:30.410> then<00:00:31.410> we<00:00:31.529> can

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
behemoth click it on and then we can

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.280 
behemoth click it on and then we can
start<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.130> flow<00:00:32.430> by<00:00:33.180> turning<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.719> power<00:00:33.930> on

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
start the flow by turning the power on

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.020 
start the flow by turning the power on
I've<00:00:34.649> already<00:00:34.829> pre-loaded<00:00:35.280> this<00:00:35.700> machine

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
I've already pre-loaded this machine

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.150 
I've already pre-loaded this machine
full<00:00:36.270> of<00:00:36.390> oil<00:00:36.570> but<00:00:36.840> basically<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.530> sump<00:00:37.890> pump

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
full of oil but basically this sump pump

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.490 
full of oil but basically this sump pump
would<00:00:38.370> suck<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.850> oil<00:00:38.879> up<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:40.020> puts<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.379> in

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
would suck the oil up and it puts it in

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.920 
would suck the oil up and it puts it in
this<00:00:40.620> machine<00:00:40.850> once<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.030> oil<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.629> here

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
this machine once the oil is in here

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.330 
this machine once the oil is in here
then<00:00:43.290> we're<00:00:43.500> ready<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.739> start<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.129> batch<00:00:44.309> to

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
then we're ready to start a batch to

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.040 
then we're ready to start a batch to
what<00:00:44.700> get<00:00:44.820> started<00:00:45.270> with<00:00:45.390> what's<00:00:45.570> next

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
what get started with what's next

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.209 
what get started with what's next
remember<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.620> takes<00:00:46.800> methanol<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.670> lye<00:00:49.219> and

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
remember it takes methanol and lye and

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.920 
remember it takes methanol and lye and
we<00:00:50.399> use<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> secret<00:00:50.910> ingredient<00:00:51.300> we<00:00:51.780> use

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
we use a secret ingredient we use

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.360 
we use a secret ingredient we use
sulfuric<00:00:52.410> acid<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:52.890> I'll<00:00:53.010> tell<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.250> what

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
sulfuric acid and I'll tell you what

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.400 
sulfuric acid and I'll tell you what
that's<00:00:53.550> for<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.940> minute<00:00:57.050> after<00:00:58.050> we've

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
that's for in a minute after we've

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.590 
that's for in a minute after we've
loaded<00:00:58.620> our<00:00:58.829> oil<00:00:59.129> into<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.789> machine<00:01:00.180> it's

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
loaded our oil into this machine it's

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.119 
loaded our oil into this machine it's
now<00:01:00.780> time<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.109> load<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.469> chemicals<00:01:01.980> and

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
now time to load the chemicals and

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.740 
now time to load the chemicals and
everything<00:01:02.190> else<00:01:02.640> needed<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.149> get<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.420> going

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
everything else needed to get it going

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.410 
everything else needed to get it going
our<00:01:04.140> next<00:01:04.530> step<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.460> put<00:01:05.670> methanol<00:01:06.150> into

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
our next step is to put methanol into

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.570 
our next step is to put methanol into
these<00:01:06.930> ports<00:01:07.590> up<00:01:07.770> here<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.159> I'm<00:01:08.340> going<00:01:08.490> to

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
these ports up here so I'm going to

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.390 
these ports up here so I'm going to
climb<00:01:08.790> up<00:01:08.850> here<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.510> what<00:01:10.320> we<00:01:10.470> have<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.979> one

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
climb up here and what we have is one

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.270 
climb up here and what we have is one
quart<00:01:11.760> for<00:01:11.939> methanol<00:01:12.540> one<00:01:13.290> quart<00:01:13.619> for<00:01:13.890> our

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
quart for methanol one quart for our

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.340 
quart for methanol one quart for our
methoxide<00:01:14.970> which<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.689> going<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.020> be<00:01:16.140> our

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
methoxide which is going to be our

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.499 
methoxide which is going to be our
combination<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.220> our<00:01:17.460> sodium<00:01:18.000> or<00:01:18.420> potassium

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
combination of our sodium or potassium

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.230 
combination of our sodium or potassium
hydroxide<00:01:19.380> we<00:01:19.830> need<00:01:20.009> potassium<00:01:20.580> hydroxide<00:01:20.850> in

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
hydroxide we need potassium hydroxide in

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.390 
hydroxide we need potassium hydroxide in
this<00:01:21.330> case<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.780> some<00:01:22.380> methanol<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:23.040> haven't

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
this case and some methanol I haven't

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.130 
this case and some methanol I haven't
had<00:01:23.549> any<00:01:23.700> gauges<00:01:24.150> on<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.330> side<00:01:24.600> here<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.020> let

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
had any gauges on the side here that let

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.260 
had any gauges on the side here that let
me<00:01:25.170> know<00:01:25.580> when<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.610> get<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.909> amount<00:01:27.150> of

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
me know when I get the amount of

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.080 
me know when I get the amount of
methanol<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.780> need<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.310> into<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.400> machine<00:01:29.759> so

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
methanol I need it into the machine so

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.550 
methanol I need it into the machine so
I'm<00:01:30.240> just<00:01:30.420> going<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.630> step<00:01:30.869> down<00:01:31.079> here<00:01:31.350> for<00:01:31.530> a

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
I'm just going to step down here for a

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.780 
I'm just going to step down here for a
moment<00:01:32.329> put<00:01:33.329> my<00:01:33.509> methanol<00:01:34.340> in<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.460> barrel<00:01:37.790> and

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
moment put my methanol in the barrel and

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.459 
moment put my methanol in the barrel and
I'm<00:01:38.970> gonna<00:01:39.150> shove<00:01:39.900> away<00:01:40.170> with<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.829> pump

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:45.469 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:55.690 

here<00:01:51.109> see<00:01:52.109> now<00:01:52.289> is<00:01:52.679> a<00:01:52.710> gauge<00:01:53.009> it's<00:01:53.369> coming<00:01:53.759> up

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
here see now is a gauge it's coming up

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.069 
here see now is a gauge it's coming up
you're<00:01:56.700> able<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:56.969> see<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.359> we<00:01:57.509> can<00:01:57.659> fill<00:01:57.899> this

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
you're able to see that we can fill this

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.859 
you're able to see that we can fill this
with<00:01:58.289> methanol<00:01:58.920> this<00:01:59.880> tank<00:02:00.209> is<00:02:00.420> going<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.750> be

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
with methanol this tank is going to be

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.100 
with methanol this tank is going to be
used<00:02:01.170> for<00:02:01.530> our<00:02:02.399> what's<00:02:03.030> called<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.689> stair

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
used for our what's called the stair

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.199 
used for our what's called the stair
application<00:02:04.890> process<00:02:05.429> which<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.880> where<00:02:06.060> we

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
application process which is where we

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:08.449 
application process which is where we
use<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:06.659> here<00:02:06.899> gases<00:02:07.500> we'll<00:02:08.069> talk<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.280> little

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
use so here gases we'll talk a little

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.460 
use so here gases we'll talk a little
bit<00:02:08.700> more<00:02:08.910> about<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.149> in<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.509> minute<00:02:09.660> but<00:02:10.289> for

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
bit more about that in a minute but for

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.830 
bit more about that in a minute but for
now<00:02:10.530> time<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.310> get<00:02:11.519> methanol<00:02:12.060> machines<00:02:14.840> the

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
now time to get methanol machines the

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.910 
now time to get methanol machines the
next<00:02:16.079> step<00:02:16.230> we're<00:02:16.349> going<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.530> do<00:02:16.709> is<00:02:16.799> we're

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
next step we're going to do is we're

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.470 
next step we're going to do is we're
going<00:02:16.950> to<00:02:17.069> measure<00:02:17.190> out<00:02:17.459> some<00:02:17.610> chemicals<00:02:18.150> it's

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
going to measure out some chemicals it's

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.600 
going to measure out some chemicals it's
really<00:02:18.870> important<00:02:19.380> that<00:02:19.650> you<00:02:19.980> wear<00:02:20.190> something

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
really important that you wear something

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.319 
really important that you wear something
to<00:02:20.880> protect<00:02:20.910> your<00:02:21.329> face<00:02:21.630> your<00:02:22.140> hands<00:02:23.329> because

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
to protect your face your hands because

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:29.050 
to protect your face your hands because
what<00:02:24.510> we're<00:02:24.660> about<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:25.019> do<00:02:25.170> is<00:02:25.200> really<00:02:25.739> nasty

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.940 

using<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.180> scale<00:02:31.430> we're<00:02:32.430> going<00:02:32.519> to<00:02:32.579> weigh<00:02:32.730> out

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
using the scale we're going to weigh out

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:50.200 
using the scale we're going to weigh out
no<00:02:34.950> catalyst<00:02:36.049> to<00:02:37.049> make<00:02:37.079> a<00:02:37.200> vitamin<00:02:37.680> C<00:02:37.799> with

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.780 

I<00:02:50.270> have<00:02:50.960> tared<00:02:51.320> my<00:02:51.650> scale<00:02:52.130> and<00:02:52.460> what<00:02:52.580> that

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
I have tared my scale and what that

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.640 
I have tared my scale and what that
means<00:02:53.030> is<00:02:53.270> I've<00:02:53.450> set<00:02:53.690> it<00:02:53.720> to<00:02:53.870> zero<00:02:54.260> so<00:02:54.500> I<00:02:54.530> know

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
means is I've set it to zero so I know

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:41.120 
means is I've set it to zero so I know
how<00:02:54.890> much<00:02:55.010> I'm<00:02:55.190> putting<00:02:55.340> in

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.400 

I'm<00:03:41.640> going<00:03:41.850> to<00:03:41.910> bring<00:03:42.090> this<00:03:42.210> up<00:03:42.420> to<00:03:42.450> 1,500

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
I'm going to bring this up to 1,500

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.950 
I'm going to bring this up to 1,500
grams<00:03:43.970> then<00:03:44.970> I'm<00:03:45.060> going<00:03:45.180> to<00:03:45.240> do<00:03:45.360> it<00:03:45.450> again<00:03:45.540> so

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
grams then I'm going to do it again so

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.890 
grams then I'm going to do it again so
my<00:03:46.080> goal<00:03:46.320> is<00:03:46.350> to<00:03:46.620> put<00:03:46.850> 4800<00:03:47.850> grams<00:03:48.120> of<00:03:48.390> catalyst

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
my goal is to put 4800 grams of catalyst

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.490 
my goal is to put 4800 grams of catalyst
in<00:03:49.290> that<00:03:49.890> machine<00:03:50.070> so<00:03:51.020> with<00:03:52.020> that<00:03:52.170> we're<00:03:52.410> going

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
in that machine so with that we're going

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:53.570 
in that machine so with that we're going
to<00:03:52.620> take<00:03:52.740> it<00:03:52.860> over<00:03:52.950> and<00:03:53.190> we're<00:03:53.280> going<00:03:53.400> to<00:03:53.460> put

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
to take it over and we're going to put

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.740 
to take it over and we're going to put
it<00:03:53.670> in<00:03:55.850> the<00:03:56.850> next<00:03:57.030> step<00:03:57.180> is<00:03:57.420> to<00:03:57.540> put<00:03:57.690> the

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
it in the next step is to put the

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:12.010 
it in the next step is to put the
catalyst<00:03:58.230> into<00:03:58.740> the<00:03:58.830> machine

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.380 

this<00:04:12.620> is<00:04:12.770> a<00:04:12.800> very<00:04:13.040> careful<00:04:13.460> process<00:04:13.580> of<00:04:14.060> making

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
this is a very careful process of making

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.270 
this is a very careful process of making
sure<00:04:14.570> all<00:04:14.750> that<00:04:14.900> stuff<00:04:15.200> in<00:04:15.320> the<00:04:15.380> picture<00:04:15.740> just

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
sure all that stuff in the picture just

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.240 
sure all that stuff in the picture just
gets<00:04:16.459> into<00:04:16.670> the<00:04:16.790> scene<00:04:17.890> generates<00:04:18.890> a<00:04:18.980> lot<00:04:19.100> of

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
gets into the scene generates a lot of

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:26.130 
gets into the scene generates a lot of
dust<00:04:20.290> kind<00:04:21.290> of<00:04:21.380> gross

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.690 

it's<00:04:27.140> basically<00:04:27.500> annoying<00:04:27.890> but<00:04:28.520> it's<00:04:28.640> a

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
it's basically annoying but it's a

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.550 
it's basically annoying but it's a
necessary<00:04:28.850> evil<00:04:29.390> we're<00:04:30.050> going<00:04:30.170> to<00:04:30.230> do<00:04:30.320> this<00:04:30.500> a

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
necessary evil we're going to do this a

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.990 
necessary evil we're going to do this a
couple<00:04:30.890> more<00:04:31.010> times<00:04:31.070> and<00:04:31.460> we'll<00:04:31.670> be<00:04:31.760> ready<00:04:31.940> to

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
couple more times and we'll be ready to

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:43.920 
couple more times and we'll be ready to
start<00:04:32.120> a<00:04:32.300> batch

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.010 

okay<00:04:44.930> so<00:04:44.990> we've<00:04:45.259> got<00:04:45.469> now<00:04:45.710> a<00:04:46.870> certain<00:04:47.870> amount

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
okay so we've got now a certain amount

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.809 
okay so we've got now a certain amount
of<00:04:48.110> catalyst<00:04:48.590> in<00:04:48.740> here<00:04:49.039> and<00:04:49.340> we're<00:04:49.550> now<00:04:49.669> going

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:49.819 
of catalyst in here and we're now going

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:51.939 
of catalyst in here and we're now going
to<00:04:49.879> introduce<00:04:50.090> methanol<00:04:50.779> a<00:04:51.080> chemical

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:51.949 
to introduce methanol a chemical

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:59.200 
to introduce methanol a chemical
reaction<00:04:52.460> is<00:04:52.639> going<00:04:52.879> to<00:04:52.939> occur<00:04:58.210> it's

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
reaction is going to occur it's

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.209 
reaction is going to occur it's
important<00:04:59.900> that<00:05:00.409> after<00:05:00.590> you<00:05:00.860> put<00:05:01.099> your

00:05:01.209 --> 00:05:01.219 
important that after you put your

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:02.739 
important that after you put your
catalyst<00:05:01.610> in<00:05:01.729> that<00:05:01.879> you<00:05:01.969> seal<00:05:02.180> your<00:05:02.210> catalyst

00:05:02.739 --> 00:05:02.749 
catalyst in that you seal your catalyst

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:04.239 
catalyst in that you seal your catalyst
back<00:05:02.930> up<00:05:03.139> so<00:05:03.349> we're<00:05:03.439> gonna<00:05:03.529> go<00:05:03.740> over<00:05:03.770> and<00:05:04.069> steal

00:05:04.239 --> 00:05:04.249 
back up so we're gonna go over and steal

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:05.830 
back up so we're gonna go over and steal
our<00:05:04.310> catalyst<00:05:04.849> before<00:05:04.999> we<00:05:05.240> get<00:05:05.360> started<00:05:05.569> on

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
our catalyst before we get started on

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.140 
our catalyst before we get started on
the<00:05:05.930> next<00:05:06.050> set<00:05:06.520> one<00:05:07.520> of<00:05:07.610> the<00:05:07.699> things<00:05:07.849> we<00:05:07.999> do

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
the next set one of the things we do

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.730 
the next set one of the things we do
after<00:05:08.539> we're<00:05:08.689> done<00:05:08.810> with<00:05:08.870> our<00:05:09.080> catalyst<00:05:09.499> is<00:05:09.620> we

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
after we're done with our catalyst is we

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.709 
after we're done with our catalyst is we
seal<00:05:10.069> everything<00:05:10.550> so<00:05:10.729> we<00:05:11.210> don't<00:05:11.419> get<00:05:11.569> the

00:05:11.709 --> 00:05:11.719 
seal everything so we don't get the

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:14.619 
seal everything so we don't get the
catalyst<00:05:12.310> we<00:05:13.310> don't<00:05:13.490> let<00:05:13.610> it<00:05:13.729> get<00:05:13.849> moist<00:05:14.150> so

00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:14.629 
catalyst we don't let it get moist so

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:16.659 
catalyst we don't let it get moist so
I've<00:05:15.080> sealed<00:05:15.499> my<00:05:15.740> catalyst<00:05:16.159> a<00:05:16.189> bucket<00:05:16.520> back

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
I've sealed my catalyst a bucket back

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.820 
I've sealed my catalyst a bucket back
out<00:05:16.879> I'm<00:05:17.060> gonna<00:05:17.300> put<00:05:17.569> a<00:05:17.599> towel<00:05:17.900> over<00:05:18.289> top<00:05:18.589> of<00:05:18.620> my

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
out I'm gonna put a towel over top of my

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.939 
out I'm gonna put a towel over top of my
scale<00:05:19.189> to<00:05:19.490> keep<00:05:19.699> it<00:05:19.849> nice<00:05:20.089> and<00:05:20.120> dry<00:05:20.539> I<00:05:20.930> put<00:05:21.800> this

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:21.949 
scale to keep it nice and dry I put this

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:23.040 
scale to keep it nice and dry I put this
inside<00:05:22.400> here

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
inside here

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.010 
inside here
keep<00:05:24.050> it<00:05:24.229> dry<00:05:24.379> and<00:05:25.189> I've<00:05:25.339> covered<00:05:26.020> everything

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
keep it dry and I've covered everything

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.170 
keep it dry and I've covered everything
so<00:05:27.979> I<00:05:28.069> don't<00:05:28.219> want<00:05:28.400> moisture<00:05:28.849> getting<00:05:29.029> on

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
so I don't want moisture getting on

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.999 
so I don't want moisture getting on
there<00:05:29.449> our<00:05:29.659> next<00:05:30.259> step<00:05:30.409> is<00:05:30.650> to<00:05:30.740> put<00:05:30.889> more

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:31.009 
there our next step is to put more

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:32.769 
there our next step is to put more
methanol<00:05:31.520> in<00:05:31.610> the<00:05:31.639> machine<00:05:31.999> we'll<00:05:32.539> get<00:05:32.629> the

00:05:32.769 --> 00:05:32.779 
methanol in the machine we'll get the

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:35.319 
methanol in the machine we'll get the
batch<00:05:32.900> started
