00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
so creating page two step by step our

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.740 
so creating page two step by step our
journal<00:02:22.840> in<00:02:22.959> creating<00:02:23.319> page<00:02:23.500> two<00:02:24.209> it<00:02:25.209> opens<00:02:25.569> up

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
journal in creating page two it opens up

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.300 
journal in creating page two it opens up
and<00:02:26.370> this<00:02:27.370> here<00:02:27.780> is<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.989> page<00:02:29.410> we<00:02:29.830> make<00:02:30.099> in

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
and this here is the page we make in

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.720 
and this here is the page we make in
book<00:02:31.030> two<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.830> I'm<00:02:35.950> going<00:02:36.099> to<00:02:36.160> go<00:02:36.310> back<00:02:36.340> into

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
book two and I'm going to go back into

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.199 
book two and I'm going to go back into
my<00:02:36.940> library<00:02:37.470> into<00:02:38.470> creating<00:02:38.950> page<00:02:39.190> three<00:02:39.640> and

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.330 

then<00:02:43.209> this<00:02:43.420> is<00:02:43.599> the<00:02:43.630> book<00:02:43.810> so<00:02:44.170> in<00:02:44.380> each<00:02:44.680> book<00:02:45.069> i

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
then this is the book so in each book i

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.120 
then this is the book so in each book i
have<00:02:45.910> used<00:02:46.150> completely<00:02:46.540> different<00:02:47.349> materials

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
have used completely different materials

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.210 
have used completely different materials
as<00:02:48.430> well<00:02:48.880> as<00:02:49.330> different<00:02:49.720> techniques<00:02:50.230> so<00:02:50.620> each

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
as well as different techniques so each

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.789 
as well as different techniques so each
one<00:02:51.280> you<00:02:52.120> will<00:02:52.269> learn<00:02:52.480> completely<00:02:53.380> different

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
one you will learn completely different

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.920 
one you will learn completely different
things<00:02:54.069> there's<00:02:54.519> no<00:02:54.819> not<00:02:55.239> much<00:02:55.450> overlap

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
things there's no not much overlap

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.100 
things there's no not much overlap
between<00:02:56.140> them<00:02:56.560> and<00:02:57.060> then<00:02:58.060> finally<00:02:58.510> in<00:02:58.690> book

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
between them and then finally in book

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.380 
between them and then finally in book
creating<00:02:59.860> page<00:03:00.069> four<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:02.819> in<00:03:03.819> this<00:03:04.000> one<00:03:04.239> we

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
creating page four and in this one we

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.360 
creating page four and in this one we
use<00:03:04.540> a<00:03:04.569> lot<00:03:04.720> of<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:05.170> distress<00:03:05.620> products<00:03:06.130> and
