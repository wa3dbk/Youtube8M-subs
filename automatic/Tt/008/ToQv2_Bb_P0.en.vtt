00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:06.420
 we are more focused on the ones we are looking for 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.760
 what is our preparation 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.040
 the rival 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.720
 well positioned in your competition but 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.310
 they will know why not 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.400
 what is what we have that is 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:20.350
 take advantage of this game for 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.779
 observing go glimpsing what 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:26.230
 we want to do in the next matches 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:28.630
 and with whom we can do it then 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.210
 and I insist for these are the pairs or are 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:35.360
 these games to continue preparing us 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.040
 all of that is the same new people that 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.470
 it will be the opportunity to other crimes 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.830
 reforming a level and we can go 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.350
 visualizing the genes groups and good to 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.150
 the best another way to play some 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.600
 different situations that we can 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:53.150
 customize the no is not the same way 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.700
 as I explained it a moment ago it's just 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.580
 the opportunity that we can take advantage of 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:01.130
 for some players that come 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.820
 returning that level to others that have 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.290
 a property of the circumstances 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.909
 that are occurring within it 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.909
 mexican tournament 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.049
 and people who have done well then 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.270
 and we do not know what I can 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.070
 move from here to a month and we have to 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.240
 foresee these circumstances with 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.240
 players who have done well 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.220
 we prepare for the immediate what is 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.470
 of the elimination matches after 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.380
 will come confederations and then copay 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.149
 then inside everything that is coming 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.840
 we have to be attentive with some 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.869
 players that we can use it 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.520
 they are parties that lend themselves to be able 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:43.530
 to be able to observe people 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.450
 but the fact that it appears one of 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.850
 captain does not appear or appear as 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.520
 headline that are decisions merely 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.170
 mine and the work group do not have 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.240
 absolutely nothing to see as some 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.009
 sometimes I heard out there that it was for 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.189
 I had time and I do not know what else 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.479
 story are not nonsense we take 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.280
 decisions based on what 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.890
 sports and what is wrapped around 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.939
 of the player we take a lot into account how 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.399
 is living what is it that is 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.799
 going around his environment that's why 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.170
 it is very interesting to practice with the bodies 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:14.269
 technicians to have more information than 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.240
 that helps us make decisions 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:20.030
 so 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.580
 the fact that one or the other can 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.530
 based on information that we believe 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.620
 is the most convenient for the brute to 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.050
 see has had activity when he had it 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.420
 even quite well then not 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.550
 we have no problem 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:38.000
 the goalkeepers I think that is the position 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.590
 more disputed not the most to see who 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.430
 plays but to see who is summoned 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.200
 then it is complicated that's why we look for 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.940
 be very close to technical positions 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.270
 because that also helps us to take 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.390
 decisions we are a group that 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:56.959
 focuses a lot on the processes in how 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.190
 things are done because that's what it's based on 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.239
 in which you can eventually have 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.239
 adequate results 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.290
 have you seen that 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.900
 every year starts to be put in the 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.880
 objectives and we work according to the 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.140
 objectives and we are on top of them in 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.340
 all elections when they have 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.590
 achieved the objectives as they have 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.720
 raised to qualify to be looking 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.730
 achieve the maximum achievements in this case 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.990
 Of course we always consider 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.940
 win the matches inside and outside of 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.850
 house is something that we always have it like this 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.560
 we work for that the results do not 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.970
 have been consistent with the way 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.070
 as we have searched 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.940
 the case the match with jamaica that was 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.370
 looser 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.050
 I said at the time that the trouble 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.840
 there was everything that was given 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:48.050
 and the others well this is football is not 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.090
 you always play well, you get the best 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.950
 result do not play badly 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.370
 he welcomed us in yesterday's game of 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.440
 17 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.970
 it complicated him a lot but in the end he pulled 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.299
 the result and the important thing was to take 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.299
 the result 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.540
 then we understand that in the 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.030
 competition the results are those that 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.890
 Mark all and sometimes they forget one 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.930
 little of the process 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.250
 we get very complicated in the 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.150
 process but we know that what they are 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.150
 backs are the results
