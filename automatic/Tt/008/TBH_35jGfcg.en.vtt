00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.220
 tiny 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.530
 I have no video showing how the 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.300
 The screen is small, but I go 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.500

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.350

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.810
 clicks on an enclosure leaving this bar 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:44.140

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:47.010
 Okay, microsoft will be here. 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:50.350
 and you will click here on that button that the 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.390
 orange button and will start recording 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:57.459
 then you just lower the bar 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:03:02.320
 notification here and will tell you the day 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:04.390

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.880
 a recorder is not already recording in 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.680
 same day I was recording because this 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.650
 recorder that has a small problem 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:15.450
 I know what a record is. 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.450
 I had to download this other than O 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.070
 program 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.110
 I had to download this team rec 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:28.630
 It took 15 minutes but it's good too. 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:31.480
 too much and then that's all this is for 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.390
 You who want to see the rec 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.810
 the rec it only aggravates if with a version 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.640
 pro must have liked it 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.430
 but I think someone can find the 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.620
 rec more than five minutes time 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.980

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.900

 Even though I marked beauty, then it is 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.030
