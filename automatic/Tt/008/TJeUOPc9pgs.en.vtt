00:00:01.789 --> 00:00:03.762
 There are two main types of stroke, 

00:00:03.762 --> 00:00:06.490
 ischemic stroke and haemorrhagic stroke. 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.347
 In this video we will look at hemorrhagic strokes. 

00:00:09.347 --> 00:00:10.867
 Hemorrhagic strokes are 

00:00:10.867 --> 00:00:14.129
 about 25% of all strokes. 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:16.486
 Let me guess what we are looking at here. 

00:00:16.486 --> 00:00:19.644
 We look at the bottom. 

00:00:19.644 --> 00:00:22.708
 View of the brain below, 

00:00:22.708 --> 00:00:24.810
 because this view of the brain allows us to see 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.167
 the vessels most often involved 

00:00:27.167 --> 00:00:28.827
 in haemorrhagic strokes. 

00:00:28.827 --> 00:00:31.369
 The Willows Circles. 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.029
 What is a hemorrhagic stroke? 

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:35.003
 Hemorrhagic stroke is when 

00:00:35.003 --> 00:00:37.778
 one of the blood vessels in the brain 

00:00:37.778 --> 00:00:42.671
 starts flowing, and the blood from this vessel starts to run 

00:00:42.671 --> 00:00:44.813
 in the cranial cavity. 

00:00:44.813 --> 00:00:47.448
 This is bad for two reasons. 

00:00:47.448 --> 00:00:48.679
 First, you lose blood 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:51.303
 of cerebral blood flow. 

00:00:51.303 --> 00:00:52.788
 I will show here, 

00:00:52.788 --> 00:00:55.680
 if bleeding starts in the skull, 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.746
 this blood flowing out of the blood vessels, 

00:00:57.746 --> 00:00:59.684
 will take place. 

00:00:59.684 --> 00:01:02.123
 The skull is a closed space, 

00:01:02.123 --> 00:01:04.166
 so the blood has nowhere to go. 

00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:07.405
 If bleeding starts in this closed space of the skull, 

00:01:07.405 --> 00:01:09.124
 here will increase the pressure 

00:01:09.124 --> 00:01:12.631
 and will begin to press the brain. 

00:01:12.631 --> 00:01:14.406
 Another thing to think about is that 

00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:16.461
 all this blood flowing out of the vessel, 

00:01:16.461 --> 00:01:19.386
 is blood that obviously will not go through the court 

00:01:19.386 --> 00:01:21.243
 to the lower vessels, 

00:01:21.243 --> 00:01:24.006
 which feed the parts of the brain down the bloodstream. 

00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:26.282
 The brain tissue there 

00:01:26.282 --> 00:01:27.966
 will begin to die. 

00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:29.800
 It's even worse. 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.681
 You see the blood flowing out 

00:01:31.681 --> 00:01:34.397
 here under the surface of the brain? 

00:01:34.397 --> 00:01:35.767
 It turns out that this blood, touching 

00:01:35.767 --> 00:01:39.447
 the outer part of the blood vessels, irritate these blood vessels. 

00:01:39.447 --> 00:01:42.164
 When these vessels sense all this blood, 

00:01:42.164 --> 00:01:45.417
 are irritated and gently tighten. 

00:01:45.417 --> 00:01:47.458
 I'll show what I mean. 

00:01:47.458 --> 00:01:50.163
 Here is a normal looking blood vessel. 

00:01:50.163 --> 00:01:51.962
 It has a nice, wide diameter 

00:01:51.962 --> 00:01:54.400
 and misses many blood cells. 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.164
 But if the blood gathers around, 

00:01:56.164 --> 00:01:58.382
 around the outside of other blood vessels, 

00:01:58.382 --> 00:02:01.621
 it eventually begins to degrade to its components. 

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:04.276
 We call these breakdown products in the blood. 

00:02:04.276 --> 00:02:07.298
 These products start to irritate the normal blood vessel. 

00:02:07.298 --> 00:02:10.236
 What does the normal blood vessel do in response to this? 

00:02:10.236 --> 00:02:12.801
 They go through something called vasospasm. 

00:02:12.801 --> 00:02:14.844
 One species is reduced a little. 

00:02:14.844 --> 00:02:16.342
 You may soon understand, 

00:02:16.342 --> 00:02:19.059
 that once this artery has been irritated and 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:20.742
 has received a spasm, and has narrowed, now less 

00:02:20.742 --> 00:02:23.679
 blood will pass through it. 

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:25.385
 Let's say all these blood vessels 

00:02:25.385 --> 00:02:27.023
 have shrunk in response to 

00:02:27.023 --> 00:02:29.321
 irritation from the blood-destroying products, 

00:02:29.321 --> 00:02:31.376
 then they do not deliver enough blood 

00:02:31.376 --> 00:02:33.361
 to the brain tissue in its area. 

00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:36.740
 Then our patient will develop a second stroke. 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.398
 Therefore care should be taken to vasospasms, 

00:02:39.398 --> 00:02:41.061
 causing secondary strokes, 

00:02:41.061 --> 00:02:44.042
 after an initial haemorrhagic stroke. 

00:02:44.042 --> 00:02:45.334
 These are the three reasons why 

00:02:45.334 --> 00:02:47.503
 haemorrhagic strokes are very bad, 

00:02:47.503 --> 00:02:49.255
 but what causes a hemorrhagic stroke? 

00:02:49.255 --> 00:02:51.600
 Let's see two of the most common reasons. 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.002
 What could cause cerebral blood vessel rupture? 

00:02:55.002 --> 00:02:57.974
 Usually, they should have a weakness, 

00:02:57.974 --> 00:02:59.297
 such as aneurism, 

00:02:59.297 --> 00:03:02.199
 bulge on the wall of the blood vessel. 

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:04.034
 Aneurism 

00:03:04.034 --> 00:03:05.833
 part of the Willis Circle, 

00:03:05.833 --> 00:03:07.400
 the vessels in the Willis Circle, 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.697
 actually swells like this. 

00:03:10.697 --> 00:03:13.240
 This happens more often in some places. 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.738
 It happens here where I drew it, 

00:03:14.738 --> 00:03:17.465
 of the rear communication artery. 

00:03:17.465 --> 00:03:21.836
 They also occur in the middle cerebral artery, 

00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:25.198
 and in the anterior communication artery. 

00:03:25.198 --> 00:03:27.555
 It can also happen near the part where they connect 

00:03:27.555 --> 00:03:32.000
 Inner Carotid, ACA (MCA) and PAC (ACA). 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.800
 They can happen elsewhere, 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.635
 but these are the most common places where 

00:03:35.635 --> 00:03:37.874
 aneurysms may occur. 

00:03:37.874 --> 00:03:39.361
 I said these aneurysms 

00:03:39.361 --> 00:03:42.577
 are weakened bulges of the arterial wall 

00:03:42.577 --> 00:03:45.311
 and may be caused by prolonged hypertension, 

00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:48.439
 which greatly stresses the walls of this artery, 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:50.958
 or can be obtained if there is a problem 

00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:54.205
 with arterial walls for genetic reasons. 

00:03:54.205 --> 00:03:58.192
 These aneurysms can spontaneously rupture 

00:03:58.192 --> 00:04:00.559
 or they can rupture if the man is hit on the head, 

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:03.137
 or if pressed during a hockey game, 

00:04:03.137 --> 00:04:04.217
 or something like that. 

00:04:04.217 --> 00:04:07.671
 If a person experiences a great trauma, they can also rupture. 

00:04:07.671 --> 00:04:09.910
 If one of them ruptures, 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.429
 suddenly from the cerebral circulation 

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:14.636
 blood starts to run out. 

00:04:14.636 --> 00:04:18.559
 This is one of the main causes of a hemorrhagic stroke, 

00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:20.475
 ruptured aneurysm. 

00:04:20.475 --> 00:04:21.041
 By the way, 

00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:23.876
 colloquially called grainy aneurysms, 

00:04:23.876 --> 00:04:25.439
 because they look like small grains, 

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:28.717
 which have developed in the arteries. 

00:04:28.717 --> 00:04:31.689
 The second major cause of haemorrhagic stroke, 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:33.048
 for which we will speak, 

00:04:33.048 --> 00:04:37.395
 is arteriovenous malformation, or AVM (AVM). 

00:04:37.395 --> 00:04:39.816
 I'll draw this from below. 

00:04:39.816 --> 00:04:42.231
 In your normal blood circulation, 

00:04:42.231 --> 00:04:43.986
 we have large arteries, 

00:04:43.986 --> 00:04:47.848
 which branched into smaller arterioles, 

00:04:47.848 --> 00:04:51.098
 which are divided into smaller arterioles, 

00:04:51.098 --> 00:04:55.101
 which are then divided into even smaller arterioles, 

00:04:55.101 --> 00:04:57.401
 until they reach the level of capillaries, 

00:04:57.401 --> 00:04:58.716
 which are super small. 

00:04:58.716 --> 00:05:00.566
 And also the level where gas exchange 

00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:04.233
 between the blood and the tissues of the body is carried out. 

00:05:04.233 --> 00:05:06.927
 On the other hand 

00:05:06.927 --> 00:05:09.256
 we have the other half of the capillaries, 

00:05:09.256 --> 00:05:12.785
 which removes the blood from the first part of the capillaries. 

00:05:12.785 --> 00:05:17.082
 Then there is a small venus, which is a small vein. 

00:05:17.082 --> 00:05:18.706
 Then is the vein, 

00:05:18.706 --> 00:05:19.785
 normal vein. 

00:05:19.785 --> 00:05:22.618
 It can reach a really big vein, 

00:05:22.618 --> 00:05:26.821
 say the inner vein or something like that. 

00:05:26.821 --> 00:05:27.936
 A really big vein. 

00:05:28.946 --> 00:05:31.049
 It is important to remember, 

00:05:31.049 --> 00:05:33.415
 that blood in the arterial system 

00:05:33.415 --> 00:05:36.270
 is under high pressure. 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.023
 Write P for pressure. 

00:05:38.023 --> 00:05:39.184
 High pressure. 

00:05:39.184 --> 00:05:43.376
 As the blood passes through the arterial system, 

00:05:43.376 --> 00:05:46.881
 to reach the capillaries, the pressure decreases. 

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:51.515
 When in the capillaries it is under really low pressure, 

00:05:51.515 --> 00:05:55.775
 as well as when in the venules. 

00:05:55.775 --> 00:05:56.959
 The reason for this is that 

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:59.641
 capillaries are very thin and delicate. 

00:05:59.641 --> 00:06:02.043
 If the blood is under high pressure, 

00:06:02.043 --> 00:06:04.122
 they will just rupture and 

00:06:04.122 --> 00:06:06.200
 will pour blood everywhere. 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.300
 It turns out that this is happening 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.796
 arteriovenous malformation. 

00:06:11.796 --> 00:06:14.558
 In arteriovenous malformation, 

00:06:14.558 --> 00:06:16.462
 the whole system is not 

00:06:16.462 --> 00:06:18.239
 styled in the way I drew it. 

00:06:18.239 --> 00:06:21.681
 What happens in the arterial end is that 

00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:24.079
 all this capillary system, 

00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:27.678
 all this capillary segment is skipped. 

00:06:27.678 --> 00:06:29.278
 And the arterioles are 

00:06:29.278 --> 00:06:31.579
 directly related to 

00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:32.682
 small veins. 

00:06:32.682 --> 00:06:34.876
 In this way the blood, which 

00:06:34.876 --> 00:06:36.860
 enters directly into the veins, 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.765
 is still under high pressure. 

00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:41.157
 This is not good for the veins, 

00:06:41.157 --> 00:06:42.700
 because they have evolved 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.825
 to cope with lower pressure. 

00:06:44.825 --> 00:06:46.660
 No detrimental effect 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.606
 of the capillaries, without reducing the pressure, 

00:06:49.606 --> 00:06:51.640
 which is allowed by the capillaries, 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.683
 high blood pressure 

00:06:53.683 --> 00:06:56.852
 passes directly from the arterial system into the venous system. 

00:06:56.852 --> 00:07:01.818
 This high pressure places the arteriovenous malformation 

00:07:01.832 --> 00:07:06.338
 in an extremely high risk of rupture. 

00:07:06.338 --> 00:07:08.578
 You can imagine that if this happens in the brain, 

00:07:08.578 --> 00:07:10.738
 a hemorrhagic stroke will occur. 

00:07:10.738 --> 00:07:13.784
 Even with the fact that ABM can happen anywhere in the body, 

00:07:13.784 --> 00:07:16.123
 it often occurs in the brain 

00:07:16.123 --> 00:07:18.377
 or in the central nervous system. 

00:07:18.377 --> 00:07:19.456
 Why are they happening? 

00:07:19.456 --> 00:07:20.443
 They are innate. 

00:07:20.443 --> 00:07:23.438
 They are due to a defect in the formation of a blood vessel 

00:07:23.438 --> 00:07:25.040
 during development. 

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.723
 These are two of the main reasons 

00:07:26.723 --> 00:07:28.214
 for hemorrhagic stroke.
