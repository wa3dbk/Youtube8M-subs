know<00:01:55.030> it<00:01:55.180> becomes<00:01:55.750> a<00:01:56.140> memory<00:01:57.870> really<00:01:58.870> try<00:01:59.050> to

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
know it becomes a memory really try to

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.140 
know it becomes a memory really try to
look<00:01:59.290> for<00:01:59.500> materials<00:01:59.980> that<00:02:00.100> I<00:02:00.220> a<00:02:00.250> 12<00:02:00.640> like

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
look for materials that I a 12 like

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.830 
look for materials that I a 12 like
things<00:02:01.420> that<00:02:02.700> in<00:02:03.700> sedate<00:02:04.000> all<00:02:04.240> of<00:02:04.360> materials

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
things that in sedate all of materials

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.470 
things that in sedate all of materials
do<00:02:04.960> like<00:02:05.170> tenders<00:02:05.650> and<00:02:05.950> weathers<00:02:06.370> and<00:02:06.480> metals

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
do like tenders and weathers and metals

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.720 
do like tenders and weathers and metals
they<00:02:08.020> get<00:02:08.170> better<00:02:08.380> with<00:02:08.560> age<00:02:08.649> known<00:02:09.220> as<00:02:09.340> people

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:09.730 
they get better with age known as people

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:12.150 
they get better with age known as people
interact<00:02:10.090> with<00:02:10.210> lemonade<00:02:10.630> where<00:02:11.290> away<00:02:11.440> parts

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
interact with lemonade where away parts

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.230 
interact with lemonade where away parts
and<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:13.770> day<00:02:14.770> they've<00:02:15.010> take<00:02:15.310> on<00:02:15.490> a<00:02:15.520> history<00:02:16.030> that

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
and a day they've take on a history that

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.120 
and a day they've take on a history that
they<00:02:16.390> become<00:02:16.660> better<00:02:16.870> it<00:02:17.620> looks<00:02:17.980> like

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
they become better it looks like

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.920 
they become better it looks like
something<00:02:18.490> that's<00:02:18.760> complicated<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.390> make<00:02:19.510> and

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
something that's complicated to make and

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.920 
something that's complicated to make and
there's<00:02:20.380> a<00:02:20.470> real<00:02:20.650> sense<00:02:20.860> of<00:02:21.070> pride<00:02:21.400> in<00:02:21.930> having

can you can pull this off like it's not
it<00:02:28.240> it<00:02:28.600> might<00:02:28.990> stretch<00:02:29.320> some<00:02:29.530> people<00:02:29.860> a<00:02:29.920> little
