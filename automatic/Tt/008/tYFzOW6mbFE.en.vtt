jeremyhill<00:00:40.710> which<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.250> definitely<00:00:41.670> going<00:00:41.879> to

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
jeremyhill which is definitely going to

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.490 
jeremyhill which is definitely going to
be<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.210> problem<00:00:42.450> because<00:00:42.780> we<00:00:43.050> all<00:00:43.230> know<00:00:43.260> that

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
be a problem because we all know that

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.670 
be a problem because we all know that
all<00:00:43.890> rookie<00:00:44.420> Jeremy<00:00:45.420> Hill<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:46.110> glitch<00:00:46.440> at

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
all rookie Jeremy Hill is a glitch at

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.990 
all rookie Jeremy Hill is a glitch at
running<00:00:47.070> back<00:00:47.100> but<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.520> see<00:00:47.700> his<00:00:47.789> wide

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
running back but you see his wide

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.119 
running back but you see his wide
receiving<00:00:48.360> for<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> pretty<00:00:49.020> solid<00:00:49.320> nothing<00:00:49.920> too

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
receiving for a pretty solid nothing too

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.010 
receiving for a pretty solid nothing too
special<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:50.820> we<00:00:50.940> definitely<00:00:51.210> do<00:00:51.629> have<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
special so we definitely do have the

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.840 
special so we definitely do have the
advantage<00:00:52.469> there<00:00:52.739> we're<00:00:53.280> getting<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.520> look<00:00:53.670> at

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
advantage there we're getting a look at

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.910 
advantage there we're getting a look at
his<00:00:54.090> offensive<00:00:54.750> line<00:00:54.780> he<00:00:55.140> has<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> couple<00:00:55.680> holes

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
his offensive line he has a couple holes

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.069 
his offensive line he has a couple holes
because<00:00:56.219> he<00:00:56.370> has<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.760> 66<00:00:57.480> over<00:00:57.750> all<00:00:57.870> right

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
because he has a 66 over all right

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.900 
because he has a 66 over all right
tackle<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:59.010> we<00:00:59.129> need<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.430> try<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.789> take

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
tackle so we need to try and take

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.000 
tackle so we need to try and take
advantage<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.780> but<00:01:01.289> his<00:01:01.440> defense<00:01:01.680> was

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
advantage of that but his defense was

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.770 
advantage of that but his defense was
pretty<00:01:02.370> solid<00:01:02.789> there<00:01:02.969> on<00:01:03.120> out<00:01:03.300> he<00:01:03.480> pretty<00:01:03.690> much

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
pretty solid there on out he pretty much

Manning were in the pocket once again
and<00:01:52.229> we<00:01:52.320> see<00:01:52.530> it's<00:01:52.680> open<00:01:53.100> once<00:01:53.340> against<00:01:53.700> we<00:01:53.939> are

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
and we see it's open once against we are

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.760 
and we see it's open once against we are
gonna<00:01:54.180> go<00:01:54.360> on<00:01:54.479> ahead<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.990> take<00:01:55.259> our<00:01:55.439> first

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
gonna go on ahead and take our first

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.649 
gonna go on ahead and take our first
down<00:01:56.100> Eli<00:01:56.820> Manning's<00:01:57.210> looking<00:01:57.479> like<00:01:57.630> a

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
down Eli Manning's looking like a

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.330 
down Eli Manning's looking like a
scrambling<00:01:58.259> quarterback<00:01:58.740> out<00:01:58.950> here<00:01:59.130> but<00:01:59.280> you

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
scrambling quarterback out here but you

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.160 
scrambling quarterback out here but you
guys<00:01:59.490> know<00:01:59.820> he<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.119> definitely<00:02:00.390> not<00:02:00.869> a

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
guys know he is definitely not a

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.870 
guys know he is definitely not a
scrambling<00:02:01.710> quarterback<00:02:02.159> when<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:02.430> try<00:02:02.729> and

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
scrambling quarterback when you try and

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.580 
scrambling quarterback when you try and
stay<00:02:03.060> away<00:02:03.180> from<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.509> because<00:02:04.049> he<00:02:04.350> probably

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
stay away from that because he probably

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.649 
stay away from that because he probably
will<00:02:04.920> end<00:02:05.159> up<00:02:05.340> fumbling<00:02:05.790> if<00:02:05.939> we<00:02:06.090> continue<00:02:06.570> to

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
will end up fumbling if we continue to

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.900 
will end up fumbling if we continue to
keep<00:02:06.780> doing<00:02:07.140> that<00:02:07.259> but<00:02:07.710> look<00:02:07.890> at<00:02:08.039> theoretical

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
keep doing that but look at theoretical

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.119 
keep doing that but look at theoretical
on<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.149> outside<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:09.869> gets<00:02:10.110> us<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.289> about<00:02:10.920> a

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
on the outside that gets us to about a

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.010 
on the outside that gets us to about a
second<00:02:11.849> down<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.000> two<00:02:12.300> we<00:02:12.480> ended<00:02:12.750> up<00:02:12.840> getting

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
second down and two we ended up getting

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.700 
second down and two we ended up getting
sacked

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
sacked

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.350 
sacked
that<00:02:13.890> gave<00:02:14.040> us<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.340> third<00:02:14.640> down<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:14.970> seven

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
that gave us a third down and seven

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.210 
that gave us a third down and seven
we're<00:02:15.660> rolling<00:02:15.990> out<00:02:16.110> with<00:02:16.290> Eli<00:02:16.590> Manning<00:02:16.950> once

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
we're rolling out with Eli Manning once

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.520 
we're rolling out with Eli Manning once
again<00:02:17.820> and<00:02:18.210> we're<00:02:18.540> almost<00:02:18.720> picking<00:02:19.200> up<00:02:19.410> the

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
again and we're almost picking up the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.380 
again and we're almost picking up the
first<00:02:19.740> down<00:02:19.860> so<00:02:20.190> on<00:02:20.220> fourth-and-inches<00:02:21.000> we're

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
first down so on fourth-and-inches we're

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.480 
first down so on fourth-and-inches we're
gonna<00:02:21.480> hand<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:21.900> off<00:02:22.020> to<00:02:22.050> our<00:02:22.470> fullback<00:02:22.950> he's

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
gonna hand it off to our fullback he's

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
gonna get us to the 20 yard line so we

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.100 
gonna get us to the 20 yard line so we
have<00:02:25.770> a<00:02:25.950> third<00:02:26.280> down<00:02:26.610> in<00:02:26.640> 12<00:02:27.270> we're<00:02:27.690> looking

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
we're rolling around with Eli Manning

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.100 
we're rolling around with Eli Manning
trying<00:02:29.850> to<00:02:30.000> scramble<00:02:30.270> once<00:02:30.660> again<00:02:30.960> it<00:02:31.080> looks

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
trying to scramble once again it looks

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.410 
trying to scramble once again it looks
like<00:02:31.410> we<00:02:31.560> had<00:02:31.740> a<00:02:31.770> chance<00:02:32.160> we<00:02:32.790> get<00:02:32.880> a<00:02:32.940> little<00:02:33.180> bit

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
like we had a chance we get a little bit

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.850 
like we had a chance we get a little bit
of<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.690> warp<00:02:33.930> tackle<00:02:34.380> there<00:02:34.500> so<00:02:34.650> we're<00:02:34.770> gonna

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
of a warp tackle there so we're gonna

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.950 
of a warp tackle there so we're gonna
have<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.130> go<00:02:35.250> on<00:02:35.370> ahead<00:02:35.490> and<00:02:35.850> take<00:02:36.450> our<00:02:36.660> field

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.410 
have to go on ahead and take our field
goal<00:02:37.110> so<00:02:37.290> we<00:02:37.440> are<00:02:37.650> up<00:02:37.860> 30<00:02:38.550> in<00:02:38.580> this<00:02:38.910> game<00:02:39.180> with

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
goal so we are up 30 in this game with

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.420 
goal so we are up 30 in this game with
three<00:02:39.690> minutes<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:40.080> go<00:02:40.170> in<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:41.010> second

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
quarter all we need to do is try and get

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.750 
quarter all we need to do is try and get
a<00:02:42.930> stop<00:02:43.230> on<00:02:43.410> defense<00:02:43.470> we<00:02:44.070> don't<00:02:44.370> want<00:02:44.580> to<00:02:44.640> let

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
a stop on defense we don't want to let

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.760 
a stop on defense we don't want to let
him<00:02:44.910> get<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.090> touchdown<00:02:45.450> we<00:02:46.200> put<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.470> pressure

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
him get a touchdown we put the pressure

him get a touchdown we put the pressure
on<00:02:46.980> him<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.520> we'll<00:02:47.640> see<00:02:47.850> if<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.180> defense<00:02:48.600> can

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
on him and we'll see if the defense can

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.990 
on him and we'll see if the defense can
do<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.260> job<00:02:49.290> but<00:02:49.980> he's<00:02:50.190> dropping<00:02:50.640> back<00:02:50.790> with

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
do the job but he's dropping back with

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.460 
do the job but he's dropping back with
Jay<00:02:51.210> Kyle<00:02:51.420> it<00:02:51.510> looks<00:02:51.540> like<00:02:51.870> he's<00:02:52.020> about<00:02:52.050> to

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
Jay Kyle it looks like he's about to

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.840 
Jay Kyle it looks like he's about to
scramble<00:02:52.860> I<00:02:52.890> hate<00:02:53.160> this<00:02:53.340> play<00:02:53.610> right<00:02:53.640> here

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850
