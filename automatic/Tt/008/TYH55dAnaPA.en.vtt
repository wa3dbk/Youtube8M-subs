 link in the description of all 5 weight places 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.309
 armed stay alive now 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.070
 very important point a lot of controversy 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.700
 there was going to be just a series and now we are all 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.039
 explain 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.570
 The first motive of the series where I won 30 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.910
 and the opponent left the match by so many 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.859
 wrote why I did not change the defender 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.680
 not visible one would be I became a match 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.439
 to zero but I don't understand why people 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.080
 such confusion because I constantly 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.730
 did as it did with all the others 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.399
 in teams this stays in place 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.530
 changing guys if the track appears 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.280
 no changes in the team 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.390
 it will be generally that with the same one 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.510
 was before this match 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.760
 when the opponent came out we were just protecting 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.250
 you another match piggy bank this league but 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.379
 I don't add anything to it 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.030
 nor diminish anyone with currents 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.280
 what score was the match just if 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.960
 the opponent went out to him led by us 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.120
 just his protection to them all 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.800
 no change there they should be 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.870
 know why people started writing this 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.080
 because in the show with the rest 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.580
 we did teams like this here 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.350
 this moment is clear and more such 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.000
 messages will not be also when the contender 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.460
 left 4 minutes of the match is well short 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.229
 the very beginning when the score was 00 and there is 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.570
 still more powerful account for explain 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.340
 why was the vote and the majority 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.770
 voted for what we count but 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.950
 I objectively looked at the situation 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.829
 imagine that the opposition series 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.720
 which are the numerator of the project and rbl which 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.240
 pretend to conquer all 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.869
 will solve one match that is, let's say 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:41.890
 opel survived already 12 matches may 13 to 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:43.780
 win and that's exactly it 13 he will 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.220
 be considered exactly this match which 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.030
 4 minutes completed and where no one 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.280
 didn't score anything 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.869
 that is, the winner will not be only for 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.399
 due to the fact that just an opponent came out of 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.830
 matches he left himself on his own initiative 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.750
 well there could be reasons and we are not or 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.710
 day led in the bill at that time that is 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.649
 it will be stupid 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.390
 so that opel run this way i 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:05.049
 I think it would be better if we are there Pts 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.840
 forget as if that were not rbl 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.160
 deservedly will go to the title beating 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.440
 I think my rivals will be like that 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.480
 much better but today I want to say 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.310
 Thank you all for voting 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.940
 and so now at the moment 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.040
 lpl passed seven matches to catch up 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.440
 a series of drive off not overtake left 5 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.840
 that is all I survived 12 matches later 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.549
 took off five more matches that is 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.739
 almost half the equator already they 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.959
 overcame and only 37 and football players 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.459
 it is simple we it is chic it 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.280
 great situation the main thing is not 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.110
 lose and today two matches we are again in 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.630
 the series play went and now we 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.930
 try diapers with this 84 and this 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:47.980
 by the way mean just okay 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:51.250
 let's go down well brazilian 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.380
 the touch sold the head here it was 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.540
 chic attack as was played 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:01.299
 guys and it is a pity that we did not forget the birth 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:03.760
 very powerful answers here already here 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:06.150
 the game and here is already Igor Akinfeev saves 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.150
 our team 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.190
 exactly the same 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.500
 took the ball and the defender is already behind the hop 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.130
 ran we have space we have 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:20.760
 options for maneuvering the hulk beat the two 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.480
 put out the protrusion handled it just 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.510
 masterpiece 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.460
 bussufa i 'm talking to a man just drags 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.780
 for a team well hold as in this 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.660
 the episode is simply divine 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.730
 and how much happy good for the opponent 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.850
 Akinfeev blow 1 of our 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.520
 midfielder should be on the sword 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:43.260
 distance penalty here it was already impossible 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:46.380
 save him too well he 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.030
 attacked the last two minutes and how would I 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.640
 did not try the ball and the ball is everything 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.210
 unsuccessfully we like them so his two 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.130
 let out 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.300
 stands alone between defenders none his 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.160
 debtor mouth 11 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:00.030
 but the hair is played by the rival but is played 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.460
 successfully put the center again 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.490
 passes life again we just give beat 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:08.780
 I do not understand why there are two defenders 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:11.730
 near they give to give give to take the ball 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.470
 it was there that I gave the type we let him 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:18.989
 we have an empty gate I'm in shock 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:20.700
 we had empty frames 31 just on 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.060
 flat place I did not want to not be 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.890
 washed 31 lose strands u lose 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.580
 five football players in one match so 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:35.100
 we go away two players attack i 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:38.289
 perhaps I remove flank and three players 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:43.289
 protection goes 1 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:46.110
 2 and I don’t even know inside 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:48.639
 pletikosa gets us at the gate 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.139
 Brazilian ferrero hysterical with speed 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:52.089
 80 in our central position 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.319
 defender and on the right we should be 

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:56.139
 bronze already protected 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:57.849
 we and return fishing has a good and 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.159
 In principle , these two guys are already in 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:02.770
 attack played silver but with 

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:04.419
 Defense is getting worse and worse and we stop more 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.759
 one player we are changing now from the center 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:08.849
 the field has already lost the match accurately and perhaps 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:11.860
 we will remove 2 lu 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:13.869
 only three gold players left 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.639
 after the match up almost the entire composition was 

00:05:13.869 --> 00:05:17.499
 gold and there are only three gold already 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:18.999
 one bronze from one match than me 

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:20.559
 spoke in the last series we are now 

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:22.899
 the main thing is not to pour on, but 

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:24.399
 save or even return players to yes 

00:05:22.899 --> 00:05:26.169
 I know that I did not put the form in this 

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:29.080
 series I apologize to the following will return 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:31.479
 we have a squad without teamwork 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.729
 but strong of course anyway without 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:37.449
 teamwork is almost absolutely 46 this 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:39.039
 very little hug feed he goes 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:41.889

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:45.580

 82 where about 00 still us 

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.520

 from behind no idea who I am to you 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.370
 I don’t even know it in person but we score 10 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:26.320
 this is a very important ball very important boys 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.270
 rejoices but early still need two more 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.250
 Sword at least hammer and better not 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.620
 skip here my move game away from 

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.600
 its gate but any attack and everything will be 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.300
 bad and still don't know how 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.970
 stove laid but played well here 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.810
 This Pavel Mamaev By the way, not bad 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.290
 I lost yamz 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:47.100
 all the taste covered up to return the mind about 

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:49.300
 hi- grade bronze defender 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.550
 insurance bronze protect your 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:56.620
 why beat my goodness cross class 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:58.390
 Well, I just do not know how to describe 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.180
 this guy's game on the right we have this 

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:05.280
 masterpiece 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:08.139
 good bussufa and 2 

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.150
 well 10 to win blah blah blah but we still 

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:12.009
 losing two players look after that 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:14.750
 we turn out we return places 

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:17.420
 my who scored a goal played cool 

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:21.800
 Bella who drags nothing at us once 

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:23.990
 and remove 2 except so I will leave on the left in 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.910
 drive to the left we will have bronze 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:26.690
 it turns out just fall to be run 

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:29.120
 saved 

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:31.010
 we are none of silver except guilty 

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.900
 I don't see explanatory stats here 

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:35.150
 the whirlpool therefore becomes abundantly 

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:37.340
 Farm ie Weipa anus Prince 

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:39.860
 playing playable here on the left will be bad 

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.270
 Of course, this is how rp looks after us 

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.640
 it turns out 9 matches 

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:45.500
 eset 11-12 left to stand out that is 

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:48.980
 it turns out 2 we let out still it is necessary to survive 

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:51.890
 two issues I don't know whether it will work or not 

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:54.590
 the question is very very controversial but we all 

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:58.570
 let's believe I thought myself was thank you 

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:58.570
 looked at seeing rural meetings yet
