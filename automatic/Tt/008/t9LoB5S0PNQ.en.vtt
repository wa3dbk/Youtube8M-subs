00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello again with you channel by h plus 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.440
 and today I would like to talk with you about 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.440
 what you want to buy what 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.519
 car but you want to buy the first 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.410
 new car or change restaurant 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.539
 save money take a loan and borrow 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.580
 money but not matter where you take 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.820
 and here the most interesting begins 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.369
 car choice choice of course choice 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.380
 the most reverent time the most interesting 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.900
 time is when you choose choose 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.820
 car and naturally and unconditionally 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.309
 the choice depends on a variety of reasons 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.010
 of circumstances and naturally it is before 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.680
 total amount of which amount is 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.270
 Well, of course there are tips 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.270
 friends 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:48.989
 my own beliefs and many 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.149
 other factors here are those who buy 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.750
 first car thinks it's best 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.750
 take the old 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.359
 well, just for the fact that 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.920
 think that this car will knock it 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.080
 I think the principle probably works 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.060
 slightly different what the more expensive on 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:13.320
 we get the car so scrupulous 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:15.659
 treat him and not even something 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.509
 scrupulous and most likely it 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.710
 will be 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:22.259
 cautious careful about this 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.229
 car and young driver not 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.950
 forget what is best 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.060
 repair 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.150
 domestic car than a foreign car 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.130
 so here but it’s more likely to talk about 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.560
 what kind of car do you need exactly for 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.259
 car suits you and ask yourself 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.619
 a few questions and the first one should 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.850
 be size cars don't forget 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.840
 that 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:54.020
 what exactly should your provide 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:56.580
 car like it for example 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.140
 put together and the more 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.340
 car, naturally, the more 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.310
 the expense that is for example what it will be 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.580
 he you even back sedan wagon 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:13.680
 jeep crossover and here most likely 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.810
 fits sedan is some kind of rather 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.260
 city ​​some family car 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.170
 Feedback is about the same 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.090
 maybe a little more trunk more accurate 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.810
 it will be a little more roomy 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:32.000
 here is a beauty of some kind can be easy 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.000
 very light SUV is not versal 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:41.680
 there is a large amount of space there 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:43.090
 space in the car and of course 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.750
 maybe there is an extra row 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.780
 the seats 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.370
 but also a jeep if you do some 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.520
 so serious and front or for example 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.400
 you 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.760
 modify dial through proxy 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.250
 country road or exit for you 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.140
 difficult is more likely the same way 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.150
 what is your gearbox 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.150
 automatic or mechanical if you 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.370
 first, the very first day begins 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.410
 drive automatically then to manual 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.840
 the box is not peresyadete well here in what 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:18.850
 pros and cons separately there is a topic for 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:21.190
 talk but briefly say that more 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.200
 this is of course a mechanical well 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:27.000
 there is rather some kind of aggressive driver 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:31.030
 must be to use exactly 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.800
 manual well here separately 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.690
 as if talking up about the box so here 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.270
 still what question engine what is needed 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.610
 it is for you engine yes that is big 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:43.540
 volume or small volume but rather 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:47.590
 probably for a small city 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:51.640
 volume 1 and 4 16 since now in many 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:56.260
 large cities are no meaningless camera 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:59.530
 There somewhere drive naturally if you 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:04.420
 there again get out somewhere there 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:06.580
 outside the city you can go 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.520
 for me it's expensive I think the same is bigger 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.150
 the volume of diction to take here what drive 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.770
 you in the car on the full will drive 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.510
 back front but naturally for beginners 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.489
 better to take front-wheel drive 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.919
 because with him is much easier or and 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.270
 complete everything again depends on your 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.690
 wallet 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:28.330
 so well, specifically already here for everything 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:31.450
 these questions if you have them of course 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:34.570
 arise i can give a separate answer a 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:37.450
 don't forget to subscribe to my videos 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:39.940
 don't forget to like 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.560
 The next topic will be about Japanese and 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.680
 German cars I think will 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.290
 interesting and if this is interesting 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.440
 topic then i can as they say inflate out 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:55.300
 flies an elephant and try somehow more 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:56.830
 volume to give answers to these questions here 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.020
 can also be called what it was 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.450
 a small announcement about how to choose 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.310
 imagine if the car is really 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.600
 Interesting in everything I can 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.919
 tell in more detail about specifically 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.820
 what would be better wagon civic 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.460
 hatchback 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:14.220
 it is for you and there and tender 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:18.180
 automatic transmission 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:20.500
 full drive car dimensions 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.430
 we can focus already 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.919
 more 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:27.030
 but thank you all with you channel bh plus with 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:27.030
 by you bye
