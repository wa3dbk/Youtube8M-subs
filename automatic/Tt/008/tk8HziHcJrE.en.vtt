reason<00:02:19.770> I<00:02:20.010> have<00:02:20.190> chosen<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.730> feather<00:02:21.030> is<00:02:21.390> that

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
reason I have chosen the feather is that

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.960 
reason I have chosen the feather is that
I<00:02:22.440> kind<00:02:22.980> of<00:02:23.040> think<00:02:23.280> when<00:02:23.550> i<00:02:23.580> think<00:02:23.670> of<00:02:23.850> the

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
I kind of think when i think of the

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.640 
I kind of think when i think of the
mardi<00:02:24.330> gras<00:02:24.480> stuff<00:02:24.780> i<00:02:24.959> think<00:02:25.200> of<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.380> beads

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
mardi gras stuff i think of the beads

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.730 
mardi gras stuff i think of the beads
but<00:02:25.950> i<00:02:25.980> also<00:02:26.190> think<00:02:26.370> of<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:27.090> feather<00:02:27.600> mask<00:02:28.320> you

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
but i also think of the feather mask you

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.260 
but i also think of the feather mask you
know<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.950> masks<00:02:29.370> with<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.550> feathers<00:02:29.940> on<00:02:30.090> them

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
know the masks with the feathers on them

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.940 
know the masks with the feathers on them
which<00:02:30.450> is<00:02:30.480> why<00:02:30.750> i<00:02:30.780> chose<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.350> feather<00:02:31.620> image

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
which is why i chose the feather image

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.180 
which is why i chose the feather image
