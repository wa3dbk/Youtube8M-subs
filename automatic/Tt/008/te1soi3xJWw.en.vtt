you're<00:00:29.340> probably<00:00:29.429> wondering<00:00:29.609> why<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.090> this

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
you're probably wondering why is this

weapon so great and how does it do so

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.780 
weapon so great and how does it do so
much<00:00:31.679> damage<00:00:31.710> well<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.340> interesting<00:00:32.579> thing

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
much damage well the interesting thing

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.520 
much damage well the interesting thing
about<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.390> it<00:00:33.570> doesn't<00:00:33.840> actually<00:00:34.110> do<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.410> lot

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
about it is it doesn't actually do a lot

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.930 
about it is it doesn't actually do a lot
of<00:00:34.590> damage<00:00:34.800> fresh<00:00:35.160> out<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.550> assembly<00:00:35.910> line

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
of damage fresh out of the assembly line

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.790 
of damage fresh out of the assembly line
it<00:00:36.390> acted<00:00:36.719> as<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.809> rather<00:00:37.079> load<00:00:37.350> physical

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
it acted as a rather load physical

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.350 
it acted as a rather load physical
damage<00:00:38.070> base<00:00:38.250> and<00:00:38.460> most<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.090> in<00:00:39.239> the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
damage base and most of it is in the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.240 
damage base and most of it is in the
slash<00:00:39.600> however<00:00:39.989> what<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.260> does<00:00:40.500> have<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:41.040> as<00:00:41.219> a

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
slash however what it does have is as a

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.580 
slash however what it does have is as a
30%<00:00:42.000> crit<00:00:42.270> chance<00:00:42.450> at<00:00:42.690> base<00:00:42.989> which<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.410> rather

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
30% crit chance at base which is rather

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.029 
30% crit chance at base which is rather
high<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.340> 3.0<00:00:45.120> crit<00:00:45.539> damage<00:00:45.719> multiplier<00:00:46.500> so

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
high and a 3.0 crit damage multiplier so

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.319 
high and a 3.0 crit damage multiplier so
that's<00:00:47.160> really<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.579> catch<00:00:47.760> with<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.059> weapon

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
that's really the catch with the weapon

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.790 
that's really the catch with the weapon
until<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.629> get<00:00:48.750> those<00:00:48.870> crit<00:00:49.170> mods<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.590> there

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
until you get those crit mods on there

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.139 
until you get those crit mods on there
you're<00:00:49.980> not<00:00:50.129> gonna<00:00:50.280> do<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> whole<00:00:50.670> lot<00:00:50.879> with<00:00:51.090> it

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
you're not gonna do a whole lot with it

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.639 
you're not gonna do a whole lot with it

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
down which takes about two seconds or so

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.410 
down which takes about two seconds or so
you<00:01:20.159> can<00:01:20.280> still<00:01:20.490> purse<00:01:20.759> fire<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.330> it

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
you can still purse fire it so it

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.060 
you can still purse fire it so it
doesn't<00:01:21.720> require<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.560> hold<00:01:22.799> down<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
doesn't require that you hold down the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.100 
doesn't require that you hold down the
trigger<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.490> entire<00:01:23.759> time<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.360> lastly<00:01:24.960> it

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
trigger the entire time and lastly it

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.020 
trigger the entire time and lastly it
has<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.259> pretty<00:01:25.500> low<00:01:25.650> status<00:01:26.009> base<00:01:26.189> at<00:01:26.340> 7%<00:01:26.640> so

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
has a pretty low status base at 7% so

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.789 
has a pretty low status base at 7% so
the<00:01:27.150> dual<00:01:27.360> status<00:01:27.630> row<00:01:28.049> mods<00:01:28.290> aren't<00:01:28.590> as

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
the dual status row mods aren't as

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.980 
the dual status row mods aren't as
viable<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.579> weapon<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.060> maybe<00:01:30.630> more<00:01:30.869> than

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
viable on the weapon and maybe more than

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.240 
viable on the weapon and maybe more than
you<00:01:31.079> think<00:01:31.259> because<00:01:31.590> it's<00:01:31.740> not<00:01:31.890> just<00:01:32.130> about

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
you think because it's not just about

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.130 
you think because it's not just about
the<00:01:32.579> fact<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.030> won't<00:01:33.180> proc<00:01:33.479> very<00:01:33.720> often

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
the fact that it won't proc very often

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.080 
the fact that it won't proc very often
from<00:01:34.350> your<00:01:34.470> elemental<00:01:34.799> combos<00:01:35.220> it's<00:01:35.610> also<00:01:35.850> the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
from your elemental combos it's also the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.730 
from your elemental combos it's also the
fact<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.509> regular<00:01:37.049> elemental<00:01:37.619> mods

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
fact that the regular elemental mods

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.499 
fact that the regular elemental mods
actually<00:01:38.280> benefit<00:01:38.670> more<00:01:38.909> from<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.360> high

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
actually benefit more from the high

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.420 
actually benefit more from the high
critical<00:01:40.049> multiplier<00:01:40.680> because<00:01:41.130> that

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
critical multiplier because that

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.520 
critical multiplier because that
actually<00:01:41.610> amplifies<00:01:42.479> elemental<00:01:43.049> damage<00:01:43.200> as

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
actually amplifies elemental damage as

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.590 
actually amplifies elemental damage as
well<00:01:43.909> alright<00:01:44.909> guys<00:01:45.060> let's<00:01:45.270> talk<00:01:45.360> about<00:01:45.420> how

elemental<00:02:13.470> combo

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
elemental combo

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.620 
elemental combo
for<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.160> factions<00:02:14.640> you<00:02:14.730> need<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.330> everything

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
for the factions you need and everything

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.330 
for the factions you need and everything
will<00:02:15.750> just<00:02:15.780> work<00:02:15.930> out<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.470> way<00:02:16.620> so<00:02:16.830> it's

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
will just work out that way so it's

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.630 
will just work out that way so it's
pretty<00:02:17.490> straightforward<00:02:18.920> so<00:02:19.920> after<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.430> I'm

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
pretty straightforward so after that I'm

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.130 
pretty straightforward so after that I'm
gonna<00:02:20.760> talk<00:02:20.910> about<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.180> core<00:02:21.630> mods<00:02:21.840> before<00:02:22.110> I

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
gonna talk about the core mods before I

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.570 
gonna talk about the core mods before I
jump<00:02:22.349> into<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.620> elemental<00:02:22.980> combos<00:02:23.370> and

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
jump into the elemental combos and

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.040 
jump into the elemental combos and
they're<00:02:23.670> gonna<00:02:23.790> be<00:02:23.970> survey<00:02:24.599> Shin<00:02:24.810> heavy

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
they're gonna be survey Shin heavy

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.870 
they're gonna be survey Shin heavy
caliber<00:02:25.319> split<00:02:25.860> chamber<00:02:26.069> they're<00:02:26.610> gonna<00:02:26.730> be

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
caliber split chamber they're gonna be

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.240 
caliber split chamber they're gonna be
your<00:02:26.970> raw<00:02:27.209> damage<00:02:27.510> mods<00:02:27.959> you<00:02:28.650> want<00:02:28.860> these<00:02:29.010> on

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
your raw damage mods you want these on

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.850 
your raw damage mods you want these on
all<00:02:29.489> your<00:02:29.700> primaries<00:02:30.470> basically<00:02:31.470> in<00:02:31.590> case<00:02:31.650> you

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
all your primaries basically in case you

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.500 
all your primaries basically in case you
didn't<00:02:32.040> know<00:02:32.160> they're<00:02:32.400> just<00:02:32.580> really<00:02:33.390> really

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
didn't know they're just really really

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.470 
didn't know they're just really really
good<00:02:33.840> like<00:02:34.200> had<00:02:35.010> two<00:02:35.310> serrations<00:02:35.880> basically

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
good like had two serrations basically

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.630 
good like had two serrations basically
and<00:02:36.630> by<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.750> way<00:02:36.900> that<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.290> -<00:02:37.650> 55%<00:02:38.489> -<00:02:38.550> they

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
and by the way that the - 55% - they

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.160 
and by the way that the - 55% - they
actually<00:02:38.940> you<00:02:39.239> don't<00:02:39.540> really<00:02:39.750> notice<00:02:39.930> that

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
actually you don't really notice that

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.020 
actually you don't really notice that
too<00:02:40.290> much<00:02:40.440> in<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.650> soma<00:02:40.890> most<00:02:41.280> primers<00:02:41.760> aren't

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
too much in the soma most primers aren't

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.699 
too much in the soma most primers aren't
affected<00:02:42.450> with<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:42.959> exception<00:02:43.349> of<00:02:43.440> like<00:02:43.500> the

need is point strike for the crit chance
and<00:02:49.440> then<00:02:49.530> file<00:02:49.739> sense<00:02:50.069> for<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.340> extra<00:02:50.640> one

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
and then file sense for the extra one

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.130 
and then file sense for the extra one
hundred<00:02:51.030> and<00:02:51.090> twenty<00:02:51.420> percent<00:02:51.540> crit<00:02:51.989> damage

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
hundred and twenty percent crit damage

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.530 
hundred and twenty percent crit damage
which<00:02:52.500> will<00:02:52.650> bump<00:02:52.890> you<00:02:52.980> up<00:02:53.160> from<00:02:53.340> 3.0<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:54.299> six

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
which will bump you up from 3.0 to six

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.380 
which will bump you up from 3.0 to six
point<00:02:54.810> six<00:02:55.140> multiplier<00:02:55.709> which<00:02:55.950> is<00:02:56.100> huge<00:02:56.489> so

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
point six multiplier which is huge so

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.270 
point six multiplier which is huge so
that's<00:02:57.540> how<00:02:57.630> that's<00:02:57.840> gonna<00:02:57.930> work<00:02:58.080> out<00:02:58.380> moving

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
that's how that's gonna work out moving

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.680 
that's how that's gonna work out moving
on<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.580> elemental<00:02:59.910> combos<00:03:00.330> oh<00:03:00.480> this

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
on to the elemental combos oh this

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.990 
on to the elemental combos oh this
loadout<00:03:01.470> is<00:03:01.620> for<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.010> Grenier<00:03:02.370> so<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.850> best

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
loadout is for the Grenier so the best

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.360 
loadout is for the Grenier so the best
combo<00:03:03.360> for<00:03:03.510> them<00:03:03.750> for<00:03:04.620> three<00:03:04.950> elemental

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
combo for them for three elemental

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.110 
combo for them for three elemental
combos<00:03:06.110> or<00:03:07.110> three<00:03:07.950> elements<00:03:08.310> rather<00:03:08.549> is<00:03:08.819> just

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
combos or three elements rather is just

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.600 
combos or three elements rather is just
basically<00:03:09.450> gonna<00:03:09.630> be<00:03:09.750> radiation<00:03:10.590> for<00:03:11.519> your

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
basically gonna be radiation for your

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.100 
basically gonna be radiation for your
combos<00:03:12.000> so<00:03:12.209> storm<00:03:12.569> bringer<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:12.930> Hellfire

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
combos so storm bringer and Hellfire

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.809 
combos so storm bringer and Hellfire
will<00:03:13.470> give<00:03:13.590> you<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:13.860> so<00:03:14.010> it's<00:03:14.160> electric<00:03:14.640> and

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
will give you that so it's electric and

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.970 
will give you that so it's electric and
fire<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.390> then<00:03:15.810> you<00:03:15.840> just<00:03:15.989> put<00:03:16.110> on<00:03:16.200> toxic<00:03:16.739> to

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
fire and then you just put on toxic to

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.250 
fire and then you just put on toxic to
get<00:03:17.190> extra<00:03:17.640> damage<00:03:17.819> to<00:03:18.090> ferrite<00:03:18.540> armored

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
get extra damage to ferrite armored

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.660 
get extra damage to ferrite armored
units<00:03:19.530> so<00:03:19.709> radiation<00:03:19.980> is<00:03:20.190> gonna<00:03:20.340> be<00:03:20.459> for<00:03:20.579> the

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
units so radiation is gonna be for the

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.970 
units so radiation is gonna be for the
Nate<00:03:20.820> Palmer's<00:03:21.180> of<00:03:21.329> bombers<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:21.980> infected

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
Nate Palmer's of bombers and infected

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.720 
Nate Palmer's of bombers and infected
clip<00:03:23.220> is<00:03:23.430> gonna<00:03:23.910> be<00:03:24.030> for<00:03:24.180> everything<00:03:24.450> else<00:03:25.730> so

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
clip is gonna be for everything else so

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.180 
clip is gonna be for everything else so
moving<00:03:27.030> on<00:03:27.150> now<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.420> corpus<00:03:28.170> basically<00:03:29.100> the

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
moving on now to corpus basically the

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.740 
moving on now to corpus basically the
best<00:03:29.280> element<00:03:29.850> to<00:03:29.910> come<00:03:30.060> before<00:03:30.180> corpus<00:03:30.600> is

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
best element to come before corpus is

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.569 
best element to come before corpus is
gonna<00:03:30.930> be<00:03:31.109> your<00:03:31.320> magnetic<00:03:31.680> for<00:03:32.070> their<00:03:32.190> shields

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
gonna be your magnetic for their shields

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.270 
gonna be your magnetic for their shields
so<00:03:32.850> electric<00:03:33.660> and<00:03:33.870> ice<00:03:34.440> will<00:03:34.769> give<00:03:34.920> you<00:03:35.070> that

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
so electric and ice will give you that

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.920 
so electric and ice will give you that
it's<00:03:35.700> a<00:03:35.790> storm<00:03:36.060> ring<00:03:36.209> and<00:03:36.329> cry<00:03:36.450> rounds<00:03:36.810> and

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
it's a storm ring and cry rounds and

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.660 
it's a storm ring and cry rounds and
then<00:03:37.200> infected<00:03:37.680> clip<00:03:37.859> works<00:03:38.100> well<00:03:38.310> against

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
then infected clip works well against

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.240 
then infected clip works well against
the<00:03:38.730> flesh<00:03:38.940> units<00:03:39.299> of<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.630> corpus<00:03:40.620> as<00:03:40.769> well<00:03:40.980> so

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
the flesh units of the corpus as well so

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.520 
the flesh units of the corpus as well so
the<00:03:41.370> texts<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:42.000> Croom<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:42.989> stuff<00:03:43.170> like<00:03:43.290> that

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
the texts and Croom and stuff like that

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.789 
the texts and Croom and stuff like that
is<00:03:43.829> a<00:03:43.890> good<00:03:44.100> multiplier<00:03:44.579> on<00:03:44.760> them<00:03:45.680> so<00:03:46.680> that's

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
is a good multiplier on them so that's

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.259 
is a good multiplier on them so that's
pretty<00:03:47.430> straightforward<00:03:47.640> there<00:03:47.970> I'm<00:03:48.060> moving

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
pretty straightforward there I'm moving

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.360 
pretty straightforward there I'm moving
on<00:03:48.329> to<00:03:48.450> infest<00:03:48.780> it<00:03:49.019> now<00:03:49.140> infested<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:50.160> best

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
on to infest it now infested the best

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.710 
on to infest it now infested the best
thing<00:03:50.549> you<00:03:50.640> want<00:03:50.820> to<00:03:50.880> do<00:03:51.060> is<00:03:51.329> actually

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
thing you want to do is actually

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.259 
thing you want to do is actually
corrosive<00:03:52.530> so<00:03:52.769> poison<00:03:53.400> electric<00:03:53.850> and<00:03:54.030> then

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
corrosive so poison electric and then

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.840 
corrosive so poison electric and then
fire<00:03:54.600> damage<00:03:55.109> for<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:55.980> lighted<00:03:56.519> unit<00:03:56.730> so

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
fire damage for the lighted unit so

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.090 
fire damage for the lighted unit so
corrosive<00:03:57.090> is<00:03:57.390> basically<00:03:57.660> for<00:03:57.900> ancients<00:03:58.470> good

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
corrosive is basically for ancients good

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.500 
corrosive is basically for ancients good
multiplier<00:03:59.459> against<00:03:59.640> them<00:03:59.910> and<00:04:00.180> then

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
multiplier against them and then

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.170 
multiplier against them and then
Hellfire<00:04:01.230> fire<00:04:01.859> damage<00:04:02.160> covers<00:04:02.640> like<00:04:02.819> the

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
Hellfire fire damage covers like the

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.349 
Hellfire fire damage covers like the
rest<00:04:03.420> of<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.600> faction<00:04:04.079> so<00:04:04.410> all<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.680> lightens

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:05.359 
rest of the faction so all the lightens

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:08.420 
rest of the faction so all the lightens
so<00:04:06.359> it<00:04:06.450> works<00:04:06.600> out<00:04:06.720> really<00:04:06.900> well<00:04:06.989> and<00:04:07.430> then

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
so it works out really well and then

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.059 
so it works out really well and then
finally<00:04:08.780> moving<00:04:09.780> on<00:04:09.900> to<00:04:10.049> the<00:04:10.170> boys<00:04:10.440> voids<00:04:10.889> is

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
finally moving on to the boys voids is

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.099 
finally moving on to the boys voids is
really<00:04:11.310> easy<00:04:11.459> all<00:04:11.609> you<00:04:11.790> have<00:04:12.120> to<00:04:12.269> do<00:04:12.420> is<00:04:12.660> just

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
really easy all you have to do is just

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:15.170 
really easy all you have to do is just
literally<00:04:13.380> switch<00:04:14.100> these<00:04:14.340> two<00:04:14.370> mods<00:04:14.760> that's

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
literally switch these two mods that's

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.849 
literally switch these two mods that's
it<00:04:15.450> because<00:04:15.900> what<00:04:16.049> this<00:04:16.139> will<00:04:16.200> give<00:04:16.470> you<00:04:16.590> is

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
it because what this will give you is

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.770 
it because what this will give you is
basically<00:04:17.370> a<00:04:17.489> corrosive<00:04:18.000> which<00:04:18.450> is<00:04:18.570> really

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
basically a corrosive which is really

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.390 
basically a corrosive which is really
good<00:04:18.900> against<00:04:19.109> the<00:04:19.229> heavy<00:04:19.380> gunners<00:04:19.650> they're

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
good against the heavy gunners they're

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.610 
good against the heavy gunners they're
the<00:04:20.549> hardest<00:04:20.729> units<00:04:21.090> in<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.419> voids<00:04:21.660> and<00:04:21.959> then

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
the hardest units in the voids and then

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.890 
the hardest units in the voids and then
ice<00:04:22.890> damage<00:04:23.400> just<00:04:23.669> for<00:04:24.180> some<00:04:24.419> damage<00:04:24.690> against

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
ice damage just for some damage against

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.360 
ice damage just for some damage against
shields<00:04:25.140> like<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.650> fusion<00:04:25.860> mullahs<00:04:26.190> and<00:04:26.310> the

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
shields like the fusion mullahs and the

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.650 
shields like the fusion mullahs and the
Ospreys<00:04:26.849> will<00:04:27.120> shield<00:04:27.360> some

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
Ospreys will shield some

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.470
