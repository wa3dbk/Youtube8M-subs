thing<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:46.980> noticed<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.760> it's<00:00:47.969> not<00:00:48.149> just<00:00:48.180> a

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
thing I noticed is that it's not just a

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.110 
thing I noticed is that it's not just a
quick<00:00:49.050> reaction<00:00:49.289> in<00:00:49.680> one<00:00:49.829> second<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.760> goalies

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
quick reaction in one second the goalies

quick reaction in one second the goalies
actually<00:00:51.539> read<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.989> plate<00:00:54.649> alright<00:00:55.649> I<00:00:55.680> really

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
actually read the plate alright I really

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.950 
actually read the plate alright I really
like<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.340> board<00:00:56.579> play<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:56.940> NHL<00:00:57.360> 10<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.750> gives

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
like the board play in NHL 10 it gives

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.410 
like the board play in NHL 10 it gives
the<00:00:58.199> game<00:00:58.739> some<00:00:59.309> more<00:00:59.489> layers<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.910> little<00:01:00.030> more

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
the game some more layers a little more

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.319 
the game some more layers a little more
depth<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:01.309> it's<00:01:02.309> like<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> mini<00:01:02.850> game<00:01:03.059> within

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
depth so it's like a mini game within

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.640 
depth so it's like a mini game within
the<00:01:03.449> game<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.899> makes<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.229> fun<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.530> it's

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
the game and it makes it fun and it's

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.950 
the game and it makes it fun and it's
realistic<00:01:05.010> if<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.150> puck<00:01:06.360> we<00:01:06.810> could

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
realistic if you have the puck we could

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.359 
realistic if you have the puck we could
actually<00:01:07.110> hit<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.619> white<00:01:07.799> button<00:01:08.130> or<00:01:08.280> the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
actually hit the white button or the

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.250 
actually hit the white button or the
triangle<00:01:08.820> depending<00:01:09.510> on<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.750> console<00:01:10.170> and

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
triangle depending on the console and

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.440 
triangle depending on the console and
shield<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.130> puck<00:01:11.400> in<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.580> corner<00:01:11.670> if<00:01:12.270> you're

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
shield the puck in the corner if you're

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.179 
shield the puck in the corner if you're
on<00:01:12.540> defense<00:01:12.780> what<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.350> does<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.619> it<00:01:13.740> pins<00:01:14.010> your

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
on defense what it does is it pins your

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.609 
on defense what it does is it pins your
opponent<00:01:14.700> with<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:15.000> cut<00:01:15.210> carrier<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.290> glass

opponent with a cut carrier to the glass

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.410 
opponent with a cut carrier to the glass
and<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.250> could<00:01:17.430> work<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.820> out<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.150> get<00:01:18.299> the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
and you could work it out and get the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.240 
and you could work it out and get the
puck<00:01:18.630> away<00:01:18.750> from<00:01:19.049> them<00:01:19.200> after<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.950> whistle

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
puck away from them after the whistle

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.859 
puck away from them after the whistle
action<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.820> another<00:01:21.090> new<00:01:21.270> thing<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.689> game

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869

on<00:03:43.520> top<00:03:43.760> I<00:03:44.060> mean<00:03:44.480> it's<00:03:44.750> still<00:03:45.050> the<00:03:45.200> best<00:03:45.440> hockey

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
on top I mean it's still the best hockey

simulation<00:03:46.340> on<00:03:46.460> the<00:03:46.490> market<00:03:47.000> and<00:03:47.240> the<00:03:47.540> game

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
simulation on the market and the game

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.390 
simulation on the market and the game
didn't<00:03:48.080> need<00:03:48.230> a<00:03:48.260> big<00:03:48.440> overhaul<00:03:48.890> it<00:03:49.040> was<00:03:49.130> minor

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
didn't need a big overhaul it was minor

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.880 
didn't need a big overhaul it was minor
changes<00:03:49.910> and<00:03:50.120> those<00:03:51.050> minor<00:03:51.350> changes<00:03:51.740> are

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
changes and those minor changes are

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.440 
changes and those minor changes are
enough<00:03:52.160> to<00:03:52.190> make<00:03:52.520> it<00:03:52.670> not<00:03:52.820> only<00:03:53.000> better<00:03:53.330> than

enough to make it not only better than

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.170 
enough to make it not only better than
oh<00:03:53.810> 9<00:03:54.080> but<00:03:54.890> also<00:03:55.100> probably<00:03:55.610> better<00:03:55.790> than<00:03:56.030> to

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
oh 9 but also probably better than to
