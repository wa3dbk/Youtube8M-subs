 between a recent sentence of the Cassation Court ruled that to be able to 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.200
 access the tax benefits provided for by the law regarding 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.229
 the use of fuels in the commercial sphere 

00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:15.689
 I don't know that the fuel card is filled in every single part 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:17.609
 what this means 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.199
 hahaha this was nau mobile with accountant who already existed now 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.970
 . been further specified 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.570
 because it seems so little to me. in reality. to be able to later not 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.569
 having problems 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:36.410
 and to be able to properly enjoy the custodian of the deduction instead of the recovery 

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:38.520

 everything and tax records 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.320
 and it must be is very simple but it must be. not forgetting any 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.070
 part 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.850
 first of all the 3 villa hm obligation creates a stamp or even all the data by hand 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.110

 address tax code and VAT number 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.880
 therefore all the extremes is the company that makes the request 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.750
 identification details of the company requesting it 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.230

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.480
 all the price 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:49.630
 with beside it because the stamp is an abbreviation of the if mc you will be dying 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.640
 many times it is left out, it is also possible, unfortunately, to do 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.479
 very careful because you do not put in which I also consulted the stamp 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.110
 but I don't have the acronym 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.920

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.399

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:44.469
 absolutely no use on communication is my choice 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:47.719
 but a behavior which, however, once I have chosen to install I must 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:48.540
 to adopt 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.859
