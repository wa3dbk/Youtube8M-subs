00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.469 
as I said the steel wool and also
another<00:02:01.320> Dremel<00:02:02.100> bit<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.820> had<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.000> brush<00:02:03.299> at

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
another Dremel bit that had a brush at

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.969 
another Dremel bit that had a brush at
the<00:02:03.540> end

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
the end

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.540 
the end
and<00:02:05.189> then<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.460> cut<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.530> plexiglass

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
and then I cut the plexiglass

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.199 
and then I cut the plexiglass
well<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.239> took<00:02:09.360> sari<00:02:09.869> I<00:02:10.110> took<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.709> cover<00:02:11.130> of<00:02:12.030> the

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
well I took sari I took the cover of the

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.330 
well I took sari I took the cover of the
drive<00:02:12.480> put<00:02:13.080> it<00:02:13.140> on<00:02:13.230> here<00:02:13.410> traced<00:02:13.770> it<00:02:13.980> as<00:02:14.160> you

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
drive put it on here traced it as you

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.860 
drive put it on here traced it as you
can<00:02:14.459> see<00:02:14.580> these<00:02:14.760> are<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:14.940> O's<00:02:15.120> some<00:02:15.720> of<00:02:15.780> the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
can see these are the O's some of the

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.020 
can see these are the O's some of the
other<00:02:15.959> tracings<00:02:16.410> on<00:02:16.530> here<00:02:16.739> I<00:02:16.890> traced<00:02:17.610> this

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
other tracings on here I traced this

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.470 
other tracings on here I traced this
pattern<00:02:18.450> out<00:02:18.599> cut<00:02:19.080> it<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:20.330> sanded<00:02:21.330> those

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
pattern out cut it and sanded those

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.590 
pattern out cut it and sanded those
edges<00:02:21.840> I<00:02:22.080> did<00:02:22.860> little<00:02:23.130> cuts<00:02:23.520> here<00:02:23.880> like<00:02:24.300> just

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
edges I did little cuts here like just

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.300 
edges I did little cuts here like just
all<00:02:24.810> over<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.170> place<00:02:25.200> just<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.980> make<00:02:26.100> sure<00:02:26.190> it

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
all over the place just to make sure it

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.970 
all over the place just to make sure it
fit<00:02:26.520> in<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:27.720> with<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.110> little<00:02:28.290> bit<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.590> force<00:02:28.830> it

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
fit in so with a little bit of force it

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.970 
fit in so with a little bit of force it
fit<00:02:29.190> fit<00:02:29.670> snug<00:02:30.000> within<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.600> drive<00:02:30.980> so

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
fit fit snug within the drive so

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.940 
fit fit snug within the drive so
everything<00:02:32.340> works<00:02:32.550> great<00:02:33.410> I'm<00:02:34.410> pretty<00:02:34.739> happy

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
everything works great I'm pretty happy

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.550 
everything works great I'm pretty happy

with it I'm proud I had a lot of people

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.380 
with it I'm proud I had a lot of people
saying<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.400> couldn't<00:02:38.760> do<00:02:38.880> it<00:02:39.000> but<00:02:39.180> it

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
saying that I couldn't do it but it

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.479 
saying that I couldn't do it but it

works and I will gladly demonstrate that

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.270 
works and I will gladly demonstrate that
free<00:02:41.819> right<00:02:42.120> now<00:02:42.260> let<00:02:43.260> me<00:02:43.319> just<00:02:43.500> adjust<00:02:43.739> the

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
free right now let me just adjust the

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.600 
free right now let me just adjust the
camera<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:44.790> hopefully<00:02:45.450> you<00:02:45.630> can<00:02:45.890> see<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:47.370> head

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
camera so hopefully you can see the head

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.600 
camera so hopefully you can see the head
moving<00:02:48.030> once<00:02:48.269> I<00:02:48.390> plug<00:02:48.630> it<00:02:48.810> in<00:02:48.959> and<00:02:49.260> I<00:02:49.980> can<00:02:50.280> read

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
moving once I plug it in and I can read

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.070 
moving once I plug it in and I can read
and<00:02:50.760> write<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:52.470> drive<00:02:52.799> and<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:54.060> works<00:02:54.690> just

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
and write to the drive and it works just

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.990 
and write to the drive and it works just
wonderfully<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:56.480> I've<00:02:57.480> just<00:02:57.600> got<00:02:58.080> a<00:02:58.110> simple

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
wonderfully so I've just got a simple

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.180 
wonderfully so I've just got a simple
power<00:03:00.000> adapter<00:03:00.540> for<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.959> drive<00:03:01.200> that<00:03:01.920> plugs

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
power adapter for the drive that plugs

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.340 
power adapter for the drive that plugs
into<00:03:02.400> any<00:03:02.519> wall<00:03:02.850> outlet<00:03:02.989> just<00:03:03.989> plug<00:03:04.170> it<00:03:04.260> in

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
into any wall outlet just plug it in

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.069 
into any wall outlet just plug it in
here<00:03:04.709> and<00:03:05.239> plug<00:03:06.239> this<00:03:06.480> in<00:03:06.720> here<00:03:06.989> and<00:03:07.500> you<00:03:09.079> can

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
here and plug this in here and you can

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.560 
here and plug this in here and you can
see<00:03:10.290> it'll<00:03:10.500> spin<00:03:10.920> up<00:03:11.070> and<00:03:11.340> it'll<00:03:11.970> initialize

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
see it'll spin up and it'll initialize

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.259 
see it'll spin up and it'll initialize
the<00:03:12.780> head<00:03:12.959> and<00:03:13.489> there<00:03:14.489> you<00:03:14.579> go

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
the head and there you go

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.630 
the head and there you go
I<00:03:15.329> can<00:03:15.959> plug<00:03:16.140> it<00:03:16.260> in<00:03:16.380> but<00:03:16.650> I'm<00:03:17.100> not<00:03:17.190> going<00:03:17.459> to

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
I can plug it in but I'm not going to

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.810 
I can plug it in but I'm not going to
for<00:03:17.880> this<00:03:18.000> demonstration<00:03:18.859> but<00:03:19.859> it<00:03:20.310> does<00:03:20.579> work

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
for this demonstration but it does work

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.030 
for this demonstration but it does work
I<00:03:21.329> managed<00:03:21.959> to<00:03:22.019> keep<00:03:22.170> all<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.440> dust<00:03:22.620> out<00:03:22.799> of<00:03:22.829> it

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
I managed to keep all the dust out of it

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.520 
I managed to keep all the dust out of it
for<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.370> most<00:03:23.579> part<00:03:23.820> I<00:03:24.030> used<00:03:24.600> this<00:03:24.989> little<00:03:25.170> tan

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
for the most part I used this little tan

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.780 
for the most part I used this little tan
of<00:03:25.769> duster<00:03:26.730> from<00:03:27.000> Ace<00:03:27.359> Hardware<00:03:28.220> it's<00:03:29.220> just

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.789 
of duster from Ace Hardware it's just
quick<00:03:30.120> simple<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:31.200> know<00:03:31.320> you<00:03:31.560> could<00:03:31.680> buy

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
quick simple you know you could buy

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:33.259 
quick simple you know you could buy
these<00:03:31.859> pretty<00:03:32.370> much<00:03:32.489> any<00:03:32.640> computer<00:03:33.060> hardware

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
these pretty much any computer hardware

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.930 
these pretty much any computer hardware
store<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:34.709> removes<00:03:35.190> all<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.489> dust<00:03:35.820> and

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940
