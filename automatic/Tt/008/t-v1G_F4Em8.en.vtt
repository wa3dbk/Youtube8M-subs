there you go until the pull it out use
two<00:02:30.620> hands<00:02:31.150> until<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.329> mayor<00:02:32.540> is<00:02:32.659> completely

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
two hands until the mayor is completely

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.610 
two hands until the mayor is completely
out<00:02:34.299> okay<00:02:35.299> when<00:02:35.720> I<00:02:35.750> don't<00:02:36.019> remove<00:02:36.230> that<00:02:36.439> and

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
out okay when I don't remove that and

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.729 
out okay when I don't remove that and
this<00:02:36.739> is<00:02:36.829> how<00:02:36.980> it<00:02:37.129> looks<00:02:37.280> from<00:02:37.519> the<00:02:37.579> side<00:02:38.739> as

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
this is how it looks from the side as

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.670 
this is how it looks from the side as
you<00:02:40.099> can<00:02:40.280> see<00:02:40.519> right<00:02:40.700> here<00:02:41.409> these<00:02:42.409> are<00:02:42.470> the

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
you can see right here these are the

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.679 
you can see right here these are the
where<00:02:43.099> the<00:02:43.220> two<00:02:43.400> millimeters<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.480> ten

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:44.689 
where the two millimeters the ten

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:47.110 
where the two millimeters the ten
millimeter<00:02:45.049> bolts<00:02:45.260> are<00:02:45.439> holding<00:02:45.709> it<00:02:46.120> right

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
millimeter bolts are holding it right

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.780 
millimeter bolts are holding it right
here<00:02:47.389> and<00:02:47.690> again<00:02:48.470> this<00:02:48.799> particular<00:02:49.310> model<00:02:49.549> is

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
here and again this particular model is

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.289 
here and again this particular model is
a<00:02:49.849> 2004<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:51.049> I<00:02:51.590> believe<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.299> connections

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
a 2004 and I believe the connections

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:58.539 
a 2004 and I believe the connections
connections<00:02:53.989> have<00:02:54.349> changed<00:02:55.329> on<00:02:56.329> the<00:02:57.549> older

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
connections have changed on the older

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.470 
connections have changed on the older
models<00:02:59.650> it's<00:03:00.650> actually<00:03:01.220> a<00:03:01.250> cable<00:03:01.760> so<00:03:02.120> again<00:03:02.299> be

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
models it's actually a cable so again be

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.750 
models it's actually a cable so again be
careful<00:03:02.689> when<00:03:02.989> you<00:03:03.049> pull<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.409> out<00:03:03.500> here<00:03:03.920> when

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
careful when you pull it out here when

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.440 
careful when you pull it out here when
you're<00:03:04.879> trying<00:03:05.090> to<00:03:05.680> yank<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:07.310> subway<00:03:08.239> mirror

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
you're trying to yank the subway mirror

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.710 
you're trying to yank the subway mirror
out<00:03:08.629> because<00:03:08.900> if<00:03:09.079> you<00:03:09.170> do<00:03:09.349> it<00:03:09.470> by<00:03:09.650> too<00:03:10.489> hard<00:03:10.760> you

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
out because if you do it by too hard you

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.179 
out because if you do it by too hard you
might<00:03:11.840> break<00:03:12.109> these<00:03:12.319> connections<00:03:12.829> right<00:03:12.980> here

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:13.189 
might break these connections right here

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:16.569 
might break these connections right here
okay<00:03:14.090> so<00:03:14.569> again<00:03:14.980> that's<00:03:15.980> how<00:03:16.099> you<00:03:16.220> remove<00:03:16.430> a

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
okay so again that's how you remove a

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.159 
okay so again that's how you remove a
stab<00:03:16.819> Damir<00:03:17.290> same<00:03:18.290> process<00:03:19.480> applies<00:03:20.480> to<00:03:20.930> coupe

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
stab Damir same process applies to coupe

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:24.699 
stab Damir same process applies to coupe
models<00:03:21.560> u46<00:03:22.370> models<00:03:22.819> okay<00:03:23.720> so<00:03:24.319> there<00:03:24.470> you<00:03:24.530> go

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
models u46 models okay so there you go

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.530 
models u46 models okay so there you go
