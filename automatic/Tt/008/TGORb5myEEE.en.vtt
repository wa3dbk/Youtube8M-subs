00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
of stuff that seems to work in rain but

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.420 
of stuff that seems to work in rain but
strangely<00:00:16.650> enough<00:00:16.859> he<00:00:16.920> doesn't<00:00:17.100> have<00:00:17.400> a

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
strangely enough he doesn't have a

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.010 
strangely enough he doesn't have a
politoed<00:00:18.000> with<00:00:18.210> him<00:00:18.359> you<00:00:18.660> know<00:00:18.720> he's<00:00:18.840> got<00:00:18.869> the

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
politoed with him you know he's got the

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.410 
politoed with him you know he's got the
garrison<00:00:19.619> jirachi<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.310> tornadoes<00:00:21.060> all<00:00:21.210> three

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
garrison jirachi and tornadoes all three

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.910 
garrison jirachi and tornadoes all three
of<00:00:21.449> which<00:00:21.900> seem<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.199> feel<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.650> arranging

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
of which seem to feel and arranging

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.920 
of which seem to feel and arranging
perfectly<00:00:23.310> but<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.670> guess<00:00:24.000> he<00:00:24.150> just<00:00:24.180> expects

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
perfectly but I guess he just expects

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.480 
perfectly but I guess he just expects
raining<00:00:25.230> all<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.439> time<00:00:25.500> therefore<00:00:26.220> it<00:00:26.310> works

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
raining all the time therefore it works

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.580 
raining all the time therefore it works
out<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:26.760> him<00:00:26.880> pretty<00:00:27.119> well<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:28.500> know

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
out of him pretty well so you know

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.230 
out of him pretty well so you know
adding<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.070> he<00:00:29.310> has<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.460> virizion<00:00:29.880> and

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
adding to that he has a virizion and

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.490 
adding to that he has a virizion and
this<00:00:30.480> version<00:00:30.720> see<00:00:30.779> on<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:30.990> going<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.170> lead<00:00:31.349> off

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
this version see on is going to lead off

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.840 
this version see on is going to lead off
against<00:00:31.859> my<00:00:32.009> azumarill<00:00:32.369> threaten<00:00:32.759> me

against my azumarill threaten me
straightaway<00:00:33.180> don't<00:00:33.719> want<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.899> behave<00:00:33.989> taking

straightaway don't want to behave taking
a<00:00:34.649> Giga<00:00:34.860> Drain<00:00:34.980> time<00:00:35.160> when<00:00:35.250> we<00:00:35.309> go<00:00:35.399> straight

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
a Giga Drain time when we go straight

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.030 
a Giga Drain time when we go straight
out<00:00:35.730> into<00:00:35.940> my<00:00:36.090> tornadus<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:37.050> resist<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.800> nicely

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
out into my tornadus to resist it nicely

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.740 
out into my tornadus to resist it nicely
hopefully<00:00:38.520> not<00:00:38.670> take<00:00:38.820> too<00:00:38.910> much<00:00:39.059> damage<00:00:39.120> I'd

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
hopefully not take too much damage I'd

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
hopefully not take too much damage I'd
be<00:00:40.020> able<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.170> threaten<00:00:40.410> him<00:00:40.559> out<00:00:40.620> with<00:00:40.739> a

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
be able to threaten him out with a

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.810 
be able to threaten him out with a
hurricane<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.340> following<00:00:41.640> turn

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
hurricane on the following turn

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.569 
hurricane on the following turn
obviously<00:00:42.239> gonna<00:00:42.390> be<00:00:42.450> faster<00:00:42.899> than<00:00:42.930> him<00:00:43.050> and

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
obviously gonna be faster than him and

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.830 
obviously gonna be faster than him and
super<00:00:44.579> effective<00:00:44.820> times<00:00:45.180> for<00:00:45.420> move<00:00:45.629> is

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
super effective times for move is

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.779 
super effective times for move is
definitely<00:00:46.410> where<00:00:46.559> things<00:00:47.190> are<00:00:47.340> at<00:00:47.489> for<00:00:47.700> me

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
definitely where things are at for me

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.639 
definitely where things are at for me
right<00:00:47.940> now<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.329> I'm<00:00:48.420> not<00:00:48.570> going<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.780> be<00:00:49.559> around

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
right now so I'm not going to be around

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:50.810 
right now so I'm not going to be around
the<00:00:49.890> bush<00:00:50.070> when<00:00:50.280> we<00:00:50.340> go<00:00:50.430> straight<00:00:50.610> for<00:00:50.760> the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
the bush when we go straight for the

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.700 
the bush when we go straight for the
hurricane<00:00:51.239> he<00:00:51.780> has<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.899> nice<00:00:52.050> resistance<00:00:52.530> with

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
hurricane he has a nice resistance with

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.979 
hurricane he has a nice resistance with
it<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.370> jirachi<00:00:54.000> he's<00:00:54.539> going<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.719> go<00:00:54.809> straight

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
it to jirachi he's going to go straight

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.630 
it to jirachi he's going to go straight
out<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.469> not<00:00:55.770> going<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.949> turn<00:00:56.219> out<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.550> it

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
out to it not going to turn out to it

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.950 
out to it not going to turn out to it
because<00:00:56.879> obviously<00:00:56.969> can't<00:00:57.270> you<00:00:57.449> turn<00:00:57.600> out<00:00:57.809> to

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
because obviously can't you turn out to

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.569 
because obviously can't you turn out to
a<00:00:57.989> rachi<00:00:58.260> if<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.829> don't<00:00:59.010> have<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.340> turn

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
virizion so unfortunately gonna go

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.990 
virizion so unfortunately gonna go
straight<00:01:01.680> into<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:02.010> but<00:01:02.190> confusion<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.850> going

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
straight into it but confusion is going

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.119 
straight into it but confusion is going
to<00:01:03.059> strike<00:01:03.270> him<00:01:03.570> strike<00:01:04.140> him<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.589> his<00:01:04.799> prime

to strike him strike him in his prime

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.010 
to strike him strike him in his prime
and<00:01:05.309> it's<00:01:06.060> actually<00:01:06.360> going<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.570> cause<00:01:06.840> him<00:01:06.930> a

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
that it may be tornadus an azumarill can

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.160 
that it may be tornadus an azumarill can
do<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.250> bit<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.430> work<00:01:14.880> going<00:01:15.330> on<00:01:15.450> first<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.080> all<00:01:16.110> I

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
virizion birth soon as that's gone you

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.539 
virizion birth soon as that's gone you
know<00:01:18.930> pretty<00:01:19.380> much<00:01:19.500> tear<00:01:19.770> apart<00:01:19.860> things<00:01:20.310> with

all that good stuff so swishing politoed
here's<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.590> pelvic<00:01:25.890> infusion<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.640> works<00:01:27.360> do<00:01:27.450> i

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
here's a pelvic infusion so works do i

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.330 
here's a pelvic infusion so works do i
benefit<00:01:27.869> because<00:01:28.020> well<00:01:28.680> i<00:01:28.710> don't<00:01:29.009> really<00:01:29.159> get

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
benefit because well i don't really get

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.609 
benefit because well i don't really get
to<00:01:29.490> see<00:01:29.729> what<00:01:30.119> kind<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.450> jirachi<00:01:30.720> he<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.110> but

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
to see what kind of jirachi he is but

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.690 
to see what kind of jirachi he is but
the<00:01:31.770> good<00:01:31.799> thing<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.100> that<00:01:32.250> he<00:01:32.460> hurts<00:01:32.579> himself

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
the good thing is that he hurts himself

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.819 
the good thing is that he hurts himself
twice<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.720> never<00:01:33.900> actually<00:01:34.110> find<00:01:34.409> out<00:01:34.619> what

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
twice and I never actually find out what

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.440 
twice and I never actually find out what
jirachi<00:01:35.130> said<00:01:35.400> he<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.640> because<00:01:36.150> I'm<00:01:36.240> gonna<00:01:36.329> go

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
jirachi said he is because I'm gonna go

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.340 
jirachi said he is because I'm gonna go
for<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.860> hydro<00:01:37.860> pump<00:01:38.009> which<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> specs<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.990> the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
for a hydro pump which is a specs in the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.249 
for a hydro pump which is a specs in the
rain<00:01:40.850> yeah<00:01:41.850> that's<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.390> dead<00:01:42.810> rush<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.110> don't

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
rain yeah that's a dead rush I don't

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.539 
rain yeah that's a dead rush I don't
really<00:01:43.350> care<00:01:43.560> if<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:43.890> specially<00:01:44.159> offensive

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
really care if it's specially offensive

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.249 
really care if it's specially offensive
I<00:01:44.700> already<00:01:44.970> had<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.180> lot<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.329> HP<00:01:45.570> taken<00:01:45.899> off<00:01:46.020> so

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
I already had a lot of HP taken off so

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.810 
I already had a lot of HP taken off so
it<00:01:46.470> was<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:47.130> know<00:01:47.159> it's<00:01:47.369> pretty<00:01:47.520> much<00:01:47.610> going

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
it was you know it's pretty much going

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.300 
it was you know it's pretty much going
down<00:01:48.030> anyway<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:49.350> at<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.710> point<00:01:49.920> he<00:01:50.070> decides

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
down anyway so at this point he decides

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.010 
down anyway so at this point he decides
to<00:01:50.399> go<00:01:50.490> into<00:01:50.610> virizion<00:01:51.060> now<00:01:51.270> what<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.840> did

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
to go into virizion now what I did

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.620 
to go into virizion now what I did
previously<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:52.950> went<00:01:53.159> into<00:01:53.369> my<00:01:53.790> tornadus<00:01:54.240> so

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
previously is I went into my tornadus so

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.999 
previously is I went into my tornadus so
this<00:01:54.899> point<00:01:55.140> I'm<00:01:55.290> thinking<00:01:55.439> he's<00:01:55.740> going<00:01:55.920> to

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
this point I'm thinking he's going to

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.069 
this point I'm thinking he's going to
predict<00:01:56.399> me<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.670> go<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.850> tornadoes<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.780> instead

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
predict me to go to tornadoes so instead

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.389 
predict me to go to tornadoes so instead
of<00:01:58.140> doing<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.619> I'm<00:01:58.920> gonna<00:01:59.100> go<00:01:59.250> into

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
of doing that I'm gonna go into

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.280 
of doing that I'm gonna go into
tyranitar<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.240> he's<00:02:00.420> most<00:02:00.659> likely<00:02:00.750> not<00:02:01.079> going

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
tyranitar is he's most likely not going

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.600 
tyranitar is he's most likely not going
to<00:02:01.500> go<00:02:01.590> for<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.770> giga<00:02:01.979> drain<00:02:02.100> you're<00:02:02.520> gonna

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
to go for the giga drain you're gonna

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.130 
to go for the giga drain you're gonna
predict<00:02:03.060> me<00:02:03.210> to<00:02:03.299> go<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.479> tornadoes<00:02:03.960> and

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
predict me to go to tornadoes and

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.300 
predict me to go to tornadoes and
therefore<00:02:04.500> good<00:02:04.619> for<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:04.799> stone<00:02:04.979> age<00:02:05.130> instead

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
therefore good for the stone age instead

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.850 
therefore good for the stone age instead
works<00:02:05.969> out<00:02:06.210> perfectly<00:02:06.899> because<00:02:07.140> I'm<00:02:07.590> able<00:02:07.770> to

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
works out perfectly because I'm able to

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.919 
works out perfectly because I'm able to
go<00:02:07.950> into<00:02:08.069> tita<00:02:08.429> find<00:02:08.910> out<00:02:09.090> with<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.450> sandstorm

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
go into tita find out with the sandstorm

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.540 
go into tita find out with the sandstorm

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
towers that he's a leftovers virizion

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.040 
towers that he's a leftovers virizion
meaning<00:02:11.910> that<00:02:11.970> he<00:02:12.030> can<00:02:12.300> switch<00:02:12.540> up<00:02:12.690> his<00:02:12.810> moves

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
now have tornados against for easy on

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.530 
now have tornados against for easy on
and<00:02:40.380> look<00:02:41.069> like<00:02:41.190> a<00:02:41.250> good<00:02:41.459> situations<00:02:41.940> looking

these not too bad at all hit the electro
says<00:02:57.630> it<00:02:57.750> comes<00:02:57.930> in<00:02:58.080> and<00:02:58.200> of<00:02:58.260> course<00:02:58.290> it

says it comes in and of course it
resisted<00:02:59.040> nicely<00:02:59.400> see<00:02:59.880> left<00:03:00.150> over<00:03:00.450> so<00:03:00.630> looking

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
resisted nicely see left over so looking

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.570 
resisted nicely see left over so looking
like<00:03:01.290> a<00:03:01.319> bit<00:03:01.530> more<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.709> a<00:03:01.800> bulky<00:03:02.130> one<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:02.430> you

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
like a bit more of a bulky one and you

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.740 
like a bit more of a bulky one and you
know<00:03:02.670> judging<00:03:02.970> by<00:03:03.060> how<00:03:03.180> well<00:03:03.300> it<00:03:03.450> took<00:03:03.569> it

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
know judging by how well it took it

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.290 
know judging by how well it took it
seems<00:03:04.200> like<00:03:04.410> that<00:03:04.680> is<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.220> case<00:03:05.430> so<00:03:05.760> he's

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
seems like that is the case so he's

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.400 
seems like that is the case so he's
gonna<00:03:06.720> be<00:03:06.840> able<00:03:06.900> to<00:03:07.019> take<00:03:07.110> it<00:03:07.260> nicely

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
gonna be able to take it nicely

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.750 
gonna be able to take it nicely
obviously<00:03:07.800> I'm<00:03:07.920> gonna<00:03:08.130> switch<00:03:08.280> into<00:03:08.459> tyrant

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
obviously I'm gonna switch into tyrant

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.370 
obviously I'm gonna switch into tyrant
are<00:03:08.910> thinking<00:03:09.239> you<00:03:09.630> know<00:03:09.690> if<00:03:09.810> I<00:03:09.900> thunder<00:03:10.290> wave

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380

him maybe fling an iron ball I don't

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.820 
him maybe fling an iron ball I don't
know<00:03:12.690> what<00:03:12.810> I'm<00:03:12.870> gonna<00:03:12.989> do<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.230> him<00:03:13.440> but<00:03:13.769> I'm

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
know what I'm gonna do to him but I'm

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.220 
know what I'm gonna do to him but I'm
just<00:03:13.980> gonna<00:03:14.100> try<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:14.610> just<00:03:14.850> shut<00:03:15.600> him<00:03:15.720> down<00:03:15.750> as

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
just gonna try and just shut him down as

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.100 
just gonna try and just shut him down as
much<00:03:16.350> as<00:03:16.440> I<00:03:16.500> can<00:03:16.560> he<00:03:17.549> is<00:03:17.640> a<00:03:17.670> coil<00:03:17.970> set<00:03:18.239> so<00:03:18.540> being

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
much as I can he is a coil set so being

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.319 
much as I can he is a coil set so being
standing<00:03:19.440> up<00:03:19.590> like<00:03:19.799> that<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.100> having<00:03:20.940> thunder

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
standing up like that and having thunder

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.180 
standing up like that and having thunder
wave<00:03:21.480> on<00:03:21.720> him<00:03:21.989> is<00:03:22.170> going<00:03:22.350> to<00:03:22.410> be<00:03:22.560> definitely

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
wave on him is going to be definitely

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.530 
wave on him is going to be definitely
beneficial<00:03:23.489> for<00:03:23.760> me<00:03:23.790> because<00:03:24.060> it<00:03:24.239> means<00:03:24.360> he's

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
beneficial for me because it means he's

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.759 
beneficial for me because it means he's
not<00:03:24.660> going<00:03:24.780> to<00:03:24.810> be<00:03:24.900> able<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:25.170> be<00:03:25.320> as<00:03:25.470> reliable

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
not going to be able to be as reliable

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.069 
not going to be able to be as reliable
as<00:03:26.070> usually<00:03:26.760> would<00:03:26.940> do<00:03:27.150> without<00:03:27.570> any<00:03:27.840> kind<00:03:27.989> of

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
as usually would do without any kind of

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.930 
as usually would do without any kind of
status<00:03:28.320> condition<00:03:28.860> so<00:03:29.070> works<00:03:29.610> out<00:03:29.730> nicely

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
status condition so works out nicely

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.340 
status condition so works out nicely
good<00:03:30.180> for<00:03:30.329> the<00:03:30.390> thunder<00:03:30.540> wave<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:30.810> he's

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
good for the thunder wave and he's

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.509 
good for the thunder wave and he's
actually<00:03:31.470> gonna<00:03:31.650> hit<00:03:31.829> me<00:03:31.860> with<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.100> dragon<00:03:32.250> tail

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
actually gonna hit me with a dragon tail

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.039 
actually gonna hit me with a dragon tail
so<00:03:32.640> it's<00:03:32.730> gonna<00:03:32.820> knock<00:03:33.060> me<00:03:33.239> straight<00:03:33.480> out<00:03:33.570> go

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
so it's gonna knock me straight out go

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.080 
so it's gonna knock me straight out go
into<00:03:34.410> my<00:03:34.709> I<00:03:34.739> believe<00:03:35.130> my<00:03:35.280> landris<00:03:35.760> is<00:03:35.880> what<00:03:36.030> he

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
into my I believe my landris is what he

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.449 
into my I believe my landris is what he
knocked<00:03:36.269> me<00:03:36.390> into<00:03:36.570> and<00:03:36.920> this<00:03:37.920> point<00:03:38.190> I<00:03:38.340> have<00:03:38.370> a

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
knocked me into and this point I have a

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.220 
knocked me into and this point I have a
scarf<00:03:38.760> landorus<00:03:39.239> so<00:03:39.450> I'm<00:03:39.660> not<00:03:39.810> really<00:03:39.870> too

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
scarf landorus so I'm not really too

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.900 
scarf landorus so I'm not really too
troubled<00:03:40.590> by<00:03:40.739> it<00:03:40.769> I<00:03:41.010> can't<00:03:41.400> go<00:03:41.519> for<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:41.700> stab

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
troubled by it I can't go for the stab

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.190 
troubled by it I can't go for the stab
earthquake<00:03:42.420> obviously<00:03:42.780> because<00:03:43.049> this

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
earthquake obviously because this

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.440 
earthquake obviously because this
electrode<00:03:43.680> has<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:44.609> levitate<00:03:45.150> so<00:03:45.269> it's<00:03:45.390> not

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
electrode has the levitate so it's not

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.270 
electrode has the levitate so it's not
gonna<00:03:45.570> be<00:03:45.690> able<00:03:45.750> to<00:03:45.989> be<00:03:46.170> affected<00:03:46.500> by<00:03:46.590> so<00:03:46.859> my

gonna be able to be affected by so my

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.069 
gonna be able to be affected by so my
best<00:03:47.489> next<00:03:47.790> option<00:03:48.150> might<00:03:48.299> Baxter<00:03:48.750> my<00:03:48.870> neck

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079

the ice punch and clean tornadoes out
which<00:04:48.400> is<00:04:48.430> a<00:04:48.580> huge<00:04:48.999> throughout<00:04:49.330> the<00:04:49.479> way

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:49.599 
which is a huge throughout the way

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:52.140 
which is a huge throughout the way
because<00:04:49.810> you<00:04:50.650> know<00:04:50.740> now<00:04:51.099> that<00:04:51.129> I<00:04:51.370> am<00:04:51.849> able<00:04:51.969> to

because you know now that I am able to

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.450 
because you know now that I am able to
get<00:04:52.300> my<00:04:52.449> rain<00:04:52.719> up<00:04:52.900> if<00:04:53.020> I<00:04:53.139> want<00:04:53.379> to<00:04:53.439> I'll<00:04:54.219> be<00:04:54.430> able

get my rain up if I want to I'll be able

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.550 
get my rain up if I want to I'll be able
to<00:04:54.849> abuse<00:04:55.300> my<00:04:55.509> tornadus<00:04:55.900> without<00:04:56.199> having<00:04:56.469> to

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
to abuse my tornadus without having to

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.490 
to abuse my tornadus without having to
worry<00:04:56.740> about<00:04:56.800> his<00:04:57.189> so<00:04:57.520> that's<00:04:57.729> pretty<00:04:57.909> perfect

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
worry about his so that's pretty perfect

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.230 
worry about his so that's pretty perfect
he<00:04:59.500> goes<00:04:59.620> into<00:04:59.800> rizzi<00:05:00.039> on<00:05:00.159> I<00:05:00.340> don't<00:05:00.789> really

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
he goes into rizzi on I don't really

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.640 
he goes into rizzi on I don't really
want<00:05:01.419> to<00:05:01.509> risk<00:05:01.659> prediction<00:05:01.990> at<00:05:02.319> this<00:05:02.409> point

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
want to risk prediction at this point

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.499 
want to risk prediction at this point
because<00:05:02.770> I<00:05:03.129> know<00:05:03.340> that<00:05:03.759> he<00:05:03.879> has<00:05:03.969> lefties<00:05:04.389> and

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:04.509 
because I know that he has lefties and

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:06.029 
because I know that he has lefties and
therefore<00:05:04.779> he<00:05:04.870> can<00:05:04.990> kind<00:05:05.229> of<00:05:05.469> choose<00:05:05.800> whatever

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 
therefore he can kind of choose whatever

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.709 
therefore he can kind of choose whatever
movie<00:05:06.400> wants<00:05:06.580> to<00:05:06.639> go<00:05:06.759> for<00:05:07.000> I<00:05:07.180> was<00:05:07.479> maybe

00:05:07.709 --> 00:05:07.719 
movie wants to go for I was maybe

movie wants to go for I was maybe
banking<00:05:08.229> on<00:05:08.289> the<00:05:08.379> fact<00:05:08.409> it<00:05:08.650> over<00:05:08.889> predict<00:05:09.159> a

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:09.219 
banking on the fact it over predict a

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:11.459 
banking on the fact it over predict a
little<00:05:09.460> bit<00:05:09.610> but<00:05:10.150> I<00:05:10.360> didn't<00:05:10.719> necessarily<00:05:10.840> need

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:11.469 
little bit but I didn't necessarily need

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:12.869 
little bit but I didn't necessarily need
a<00:05:11.529> zoo<00:05:11.770> Merle<00:05:12.009> for<00:05:12.159> the<00:05:12.219> rest<00:05:12.400> of<00:05:12.430> the<00:05:12.520> game<00:05:12.699> so

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:12.879 
a zoo Merle for the rest of the game so

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:13.920 
a zoo Merle for the rest of the game so
I<00:05:12.939> thought<00:05:13.150> I<00:05:13.210> just<00:05:13.449> might<00:05:13.539> as<00:05:13.629> well<00:05:13.750> let<00:05:13.900> it

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
I thought I just might as well let it

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.129 
I thought I just might as well let it
die<00:05:14.199> and<00:05:14.729> get<00:05:15.729> myself<00:05:15.849> a<00:05:16.090> free<00:05:16.240> switch<00:05:16.599> into

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139 
die and get myself a free switch into

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:18.629 
die and get myself a free switch into
tornadoes<00:05:17.589> now<00:05:17.740> which<00:05:17.919> I<00:05:17.979> can<00:05:18.129> now<00:05:18.159> threatened

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
tornadoes now which I can now threatened

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.550 
tornadoes now which I can now threatened
with<00:05:18.939> the<00:05:19.029> hurricane<00:05:19.360> was<00:05:19.659> what<00:05:20.050> I<00:05:20.080> do<00:05:20.199> I

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
with the hurricane was what I do I

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.230 
with the hurricane was what I do I
actually<00:05:21.009> still<00:05:21.370> don't<00:05:21.580> have<00:05:21.729> rain<00:05:21.939> up<00:05:22.120> I

actually still don't have rain up I

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.939 
actually still don't have rain up I
believe<00:05:22.539> sand<00:05:22.930> is<00:05:23.229> actually<00:05:23.349> up<00:05:23.710> at<00:05:23.860> the

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:23.949 
believe sand is actually up at the

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.219 
believe sand is actually up at the
moment<00:05:24.069> so<00:05:24.370> hurricanes<00:05:25.240> hitting<00:05:25.659> through

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
moment so hurricanes hitting through

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:27.929 
moment so hurricanes hitting through
sand<00:05:26.499> I'm<00:05:26.949> not<00:05:27.129> sure<00:05:27.310> if<00:05:27.430> sound<00:05:27.639> actually

00:05:27.929 --> 00:05:27.939 
sand I'm not sure if sound actually

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:29.850 
sand I'm not sure if sound actually
reduces<00:05:28.419> hurricanes<00:05:28.810> accuracy<00:05:29.139> or<00:05:29.319> if<00:05:29.620> that's

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
reduces hurricanes accuracy or if that's

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.309 
reduces hurricanes accuracy or if that's
something<00:05:30.069> to<00:05:30.250> do<00:05:30.400> with<00:05:30.610> Sun<00:05:31.089> or<00:05:31.449> I<00:05:31.689> honestly

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:32.319 
something to do with Sun or I honestly

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:34.649 
something to do with Sun or I honestly
don't<00:05:32.529> know<00:05:32.650> how<00:05:32.800> things<00:05:33.610> work<00:05:33.879> with<00:05:34.180> thunder

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:34.659 
don't know how things work with thunder

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:37.260 
don't know how things work with thunder
and<00:05:34.839> hurricane<00:05:35.560> when<00:05:36.219> it<00:05:36.310> comes<00:05:36.490> to<00:05:36.759> weather

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
and hurricane when it comes to weather

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.719 
and hurricane when it comes to weather
like<00:05:37.629> if<00:05:37.779> in<00:05:37.930> Sun<00:05:38.199> its<00:05:38.469> low<00:05:38.770> accuracy<00:05:39.129> or<00:05:39.370> if<00:05:39.610> in

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:39.729 
like if in Sun its low accuracy or if in

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:42.420 
like if in Sun its low accuracy or if in
Santa<00:05:40.060> slower<00:05:40.240> accuracy<00:05:40.659> but<00:05:41.199> honestly<00:05:41.800> all<00:05:42.339> i

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
Santa slower accuracy but honestly all i

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.219 
Santa slower accuracy but honestly all i
care<00:05:42.669> about<00:05:42.699> is<00:05:42.879> hitting<00:05:43.149> a<00:05:43.210> hurricane<00:05:43.599> and<00:05:43.779> so

hurricane<00:06:40.209> an<00:06:40.360> electrician<00:06:40.899> I<00:06:40.959> really<00:06:41.379> don't

00:06:41.609 --> 00:06:41.619 
hurricane an electrician I really don't

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:43.139 
hurricane an electrician I really don't
understand<00:06:42.069> why<00:06:42.279> he<00:06:42.520> didn't<00:06:42.759> bring<00:06:42.969> this

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:43.149 
understand why he didn't bring this

00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:44.999 
understand why he didn't bring this
thing<00:06:43.389> in<00:06:43.509> earlier<00:06:43.899> he<00:06:44.349> knows<00:06:44.559> it<00:06:44.740> can<00:06:44.860> take<00:06:44.949> a

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:45.009 
thing in earlier he knows it can take a

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:47.639 
thing in earlier he knows it can take a
hurricane<00:06:45.520> and<00:06:45.699> though<00:06:46.599> it's<00:06:46.749> paralyzed<00:06:47.229> he

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:47.649 
hurricane and though it's paralyzed he

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:49.290 
hurricane and though it's paralyzed he
still<00:06:47.889> would<00:06:48.069> be<00:06:48.099> able<00:06:48.520> to<00:06:48.610> take<00:06:48.789> tornadoes<00:06:49.179> on

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:49.300 
still would be able to take tornadoes on

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.119 
still would be able to take tornadoes on
pretty<00:06:49.569> well<00:06:49.749> so<00:06:50.020> honestly<00:06:50.709> don't<00:06:50.919> know<00:06:50.949> why

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:51.129 
pretty well so honestly don't know why

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:53.040 
pretty well so honestly don't know why
he<00:06:51.279> left<00:06:51.459> this<00:06:51.639> thing<00:06:51.819> to<00:06:51.939> last<00:06:52.119> but<00:06:52.659> I<00:06:52.839> can

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050 
he left this thing to last but I can

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.049
