00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.650
 how I got used to a conspiracy 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.070
 of the approach of an asteroid could 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.869
 be valid in a short time in which 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.410
 has made the last ones very popular 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.920
 months especially when it is said that a 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.650
 great asteroid would pass very close or that 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.920
 in fact it will even impact the 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:47.039
 land in September this year 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.769
 but what's true with this is nothing 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.289
 more an invention of people to call 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:55.530
 attention and to alarm the 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.839
 population or really a space rock 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.109
 is about to collide with our 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:00.109
 planet 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.710
 the nasa has assured that there is no 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.500
 eventual collision of an asteroid with 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.640
 our planet at least 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.060
 next 100 years 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.260
 the constant contradictions on the part 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.170
 of the scientists of the agency 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.810
 American spacecraft have made 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:27.369
 some experts discovered that the 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:31.540
 asteroid 200 meters wide 2012 75 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:34.960
 will approach the earth between 22 and 28 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.259
 of September coinciding with the 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.810
 predictions of many current prophets 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:44.229
 among them efraín rodríguez and ricardo 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:47.680
 salazar although salazar warns that this 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:50.080
 asteroid will not reach its purpose and 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.240
 will not impact the earth because according to him 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.990
 the space rock that will arrive in 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.240
 September will be torn down or destroyed already 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.539
 either naturally or by intervention 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.470
 human with a Russian missile that destroys 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.830
 the space threat 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:10.369
 some asteroids are expected to pass 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.290
 near the earth between the 22nd and 28th of 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.829
 September 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:19.700
 the conspiracy theorists 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:21.950
 agree that the asteroid 2012 75 is 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.700
 the best candidate to meet the 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.700
 worst of the scenarios 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.020
 you just have to imagine the damage that 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.780
 would cause if a 200-meter asteroid 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.790
 collide with the earth 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.810
 at a speed of 20 kilometers per 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:43.530
 second would unleash an explosion of 4000 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.560
 megatones would immediately form a 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.470
 4 kilometer crater full of rock 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.410
 melted while on it it 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.020
 generate a fireball thereof 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:59.250
 size that would cause fires in a 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:02.020
 radius of 40 to 60 kilometers 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.530
 after a few seconds a 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:08.410
 earthquake would completely destroy all 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:12.130
 the buildings within a radius of 20 to 30 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.130
 kilometers where they would come later 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.319
 down most facilities 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:20.240
 that are at a distance of 130 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:23.600
 180 km 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.490
 for some theorists of this news the 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.120
 nasa assessment on 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:31.100
 possibility that the asteroid 2012 of gt5 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.980
 impact against the ground 24 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.290
 September is incorrect because 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.920
 mainly to that they rely only on 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.770
 calculated odds and events 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.830
 real 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.930
 researchers point to the fact 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:50.320
 that there is an important level of 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:54.070
 uncertainty about the trajectory of 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:57.070
 2012 75 that could challenge the 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:59.650
 expectations the experts 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.950
 in biblical prophecies they assure that the 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:06.070
 asteroid 2012 dt 5 will change from 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:09.960
 address days before 24 of 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:12.570
 September thus achieving its mission 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.820
 although the funny thing is that it coincides with the 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:18.470
 last moon of blood 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:21.200
 which will take effect this September 28 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:23.390
 so I personally think that this 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.760
 is one of the reasons why it has 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.530
 invented this news and it has been done so 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.960
 popular 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.910
 according to the experts there would be no 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.050
 reason for the impact of a 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:39.110
 asteroid becomes effective what is certain is 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.450
 that the objects in space are very 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.510
 unpredictable so neither is 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.160
 discard 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.490
 let's hope it's just news 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:51.400
 invented of people with the single fact 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.420
 of terrorizing humanity that 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.430
 September 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.520
 pass quietly and without any 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.520
 novelty 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:06.680
