our<00:00:20.689> clan<00:00:20.989> leader<00:00:21.259> he<00:00:21.650> had<00:00:21.890> a<00:00:22.480> very<00:00:23.480> good

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
our clan leader he had a very good

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.689 
our clan leader he had a very good
attack<00:00:24.019> against<00:00:24.679> a<00:00:24.800> very<00:00:25.069> strong<00:00:25.400> opponent

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
attack against a very strong opponent

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.099 
attack against a very strong opponent
and<00:00:26.179> it<00:00:26.659> all<00:00:26.779> started<00:00:27.169> with<00:00:27.289> a<00:00:27.349> proper<00:00:27.919> ler

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.109

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.080 
and it all started with a proper ler
okay<00:00:30.109> so<00:00:30.859> it<00:00:30.949> looks<00:00:31.099> like<00:00:31.159> he<00:00:31.310> drops<00:00:31.579> an<00:00:31.729> archer

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
okay so it looks like he drops an archer

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.450 
okay so it looks like he drops an archer
just<00:00:32.509> a<00:00:32.689> you<00:00:33.559> know<00:00:33.649> in<00:00:33.800> range<00:00:34.039> of<00:00:34.190> the<00:00:34.280> clan

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
just a you know in range of the clan

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.680 
just a you know in range of the clan
castle<00:00:34.699> to<00:00:35.329> get<00:00:35.480> him<00:00:35.600> out<00:00:35.750> and<00:00:36.309> then<00:00:37.539> drops<00:00:38.539> an

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
castle to get him out and then drops an

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.959 
castle to get him out and then drops an
archer<00:00:38.989> up<00:00:39.140> top<00:00:39.379> just<00:00:39.769> to<00:00:39.859> draw<00:00:40.370> them<00:00:40.579> up<00:00:40.609> to

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
archer up top just to draw them up to

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:42.610 
archer up top just to draw them up to
where<00:00:41.120> he's<00:00:41.359> going<00:00:41.629> to<00:00:41.719> be<00:00:41.809> attacking<00:00:42.289> from

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
where he's going to be attacking from

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.349 
where he's going to be attacking from
it's<00:00:42.980> very<00:00:43.190> important<00:00:43.609> to<00:00:43.699> do<00:00:43.820> it<00:00:43.940> from<00:00:44.090> where

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:44.359 
it's very important to do it from where

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:45.610 
it's very important to do it from where
they're<00:00:44.570> from<00:00:44.870> where<00:00:45.079> you're<00:00:45.230> going<00:00:45.410> to<00:00:45.530> be

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
they're from where you're going to be

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.650 
they're from where you're going to be
attacking<00:00:45.920> from<00:00:46.339> takes<00:00:47.089> a<00:00:47.179> little<00:00:47.390> bit<00:00:47.480> more

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
attacking from takes a little bit more

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.590 
attacking from takes a little bit more
time<00:00:47.899> but<00:00:48.140> it<00:00:48.739> saves<00:00:49.370> a<00:00:49.489> lot<00:00:49.609> of<00:00:49.730> troops<00:00:52.600> okay

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
time but it saves a lot of troops okay

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.860 
time but it saves a lot of troops okay
so<00:00:54.559> now<00:00:54.710> what<00:00:54.890> he<00:00:54.980> does<00:00:55.239> is<00:00:56.239> he<00:00:56.300> uses<00:00:56.690> a

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
so now what he does is he uses a

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.049 
so now what he does is he uses a
barbarian<00:00:57.530> very<00:00:57.980> effectively<00:00:58.489> a<00:00:58.609> couple<00:00:58.969> of

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
barbarian very effectively a couple of

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.450 
barbarian very effectively a couple of
barbarians<00:00:59.539> to<00:00:59.960> tank<00:01:00.409> the<00:01:00.649> wizards<00:01:00.980> damage

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
barbarians to tank the wizards damage

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.639 
barbarians to tank the wizards damage
and<00:01:01.670> then<00:01:02.480> he<00:01:02.539> drops<00:01:02.780> a<00:01:02.870> couple<00:01:03.019> wizards<00:01:03.499> of

00:01:03.639 --> 00:01:03.649 
and then he drops a couple wizards of

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.800 
and then he drops a couple wizards of
his<00:01:03.739> own<00:01:03.920> and<00:01:04.130> boom<00:01:04.580> they're<00:01:05.000> instantly<00:01:05.600> dead

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
his own and boom they're instantly dead

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.140 
his own and boom they're instantly dead
that<00:01:06.440> could<00:01:06.620> have<00:01:06.710> gone<00:01:06.890> so<00:01:07.340> much<00:01:07.400> worse<00:01:07.790> and

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
that could have gone so much worse and

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.490 
that could have gone so much worse and
see<00:01:08.390> how<00:01:08.570> it<00:01:08.720> just<00:01:08.870> lets<00:01:09.080> him<00:01:09.200> start<00:01:09.470> his

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
see how it just lets him start his

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.770

as a as kind of a meat shield and then

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.160 
as a as kind of a meat shield and then
you<00:01:55.490> use<00:01:55.670> wizards<00:01:56.090> just<00:01:56.390> to<00:01:56.510> do<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.780> damage

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
you use wizards just to do the damage

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.840 
you use wizards just to do the damage
you<00:01:57.590> didn't<00:01:57.830> do<00:01:57.890> it<00:01:57.980> perfectly<00:01:58.370> here<00:01:58.640> but<00:01:58.790> he

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
you didn't do it perfectly here but he

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.270 
you didn't do it perfectly here but he
did<00:01:58.970> really<00:01:59.120> well<00:01:59.410> yeah<00:02:00.410> their<00:02:00.680> barbarian

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
did really well yeah their barbarian

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.060 
did really well yeah their barbarian
just<00:02:01.790> to<00:02:01.880> get<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.150> draw<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.510> fire<00:02:02.960> and<00:02:03.260> then

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
just to get the draw the fire and then

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.980 
just to get the draw the fire and then
see<00:02:04.820> it's<00:02:05.060> going<00:02:05.210> to<00:02:05.270> go<00:02:05.360> for<00:02:05.510> those<00:02:05.600> wizards

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
see it's going to go for those wizards

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.169 
see it's going to go for those wizards
because<00:02:06.290> they're<00:02:06.440> closest<00:02:06.950> but<00:02:07.250> still<00:02:08.000> the

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
because they're closest but still the

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.400 
because they're closest but still the
wizards<00:02:08.539> do<00:02:08.720> a<00:02:08.750> ton<00:02:09.080> of<00:02:09.110> damage

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
wizards do a ton of damage

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.320 
wizards do a ton of damage
and<00:02:10.500> that's<00:02:11.100> how<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.310> take<00:02:11.550> them<00:02:11.730> out<00:02:11.910> it

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
and that's how you take them out it

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.310 
and that's how you take them out it
would<00:02:12.480> have<00:02:12.570> been<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.720> lot<00:02:12.900> better<00:02:13.110> if<00:02:13.230> you

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
would have been a lot better if you

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.690 
would have been a lot better if you
dropped<00:02:13.620> a<00:02:13.710> couple<00:02:14.010> archers<00:02:14.430> right

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
dropped a couple archers right

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.390 
dropped a couple archers right
underneath<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.300> but<00:02:15.810> there<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.410> go<00:02:16.620> so

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
underneath it but there you go so

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.780 
underneath it but there you go so
anyways<00:02:17.880> to<00:02:18.300> recount<00:02:18.840> or<00:02:19.350> to<00:02:19.710> recap<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.310> you

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
anyways to recount or to recap it you

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.220

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
castle and sometimes you need to use a

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.500 
castle and sometimes you need to use a
giant<00:02:24.840> or<00:02:25.050> wallbreakers<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.740> do<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:26.510> but

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
giant or wallbreakers to do that but

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.580 
giant or wallbreakers to do that but
generally<00:02:27.720> you<00:02:28.050> just<00:02:28.110> want<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.470> use<00:02:28.560> a

use of a few barbarians as neat shields
is<00:03:03.690> critical<00:03:04.140> so<00:03:04.440> they<00:03:04.530> don't<00:03:04.740> just<00:03:04.980> blow<00:03:05.220> up

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250

wizards and archers use archers as the
meat<00:03:11.220> shield<00:03:11.520> so<00:03:11.700> you<00:03:11.820> drop<00:03:12.000> like<00:03:12.030> one<00:03:12.480> or<00:03:12.600> two

archers underneath the dragon and then
the<00:03:15.120> wizards<00:03:15.450> around<00:03:15.780> so<00:03:16.020> that<00:03:16.050> they<00:03:16.260> can<00:03:16.470> kill

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
the wizards around so that they can kill

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.490 
the wizards around so that they can kill
