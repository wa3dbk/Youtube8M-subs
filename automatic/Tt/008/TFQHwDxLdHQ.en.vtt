00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.749
 More than 5000 years ago goalkeeper a man who was pointed out for about 45 years 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:18.970
 henin from the italian valleys of the alps 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.119
 how he himself does not tell the weaver at fund more about our past than 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.189
 most of his contemporaries, therefore, not only one of the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.189
 most important prehistoric people 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.210
 it can just be what was not just one season for prehistoric man 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.630
 not only was the temperature pleasant 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.620
 but more food had changed 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.190
 because although they already have farms also quite a large portion of the fund as well 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.190
 from the Betuwe 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.350
 so that our prehistoric european quietly enjoy the summer sun 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.380
 shorten a capricorn meat inspection meal 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.210
 this meal was achieved exactly, we do not know 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.209
 maybe it was ibex meat vs 

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:02.209
 have been the intestines of the year before 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.210
 Paris could be that both were part of a dish such as 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.010
 and the side of the american indians 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.010
 in that case steeman meat was not fresh either 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.570
 he would remain perverted thoughts the man got into a fight with at least four 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.220
 contemporaries thereafter will be injured and eventually die of being 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.650
 injuries 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.770
 after his accident sometimes front yard 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.530
 because it is precisely because of this that we can relatively accurately last 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.410
 Twenty did not describe a man who lived so long ago as his 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.740
 real name has disappeared in history 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.760
 so in its named after its final resting place find the steel 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.270
 Dexia clearly intended to go up the mountain 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.140
 the season also points to the storage room on a planned trip 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.110
 the extensive equipment excludes that in addition to fighting in mountains 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.070
 has fled 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.860
 traveling back and forth is unclear 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.860
 after he got into a fight it is certain 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.840
 the fight initially benefits children 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.780
 blood traces of at least four opponents are found on his 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.349
 surrendering weapons 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.840
 himself was wounded in the fight as well as a deep cut in his hand 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.840
 result 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.840
 when he turns his back to his opponents, he climbs up again 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.939
 are hit by a roadside bomb 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:29.569
 this one was shot from more than thirty meters so there was no you doing 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:30.439
 hear it 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:34.509
 in itself the union is not immediately deadly, it steps down the shaft of the arrows 

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:36.879
 but the tip remains in his body 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.209
 then shrinkage showed fighting 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.119
 higher up the mountain I see for the last time 

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:46.409
 whose menu is from a corner but not accompanied by the meat from 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:47.579
 quite an end 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.579
 but the dog turns out to be stable with that is perhaps thought 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:52.999
 not to frustration 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:56.379
 in the last hours of his life we ​​are busy making new ones 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:57.239
 times 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.409
 climbing a mountain 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:03.139
 until he is twelve 100 meters higher than the point at which twelve hours earlier 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:04.229
 had left 

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:07.229
 exhausted for robberies 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:12.569
 so the story of music is too little better said my wife about 

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:16.130
 the events of the past cannot be achieved 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.399
 it is doomed never to occur 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:21.229
 what a historian does is make a reconstruction 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:23.839
 the reconstruction of which only one thing is certain 

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:25.040
 that it is never correct 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.040
 with historical reality 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:32.959
 anp editorial It is a good example of how modern science still is 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.829
 tells more about a period that used to be a black hole in ours 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.329
 history as 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.299
 mckinnon learn more about the mission all the more 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:41.330
 in that municipality 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.330
 a reconstruction they can arise 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:48.949
 see personally undergo as I died of his injuries 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:51.309
 according to another concern or being 

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:54.399
 my thesis parties acceptable term arable farmer 

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:56.329
 according to other well-being 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.819
 He will have emitted how society is because these are after research 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.399
 or government 

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:03.930
 but there are also claims that he was a respected man 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.309
 given the next eleven years 

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:09.519
 so thesis is one of the most important sources of its time 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.340
 but he tells many conflicting stories
