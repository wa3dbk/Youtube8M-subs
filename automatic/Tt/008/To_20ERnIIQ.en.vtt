00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
actually kind of upset about that

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.319 
actually kind of upset about that
because<00:02:29.920> if<00:02:30.189> you<00:02:30.280> think<00:02:30.310> about<00:02:30.579> it<00:02:30.790> that's

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:31.329

pretty<00:02:31.780> much<00:02:31.989> that's<00:02:32.530> pretty<00:02:32.769> much<00:02:32.889> what

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
pretty much that's pretty much what

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.759 
pretty much that's pretty much what
modern<00:02:33.280> warfare<00:02:33.549> 3<00:02:33.700> is<00:02:34.030> in<00:02:34.209> a<00:02:34.269> way<00:02:34.769> modern

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
modern warfare 3 is in a way modern

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.360 
modern warfare 3 is in a way modern
warfare<00:02:35.859> 3<00:02:36.069> and<00:02:36.370> i<00:02:36.400> believe<00:02:36.670> is<00:02:36.849> based<00:02:37.150> in<00:02:38.370> 2016

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
warfare 3 and i believe is based in 2016

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.399 
warfare 3 and i believe is based in 2016
all<00:02:40.060> right<00:02:40.269> I<00:02:40.299> mean<00:02:40.510> I<00:02:40.659> know<00:02:40.689> it's<00:02:40.989> not<00:02:41.139> really

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:41.409 
all right I mean I know it's not really

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:43.440 
all right I mean I know it's not really
that<00:02:41.560> far<00:02:41.889> off<00:02:41.920> it's<00:02:42.280> not<00:02:42.459> like<00:02:42.609> it's<00:02:42.760> 10<00:02:42.969> to<00:02:43.090> 15

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
that far off it's not like it's 10 to 15

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.629 
that far off it's not like it's 10 to 15
years<00:02:43.750> but<00:02:44.019> overall<00:02:45.010> I<00:02:45.159> don't<00:02:45.370> think<00:02:45.519> there's

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:45.639 
years but overall I don't think there's

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:47.069 
years but overall I don't think there's
going<00:02:45.730> to<00:02:45.819> be<00:02:45.849> much<00:02:46.060> difference<00:02:46.510> you<00:02:46.629> know<00:02:46.689> 10

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
going to be much difference you know 10

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:49.470 
going to be much difference you know 10
to<00:02:47.170> 15<00:02:47.500> years<00:02:47.530> now<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.459> be<00:02:48.609> honest<00:02:48.939> with<00:02:49.060> you<00:02:49.120> I

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
to 15 years now to be honest with you I

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.330 
to 15 years now to be honest with you I
don't<00:02:49.989> think<00:02:50.109> you're<00:02:50.349> Nikki<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.950> whole<00:02:51.099> world

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
don't think you're Nikki the whole world

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.220 
don't think you're Nikki the whole world
is<00:02:51.489> not<00:02:51.609> going<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.819> dramatically<00:02:52.329> change<00:02:52.450> you

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
is not going to dramatically change you

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.740 
is not going to dramatically change you
know<00:02:53.349> it'll<00:02:54.129> be<00:02:54.310> a<00:02:54.430> little<00:02:54.730> different<00:02:55.060> couple

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
know it'll be a little different couple

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.360 
know it'll be a little different couple
different<00:02:56.049> upgrades<00:02:56.139> but<00:02:56.859> that's<00:02:57.040> my<00:02:57.220> only

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
different upgrades but that's my only

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.000 
different upgrades but that's my only
concern<00:02:57.459> is<00:02:57.849> that<00:02:58.120> black<00:02:58.540> ops<00:02:58.810> 2<00:02:59.109> will<00:02:59.799> be

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
concern is that black ops 2 will be

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.449 
concern is that black ops 2 will be
pretty<00:03:00.459> much<00:03:00.549> like<00:03:00.939> a<00:03:01.150> modern<00:03:01.719> warfare<00:03:01.930> 4<00:03:02.459> what

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
pretty much like a modern warfare 4 what

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:04.800 
pretty much like a modern warfare 4 what
would<00:03:03.609> I<00:03:03.700> rather<00:03:03.909> I<00:03:04.090> would<00:03:04.209> actually<00:03:04.659> rather

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
would I rather I would actually rather

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.619 
would I rather I would actually rather
black<00:03:05.169> ops<00:03:05.439> 2<00:03:05.709> to<00:03:05.950> be<00:03:06.069> based<00:03:06.340> in<00:03:06.549> the<00:03:06.639> 1970s

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
black ops 2 to be based in the 1970s

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.309 
black ops 2 to be based in the 1970s
which<00:03:07.959> it<00:03:08.139> might<00:03:08.290> not<00:03:08.469> happen<00:03:09.900> you<00:03:10.900> know<00:03:11.019> I

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
which it might not happen you know I

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.110 
which it might not happen you know I
could<00:03:11.709> see<00:03:11.889> a<00:03:11.919> possibility<00:03:12.700> of<00:03:12.760> maybe<00:03:12.909> the

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
could see a possibility of maybe the

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.659 
could see a possibility of maybe the
games<00:03:13.329> campaign<00:03:13.989> jumping<00:03:14.620> from<00:03:14.739> the<00:03:14.859> 70s<00:03:15.430> into

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:15.669 
games campaign jumping from the 70s into

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:18.089 
games campaign jumping from the 70s into
the<00:03:16.090> future<00:03:16.329> maybe<00:03:17.139> like<00:03:17.349> two<00:03:17.530> little<00:03:17.829> story

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
the future maybe like two little story

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.369 
the future maybe like two little story
lines<00:03:18.340> in<00:03:18.639> one<00:03:18.939> that<00:03:19.659> would<00:03:19.810> actually<00:03:20.079> be<00:03:20.260> a

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:20.379 
lines in one that would actually be a

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.800 
lines in one that would actually be a
very<00:03:20.680> clever<00:03:20.919> idea<00:03:21.340> and<00:03:21.549> I<00:03:22.030> really<00:03:22.419> like<00:03:22.599> how

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
very clever idea and I really like how

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.479 
very clever idea and I really like how
Activision<00:03:23.500> just<00:03:23.680> lays<00:03:23.949> out<00:03:24.159> the<00:03:24.220> whole

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
Activision just lays out the whole

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.550 
Activision just lays out the whole
marketing<00:03:25.000> thing<00:03:25.269> they're<00:03:25.900> doing<00:03:26.079> it<00:03:26.349> once

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
marketing thing they're doing it once

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.890 
marketing thing they're doing it once
