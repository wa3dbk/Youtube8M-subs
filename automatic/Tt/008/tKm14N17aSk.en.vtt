can clip it out words which I usually do
when<00:02:17.880> I'm<00:02:18.030> in<00:02:18.210> an<00:02:18.600> office<00:02:19.110> environment<00:02:19.260> and

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
when I'm in an office environment and

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.010 
when I'm in an office environment and
then<00:02:20.220> if<00:02:20.610> I'm<00:02:20.790> out<00:02:20.910> in<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.060> field<00:02:21.330> I'm<00:02:21.780> still

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
then if I'm out in the field I'm still

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.080 
then if I'm out in the field I'm still
with<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.560> military<00:02:23.010> I<00:02:23.270> clip<00:02:24.270> it<00:02:24.300> face<00:02:25.050> in<00:02:26.090> but

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
with the military I clip it face in but

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.790 
with the military I clip it face in but
this<00:02:27.180> one<00:02:27.360> only<00:02:27.570> leaves<00:02:27.810> one<00:02:27.960> option<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.710> it's

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
this one only leaves one option and it's

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.670 
this one only leaves one option and it's
clothing<00:02:29.130> it<00:02:29.220> in<00:02:29.310> like<00:02:29.490> that<00:02:30.380> so<00:02:31.380> let's<00:02:31.530> move

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
clothing it in like that so let's move

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.640 
clothing it in like that so let's move
on<00:02:31.830> to<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.100> actual<00:02:32.340> case<00:02:33.230> like<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.320> said<00:02:34.530> before

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
on to the actual case like I said before

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.220 
on to the actual case like I said before
these<00:02:35.190> bumpers<00:02:35.610> offer<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:36.030> lot<00:02:36.360> of<00:02:36.570> impact

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
these bumpers offer a lot of impact

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.470 
these bumpers offer a lot of impact
resistance<00:02:37.890> one<00:02:38.490> thing<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:38.880> didn't<00:02:39.270> like

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
resistance one thing that I didn't like

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.590 
resistance one thing that I didn't like
is<00:02:40.170> that<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.250> can<00:02:41.400> might<00:02:41.880> be<00:02:42.030> able<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.240> see<00:02:42.420> the

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
is that you can might be able to see the

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.740 
is that you can might be able to see the
the<00:02:42.870> cut<00:02:43.140> of<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.830> silicone<00:02:44.340> it's<00:02:45.000> not<00:02:45.240> a<00:02:45.270> cut

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
the cut of the silicone it's not a cut

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.350 
the cut of the silicone it's not a cut
perfectly<00:02:46.260> which<00:02:46.650> makes<00:02:47.190> it<00:02:47.370> look<00:02:47.730> just<00:02:47.760> a

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
perfectly which makes it look just a

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.920 
perfectly which makes it look just a
little<00:02:48.510> bit<00:02:48.780> cheaper<00:02:49.650> um<00:02:50.240> there's<00:02:51.240> no<00:02:51.330> plastic

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
little bit cheaper um there's no plastic

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.310 
little bit cheaper um there's no plastic
over<00:02:52.260> any<00:02:52.740> of<00:02:52.920> these<00:02:53.070> so<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.970> camera<00:02:54.330> is<00:02:54.360> still

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
over any of these so the camera is still

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.760 
over any of these so the camera is still
exposed<00:02:56.240> just<00:02:57.240> keep<00:02:57.450> that<00:02:57.570> in<00:02:57.630> mind<00:02:57.840> sometimes

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
exposed just keep that in mind sometimes

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.900 
exposed just keep that in mind sometimes
with<00:02:59.930> otterbox<00:03:00.930> cases<00:03:01.470> they<00:03:01.830> have<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:02.010> thin

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
with otterbox cases they have a thin

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.900 
with otterbox cases they have a thin
layer<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.150> plastic<00:03:03.870> over<00:03:04.620> that<00:03:04.830> which<00:03:05.670> might

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
layer of plastic over that which might

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.030 
layer of plastic over that which might
diminish<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.570> quality<00:03:06.600> of<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.560> picture<00:03:07.890> so

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
diminish the quality of the picture so

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.470 
diminish the quality of the picture so
you<00:03:08.100> have<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.310> take<00:03:08.490> that<00:03:08.520> into<00:03:08.700> account<00:03:09.030> as

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
you have to take that into account as

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.380 
you have to take that into account as
well<00:03:10.010> this<00:03:11.010> body<00:03:11.310> right<00:03:11.430> here<00:03:11.850> that<00:03:11.970> goes<00:03:12.120> over

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
well this body right here that goes over

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.390 
well this body right here that goes over
the<00:03:12.480> silicone<00:03:12.900> this<00:03:13.110> is<00:03:13.290> all<00:03:13.560> plastic<00:03:13.890> there's

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
the silicone this is all plastic there's

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.550 
the silicone this is all plastic there's
no<00:03:14.550> rubbery<00:03:14.940> feel<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.420> this<00:03:15.710> or<00:03:16.710> the<00:03:16.860> sides

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
no rubbery feel to this or the sides

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.890 
no rubbery feel to this or the sides
here<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.709> port<00:03:20.010> covers<00:03:20.820> they<00:03:21.420> don't<00:03:21.600> really

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
here the port covers they don't really

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.860 
here the port covers they don't really
have<00:03:22.170> like<00:03:22.200> a<00:03:22.590> little<00:03:23.060> lip<00:03:24.060> on<00:03:24.300> them<00:03:24.510> so<00:03:24.750> they

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
have like a little lip on them so they

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.830 
have like a little lip on them so they
just<00:03:24.900> slide<00:03:25.320> right<00:03:25.380> in<00:03:26.150> I'm<00:03:27.150> wondering<00:03:27.630> if<00:03:27.720> you

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
just slide right in I'm wondering if you

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.630 
just slide right in I'm wondering if you
pull<00:03:28.080> it<00:03:28.230> out<00:03:28.350> a<00:03:28.380> lot<00:03:28.680> if<00:03:28.920> it<00:03:29.040> will<00:03:29.130> just<00:03:29.310> start

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
pull it out a lot if it will just start

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.050 
pull it out a lot if it will just start
to<00:03:29.790> hang<00:03:30.090> just<00:03:30.630> hang<00:03:30.780> out<00:03:30.930> like<00:03:31.110> that<00:03:32.060> they're

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
to hang just hang out like that they're

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.060 
to hang just hang out like that they're
cutouts<00:03:33.480> for<00:03:33.660> all<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.020> appropriate<00:03:34.260> areas

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
cutouts for all the appropriate areas

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.290 
cutouts for all the appropriate areas
all<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.820> mics<00:03:36.380> those<00:03:37.380> two<00:03:38.030> 3.5<00:03:39.030> millimeter

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
all the mics those two 3.5 millimeter

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.150 
all the mics those two 3.5 millimeter
headphone<00:03:39.690> jack<00:03:40.200> again<00:03:40.560> there's<00:03:40.830> no<00:03:40.890> lip

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
headphone jack again there's no lip

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.060 
headphone jack again there's no lip
right<00:03:41.340> there<00:03:41.400> so<00:03:41.820> just<00:03:42.000> kind<00:03:42.270> of<00:03:42.800> slide<00:03:43.800> right

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
right there so just kind of slide right

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.100 
right there so just kind of slide right
in<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:44.430> hope<00:03:44.610> that<00:03:44.790> will<00:03:44.940> stay<00:03:45.630> in<00:03:45.690> there<00:03:45.900> in<00:03:46.020> the

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
in I hope that will stay in there in the

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.010 
in I hope that will stay in there in the
long<00:03:46.290> term<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:47.280> volume<00:03:48.180> rockers<00:03:48.540> are<00:03:48.720> really

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
long term the volume rockers are really

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.500 
long term the volume rockers are really
easy<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.440> access<00:03:49.830> and<00:03:50.100> they<00:03:51.060> still<00:03:51.300> have<00:03:51.480> a

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
easy to access and they still have a

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.710 
easy to access and they still have a
crisp<00:03:52.380> feedback<00:03:53.310> to<00:03:53.550> them<00:03:53.700> include<00:03:54.209> and<00:03:54.390> the

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
crisp feedback to them include and the

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.810 
crisp feedback to them include and the
power<00:03:54.930> button<00:03:55.140> as<00:03:55.320> well<00:03:55.370> the<00:03:56.370> buttons<00:03:56.670> right

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
power button as well the buttons right

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.160 
power button as well the buttons right
down<00:03:57.000> here<00:03:57.209> these<00:03:57.420> are<00:03:57.480> kind<00:03:57.810> of<00:03:57.900> hard<00:03:58.050> to

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
down here these are kind of hard to

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.320 
down here these are kind of hard to
access<00:03:58.410> because<00:03:59.220> they're<00:03:59.550> right<00:03:59.850> over<00:03:59.880> the

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
access because they're right over the

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:01.729 
access because they're right over the
lip<00:04:00.630> so<00:04:00.930> you<00:04:00.989> either<00:04:01.080> have<00:04:01.320> to<00:04:01.440> bend<00:04:01.620> your

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
lip so you either have to bend your

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.440 
lip so you either have to bend your
finger<00:04:01.980> in<00:04:02.070> there<00:04:02.190> or<00:04:02.400> push<00:04:02.940> con<00:04:03.150> we<00:04:03.300> get<00:04:03.420> a

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
finger in there or push con we get a

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.320 
finger in there or push con we get a
fingernail<00:04:04.370> same<00:04:05.370> thing<00:04:05.580> with<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:05.760> back<00:04:06.060> and

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
fingernail same thing with the back and

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.699 
fingernail same thing with the back and
then<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:07.050> menu<00:04:07.380> button<00:04:09.110> let's<00:04:10.110> take<00:04:10.560> this

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
then the menu button let's take this

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.430 
then the menu button let's take this
back<00:04:10.950> apart<00:04:11.640> first<00:04:12.330> we'll<00:04:12.480> take<00:04:12.630> the<00:04:12.780> plastic

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
back apart first we'll take the plastic

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.870 
back apart first we'll take the plastic
off<00:04:13.860> here<00:04:16.070> and<00:04:17.070> then<00:04:17.220> that<00:04:17.370> just<00:04:17.549> leaves<00:04:17.790> the

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
off here and then that just leaves the

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.230 
off here and then that just leaves the
