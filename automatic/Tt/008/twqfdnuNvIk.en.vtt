00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.269 
two pieces of paper glue or tape here's
how<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.619> make<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.430> paper<00:00:23.640> airplane<00:00:24.980> get<00:00:25.980> this

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
how you make the paper airplane get this

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.359 
how you make the paper airplane get this
and<00:00:26.700> fold<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.090> down<00:00:27.470> so<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.710> doesn't<00:00:28.740> make<00:00:29.340> a

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
and fold it down so it doesn't make a

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.119 
and fold it down so it doesn't make a
triangle<00:00:32.269> be<00:00:33.269> sure<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.600> leave<00:00:33.720> some<00:00:33.809> space

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
triangle be sure to leave some space

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.049 
triangle be sure to leave some space
right<00:00:35.129> here<00:00:35.309> now<00:00:36.090> you're<00:00:36.870> gonna<00:00:37.019> get<00:00:37.199> the<00:00:37.320> top

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
right here now you're gonna get the top

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.970 
right here now you're gonna get the top
this<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.449> then<00:00:39.989> you're<00:00:40.260> gonna<00:00:40.410> fold<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.830> down

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
this and then you're gonna fold it down

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.910 
this and then you're gonna fold it down
to<00:00:41.129> make<00:00:41.280> another<00:00:41.580> circle<00:00:42.410> now<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.589> looks<00:00:43.769> like

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
to make another circle now it looks like

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.959 
to make another circle now it looks like
a<00:00:44.129> house<00:00:44.580> shape<00:00:45.800> it's<00:00:46.800> let's<00:00:47.460> take<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.760> shape

a house shape it's let's take the shape
the<00:00:48.149> shape<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.840> house<00:00:49.129> there<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.250> get<00:00:50.399> the

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
the shape of a house there you get the

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.689 
the shape of a house there you get the
top<00:00:50.700> again<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.210> fold<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.570> down<00:00:52.430> like<00:00:53.430> just

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
top again and fold it down like just

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.240 
top again and fold it down like just
like<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:55.340> so<00:00:56.340> now<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.730> looks<00:00:56.760> like<00:00:57.149> that

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
so you have two paper airplanes now what

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.580 
so you have two paper airplanes now what
you're<00:02:23.330> gonna<00:02:23.450> do<00:02:23.630> is<00:02:23.780> get<00:02:23.960> the<00:02:24.110> glue<00:02:24.290> stick

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
you're gonna do is get the glue stick

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.640 
you're gonna do is get the glue stick
and<00:02:24.860> put<00:02:25.640> glue<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:26.360> whichever<00:02:26.810> one<00:02:27.080> you<00:02:27.560> want

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
and put glue and whichever one you want

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
so there now get the other piece and put

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.020 
so there now get the other piece and put
it<00:02:53.960> on<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.260> top<00:02:54.440> make<00:02:55.130> sure<00:02:55.340> they're<00:02:55.580> even

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
do is fold the bottom plane down the

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.340 
do is fold the bottom plane down the
upper<00:03:11.630> plane<00:03:11.870> up<00:03:13.480> and<00:03:14.480> there<00:03:14.930> you<00:03:14.960> have<00:03:15.170> it

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
upper plane up and there you have it

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.650 
upper plane up and there you have it
that's<00:03:15.680> about<00:03:15.890> it<00:03:16.190> so<00:03:16.460> here's<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:17.390> paper

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
that's about it so here's the paper
