current gen consoles in like the 360 in
the<00:00:41.520> ps3<00:00:42.030> are<00:00:42.239> older<00:00:42.989> gen<00:00:43.260> consoles<00:00:43.710> that

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
the ps3 are older gen consoles that

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.350 
the ps3 are older gen consoles that
makes<00:00:44.010> sense<00:00:44.219> but<00:00:44.340> always<00:00:44.520> be<00:00:44.760> like<00:00:44.879> next<00:00:45.120> gen

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
makes sense but always be like next gen

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.760 
makes sense but always be like next gen
consoles<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.899> me<00:00:46.020> just<00:00:46.230> because<00:00:46.350> that's<00:00:46.620> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
consoles to me just because that's the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.020 
consoles to me just because that's the
way<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.860> think<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.640> know<00:00:47.670> you're<00:00:47.879> always

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
way I think of it you know you're always

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.700 
way I think of it you know you're always
going<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.180> have<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.390> classic<00:00:48.600> ps3<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.320> xbox
