00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello girls welcome to miami capone 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.410
 how are you 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.030
 Today I have this look that is great 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.910
 for any special occasion that 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.679
 you have go with everything then by 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.260
 I liked that job offered with 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.080
 navy blue under black goes with white goes 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.910
 with page goes with red so I hope that 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.340
 be a super option for all of you 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.199
 who have some special event so 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.510
 come with me so you know how to achieve 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.730
 look 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.620
 ok girls then let's start and it's 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.460
 very important to apply our pre-base 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:36.620
 shadows expressing the surface and we're going to 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.940
 apply on the top and on the 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.340
 lower part of the eyelid 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.469
 and this makes everything you put 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.170
 Above it is in place we will 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.899
 illuminate below the eyebrow and was in 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.699
 my favorite product the high brown of 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.350
 see that here comes hard for everything but 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.989
 they know that it makes me cool that 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.360
 see if I use the new products there 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.159
 that he used them constantly this is for 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.070
 to change it as it says in English 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:08.789
 phrase your product that is broken 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.799
 if it's not broken do not fix it use that 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:12.360
 function 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:16.970
 and now after this we are going to use 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.970
 the parrot but arguing is very dirty 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.410
 then the saber will be also and 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.380
 then the one that follows is the express and 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:29.530
 let's use the code 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.990
 also and like 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.580
 then I'm saying the real names 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.890
 I have all the products towards 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.600
 down and let's start with the club what 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.210
 I'm going to apply in the almond 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.310
 to blur it this works like 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.310
 our base diffuses 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:52.830
 Follow the saber and he knows what we are going to 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.830
 apply here in the corner 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.470
 and you can change the brush if you like it 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.020
 smaller brush this one I like 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:03.990
 because it fits very well here in me in my 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.979
 basin in space have my account 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.979
 It depends on you 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.180
 we blur ok now what if 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.450
 we need a smaller brush a 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.760
 pen comes the espresso this is the 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.670
 part this is a darker part 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.520
 we want to apply color only in the 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.520
 corner and start blurring is also 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:31.819
 important that you have a flat brush 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.819
 because we are going to draw a line with this 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.390
 as you already saw back there was something 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.490
 dirty right now it does not matter because I'm going to 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.230
 clean is what I wanted is that more 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:53.819
 that nothing will remain dark but 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.980
 blurred and now I'm going to take the plane 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:03:00.780
 and with the plane what I'm going to do is that 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:04.430
 I already put it over the shadow and now 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.430
 I want to draw a line 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.500
 and since you drew that line I'm going to clean 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.680
 the brush that I'm going to start to blur 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.200
 upwards 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.579
 what I want to achieve is that this 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.310
 line begins to merge with the 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:21.530
 blurred that we already had earlier like this 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.310
 as I have it on this side 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.020
 we can darken again more than anything 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.620
 the important thing is that the dark one looks 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:34.209
 here at the mere corner and we're going to 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.209
 use the pen for that 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.550
 a little 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.430
 ok your flames your violence the phrase ya 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.500
 it's not that clean yet because we're going to 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.630
 pass you with a proofreader or with 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.460
 makeup and now what I want is the 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:57.340
 part of below we will take the express 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.270
 and we're going to pass it here on the eyelid 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.480
 lower 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.980
 and you have to join 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:09.260
 with the hairline that we did above 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.260
 that is to say that he cured me and my daughter 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.240
 and this part we are going to lower it a little bit 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:19.190
 plus 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.190
 and now let's take the saber 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.599
 he entered what is half and after 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.979
 I'm going to take a pen that is a 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.210
 little bit more open that works for 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.210
 blur equal 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:44.880
 now 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:47.580
 I'm going to take my eyeliner that pod 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.080
 and the ease of this the advantage that 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.850
 have this forgiveness is that we can continue 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.280
 making some lines drawn then 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:57.440
 I'm going to do my delineated line 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.440
 just where I already have that line drawn 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.080
 and now we are going to follow the line of 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.080
 tabs 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.760
 now since we have this with what we 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.289
 it was right here in the mail and now what 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.839
 let's put in the bottom 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.380
 is also following the line that already 

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:22.630
 we think 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:26.860
 inward and it is not to enter 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:29.380
 tear down and we take our 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:32.340
 our brush and we blur the shadow 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:37.140
 this is instead of as a shadow 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.140
 we apply the mascara 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.080
 I'm going to use the gas 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:54.169
 and now I wear the false eyelash and 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:57.979
 I'm going to apply a little bronzer and 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:06:00.349
 this is the best product in 1 873 and 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:03.650
 it's just a darker shade than 

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:06.560
 that my skin so that it looks like a 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.690
 shaded very natural and now I'm going to 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.479
 use the bar that I had this is the 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:14.060
 blush of benefit has something of 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:16.850
 lighting also 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.980
 and this I'm going to apply here in the 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:23.350
 cheek 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:23.350
 let's take the lighting style 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:30.950
 in the past I will put here 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:35.190
 and now yes girls come the good we're going to 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:39.660
 clean the eye I'm going to take my 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:42.120
 my makeup I'm going to put it with 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:46.040
 the brush I will take a little bit of the 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.040
 product and now I'm going to draw 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.979
 ok lips super simple this is my 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.770
 favorite tournament for me I already have them 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:58.919
 taken several times this is the closing of 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:07:04.949
 max and if you like they can give you a glitter 

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:08.460
 with this the first of lime and are 

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:11.580
 ready for your event 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:17.280

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:21.469
 we are not ready for him because he is missing 

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:24.469
 the club the golden one we are going to explain it 

00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:24.469

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:30.360
