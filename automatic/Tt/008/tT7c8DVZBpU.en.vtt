do so if I have to see you my

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.190 
do so if I have to see you my
recommendation<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.989> just<00:00:33.989> go<00:00:34.140> to

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
recommendation is that you just go to

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.610 
recommendation is that you just go to
your<00:00:34.320> percent<00:00:34.829> updated<00:00:35.250> percent<00:00:35.579> folder<00:00:36.620> and

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
your percent updated percent folder and

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.400 
your percent updated percent folder and
just<00:00:37.710> delete<00:00:38.160> your<00:00:38.719> ticket<00:00:39.719> folder<00:00:40.170> your

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
just delete your ticket folder your

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.630 
just delete your ticket folder your
technic<00:00:40.680> launcher<00:00:40.710> folder<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.399> then<00:00:41.460> just

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
technic launcher folder and then just

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.290 
technic launcher folder and then just
redownload<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.710> should<00:00:43.860> work<00:00:44.300> but

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
redownload it and it should work but

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.790 
redownload it and it should work but
yeah<00:00:45.420> so<00:00:45.750> basically<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.379> just<00:00:46.620> going<00:00:46.739> to

it<00:01:56.770> look<00:01:56.920> all<00:01:57.009> pretty<00:01:57.280> whatever<00:01:57.670> you<00:01:57.820> want<00:01:57.940> to

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
it look all pretty whatever you want to

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.960 
it look all pretty whatever you want to
do<00:01:58.149> but<00:01:58.420> build<00:01:59.259> a<00:01:59.380> tower<00:01:59.680> around<00:02:00.100> it<00:02:00.340> and<00:02:00.460> make

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
do but build a tower around it and make

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.940 
do but build a tower around it and make
it<00:02:01.000> look<00:02:01.180> like<00:02:01.360> an<00:02:01.509> actual<00:02:02.700> actual<00:02:03.700> nuclear

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
it look like an actual actual nuclear

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.170 
it look like an actual actual nuclear
initial<00:02:05.950> missile<00:02:06.340> silo<00:02:06.759> or<00:02:06.789> whatever<00:02:07.119> you

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
initial missile silo or whatever you

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.809 
initial missile silo or whatever you
want<00:02:07.299> to<00:02:07.330> do<00:02:07.450> but<00:02:07.659> basically<00:02:08.259> oh<00:02:08.590> wait<00:02:09.100> forgot

want to do but basically oh wait forgot
something<00:02:10.330> I<00:02:10.450> know<00:02:10.630> I<00:02:10.690> was<00:02:10.810> reading<00:02:11.319> something

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
something I know I was reading something

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:19.140 
something I know I was reading something
in<00:02:12.489> the<00:02:12.670> lever<00:02:15.150> also<00:02:16.150> so<00:02:16.510> yeah<00:02:16.720> Yello<00:02:17.970> so<00:02:18.970> lets

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
in the lever also so yeah Yello so lets

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.800 
in the lever also so yeah Yello so lets
you<00:02:19.239> all<00:02:19.299> this<00:02:19.600> you<00:02:19.959> get<00:02:20.140> it<00:02:20.400> build<00:02:21.810> copper

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
you all this you get it build copper

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.920 
you all this you get it build copper
wire<00:02:23.019> like<00:02:23.410> this<00:02:24.750> away<00:02:25.750> from<00:02:25.810> here<00:02:27.600> like<00:02:28.600> so

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
wire like this away from here like so

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.199 
wire like this away from here like so
and<00:02:29.200> what<00:02:29.950> I<00:02:29.980> like<00:02:30.250> to<00:02:30.400> do<00:02:30.519> is<00:02:30.549> bring<00:02:31.000> it<00:02:31.150> around

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
and what I like to do is bring it around

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.110 
and what I like to do is bring it around
here<00:02:31.780> to<00:02:31.989> to<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:32.440> other<00:02:32.590> side<00:02:32.830> I<00:02:33.250> don't<00:02:34.060> know

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
here to to the other side I don't know

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.759 
here to to the other side I don't know
if<00:02:34.209> that's<00:02:34.360> completely<00:02:34.750> necessary<00:02:34.989> but<00:02:35.590> I<00:02:35.650> do

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
if that's completely necessary but I do

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.710 
if that's completely necessary but I do
it<00:02:36.040> anyways<00:02:36.549> really<00:02:37.239> you're<00:02:37.480> going<00:02:37.600> to<00:02:37.660> get

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
it anyways really you're going to get

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.190 
it anyways really you're going to get
blown<00:02:37.959> up<00:02:38.760> then<00:02:39.760> you're<00:02:39.940> going<00:02:40.030> to<00:02:40.090> do<00:02:40.299> your

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
blown up then you're going to do your

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.319 
blown up then you're going to do your
generator<00:02:41.709> here<00:02:42.040> and<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.880> important<00:02:43.209> thing

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329 
generator here and the important thing

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:44.819 
generator here and the important thing
let<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:43.540> generator<00:02:43.989> is<00:02:44.109> there's<00:02:44.470> a<00:02:44.560> hole<00:02:44.799> on

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
let the generator is there's a hole on

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:50.069 
let the generator is there's a hole on
that<00:02:45.010> side<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:45.730> you<00:02:46.510> can't<00:02:46.810> really<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:49.870> can't

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
that side and you can't really you can't

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:53.460 
that side and you can't really you can't
really<00:02:51.450> change<00:02:52.450> that<00:02:52.690> with<00:02:52.870> a<00:02:52.900> French<00:02:53.260> it<00:02:53.410> I

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
really change that with a French it I

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.200 
really change that with a French it I
think<00:02:53.680> so<00:02:53.829> make<00:02:54.280> sure<00:02:54.310> that<00:02:54.459> you<00:02:54.880> get<00:02:55.060> that

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
think so make sure that you get that

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.830 
think so make sure that you get that
that<00:02:57.080> right<00:02:57.440> so<00:02:58.430> you<00:02:58.880> it's<00:02:59.330> easier<00:02:59.690> if<00:02:59.750> your

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
that right so you it's easier if your

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.300 
that right so you it's easier if your
place<00:03:00.050> to<00:03:00.200> generate<00:03:00.560> a<00:03:00.590> first<00:03:00.860> and<00:03:01.010> then<00:03:01.160> the

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
place to generate a first and then the

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.410 
place to generate a first and then the
copper<00:03:01.550> wire<00:03:01.730> because<00:03:01.970> then<00:03:02.090> you<00:03:02.150> know<00:03:02.180> where

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
copper wire because then you know where

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.540 
copper wire because then you know where
to<00:03:02.510> place<00:03:02.720> it<00:03:02.950> but<00:03:03.950> then<00:03:04.100> you're<00:03:04.250> going<00:03:04.340> to<00:03:04.400> put

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
to place it but then you're going to put

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.480 
to place it but then you're going to put
your<00:03:04.580> coal<00:03:04.850> in<00:03:05.320> the<00:03:08.020> that<00:03:09.020> wire<00:03:09.200> rack<00:03:09.500> and<00:03:10.340> then

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
your coal in the that wire rack and then

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.700 
your coal in the that wire rack and then
what<00:03:10.640> you<00:03:10.790> going<00:03:10.940> to<00:03:11.000> do<00:03:11.410> once<00:03:12.410> you<00:03:12.530> get<00:03:12.620> your

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:12.710 
what you going to do once you get your

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.980 
what you going to do once you get your
cold<00:03:12.950> running<00:03:13.310> see<00:03:14.300> that's<00:03:14.630> going<00:03:14.810> to<00:03:14.870> know

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
cold running see that's going to know

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.810 
cold running see that's going to know
that's<00:03:15.170> good<00:03:15.370> then<00:03:16.370> you're<00:03:16.490> going<00:03:16.610> to<00:03:16.670> check

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
that's good then you're going to check

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.720 
that's good then you're going to check
in<00:03:17.000> here<00:03:17.140> and<00:03:18.140> you're<00:03:18.950> going<00:03:19.160> to<00:03:19.220> get<00:03:19.430> power

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
in here and you're going to get power

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.360 
in here and you're going to get power
going<00:03:20.030> like<00:03:20.240> that<00:03:20.270> alright<00:03:20.840> so<00:03:21.740> I<00:03:21.770> don't<00:03:22.220> think

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
going like that alright so I don't think

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.580 
going like that alright so I don't think
you<00:03:22.490> need<00:03:24.430> this<00:03:25.430> one<00:03:25.700> back<00:03:25.730> here<00:03:26.410> that's<00:03:27.410> not

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
you need this one back here that's not

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.470 
you need this one back here that's not
necessary<00:03:28.010> I<00:03:28.190> just<00:03:28.460> did<00:03:28.640> it<00:03:28.670> once<00:03:28.910> can<00:03:29.240> let<00:03:29.360> it

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
necessary I just did it once can let it

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.880 
necessary I just did it once can let it
always<00:03:29.720> a<00:03:29.750> quite<00:03:29.960> sure<00:03:30.170> if<00:03:30.200> you<00:03:30.470> need<00:03:30.650> or<00:03:30.800> not

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
always a quite sure if you need or not

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.640 
always a quite sure if you need or not
but<00:03:31.510> looks<00:03:32.510> like<00:03:32.600> it's<00:03:32.780> working<00:03:33.760> yep<00:03:35.470> so<00:03:36.470> it

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
but looks like it's working yep so it

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.350 
but looks like it's working yep so it
says<00:03:36.830> insufficient<00:03:37.580> electricity<00:03:38.150> so<00:03:38.300> I'm

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
says insufficient electricity so I'm

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:48.940 
says insufficient electricity so I'm
gonna<00:03:38.480> let<00:03:38.630> that<00:03:38.840> do<00:03:39.800> its<00:03:39.920> thing<00:03:42.490> and<00:03:43.990> then

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.979 

let's<00:03:49.489> do<00:03:49.640> its<00:03:49.790> thing<00:03:49.910> till<00:03:50.540> it<00:03:50.629> gets<00:03:50.780> enough

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
let's do its thing till it gets enough

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.000 
let's do its thing till it gets enough
electricity<00:03:51.790> what<00:03:52.790> you<00:03:52.910> can<00:03:53.030> do<00:03:53.150> right<00:03:53.180> now<00:03:53.360> is

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
electricity what you can do right now is

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:02.430 
electricity what you can do right now is
put<00:03:55.010> your<00:03:55.040> missile<00:03:55.430> on<00:03:55.550> there<00:03:57.280> like<00:03:58.280> so<00:03:59.860> yeah

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
me I'm going to do that scan coordinates

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.930 
me I'm going to do that scan coordinates
so<00:04:38.990> it<00:04:39.080> knows<00:04:39.260> that<00:04:39.470> I'm<00:04:39.830> I<00:04:40.370> have<00:04:40.700> the<00:04:40.850> right

so it knows that I'm I have the right

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.140 
so it knows that I'm I have the right
coordinates<00:04:41.270> that<00:04:41.570> I<00:04:41.630> want<00:04:41.840> to<00:04:41.900> hit<00:04:43.000> come<00:04:44.000> back
