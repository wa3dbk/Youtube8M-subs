 Wilders has been through today 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:26.710
 what actually 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.909
 fiona signatures are handed out in public 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:33.210
 it always helps a benefit that is paid out 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.210
 and that has become 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.680
 he is the first dutch title but if the earth get into the research 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.680
 everest poker percent 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.290
 the part thereof 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.410

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.280

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.770
 the top brands also don't have a set time for a signing session 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.060

 katwijk 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.120
 And what's the nicest thing was it doesn't belong to anyone I think 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.119
 say 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.740
 how that is due to the hagenaar pocket 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.990
 the service works 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.220
 really 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.610
 of course you have your own paws of blood 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.610

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.020

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.950
 making remains a hunk 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.670
