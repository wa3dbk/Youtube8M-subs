00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:30.400
 Annoyed spring wind, my heart is annoyed by the spring breeze 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:45.400
 Can't tell the loan 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:59.400
 Freezing raindrops in the night are transmitted to the photo 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:10.400
 Looking back, it seems that the dream can't be bounced. 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.400
 I am fascinated by your fading photos 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:33.400
 Ah, like the flowers are not red as ice, although they are not frozen. 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:46.400
 But like there are countless words, but I don’t understand. 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:55.400
 Ah, the glass of wine is getting thicker. 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:10.400
 Or how does my heart vacuum feel shocked? 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:23.400
 Where can I vote in the photo? 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:38.400
 Looking forward to finding time cracks 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:50.400
 Night indulgence tells me that it is hard to find you 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:01.400
 Going back is also a dream still passive 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:11.400
 Escape from gaze, but deep in the mind 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:22.000
 Ah, like the flowers are not red as ice, although they are not frozen. 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:34.400
 But like there are countless words, but I don’t understand. 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:51.400
 Yeah, the glass of wine is getting thicker or my heart is vacuum. 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:00.400
 Why do you feel shocked?
