00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
cheap steel sheds right

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.509 
cheap steel sheds right
the<00:00:10.500> reason<00:00:10.769> they<00:00:10.830> buy<00:00:11.010> them<00:00:11.190> is<00:00:11.309> because

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
the reason they buy them is because

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.640 
the reason they buy them is because
they're<00:00:11.849> temporary<00:00:12.389> structure<00:00:12.900> they're

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
they're temporary structure they're

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.799 
they're temporary structure they're
quick<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.009> file<00:00:14.490> or<00:00:14.700> kind<00:00:15.089> of<00:00:15.150> quick<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.450> put<00:00:15.660> up

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
quick to file or kind of quick to put up

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.210 
quick to file or kind of quick to put up
you<00:00:15.990> got<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.230> watch<00:00:16.440> you<00:00:16.650> if<00:00:16.710> there's<00:00:16.890> no<00:00:17.010> wind

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
you got to watch you if there's no wind

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.750 
you got to watch you if there's no wind
and<00:00:17.550> stuff<00:00:17.789> but<00:00:18.660> they<00:00:19.529> don't<00:00:19.770> um<00:00:19.980> they<00:00:20.609> don't

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
and stuff but they don't um they don't

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.250 
and stuff but they don't um they don't
tax<00:00:21.029> them<00:00:21.240> because<00:00:21.449> it's<00:00:21.570> just<00:00:21.689> temporary

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
tax them because it's just temporary

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.700 
tax them because it's just temporary
structure<00:00:22.880> so<00:00:23.880> but<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.900> don't<00:00:24.990> like<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.590> way

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
structure so but I don't like the way

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.730 
structure so but I don't like the way
they<00:00:25.859> are<00:00:26.039> because<00:00:26.430> they're<00:00:27.180> too<00:00:27.420> low<00:00:28.050> like<00:00:28.590> in

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
they are because they're too low like in

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.300 
they are because they're too low like in
other<00:00:28.890> words

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
other words

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.429 
other words
well<00:00:29.730> this<00:00:29.849> one's<00:00:30.090> higher<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.900> way<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.080> have

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
well this one's higher in the way I have

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.650 
well this one's higher in the way I have
it<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.099> very<00:00:32.219> good<00:00:32.640> trick<00:00:32.910> still

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
it this is a very good trick still

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.900 
it this is a very good trick still
consider<00:00:34.110> temporary<00:00:34.739> structure<00:00:35.190> not<00:00:35.399> taxed

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
consider temporary structure not taxed

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.260 
consider temporary structure not taxed
it's<00:00:36.750> on<00:00:36.899> four<00:00:37.170> by<00:00:37.350> fours<00:00:37.940> so<00:00:38.940> these<00:00:39.059> are

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
it's on four by fours so these are

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.479 
it's on four by fours so these are
bolted<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.989> wood<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.280> wood<00:00:41.309> is

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
bolted to the wood and the wood is

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.709 
bolted to the wood and the wood is
bolted<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.030> each<00:00:42.239> other

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
bolted to each other

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.619 
bolted to each other
right<00:00:43.040> so<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.219> makes<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.579> shed<00:00:44.820> stronger<00:00:45.420> on<00:00:45.600> a

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
right so it makes the shed stronger on a

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.959 
right so it makes the shed stronger on a
base<00:00:45.930> for<00:00:46.289> one<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:47.070> know<00:00:47.219> it's<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.700> don't

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
base for one you know it's you don't

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.770 
base for one you know it's you don't
want<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.300> sitting<00:00:48.570> on<00:00:49.879> the<00:00:50.879> ground<00:00:51.149> anyway<00:00:51.449> but

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
want it sitting on the ground anyway but

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.540 
want it sitting on the ground anyway but
most<00:00:51.960> people<00:00:52.289> put<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.559> slab<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.160> when<00:00:53.280> they<00:00:53.370> put

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
most people put a slab and when they put

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.970 
most people put a slab and when they put
a<00:00:53.579> slab<00:00:54.230> sometimes<00:00:55.230> they<00:00:55.500> consider<00:00:55.920> it

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
a slab sometimes they consider it

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.529 
a slab sometimes they consider it
permanent<00:00:58.980> structure<00:00:59.399> it's<00:00:59.609> taxed<00:01:00.030> doing<00:01:00.449> it

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
permanent structure it's taxed doing it

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.810 
permanent structure it's taxed doing it
this<00:01:00.660> way<00:01:00.719> it's<00:01:01.140> not<00:01:01.199> taxed<00:01:01.859> but<00:01:02.520> then<00:01:02.699> it

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
this way it's not taxed but then it

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.090 
this way it's not taxed but then it
gives<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.059> four<00:01:03.420> inches<00:01:03.719> more<00:01:03.930> height<00:01:04.229> now

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
gives you four inches more height now

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.950 
gives you four inches more height now
what<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.309> use<00:01:05.460> for<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.700> floor<00:01:05.970> for<00:01:06.210> concrete<00:01:06.689> you

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
what I use for a floor for concrete you

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.980 
what I use for a floor for concrete you
see<00:01:07.140> these<00:01:07.260> are<00:01:07.439> one<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.799> these<00:01:08.040> are<00:01:08.960> 1x1

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
see these are one in these are 1x1

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.039 
see these are one in these are 1x1
concrete<00:01:10.890> blocks<00:01:11.510> that's<00:01:12.510> what's<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:12.900> there

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
concrete blocks that's what's in there

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.870 
concrete blocks that's what's in there
in<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.229> floor<00:01:13.530> then<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.490> have<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.700> make<00:01:14.850> a

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
in the floor then you have to make a

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.289 
in the floor then you have to make a
ramp<00:01:15.210> go<00:01:16.049> up<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.670> so<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.700> just<00:01:18.000> poured<00:01:18.270> some

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
ramp go up it so I just poured some

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.910 
ramp go up it so I just poured some
concrete<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.140> like<00:01:19.259> way<00:01:19.439> back<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.860> a

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
concrete this is like way back in a

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.190 
concrete this is like way back in a
property<00:01:20.340> further<00:01:21.090> back<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:22.070> it's<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:24.200> think

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
property further back and it's I think

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.770 
property further back and it's I think
was<00:01:25.320> like<00:01:25.350> 380<00:01:25.860> pound<00:01:26.130> bags<00:01:26.450> and<00:01:27.450> then<00:01:27.630> I'll

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
was like 380 pound bags and then I'll

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.670 
was like 380 pound bags and then I'll
use<00:01:28.020> like<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:29.490> tie-downs<00:01:30.619> there's<00:01:31.619> a

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
use like the tie-downs there's a

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.780 
use like the tie-downs there's a
tie-down<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:33.420> go<00:01:33.570> up<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.840> here<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.310> I<00:01:35.310> have

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
tie-down so you go up to here and I have

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.499 
tie-down so you go up to here and I have
them<00:01:35.939> going<00:01:36.150> over<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.720> roof<00:01:36.960> because<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:38.520> find

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
them going over the roof because I find

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.319 
them going over the roof because I find
that<00:01:39.950> you<00:01:40.950> know<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.100> want<00:01:41.490> two<00:01:41.610> steel<00:01:41.850> panels

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
that you know I want two steel panels

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.460 
that you know I want two steel panels
held<00:01:42.570> down<00:01:42.720> actually<00:01:43.079> they're<00:01:43.170> supposed<00:01:43.409> to

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
held down actually they're supposed to

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.260 
held down actually they're supposed to
go<00:01:43.619> through<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.890> frame<00:01:44.159> but<00:01:44.790> these<00:01:45.030> roofs

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
go through the frame but these roofs

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.999 
go through the frame but these roofs
ever<00:01:45.479> get<00:01:45.659> rusty<00:01:46.110> what<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.320> do<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.860> use

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
ever get rusty what I do is I use

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.149 
ever get rusty what I do is I use
rust-oleum<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.570> use<00:01:48.810> white<00:01:49.259> roofing<00:01:49.860> paint

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
rust-oleum and I use white roofing paint

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.660 
rust-oleum and I use white roofing paint
then<00:01:51.119> they<00:01:51.270> never<00:01:51.540> screw<00:01:51.960> up<00:01:52.040> till<00:01:53.040> it'll

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
then they never screw up till it'll

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.850 
then they never screw up till it'll
stand<00:01:54.000> here<00:01:54.210> like<00:01:54.360> ten<00:01:54.689> years<00:01:55.020> will<00:01:55.590> never

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
stand here like ten years will never

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.330 
stand here like ten years will never
rust

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
rust

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.249 
rust
so<00:01:56.969> one<00:01:57.149> thing<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.390> work<00:01:57.630> in<00:01:57.810> these<00:01:57.960> sheds

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
so one thing you work in these sheds

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.910 
so one thing you work in these sheds
when<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.500> rust<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.100> use<00:02:00.290> rust-oleum<00:02:01.290> rusts

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
when a rust I use rust-oleum rusts

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.910 
when a rust I use rust-oleum rusts
killing<00:02:02.549> primer<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.840> white<00:02:04.170> roofing<00:02:04.649> paint

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
killing primer and white roofing paint

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.219 
killing primer and white roofing paint
then<00:02:05.399> they<00:02:05.520> never<00:02:05.850> rust<00:02:06.180> this<00:02:06.869> one<00:02:07.020> hasn't

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
then they never rust this one hasn't

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.330 
then they never rust this one hasn't
been<00:02:07.409> out<00:02:07.530> there<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.710> long<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.190> there's

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
been out there that long so there's

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.110 
been out there that long so there's
absolutely<00:02:08.459> no<00:02:08.759> rust<00:02:09.030> on<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.239> what<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:09.959> use<00:02:10.200> on

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
absolutely no rust on it what I use on

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.400 
absolutely no rust on it what I use on
this<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.330> still<00:02:12.510> considered<00:02:12.660> temporary

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
this is still considered temporary

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.850 
this is still considered temporary
structure

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
structure

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.940 
structure
so<00:02:14.610> it's<00:02:14.730> not<00:02:14.850> taxed<00:02:15.360> but<00:02:16.350> you<00:02:16.500> notice<00:02:16.740> you<00:02:16.860> get

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
so it's not taxed but you notice you get

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.230 
so it's not taxed but you notice you get
a<00:02:17.010> little<00:02:17.280> more<00:02:17.400> wall<00:02:17.700> height

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
a little more wall height

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.510 
a little more wall height
all<00:02:19.170> right<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.530> still<00:02:19.770> have<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.920> concrete

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
all right you still have a concrete

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.140 
all right you still have a concrete
floor<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.420> all<00:02:22.410> four<00:02:22.740> corners<00:02:23.370> are<00:02:24.290> tied<00:02:25.290> down

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
floor and all four corners are tied down

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.380 
floor and all four corners are tied down
so<00:02:27.920> okay<00:02:28.920> so<00:02:28.950> I<00:02:29.370> don't<00:02:29.640> believe<00:02:30.000> me<00:02:30.120> just

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
so okay so I don't believe me just

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.090 
so okay so I don't believe me just
giving<00:02:30.630> you<00:02:30.810> this<00:02:30.960> extra<00:02:31.380> four<00:02:31.590> inches<00:02:31.890> of

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
giving you this extra four inches of

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.810 
giving you this extra four inches of
height<00:02:32.510> inside<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.690> shed<00:02:33.960> is<00:02:34.640> fantastic<00:02:35.640> I

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
height inside the shed is fantastic I

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.460 
height inside the shed is fantastic I
mean<00:02:35.850> it's<00:02:36.090> it's<00:02:36.390> like<00:02:36.540> you<00:02:36.600> can<00:02:36.900> walk<00:02:37.080> in<00:02:37.290> here

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
mean it's it's like you can walk in here

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.880 
mean it's it's like you can walk in here
without<00:02:38.210> smacking<00:02:39.210> your<00:02:39.330> head<00:02:39.570> so<00:02:39.900> I<00:02:40.170> just

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
without smacking your head so I just

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.880 
without smacking your head so I just
figured<00:02:41.130> that<00:02:41.220> pack<00:02:41.430> point<00:02:41.760> is<00:02:41.910> tip<00:02:42.150> off<00:02:42.330> is

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
figured that pack point is tip off is

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.910 
figured that pack point is tip off is
use<00:02:43.890> four<00:02:44.580> by<00:02:44.730> fours<00:02:45.620> pressure-treated<00:02:46.620> of

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
use four by fours pressure-treated of

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.050 
use four by fours pressure-treated of
course<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.430> actually<00:02:47.670> these<00:02:47.730> should<00:02:47.940> be

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
course and actually these should be

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.340 
course and actually these should be
painted<00:02:48.390> I<00:02:48.480> probably<00:02:48.690> will<00:02:48.900> paint<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.230> pretty

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
painted I probably will paint a pretty

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.640 
painted I probably will paint a pretty
soon<00:02:49.680> here<00:02:50.720> pressure-treated<00:02:51.720> four<00:02:52.170> by<00:02:52.320> fours

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
soon here pressure-treated four by fours

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.510 
soon here pressure-treated four by fours
and<00:02:55.130> tie-downs<00:02:56.420> with<00:02:57.420> concrete<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.250> I<00:02:59.250> use

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
and tie-downs with concrete and I use

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.300 
and tie-downs with concrete and I use
one<00:03:00.120> inch<00:03:00.330> block<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:01.050> mean<00:03:01.350> one<00:03:01.530> by<00:03:01.680> one<00:03:01.920> block

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
one inch block I mean one by one block

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.180 
one inch block I mean one by one block
on<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:03.060> inside<00:03:03.420> of<00:03:03.450> it<00:03:03.720> this<00:03:04.650> way<00:03:04.920> it's

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
on the inside of it this way it's

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.060 
on the inside of it this way it's
considered<00:03:05.670> a<00:03:05.760> non-taxable<00:03:06.330> structure<00:03:07.200> it's

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
considered a non-taxable structure it's

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.280 
considered a non-taxable structure it's
still<00:03:08.459> pretty<00:03:09.060> damn<00:03:09.330> strong<00:03:09.630> it's<00:03:09.930> stronger

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
still pretty damn strong it's stronger

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.280 
still pretty damn strong it's stronger
than<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:10.500> stock<00:03:10.770> shed<00:03:11.070> and<00:03:11.930> you<00:03:12.930> got<00:03:13.080> more

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
than the stock shed and you got more

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.310 
than the stock shed and you got more
height<00:03:13.530> in<00:03:13.740> it<00:03:13.920> more<00:03:14.190> height<00:03:14.400> so<00:03:15.140> cheap<00:03:16.140> way<00:03:16.290> to

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
height in it more height so cheap way to

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.259 
height in it more height so cheap way to
get<00:03:16.530> around<00:03:16.830> things<00:03:17.070> now<00:03:17.880> you<00:03:17.940> know<00:03:18.239> I

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
get around things now you know I

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.060 
get around things now you know I
mentioned<00:03:18.690> about<00:03:18.840> getting<00:03:19.110> a<00:03:19.170> motorcycle<00:03:19.320> if
