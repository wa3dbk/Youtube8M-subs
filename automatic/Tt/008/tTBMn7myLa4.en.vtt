00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
guessing so I'm not sure how long the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.319 
guessing so I'm not sure how long the
process<00:02:42.319> is<00:02:42.709> they<00:02:42.950> don't<00:02:43.099> have<00:02:43.310> a<00:02:43.340> set<00:02:44.299> time

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
process is they don't have a set time

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.380
