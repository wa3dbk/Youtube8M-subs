00:00:08.412 --> 00:00:12.453
 Have you ever seen static electricity cause a spark of light? 

00:00:12.453 --> 00:00:14.538
 What is this spark? 

00:00:14.538 --> 00:00:15.920
 What about lightning, 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.135
 Northern Lights, 

00:00:17.135 --> 00:00:19.352
 Or tail of the comet? 

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:21.255
 All those things, and many others, 

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:27.191
 In fact 99.9% of the universe, made of plasma. 

00:00:27.191 --> 00:00:29.318
 Plasma is a state of matter 

00:00:29.318 --> 00:00:32.650
 Radically different from the most familiar forms. 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.258
 Take ice, for example. 

00:00:34.258 --> 00:00:38.383
 Ice, solid, melts into water, liquid, 

00:00:38.383 --> 00:00:42.841
 Which, when heated, evaporates into vapor, a gas. 

00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:46.298
 Constant heating of the steam when the temperature is high enough 

00:00:46.298 --> 00:00:49.550
 This caused the separation of water molecules 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.879
 Into hydrogen and oxygen atoms that roam freely. 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.352
 With a little more heat, the ionization process occurs 

00:00:57.352 --> 00:01:00.849
 The negatively charged electrons evade the atoms, 

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:04.423
 Leaving behind positive ions. 

00:01:04.423 --> 00:01:09.783
 This mixture of positive and negative charges that freely circulate is plasma, 

00:01:09.783 --> 00:01:14.752
 At a sufficiently high temperature, any gas can be converted into a plasma. 

00:01:14.752 --> 00:01:18.772
 These charged particles that move freely behave very differently 

00:01:18.772 --> 00:01:21.565
 Of particles in other types of this substance. 

00:01:21.565 --> 00:01:25.263
 When the knob, solid, contains static electricity in it, 

00:01:25.263 --> 00:01:28.125
 It does not seem or behave differently. 

00:01:28.125 --> 00:01:31.940
 Except for a compass or other magnetic object, 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.503
 We rarely see a material that responds to a magnetic field. 

00:01:36.503 --> 00:01:40.033
 But place the plasma in an electric field or magnetic field, 

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:42.416
 You will get a very different reaction. 

00:01:42.416 --> 00:01:44.368
 Because plasma is charged, 

00:01:44.368 --> 00:01:46.324
 Electric fields accelerate, 

00:01:46.324 --> 00:01:50.628
 The magnetic fields guide them in circular orbits. 

00:01:50.628 --> 00:01:52.918
 When the particles collide within the plasma, 

00:01:52.918 --> 00:01:56.381
 Or accelerated by electricity or magnetism, 

00:01:56.381 --> 00:01:58.119
 Light is generated, 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.396
 This is what we see when we look at plasma 

00:02:00.396 --> 00:02:03.166
 Such as the Aurora. 

00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:06.699
 Plasma is not only beautiful, though it is a celestial phenomenon. 

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:12.735
 Imagine a small cube made of natural gas with a very high voltage across it. 

00:02:12.735 --> 00:02:14.785
 Output electric field 

00:02:14.785 --> 00:02:19.969
 Some electrons are driven from the atoms and speeded up to high speeds 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:22.786
 Causing ionization of other atoms. 

00:02:22.786 --> 00:02:26.974
 Impurities imprinted in a small cube of gas 

00:02:26.974 --> 00:02:30.855
 Make it acquire and release a precise amount of energy 

00:02:30.855 --> 00:02:34.769
 In the form of UV rays. 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.759
 Each small cube, 

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:40.199
 With a fluorescent material that lights up with a specific color 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:45.046
 When the UV light reaches the correct density. 

00:02:45.046 --> 00:02:49.284
 Now, make a rectangle of a million of these small cubes, 

00:02:49.284 --> 00:02:53.397
 All controlled by advanced electronics. 

00:02:53.397 --> 00:02:55.870
 Maybe look at one now. 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.535
 This is called plasma TV. 

00:02:58.535 --> 00:03:01.773
 I also have plasma effects in health care. 

00:03:01.773 --> 00:03:05.756
 Plasma chemists have made very dedicated plasmas 

00:03:05.756 --> 00:03:09.029
 Which can destroy or alter the target chemicals, 

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:14.620
 Killing pathogenic organisms on food or hospital surfaces. 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.064
 Plasma is everywhere around us, 

00:03:17.064 --> 00:03:20.337
 In which models are both spectacular and practical. 

00:03:20.337 --> 00:03:22.623
 In the future, plasma can be used 

00:03:22.623 --> 00:03:25.709
 To completely dispose of landfills from waste, 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.790
 Detoxify efficiently from our air and water, 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.674
 And provide us with unlimited supply possibilities 

00:03:32.674 --> 00:03:35.307
 Of clean renewable energy.
