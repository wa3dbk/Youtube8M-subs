 front 16 works land a jig of ram 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:37.350
 2150 of battery then we have the life x5 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:41.100

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.629
 the live hicks 6100 that doesn't turn on or 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.210

 for hour of battery we pass now to 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:18.260
 lenovo and if they seemed so mine 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.670
 among other things, the expenses are very nice 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:25.130
 and what not will seem even more so 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:31.120
 and let's make space let's see between 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:37.370
 the crowd of barcelona 70 70 64 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:41.360

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:59.210
 stay in a device anyway anyway 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.170

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.700
 let's see if I can make it to everyone 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.540
 a bit stuck on demo apps 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.790

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.780
 atom therefore the whole range we have seen 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:29.349
 account of how much you believe that here 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:32.560
 interprets 35 60 55 arrived as far as 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.959
 it's about 3 megapixels of room 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.060
 slightly protruding back which 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.189

 of ram integrated for other country 4g 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:59.110
 we will probably remember 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.110
 with this video they never close like this 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:03.400
