so<00:00:30.750> my<00:00:31.019> time<00:00:31.230> here<00:00:31.380> Utah<00:00:31.769> state's<00:00:32.009> been

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
so my time here Utah state's been

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.380 
so my time here Utah state's been
probably<00:00:32.489> one<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.759> hardest<00:00:33.030> things<00:00:33.239> I've

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
probably one of the hardest things I've

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.060 
probably one of the hardest things I've
ever<00:00:33.480> done<00:00:33.630> beautifully<00:00:34.590> told<00:00:34.800> me<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:34.980> it

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
ever done beautifully told me that it

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.889 
ever done beautifully told me that it
was<00:00:35.160> going<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.370> be<00:00:35.430> pretty<00:00:35.610> tough<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.690> I

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
was going to be pretty tough and I

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.209 
was going to be pretty tough and I
didn't<00:00:37.170> understand<00:00:37.559> how<00:00:37.680> tough<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.010> would<00:00:38.100> be

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
didn't understand how tough it would be

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.799 
didn't understand how tough it would be
until<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.640> actually<00:00:38.820> got<00:00:39.149> into<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.660> I

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
until I actually got into it I

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.450 
until I actually got into it I
originally<00:00:40.260> picked<00:00:40.440> mechanical<00:00:41.070> engineering

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
originally picked mechanical engineering

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.160 
originally picked mechanical engineering
because<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.760> knew<00:00:41.879> it'd<00:00:42.000> be<00:00:42.030> hard<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.660> wanted<00:00:43.110> a

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
because I knew it'd be hard I wanted a

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.470 
because I knew it'd be hard I wanted a
challenge<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.920> spent<00:00:44.309> countless<00:00:44.550> hours<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.239> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
challenge I spent countless hours in the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.900 
challenge I spent countless hours in the
lab<00:00:45.690> just<00:00:45.960> writing<00:00:46.739> out<00:00:46.920> cold<00:00:47.250> debugging

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.830 
doing homework takes a lot of work but
but<00:00:50.520> they<00:00:50.670> get<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.969> work<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.329> lot<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.600> really

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
but they get to work on a lot of really

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.209 
but they get to work on a lot of really
cool<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.230> important<00:00:52.559> things<00:00:52.770> that's<00:00:53.070> what<00:00:53.190> I

I've been involved with the Baja for the
last<00:01:23.009> three<00:01:23.310> years<00:01:23.340> we've<00:01:23.790> built<00:01:24.150> it

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
last three years we've built it

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:35.130

different people through the research

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.459 
different people through the research
that's<00:03:04.909> like<00:03:05.120> universities<00:03:05.900> I've<00:03:06.109> gained<00:03:06.349> a

that's like universities I've gained a
lot<00:03:06.620> of<00:03:06.650> skills<00:03:07.310> here<00:03:07.790> but<00:03:08.269> it's<00:03:08.659> really

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:08.719 
lot of skills here but it's really

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:11.170 
lot of skills here but it's really
challenging<00:03:09.109> at<00:03:09.530> first<00:03:09.560> but<00:03:10.189> it<00:03:10.700> allows<00:03:10.909> you
