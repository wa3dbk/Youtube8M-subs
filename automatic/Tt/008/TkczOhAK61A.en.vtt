not got a couple of muscles here and

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.770 
not got a couple of muscles here and
they<00:02:40.100> can't<00:02:40.340> really<00:02:40.490> function<00:02:40.790> and<00:02:41.360> you<00:02:41.720> know

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
they can't really function and you know

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.630 
they can't really function and you know
that's<00:02:42.050> pulling<00:02:42.500> actually<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.040> latissimus

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
that's pulling actually the latissimus

does which is 80 ducting in the black
and<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.280> lines<00:02:46.460> actually<00:02:46.610> have<00:02:46.940> something

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
and the lines actually have something

called a witness tip we call that herb

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.660 
called a witness tip we call that herb
just<00:02:50.180> two<00:02:50.390> chins<00:02:50.660> pausing<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.380> last<00:02:52.160> but<00:02:52.490> not

just two chins pausing and last but not
the<00:02:52.730> least<00:02:52.880> is<00:02:53.300> when<00:02:54.080> patients<00:02:54.290> have<00:02:54.560> a

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
the least is when patients have a

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.380 
the least is when patients have a
rupture<00:02:55.430> of<00:02:55.690> c8<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:56.930> t1<00:02:57.940> somebody<00:02:58.940> goes<00:02:59.150> and

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
rupture of c8 and t1 somebody goes and

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.330 
rupture of c8 and t1 somebody goes and
try<00:02:59.540> to<00:02:59.600> jump<00:02:59.870> on<00:02:59.990> the<00:03:00.050> tree<00:03:00.350> Yanks<00:03:00.950> off<00:03:01.100> and

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
falls off and run and pull it is so hard

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.450 
falls off and run and pull it is so hard
they<00:03:04.580> can<00:03:04.640> pull<00:03:05.030> up<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.330> CNN<00:03:05.870> t1<00:03:06.440> right<00:03:07.100> here

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
they can pull up the CNN t1 right here

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.150 
they can pull up the CNN t1 right here
all<00:03:08.360> of<00:03:08.690> a<00:03:08.750> sudden<00:03:09.170> they<00:03:09.650> develop<00:03:10.010> something

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
all of a sudden they develop something

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.520 
all of a sudden they develop something
called<00:03:10.250> clamp<00:03:10.880> it's<00:03:11.210> pausing<00:03:11.900> how<00:03:12.290> do<00:03:12.350> you

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
called clamp it's pausing how do you

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.199 
called clamp it's pausing how do you
remember<00:03:12.710> which<00:03:12.920> is<00:03:13.070> herb<00:03:13.310> do<00:03:13.610> chain<00:03:13.880> and

with<00:03:57.770> child<00:03:58.070> a<00:03:58.220> laboratory<00:03:59.030> anatomy<00:03:59.930> course

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
with child a laboratory anatomy course

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.400 
with child a laboratory anatomy course
go<00:04:00.800> to<00:04:00.830> the<00:04:01.070> lab<00:04:01.720> know<00:04:02.720> what<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:03.020> structure

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
go to the lab know what the structure

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.500 
go to the lab know what the structure
cold<00:04:03.860> then<00:04:04.340> go<00:04:04.580> in<00:04:04.640> the<00:04:04.730> body<00:04:04.970> and<00:04:05.270> actually

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
cold then go in the body and actually

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.199 
cold then go in the body and actually
tug<00:04:06.080> on<00:04:06.290> this<00:04:06.500> nerves<00:04:06.920> you<00:04:07.400> actually<00:04:07.730> baby<00:04:07.880> so

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
tug on this nerves you actually baby so

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.180 
tug on this nerves you actually baby so
it's<00:04:08.690> going<00:04:09.080> right<00:04:09.260> through<00:04:09.320> the<00:04:09.620> muscle<00:04:10.040> and

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
it's going right through the muscle and

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.820 
it's going right through the muscle and
now<00:04:10.700> even<00:04:10.940> makes<00:04:11.269> a<00:04:11.360> lot<00:04:11.540> more<00:04:11.570> sense<00:04:11.780> the<00:04:12.470> more

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
now even makes a lot more sense the more

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.100 
now even makes a lot more sense the more
you<00:04:13.130> practice<00:04:13.459> the<00:04:14.060> more<00:04:14.090> you<00:04:14.660> know<00:04:14.930> it

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
you practice the more you know it

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.740 
you practice the more you know it
