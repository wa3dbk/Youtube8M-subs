it works out really really good very
very<00:02:02.880> responsive<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:04.369> believe<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.610> can<00:02:05.729> also

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
very responsive I believe you can also

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.169 
very responsive I believe you can also
switch<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.530> t9<00:02:08.129> mode<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.759> let<00:02:08.910> me<00:02:09.000> see<00:02:09.149> if

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
switch to the t9 mode and let me see if

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.669 
switch to the t9 mode and let me see if
I<00:02:09.300> can<00:02:09.539> do<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:09.840> sometimes<00:02:10.259> it's<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.649> little

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
I can do it sometimes it's a little

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.940 
I can do it sometimes it's a little
tricky

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
tricky

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.009 
tricky
I<00:02:14.520> know<00:02:15.520> you<00:02:15.760> have<00:02:15.879> to<00:02:16.030> do<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.239> from<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.629> bottom

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
I know you have to do it from the bottom

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.660 
I know you have to do it from the bottom
there<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.099> go<00:02:18.250> so<00:02:19.239> that's<00:02:19.480> a<00:02:19.629> t9<00:02:20.080> mode<00:02:20.190> I<00:02:21.190> I

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
there you go so that's a t9 mode I I

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.089 
there you go so that's a t9 mode I I
like<00:02:22.120> actually<00:02:22.510> like<00:02:22.930> our<00:02:23.170> typing<00:02:23.620> in<00:02:23.739> t9<00:02:24.040> mode

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099
