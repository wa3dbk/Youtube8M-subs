00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 very often flying to montenegro 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.280
 have to do Serbian airlines 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.309
 very good company tariff they have the most 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.620
 Cheap but connecting flight Moscow 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.680
 Belgrade Belgrade Tivat 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.949
 for example or Belgrade Podgorica but 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.100
 you should not be afraid of the total arrival zone 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.340
 just need to go to the departure area and 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.949
 check in at the reception 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.980
 It takes about 20-25 minutes. 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.110
 at the airport of belgrade nikola tesla all 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.110
 easy enough to navigate 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.969
 on the signs that lead everywhere 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.550
 pointers to the transit zone and tincture 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:46.200
 check-in transit passengers 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.829
 in this case, go, go, go and see 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.760
 on the transfer zone transit indicator 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.010
 landing she is one landing zone 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:59.359
 big enough but also 1 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:04.470
 pointers will accompany us everywhere 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:06.960
 transfer transit connecting flight more 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.920
 addition if you bought a direct ticket from 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.350
 Moscow and Kiev, then you do not need to bathe 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.490
 reloading your luggage for you 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.979
 the airline automatically even 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:23.640
 come here to this stand and and you can see 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.340
 now looks like a rack for 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.200
 transit passengers may be needed 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.540
 purely symbolic to be noted 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.829
 because in fact you have the right to immediately 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.530
 go to flight gate for example on 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.270
 tivat is not even celebrated 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.310
 but I would recommend you all the same 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.970
 pay attention to the schedule for 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.420
 This flashing image circle 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.689
 noted exactly where the schedule is lit 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.119
 display device 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.500
 next we noted where the point is 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:58.820
 Serbian airlines to mark 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.710
 transit passengers and now we see 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.049
 for transit passengers of others 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.450
 airlines places to be noted 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.520
 there is more subtlety when buying in duty free 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.459
 fries from Moscow should not lead alcohol 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.590
 because with the transit of the airline 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.599
 security guards cut down transit duty free and 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.079
 require purchase and at the airport 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.219
 departures bear in mind an important detail 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.879
 typical for Belgrade only 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:24.999
 the airport 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:27.159
 here all security pass before 

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:29.500
 the very boarding of the plane is very 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:31.480
 uncomfortable and need to still do it 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.950
 in advance because in the drive 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.329
 Firstly, there are so many people and 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.909
 hitch on safer just can 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:42.159
 exhaust you nerves yourself 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:44.379
 do you understand people are different and different 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:47.370
 passes this place so come 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.370
 advance landing
