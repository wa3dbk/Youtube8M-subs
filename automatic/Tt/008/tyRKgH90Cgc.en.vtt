only supply list was on the moon or in
area<00:01:31.290> 51<00:01:31.650> which<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:31.860> pretty<00:01:31.979> stupid<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.549> go<00:01:32.729> to

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
area 51 which is pretty stupid to go to

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.310 
area 51 which is pretty stupid to go to
as<00:01:33.210> it's<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.659> high-security<00:01:34.409> military<00:01:35.369> base<00:01:36.320> so

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
as it's a high-security military base so

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.859 
as it's a high-security military base so
this<00:01:38.280> may<00:01:38.820> be<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.119> main<00:01:39.329> reason<00:01:39.600> for<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
this may be the main reason for the

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.499 
this may be the main reason for the
Russian<00:01:40.140> space<00:01:40.790> enthusiasm<00:01:41.790> not<00:01:41.970> not<00:01:42.210> in<00:01:42.329> real

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
Russian space enthusiasm not not in real

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.330 
Russian space enthusiasm not not in real
life<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.869> know<00:01:42.930> it's<00:01:43.170> not<00:01:43.320> real<00:01:43.590> stop<00:01:43.920> trolling

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
life I know it's not real stop trolling

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.030 
life I know it's not real stop trolling
about<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.700> but<00:01:45.600> like<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.140> game<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.829> may

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
about that but like in the game this may

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.510 
about that but like in the game this may
be<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.280> reason<00:01:47.399> why<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.720> game<00:01:48.899> life<00:01:49.530> may

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
be the reason why in the game life may

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.249 
be the reason why in the game life may
be<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.700> real<00:01:50.880> reason<00:01:51.240> why<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.780> Russians<00:01:51.960> went

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
be the real reason why the Russians went

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.460 
be the real reason why the Russians went
to<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.409> moon<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.860> um<00:01:53.780> here<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.899> can<00:01:55.049> see<00:01:55.229> here

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
to the moon and um here you can see here

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.700 
to the moon and um here you can see here
he<00:01:56.430> then<00:01:56.939> we<00:01:57.509> got<00:01:57.630> all<00:01:57.780> these<00:01:57.869> plans<00:01:58.140> down<00:01:58.500> here

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
he then we got all these plans down here

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.149 
he then we got all these plans down here
I<00:01:58.740> can't<00:01:59.040> really<00:01:59.159> make<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.430> out<00:02:00.920> and<00:02:01.920> then<00:02:01.950> you
