00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
we've got a bunch of developers we spent

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.590 
we've got a bunch of developers we spent
the<00:01:17.500> last<00:01:17.680> four<00:01:18.010> days<00:01:18.190> creating<00:01:18.970> applications

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
the last four days creating applications

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.130 
the last four days creating applications
for<00:01:20.440> a<00:01:20.470> smartphone<00:01:20.860> that<00:01:21.340> will<00:01:21.850> now<00:01:22.060> go<00:01:22.810> and

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
for a smartphone that will now go and

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.650 
for a smartphone that will now go and
into<00:01:23.800> your<00:01:23.950> dash<00:01:24.130> using<00:01:24.850> pioneer<00:01:25.240> zap<00:01:25.420> radio
