have pretty roomy baskets born in well
the<00:02:41.290> stroller<00:02:41.560> so<00:02:41.860> there's<00:02:42.070> no<00:02:42.220> differences

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
the stroller so there's no differences

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.780 
the stroller so there's no differences
there<00:02:43.360> they<00:02:44.200> both<00:02:44.410> have<00:02:44.710> a<00:02:44.740> cup<00:02:45.130> holder

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
there they both have a cup holder

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.930 
there they both have a cup holder
um<00:02:45.930> one<00:02:46.930> on<00:02:47.050> each<00:02:47.200> side<00:02:47.590> so<00:02:47.920> you<00:02:48.070> have<00:02:48.400> that<00:02:48.670> the

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
um one on each side so you have that the

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.450 
um one on each side so you have that the
same<00:02:49.210> they<00:02:49.990> canopies<00:02:50.770> let's<00:02:51.100> talk<00:02:51.310> about

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:51.460 
same they canopies let's talk about

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.900 
same they canopies let's talk about
these<00:02:51.700> canopies<00:02:52.270> the<00:02:52.450> canopies<00:02:53.080> are<00:02:53.910> the

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
these canopies the canopies are the

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.150 
these canopies the canopies are the
exact<00:02:55.300> same<00:02:55.330> that's<00:02:56.050> right<00:02:56.380> they<00:02:56.920> have<00:02:57.130> the

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
exact same that's right they have the

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.940 
exact same that's right they have the
same<00:02:57.520> coverage<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.390> same<00:02:58.690> pop-out<00:02:59.290> Sun<00:02:59.680> Visor

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
same coverage the same pop-out Sun Visor

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.990 
same coverage the same pop-out Sun Visor
neither<00:03:00.790> one<00:03:01.060> has<00:03:01.450> a<00:03:01.840> peekaboo<00:03:02.740> window<00:03:03.280> the

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
neither one has a peekaboo window the

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.750 
neither one has a peekaboo window the
back<00:03:04.330> of<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:05.230> G<00:03:05.620> locks<00:03:05.920> just<00:03:06.190> happens<00:03:06.520> to<00:03:06.580> be

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
back of the G locks just happens to be

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.600 
back of the G locks just happens to be
longer<00:03:07.030> because<00:03:07.270> the<00:03:07.600> seat<00:03:07.870> reclines<00:03:08.610> but

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
longer because the seat reclines but

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.330 
longer because the seat reclines but
otherwise<00:03:09.910> same<00:03:10.360> coverage<00:03:10.900> on<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.680> canopies

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
otherwise same coverage on the canopies

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.000 
otherwise same coverage on the canopies
now<00:03:13.090> one<00:03:13.780> of<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:14.020> second<00:03:14.770> biggest

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
now one of the second biggest

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.370 
now one of the second biggest
differences<00:03:15.820> is<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.120> wheel<00:03:16.780> so<00:03:17.080> let's<00:03:17.230> go

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
differences is the wheel so let's go

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.440 
differences is the wheel so let's go
down<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.710> wheels<00:03:17.980> and<00:03:18.100> look<00:03:18.190> at<00:03:18.310> those<00:03:18.450> big

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
down to the wheels and look at those big

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.390 
down to the wheels and look at those big
difference<00:03:19.840> in<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.020> wheels<00:03:20.230> now<00:03:21.070> they<00:03:21.280> both

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
difference in the wheels now they both

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.130 
difference in the wheels now they both
have<00:03:21.730> two<00:03:22.120> wheels<00:03:22.390> in<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.600> front<00:03:22.630> and<00:03:23.080> they

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
have two wheels in the front and they

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.480 
have two wheels in the front and they
both<00:03:23.290> have<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.560> ability<00:03:23.860> to<00:03:23.890> lock<00:03:24.160> straight

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
both have the ability to lock straight

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.430 
both have the ability to lock straight
so<00:03:24.670> that<00:03:24.700> is<00:03:25.120> the<00:03:25.240> same<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:26.050> difference<00:03:26.140> is

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
so that is the same the difference is

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.290 
so that is the same the difference is
the<00:03:26.620> size<00:03:26.920> and<00:03:27.280> how<00:03:27.520> the<00:03:27.580> wheels<00:03:27.880> are<00:03:28.000> shaped

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
the size and how the wheels are shaped

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.960 
the size and how the wheels are shaped
now<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:29.140> G<00:03:29.320> light<00:03:29.560> has<00:03:29.860> four<00:03:30.160> and<00:03:30.310> a<00:03:30.340> half<00:03:30.370> inch

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
now the G light has four and a half inch

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.760 
now the G light has four and a half inch
wheels<00:03:31.390> they<00:03:31.540> are<00:03:31.600> smaller<00:03:32.050> than<00:03:32.320> the<00:03:32.410> G<00:03:32.560> locks

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
wheels they are smaller than the G locks

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.490 
wheels they are smaller than the G locks
and<00:03:32.890> they<00:03:33.280> are<00:03:33.340> smooth<00:03:34.080> wheels<00:03:35.080> so<00:03:35.380> they're

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
and they are smooth wheels so they're

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.070 
and they are smooth wheels so they're
going<00:03:35.620> to<00:03:35.680> be<00:03:35.770> good<00:03:36.070> for<00:03:36.280> smooth<00:03:36.700> surfaces<00:03:37.360> the

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
going to be good for smooth surfaces the

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.960 
going to be good for smooth surfaces the
G<00:03:38.320> locks<00:03:38.590> on<00:03:38.740> the<00:03:38.830> other<00:03:38.980> hand<00:03:39.310> these<00:03:39.490> are<00:03:39.640> five

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
G locks on the other hand these are five

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.580 
G locks on the other hand these are five
and<00:03:40.240> a<00:03:40.270> half<00:03:40.330> inches<00:03:40.780> they're<00:03:40.960> bigger<00:03:41.260> wheels

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
and a half inches they're bigger wheels

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.590 
and a half inches they're bigger wheels
they<00:03:42.100> have<00:03:42.280> a<00:03:42.310> little<00:03:42.580> bit<00:03:42.700> of<00:03:42.790> tread<00:03:43.240> that's

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
they have a little bit of tread that's

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.090 
they have a little bit of tread that's
why<00:03:43.750> they<00:03:43.870> call<00:03:44.050> them<00:03:44.080> high-performance<00:03:44.920> and

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
why they call them high-performance and

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.520 
why they call them high-performance and
they're<00:03:45.850> going<00:03:46.090> to<00:03:46.300> tackle<00:03:46.540> a<00:03:46.900> little<00:03:47.350> bit<00:03:47.440> of

they're going to tackle a little bit of
terrain<00:03:47.830> a<00:03:48.040> little<00:03:48.490> bit<00:03:48.640> better<00:03:48.880> so<00:03:49.210> grass

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
terrain a little bit better so grass

this<00:03:50.110> one's<00:03:50.320> going<00:03:50.530> to<00:03:50.620> charge<00:03:50.830> through<00:03:51.010> it<00:03:51.070> a

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
this one's going to charge through it a

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.590 
this one's going to charge through it a
little<00:03:51.340> bit<00:03:51.550> better<00:03:51.730> than<00:03:52.000> this<00:03:52.150> one<00:03:52.390> because

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
in it the G line might be a better deal

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.890

because<00:05:16.980> it<00:05:17.130> is<00:05:17.220> cheaper<00:05:17.700> I<00:05:17.880> think<00:05:18.600> the<00:05:18.690> wheels

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
because it is cheaper I think the wheels

because it is cheaper I think the wheels
the<00:05:19.350> wheels<00:05:19.380> are<00:05:19.680> different<00:05:20.070> guests<00:05:20.280> but<00:05:20.700> as<00:05:21.060> a

the wheels are different guests but as a

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.880 
the wheels are different guests but as a
deal<00:05:21.600> breaker<00:05:21.780> probably<00:05:22.350> not<00:05:22.530> you're<00:05:22.770> going

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890
