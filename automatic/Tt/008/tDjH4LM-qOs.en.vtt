00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.820 
see how slightly that fitted in and out
on<00:02:25.790> a<00:02:25.850> tighter<00:02:26.180> coupling<00:02:26.690> I<00:02:26.870> think<00:02:27.560> it<00:02:27.740> would

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
on a tighter coupling I think it would

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.620 
on a tighter coupling I think it would
be<00:02:27.950> fine<00:02:30.130> even<00:02:31.130> great<00:02:31.430> cheaper<00:02:31.760> didn't<00:02:32.390> go<00:02:32.480> too

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
be fine even great cheaper didn't go too

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.270 
be fine even great cheaper didn't go too
bad<00:02:32.810> at<00:02:32.900> all<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.470> gun<00:02:33.650> shot<00:02:33.950> absolutely

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
bad at all the gun shot absolutely

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.740 
bad at all the gun shot absolutely
fantastic<00:02:35.210> so<00:02:37.030> ignoring<00:02:38.030> this<00:02:38.240> first<00:02:38.510> one

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
fantastic so ignoring this first one

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.110 
fantastic so ignoring this first one
which<00:02:38.930> was<00:02:39.140> rubbish<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:39.830> I<00:02:40.640> think<00:02:40.910> you<00:02:40.970> said

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
which was rubbish and I think you said

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.850 
which was rubbish and I think you said
it<00:02:41.180> was<00:02:41.300> a<00:02:41.330> slip<00:02:41.600> or<00:02:41.870> yeah<00:02:42.410> there's<00:02:42.710> a<00:02:42.740> good

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
it was a slip or yeah there's a good

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.770 
it was a slip or yeah there's a good
excuse<00:02:43.160> for<00:02:43.340> it<00:02:43.520> yeah<00:02:43.880> not<00:02:44.120> bad<00:02:44.240> grouping<00:02:44.570> here

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
excuse for it yeah not bad grouping here

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.870 
excuse for it yeah not bad grouping here
that's<00:02:45.170> still<00:02:45.380> an<00:02:45.470> inch<00:02:45.650> these<00:02:46.400> squares<00:02:46.730> were

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
that's still an inch these squares were

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.410 
that's still an inch these squares were
an<00:02:46.970> inch<00:02:47.120> square<00:02:47.420> so<00:02:48.260> first<00:02:49.040> shot<00:02:49.250> second<00:02:50.000> shot

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
an inch square so first shot second shot

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.670 
an inch square so first shot second shot
third<00:02:50.870> shot<00:02:51.110> straight<00:02:51.350> through<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.590> hole

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
third shot straight through the hole

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.680 
third shot straight through the hole
again<00:02:51.830> is<00:02:52.430> that<00:02:52.550> kind<00:02:52.760> of<00:02:52.790> how<00:02:52.880> it<00:02:52.970> works<00:02:53.180> so<00:02:53.570> it

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
again is that kind of how it works so it

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.000 
again is that kind of how it works so it
was<00:02:53.840> so<00:02:54.380> that's<00:02:54.530> not<00:02:54.620> a<00:02:54.680> bad<00:02:54.890> dream<00:02:55.160> yeah

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
that's not circuitry I know but not

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.570 
that's not circuitry I know but not
consistently<00:03:21.200> much<00:03:21.890> there's<00:03:22.190> a<00:03:22.250> bit<00:03:22.370> punchy

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
consistently much there's a bit punchy

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.160 
consistently much there's a bit punchy
isn't<00:03:22.910> it<00:03:22.970> it<00:03:23.180> is<00:03:23.300> a<00:03:23.330> little<00:03:23.570> bit<00:03:23.720> punchy<00:03:23.930> yeah

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
isn't it it is a little bit punchy yeah

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.720 
isn't it it is a little bit punchy yeah
but<00:03:24.530> so<00:03:24.650> whatever<00:03:24.920> that<00:03:25.100> is<00:03:25.220> in<00:03:25.370> those<00:03:25.519> sites

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
but so whatever that is in those sites

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:26.350 
but so whatever that is in those sites
is<00:03:25.880> dead

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.320 
properly that's what happens but there
were<00:05:47.930> a<00:05:47.990> few<00:05:48.020> logistical<00:05:48.740> issues<00:05:49.100> yeah<00:05:49.790> the

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
were a few logistical issues yeah the

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.620 
were a few logistical issues yeah the
camera<00:05:50.840> kept<00:05:51.260> trying<00:05:51.560> to<00:05:51.650> build<00:05:51.830> yeah<00:05:52.630> because

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
camera kept trying to build yeah because

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.450 
camera kept trying to build yeah because
we<00:05:53.840> always<00:05:54.170> think<00:05:54.470> that<00:05:54.530> actually<00:05:54.770> it's<00:05:55.190> the

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
we always think that actually it's the

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.880 
we always think that actually it's the
illuminator<00:05:56.390> and<00:05:56.510> screen<00:05:56.990> unit<00:05:57.410> there's

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:57.890 
illuminator and screen unit there's

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:59.260 
illuminator and screen unit there's
gonna<00:05:58.070> be<00:05:58.280> the<00:05:58.550> one<00:05:58.700> that's<00:05:58.730> causing<00:05:59.060> the

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
gonna be the one that's causing the

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.020 
gonna be the one that's causing the
problems<00:05:59.600> but<00:05:59.720> actually<00:05:59.870> it's<00:06:00.140> not<00:06:00.230> that<00:06:01.030> kick

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
problems but actually it's not that kick

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.390 
problems but actually it's not that kick
the<00:06:02.210> camera<00:06:02.630> slid<00:06:03.530> off<00:06:03.680> the<00:06:03.710> bag<00:06:03.860> which<00:06:04.250> you

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
the camera slid off the bag which you

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.490 
the camera slid off the bag which you
know<00:06:04.490> actually<00:06:04.820> makes<00:06:05.360> perfect<00:06:05.810> sense<00:06:05.960> yeah

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
know actually makes perfect sense yeah

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.560 
know actually makes perfect sense yeah
but<00:06:06.830> luckily<00:06:06.980> you've<00:06:07.250> got<00:06:07.400> that<00:06:07.490> big<00:06:07.790> you<00:06:08.480> know
