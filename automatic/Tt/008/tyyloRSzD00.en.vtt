00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.560
 hello and welcome and thanks for the 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.750
 tuning this is meeting solution and you 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.520
 channel android on this occasion we are going to 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.459
 do what is the review of a custom 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.490
 I'm really going to recommend it to you 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:20.550
 on a personal level this track I am 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.830
 testing is based on android 4.3 as 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.140
 a base rom but it also has all the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.269
 customization of samsung galaxy s 5 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.300
 so I recommend you try it 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.009
 that you download as long as you do what 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.840
 which is the backup of your fs folder and 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.539
 the android backup i am testing it and 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.910
 I have not found any error like 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:41.010
 come back I repeat you I recommend it is a 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.469
 rom that had influenced this 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.109
 personalized with the play the pre-salt layer 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.000
 action of the s5 which makes it a bit 

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:49.649
 more attractive and already have what 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.690
 national people that we have in the 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.670
 other versions we are going to enter what 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.530
 it's been the adjustments we're going to visit 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.780
 which is where it says more about the 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.910
 device to show them here we have 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.370
 What is the version of Android 4.3 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.040
 the name of the rom is called efe extreme 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.580
 lightroom so all the rights 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.430
 for your developer and then here 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.110
 we have this rom in this terminal is it 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.810
 tested and everything works properly 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.850
 fluid completely I have not had any 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.720
 problem here shows us what's coming 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:26.240
 being what from my my magazine that 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.550
 that's what they do not know is a 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.740
 news magazine we will be 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.140
 back we can see that we have here what 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.670
 which is the doubles of the s5 what are the 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.040
 adjustments these adjustments we can 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.450
 modify as we want we are going to 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.039
 enter what can of applications the 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.280
 application drawer we can find 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:44.020
 that comes without comes with the application 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.369
 from the web 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.740
 then net flaquer that we can 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.660
 install and we can configure it with 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.100
 this application we can also 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.450
 find that we have what comes 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.580
 being the post installers is for 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.020
 install some engines do not want that 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.820
 we want to personalize even more this 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.380
 application and we go what comes 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.700
 being the adjustments the adjustments are the 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.560
 same as we have seen in the other 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.270
 Android versions that no longer come 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.980
 by icons finally by come by 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.860
 sections we can see here 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:12.710
 what are the accounts in more 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.540
 the battery I'm trying it is going very well 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.810
 I have no complaints about this terminal 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.640
 the cloaca edge to disconnect because no 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.040
 I was using it but really already 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.450
 I tried it and do not complain let's get it 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.710
 what is it to youtube to see that 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.670
 it works correctly what the 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.650
 reproducer because we have had 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.530
 problems with a rom we have 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.110
 updated we have given support in this 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.000
 channel that had a lot of problems what 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.730
 is the reproduction going to 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.860
 enter or never to a video we will be 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.400
 here to the project by 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.400
 to see here 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.850
 As you can see it works correctly 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.190
 without any problem 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.830
 the Roman vein of this rosemary is 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.020
 based on android 4.3 they used it as 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.730
 a base rom for this terminal and 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.620
 they really did an excellent job 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.470
 because most of the rom we have 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.060
 used are based on the archi 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.460
 by and remember that the 'red' chi x 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.900
 still not in its final phase 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.190
 or whether we find problems and 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.650
 still adding what is the 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.420
 personalization what that will generate 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.550
 a lot of mistakes and that is what we have 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.350
 come noticing until the time of now 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.870
 with this type of theft but well here they 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.910
 I bring what is the solution they want 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.650
 use a stable rom and with the 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.570
 customization of the s5 well here the 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.420
 they have the downloads from the description 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.920
 of the video really works for me very 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.240
 ok let's go in what to the 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.690
 application of us from our 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:44.290
 community is well fluent is used 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.990
 about 500 or 450 megabytes we go to 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.700
 visualize what we are going to see here we are going to 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.550
 wait what is the task mentor and 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.660
 ram we go let's have 742 we're going to 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:55.810
 delete 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:58.210
 how can you see that we have 589 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.800
 megas that's what you have used 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.780
 currently the rom 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.820
 as everyone knows that layers of 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.890
 personalization take up much more memory 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.020
 so when it comes to using the 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.090
 terminal then not so that a little slow 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.850
 but the truth will not have any 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:14.590
 problem with this rom let's enter what 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.860
 what is the camera that works 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.860
 very good 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.799
 this 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.790
 this photo was touching them 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.280
 previously 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.840
 but well this is a rom so that the 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.240
 We are recommending from in our 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.540
 channel so all the rights for your 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:43.000
 developer and without more to tell them 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.400
 because this rom really works 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.770
 correctly for our terminal 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.930
 Samsung Galaxy S3 and 9,300 is a single 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.300
 package we went through recovery then 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.620
 well before doing the past by 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.820
 We recollect do what is making 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.440
 three strokes then we went through 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.780
 recovery and restart the terminal and 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.400
 ready remember always to do what 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.350
 what is the android backup and also what 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.850
 which is the folder the backup 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.100
 from the folder of fs so you do not have 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.870
 no problem now I 'm going to show you 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.370
 what is navigation with google 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:11.350
 chrome with this rom will show the 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.010
 google chrome let's go in our 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.830
 Web page 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.810
 hopefully loads sometimes when 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.550
 late when loading a rom or not always 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.170
 means that it is the problem of the rom or 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.120
 phone but the bandwidth 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.680
 that we have hired 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.750
 you can not see that he has loaded very well 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.230
 which is the one on our page 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.930
 Web 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.640
 as salt after what is on the menu we go 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:34.720
 to other applications to see how 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.720
 load fast 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.319
 there we have what are the applications 

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:41.669
 this has been all because you already know if it has 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:44.009
 liked the video so give us a 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:45.899
