00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.679
 we are still that he is not here Â»but further north in 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:31.809
 Australia 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:35.320
 and Kerns is the outlier Zionsberg trigger for that path the 

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:36.670
 compulsory military service 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.670
 and that's what we do now 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.410
 s 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.100
 Euro 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.710
 Dr 1 have another 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.160
 unfortunately not sbm 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.799
 the sending of a text message or the water stirred up that's why he's there 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.799
 Bundeswehr soldiers are just the beginning to be made 

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:37.499
 this is true 

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:41.499
 and maybe I can 

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:08.619
 it is a laptop transfer 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.989
 with the city because of that Companies Clubhouse 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.359
 but you can see that you are not 4 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.349
 what we have seen today is almost on what you are sure of that 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.249
 Wiesbaden 

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:26.409
 and the fans wanted to insert and random company that is not so 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:29.479
 So you only see a few addresses 

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:31.049
 the travel portal 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.029
 and that's why the Dragons already in Estonia one each from Americans British 

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:37.039
 both 

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:42.229
 he has just told a rousing she is improving Iran Breweries 19 

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:45.229
 and then he said yesterday 

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:50.459
 and very exciting the road was to admire and now 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.459
 if two is about what he is at 2 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.819
 I have some trains through the train 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:05.299
 Set the euro on the way 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.299
 the first trip around the world 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.919
 how far that should be 

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:16.969
 he loves 4000 

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:19.969
 Maybe he was open 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.660
 that's why I'm going to fly the sky 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.059
 Once again we say that nobody is saying fruit bats 

00:04:47.059 --> 00:04:51.859
 and the zeitgeist has said that moving us out of the city is something we are all about 

00:04:51.859 --> 00:04:54.329
 Weather wise, something bad before
