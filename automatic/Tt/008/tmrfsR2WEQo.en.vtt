00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 Hello everyone, today let's talk about weapons 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.670
 umbilical before starting the topic 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.800
 as you can see in overlay 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:13.469
 match the surgical reduction of a 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.109
 america i hope you can please 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.900
 some of you what is mine 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.539
 umbilical le americans is a hernia 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.240
 external abdominal there is a defect of the 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.560
 abdominal wall for which one occurs 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.090
 protrusion of the abdominal organs 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.000
 outwards 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.750
 in this case through the ring 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.760
 umbilical is usually hernia true 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.059
 that is, we obviously find content 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.309
 inside this bag to undermine 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:47.129
 it is usually in my congenital 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:49.530
 due to a defect in the companies months 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.010
 in the umbilical ring usually in the 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.460
 fetus passes the umbilical vessels the duct 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.090
 calf the peduncle of the aran removes 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.260
 which of course after birth 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.420
 all these structures obviously 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.270
 regress and the ring should 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.310
 close in some subjects this 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.380
 ring did not close too lario 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.610
 therefore it allows the leakage 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.670
 this through this ring 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.939
 abdominal contents hole towards 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:25.500
 obviously the outside very often the 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.520
 content is the increase sometimes a little more 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.890
 critical 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.020
 it can also erode part of the intestine 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.000
 practice you have to be careful that 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.440
 the ring then does not restrict this 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.130
 content is that away 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.550
 life a herniated strangled in general la 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.020
 therapy a surgical reduction 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.030
 of the hernia practically opens 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.130
 obviously the skin takes the 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.500
 content deleted and through the 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.260
 forum returns to the abdomen closes the 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.840
 hole will close the skin under the skin 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.310
 and it's an intervention let's say enough about 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.530
 routine is never an emerging one 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.070
 surgical at least that hernia 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:06.130
 obviously strangled I hope this 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.160
 video you enjoyed and see you at 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.160
 next
