 rhythmic gymnastics for abalakova 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.930
 sport is pretty new and therefore 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.790
 of great interest as 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.670
 it turned out they would like to deal with many 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.920
 young residents of our city in this 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.929
 Veronica Bolekâ€™s coach was convinced 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.180
 which over the past year has already managed 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.609
 prepare your pupils for the first 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.350
 serious start we went to the city 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.560

 Academy of Physical Education 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.289
 Here we went to the mountains of Sarata where our 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.750
 girls entered the top five 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.059
 last year both for the coach and for her 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.340
 alumni was difficult but interesting 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.230
 it's always difficult to start especially there 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.239
 where rhythmic gymnastics as a species 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.030
 sports exactly at the professional level 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.879
 never happened but as the saying goes 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.039
 trouble started and now there are results 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.739
 and first champions such as 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.020
 seven-year-old marina vedeneeva which in 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.829
 rhythmic gymnastics led mom 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.350

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:04.409
 gymnastics I ranked second 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.180
 place third place and such young 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.220
 athletes in the art section 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.439
 gymnastics a lot according to Veronica 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.930
 Bolek is probably the only species 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.689
 sports where to start classes is already possible with 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.000
 three and a half 4 years in this 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.790
 age which develops flexibility 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.590
