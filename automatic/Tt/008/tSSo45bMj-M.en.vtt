we're<00:01:55.450> going<00:01:55.570> to<00:01:55.600> do<00:01:55.780> now<00:01:55.990> is<00:01:56.380> we're<00:01:56.650> going<00:01:56.740> to

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
we're going to do now is we're going to

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.200 
we're going to do now is we're going to
push<00:01:57.070> she's<00:01:57.670> already<00:01:57.970> at<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.270> top<00:01:59.040> so<00:02:00.210> by

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
push she's already at the top so by

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.630 
push she's already at the top so by
pulling<00:02:01.450> this<00:02:01.630> lever<00:02:02.220> what<00:02:03.220> I'm<00:02:03.310> going<00:02:03.430> to<00:02:03.580> be

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
pulling this lever what I'm going to be

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.090 
pulling this lever what I'm going to be
able<00:02:03.760> to<00:02:03.910> do<00:02:04.060> is<00:02:04.300> just<00:02:07.380> drop<00:02:08.380> it<00:02:08.560> down<00:02:08.770> and

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
able to do is just drop it down and

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.140 
able to do is just drop it down and
she'll<00:02:10.000> move<00:02:10.180> maybe<00:02:10.600> one<00:02:10.930> inch<00:02:11.850> that's<00:02:12.850> all

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
she'll move maybe one inch that's all

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.600 
she'll move maybe one inch that's all
then<00:02:13.810> let<00:02:14.680> her<00:02:14.770> come<00:02:14.950> all<00:02:15.070> the<00:02:15.130> way<00:02:15.160> back<00:02:15.280> up<00:02:15.430> to

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
then let her come all the way back up to

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.930 
then let her come all the way back up to
the<00:02:15.760> top<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:17.110> then<00:02:17.290> hopefully<00:02:17.890> she's<00:02:18.610> good<00:02:18.790> to

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
the top and then hopefully she's good to

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:19.290 
the top and then hopefully she's good to
go

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
go

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.580 
go
fill<00:02:19.540> tap<00:02:19.780> off<00:02:20.460> and<00:02:21.460> then<00:02:21.610> we<00:02:22.000> just<00:02:22.120> give<00:02:22.300> a<00:02:22.590> big

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
fill tap off and then we just give a big

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:38.630 
fill tap off and then we just give a big
kick

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.270 

it's<00:02:38.790> good<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.120> go
