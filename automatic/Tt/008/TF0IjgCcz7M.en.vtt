00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.520
 my name is silvia lopez and i am seat 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.520
 and 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.489
 here in the ship to 122 in seat barcelona 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.070
 they hide authentic gems of the 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.760
 collection seat 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:46.430
 here we have 263 cars spread between 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.470
 classic cars production concept 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.690
 cars and racing cars 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.060
 when I walk between all these cars 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.890
 I have a very special feeling about 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.230
 luck that I have to be able to work with 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.410
 the history of seat and all its 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.270
 models that not only represent a 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.559
 great brand but of the story of a 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.559
 country of a country's mobility 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.670
 see how you recover a car that is 60 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.260
 years and that in the end you leave it better than 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.870
 when he left the line 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.940
 My commitment is not only to have the cars 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.370
 nice to take photos in a way 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.920
 static but that they come alive that 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:31.400
 they may be working perfectly 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.140
 to show the cars in motion 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.000
 we organize or participate in different 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.200
 events during the year now what 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
 we are doing are the last 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.040
 preparations for the Costa Brava rally 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.040
 where we participate with four cars 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.960
 very welcome 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.960
 ostrava 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.140
 how it goes everything is all right 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.140
 boots the first network and stable 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.980
 it is very rewarding to see and check 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:19.670
 on the road how well they go and today 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:23.080
 we have the conditions a little more 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:26.210
 complicated because it's still raining 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.280
 We even have information that in 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.280
 sant hilari is snowing but go the 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.360
 cars are prepared for these 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.360
 climatological adversities 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:43.640
 ten minutes, sales 53 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.680
 ibiza ibiza who we serve have 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.240
 a frantic pace because we have very 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.010
 little time to review all the 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.450
 cars to work perfectly 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.450
 for the next stretch 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.280
 it is impressive what can reach 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.680
 enjoy the dog 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.959
 how do we restore the cars as they 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.540
 we give life and put them in the 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.550
 roads to enjoy them all 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.530
 the world because the truth is that it is a 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.530
 feeling that it is very difficult 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.200
 I am very lucky to work in my 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.569
 hobby in what I like most are the 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.139
 cars and since very small has been like this 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:23.329
 I have been able to work in my seat stage 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:26.450
 sport with the best engineers winning 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:28.819
 worldwide and now the truth is that 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.079
 I'm surprised with myself 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.079
 that I like the classics
