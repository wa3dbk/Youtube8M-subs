combo potential on Roy

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.360 
combo potential on Roy
since<00:00:03.899> Roy's<00:00:04.110> weight<00:00:04.500> is<00:00:04.830> actually<00:00:05.190> really

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
since Roy's weight is actually really

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.780 
since Roy's weight is actually really
easy<00:00:05.460> to<00:00:06.000> combo<00:00:06.660> it<00:00:07.470> might<00:00:08.160> spell<00:00:08.400> trouble<00:00:08.610> for

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
easy to combo it might spell trouble for

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.580 
easy to combo it might spell trouble for
Cosmo<00:00:09.300> yeah<00:00:09.719> you<00:00:09.809> don't<00:00:09.960> have<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.139> same<00:00:10.320> sort

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
Cosmo yeah you don't have the same sort

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.959 
Cosmo yeah you don't have the same sort
of<00:00:10.710> like<00:00:10.830> safe<00:00:11.070> out<00:00:11.219> of<00:00:11.250> shield<00:00:11.490> options<00:00:11.820> like

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
of like safe out of shield options like

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.249 
of like safe out of shield options like
I'll<00:00:12.120> be<00:00:12.210> out<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.330> shield<00:00:12.599> if<00:00:12.780> you're<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:12.929> Martha

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
I'll be out of shield if you're a Martha

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.589 
I'll be out of shield if you're a Martha
or<00:00:13.740> like<00:00:14.250> even<00:00:14.490> Farah<00:00:14.940> she'll<00:00:15.240> doesn't<00:00:15.509> give

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
or like even Farah she'll doesn't give

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.910 
or like even Farah she'll doesn't give
you<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.719> space<00:00:15.960> that<00:00:16.170> I'm<00:00:16.260> Martha<00:00:16.440> give<00:00:16.740> you

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
you the space that I'm Martha give you

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.010 
you the space that I'm Martha give you
so<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:18.150> looks<00:00:18.359> like<00:00:18.449> we're<00:00:18.570> going<00:00:18.690> right<00:00:18.869> into

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
so it looks like we're going right into

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.769 
so it looks like we're going right into
it<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.430> that's<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.580> battlefield<00:00:20.970> stage<00:00:21.210> first

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
it so that's the battlefield stage first

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.320 
it so that's the battlefield stage first
off<00:00:22.080> and<00:00:22.410> just<00:00:22.859> look<00:00:23.369> at<00:00:23.490> recite<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.939> sort<00:00:24.240> of

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
off and just look at recite to sort of

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.960 
off and just look at recite to sort of
dictate<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.750> flow<00:00:24.840> with<00:00:25.050> lasers<00:00:25.410> space<00:00:26.220> Cosmo

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
dictate the flow with lasers space Cosmo

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.000 
dictate the flow with lasers space Cosmo
out<00:00:27.119> because<00:00:27.420> Roy<00:00:27.750> really<00:00:28.080> can't<00:00:28.500> approach<00:00:28.740> if

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
out because Roy really can't approach if

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.859 
out because Roy really can't approach if
so<00:00:29.189> either<00:00:29.760> just<00:00:30.060> shooting<00:00:30.300> these<00:00:30.359> lasers<00:00:30.720> in

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
so either just shooting these lasers in

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.830 
so either just shooting these lasers in
his<00:00:30.960> face<00:00:31.250> the<00:00:32.250> lasers<00:00:32.790> are<00:00:32.910> really<00:00:33.120> good<00:00:33.300> so

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
his face the lasers are really good so

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.500 
his face the lasers are really good so
control<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.860> ground<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.790> lock<00:00:36.180> down

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
control to the ground and to lock down

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.860 
control to the ground and to lock down
Cosmo<00:00:37.440> as<00:00:37.559> well<00:00:37.800> he<00:00:38.430> can<00:00:38.640> use<00:00:38.940> back<00:00:39.270> air<00:00:39.480> to

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
Cosmo as well he can use back air to

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.810 
Cosmo as well he can use back air to
help<00:00:40.079> with<00:00:40.290> Crouch<00:00:40.530> cancels<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.160> also<00:00:41.520> tear

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
though that can get Crouch cancelled it

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.729 
though that can get Crouch cancelled it
needs<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.780> be<00:00:45.870> careful<00:00:46.200> for<00:00:46.289> instance<00:00:46.559> Cosmo

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
needs to be careful for instance Cosmo

and<00:03:34.950> if<00:03:35.190> you<00:03:35.280> miss<00:03:35.549> the<00:03:36.180> punish<00:03:36.450> you<00:03:36.569> quite

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
and if you miss the punish you quite

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.900 
and if you miss the punish you quite
handily<00:03:37.260> well<00:03:38.250> maybe<00:03:38.370> I'm<00:03:38.549> supposed<00:03:38.639> to<00:03:38.790> be<00:03:38.880> a

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
handily well maybe I'm supposed to be a

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.730 
handily well maybe I'm supposed to be a
pivot<00:03:39.209> for<00:03:39.359> smash<00:03:39.630> then

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
pivot for smash then

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.310 
pivot for smash then
that'll<00:03:41.740> do<00:03:41.860> it<00:03:41.890> for<00:03:42.070> Game<00:03:42.310> one<00:03:42.390> yeah<00:03:43.390> that<00:03:43.840> 1%

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
that'll do it for Game one yeah that 1%

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.710 
that'll do it for Game one yeah that 1%
keeping<00:03:45.070> him<00:03:45.160> from<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.370> JV<00:03:45.580> 3<00:03:45.760> but<00:03:46.330> I<00:03:46.360> was

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
keeping him from the JV 3 but I was

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.780 
keeping him from the JV 3 but I was
pretty<00:03:46.960> solid<00:03:47.200> to<00:03:47.530> stock<00:03:47.800> right<00:03:48.010> there<00:03:48.220> sighs

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
pretty solid to stock right there sighs

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.550 
pretty solid to stock right there sighs
all<00:03:49.660> right<00:03:49.750> so<00:03:49.810> what's<00:03:50.050> the<00:03:50.110> counter<00:03:50.410> pick

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
all right so what's the counter pick

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.140 
all right so what's the counter pick
game<00:03:50.770> here<00:03:50.980> what<00:03:51.130> are<00:03:51.190> you<00:03:51.250> what<00:03:51.850> do<00:03:51.910> you<00:03:51.940> think

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
game here what are you what do you think

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.890 
game here what are you what do you think
I<00:03:52.930> could<00:03:53.370> see<00:03:54.370> final<00:03:54.850> destination<00:03:55.510> for<00:03:55.750> Roy

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
I could see final destination for Roy

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.100 
I could see final destination for Roy
but<00:03:56.890> I'm<00:03:57.340> not<00:03:57.580> sure<00:03:57.820> how<00:03:58.000> good<00:03:58.210> cosmo<00:03:58.660> is<00:03:58.840> with

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
but I'm not sure how good cosmo is with

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.950 
but I'm not sure how good cosmo is with
power<00:03:59.770> shields<00:04:00.280> so<00:04:00.700> he<00:04:01.300> probably<00:04:01.480> might<00:04:01.750> opt

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
power shields so he probably might opt

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.390 
power shields so he probably might opt
for<00:04:02.140> something<00:04:02.500> with<00:04:02.680> platforms<00:04:03.190> that<00:04:03.250> are

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
for something with platforms that are

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.610 
for something with platforms that are
quite<00:04:03.550> low<00:04:03.730> and<00:04:04.150> there<00:04:04.630> you<00:04:04.720> have<00:04:04.750> it<00:04:04.900> low

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
quite low and there you have it low

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.740 
quite low and there you have it low
platforms<00:04:06.220> I<00:04:06.460> assuming<00:04:07.330> this<00:04:07.390> is<00:04:07.540> also

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
platforms I assuming this is also

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.420 
platforms I assuming this is also
best-of-three<00:04:08.050> if<00:04:08.290> we're<00:04:08.620> in<00:04:08.710> losers<00:04:09.070> not

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
best-of-three if we're in losers not

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.370 
best-of-three if we're in losers not
even<00:04:09.880> close<00:04:10.060> to<00:04:10.180> fate<00:04:10.450> yeah<00:04:10.810> but<00:04:10.990> I<00:04:11.080> guess<00:04:11.230> we

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
even close to fate yeah but I guess we

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:21.210 
even close to fate yeah but I guess we
don't<00:04:11.500> know<00:04:11.680> we'll<00:04:12.600> bracket<00:04:13.600> scenario<00:04:14.020> so<00:04:20.220> you

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
don't know we'll bracket scenario so you

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.830 
don't know we'll bracket scenario so you
could<00:04:21.370> see<00:04:21.549> cosmos<00:04:22.000> just<00:04:22.210> trying<00:04:22.420> to<00:04:22.510> stay<00:04:22.660> out

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
could see cosmos just trying to stay out

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.140 
could see cosmos just trying to stay out
of<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:23.260> range<00:04:23.500> of<00:04:23.860> the<00:04:24.100> lasers<00:04:24.490> like<00:04:24.970> he'll

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
of the range of the lasers like he'll

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.100 
of the range of the lasers like he'll
jump<00:04:25.390> over<00:04:25.780> it<00:04:27.120> that's<00:04:28.120> a<00:04:28.240> tough<00:04:28.270> that's<00:04:28.690> a

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
jump over it that's a tough that's a

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.240 
jump over it that's a tough that's a
tough<00:04:29.140> spot<00:04:29.560> to<00:04:29.860> try<00:04:30.220> to<00:04:30.990> catch<00:04:31.990> Falco<00:04:32.860> in<00:04:33.010> as

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
tough spot to try to catch Falco in as

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.890 
tough spot to try to catch Falco in as
you<00:04:33.430> saw<00:04:33.640> he<00:04:34.000> went<00:04:34.210> for<00:04:34.390> the<00:04:34.450> flare<00:04:34.690> blade

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
you saw he went for the flare blade

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.810 
you saw he went for the flare blade
right<00:04:35.080> and<00:04:35.500> then<00:04:35.710> he<00:04:36.280> couldn't<00:04:36.520> like<00:04:36.640> turn

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
right and then he couldn't like turn

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.370 
right and then he couldn't like turn
around<00:04:37.090> up<00:04:37.210> to<00:04:37.360> like<00:04:37.540> a<00:04:37.570> Martha<00:04:37.870> would<00:04:38.080> cut

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
around up to like a Martha would cut

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.140 
around up to like a Martha would cut
this<00:04:38.500> up<00:04:38.680> till<00:04:38.860> you<00:04:39.400> know<00:04:39.520> you<00:04:39.580> have<00:04:39.820> to<00:04:40.000> like

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
this up till you know you have to like

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.870 
this up till you know you have to like
aim<00:04:40.330> it<00:04:40.480> properly<00:04:40.990> get<00:04:41.830> the<00:04:41.950> inside<00:04:42.400> hit<00:04:42.610> right

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
aim it properly get the inside hit right

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.620 
aim it properly get the inside hit right
near<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.090> hill<00:04:45.060> another<00:04:46.060> miss<00:04:46.330> Connor<00:04:46.540> I

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
near the hill another miss Connor I

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.060 
near the hill another miss Connor I
think<00:04:46.840> we've<00:04:46.960> seen<00:04:47.140> four<00:04:47.410> counters<00:04:47.770> so<00:04:47.890> far

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
think we've seen four counters so far

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.170 
think we've seen four counters so far
from<00:04:48.220> shots<00:04:48.430> but<00:04:48.520> I<00:04:48.580> don't<00:04:48.700> think<00:04:48.820> any<00:04:48.940> of<00:04:49.030> them

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
from shots but I don't think any of them

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.390 
from shots but I don't think any of them
have<00:04:49.360> connected<00:04:49.780> obviously<00:04:50.650> like<00:04:50.860> if<00:04:51.040> it<00:04:51.250> does

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
have connected obviously like if it does

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.220 
have connected obviously like if it does
connect<00:04:51.700> with<00:04:51.880> the<00:04:52.000> like<00:04:52.660> the<00:04:52.840> fact<00:04:53.020> that<00:04:53.080> it

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
connect with the like the fact that it

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.810 
connect with the like the fact that it
not<00:04:53.680> it<00:04:53.920> doesn't<00:04:54.220> double<00:04:54.400> the<00:04:54.460> damage<00:04:54.580> what

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
not it doesn't double the damage what

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.060 
not it doesn't double the damage what
it's<00:04:54.940> like<00:04:55.030> a<00:04:55.060> one-point<00:04:55.630> three<00:04:55.870> sort<00:04:56.860> of<00:04:56.950> it

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
it's like a one-point three sort of it

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.130 
it's like a one-point three sort of it
it's<00:04:57.430> amazing<00:04:57.790> and<00:04:58.120> that<00:04:58.270> it<00:04:58.630> deals<00:04:59.020> more

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
it's amazing and that it deals more

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:00.930 
it's amazing and that it deals more
damage<00:04:59.320> than<00:04:59.950> it<00:05:00.100> would<00:05:00.220> have<00:05:00.250> received<00:05:00.580> yeah

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
damage than it would have received yeah

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.580 
damage than it would have received yeah
and<00:05:01.090> yet<00:05:01.480> another<00:05:01.720> this<00:05:01.990> is<00:05:02.140> really<00:05:02.470> good

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
and yet another this is really good

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.560 
and yet another this is really good
stuff<00:05:02.620> I<00:05:02.950> sight<00:05:03.220> to<00:05:03.400> avoid<00:05:03.730> these<00:05:03.940> counters<00:05:04.360> oh

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
stuff I sight to avoid these counters oh

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.570 
stuff I sight to avoid these counters oh
there<00:05:07.570> it<00:05:07.690> is<00:05:07.840> yeah<00:05:08.140> see<00:05:08.919> that's<00:05:09.010> the<00:05:09.250> thing

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
there it is yeah see that's the thing

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.400 
there it is yeah see that's the thing
about<00:05:09.669> Falco<00:05:10.240> means<00:05:10.419> right<00:05:10.690> a<00:05:10.840> lot<00:05:11.140> of<00:05:11.260> them

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
about Falco means right a lot of them

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.310 
about Falco means right a lot of them
are<00:05:11.560> quite<00:05:11.919> aggressive<00:05:12.960> since<00:05:13.960> they<00:05:14.080> have<00:05:14.200> the

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
are quite aggressive since they have the

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.800 
are quite aggressive since they have the
laser<00:05:14.500> and<00:05:15.160> all<00:05:15.250> these<00:05:15.370> aerials<00:05:16.210> that<00:05:16.480> have

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
laser and all these aerials that have

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.320 
laser and all these aerials that have
great<00:05:17.110> range<00:05:17.430> they<00:05:18.430> stun<00:05:18.760> you<00:05:18.880> pretty<00:05:19.120> well

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:19.330 
great range they stun you pretty well

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.990 
great range they stun you pretty well
and<00:05:19.630> if<00:05:20.169> he<00:05:20.500> happens<00:05:20.860> to<00:05:21.070> hit<00:05:21.220> your<00:05:21.340> shield<00:05:21.610> he

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 
and if he happens to hit your shield he

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.690 
and if he happens to hit your shield he
can<00:05:22.180> shine<00:05:22.390> and<00:05:22.690> just<00:05:22.840> go<00:05:23.020> crazy<00:05:23.380> so<00:05:23.980> the<00:05:24.460> fact

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
can shine and just go crazy so the fact

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.010 
can shine and just go crazy so the fact
that<00:05:24.760> cost<00:05:24.970> went<00:05:25.150> went<00:05:25.270> for<00:05:25.390> that<00:05:25.480> counter<00:05:25.810> was

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
that cost went went for that counter was

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.040 
that cost went went for that counter was
really<00:05:26.290> smart<00:05:26.790> don't<00:05:27.790> only<00:05:27.970> cuz<00:05:28.450> Broncos<00:05:28.810> will

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
really smart don't only cuz Broncos will

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.720 
really smart don't only cuz Broncos will
go<00:05:29.230> in<00:05:29.410> and<00:05:29.620> I<00:05:29.740> like<00:05:29.919> the<00:05:30.070> Ford<00:05:30.310> smashing<00:05:30.669> as

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730 
go in and I like the Ford smashing as

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.460 
go in and I like the Ford smashing as

see right here Cosmo hanging near the

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.790 
see right here Cosmo hanging near the
edge<00:05:34.240> if<00:05:34.540> you<00:05:34.720> got<00:05:34.930> a<00:05:34.960> graph<00:05:35.230> you<00:05:35.560> could<00:05:35.650> have

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
edge if you got a graph you could have

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.380 
edge if you got a graph you could have
set<00:05:35.950> up<00:05:36.040> for<00:05:36.070> a<00:05:36.220> situation<00:05:36.400> where<00:05:36.880> you<00:05:37.180> might

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
set up for a situation where you might

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.240 
set up for a situation where you might
be<00:05:37.419> able<00:05:37.630> to<00:05:37.780> toss<00:05:37.960> scythe<00:05:38.230> offstage<00:05:38.650> and<00:05:38.860> and

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
be able to toss scythe offstage and and

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:40.620 
be able to toss scythe offstage and and
it's<00:05:39.400> not<00:05:39.580> quite<00:05:39.790> early<00:05:39.910> definitely<00:05:40.510> that

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630 
it's not quite early definitely that

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.780 
it's not quite early definitely that
down<00:05:40.810> throw<00:05:41.050> is<00:05:41.110> such<00:05:41.410> an<00:05:41.560> effective<00:05:42.520> gift

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
down throw is such an effective gift

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.580 
down throw is such an effective gift
tool<00:05:43.030> especially<00:05:43.540> if<00:05:43.960> you<00:05:44.140> were<00:05:44.230> to<00:05:44.320> read<00:05:44.500> the

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
tool especially if you were to read the

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.260 
tool especially if you were to read the
jump<00:05:44.860> and<00:05:45.070> throw<00:05:45.370> maybe<00:05:45.580> a<00:05:45.700> jab<00:05:45.910> or<00:05:45.940> a<00:05:46.090> down

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
jump and throw maybe a jab or a down

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.360 
jump and throw maybe a jab or a down
tool<00:05:46.480> but<00:05:46.660> then<00:05:46.750> again<00:05:46.870> if<00:05:47.169> Roy<00:05:47.980> were<00:05:48.160> to<00:05:48.250> throw

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
tool but then again if Roy were to throw

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.560 
tool but then again if Roy were to throw
that<00:05:48.460> down<00:05:48.669> till<00:05:48.880> it<00:05:49.090> would<00:05:49.180> just<00:05:49.330> pop<00:05:49.419> them

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:49.570 
that down till it would just pop them

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:50.820 
that down till it would just pop them
right<00:05:49.600> back<00:05:49.810> up<00:05:49.990> instead<00:05:50.289> of<00:05:50.380> doing<00:05:50.560> the<00:05:50.620> marks

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
right back up instead of doing the marks

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:51.500 
right back up instead of doing the marks
back<00:05:50.979> to<00:05:51.130> 19

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
back to 19

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.660 
back to 19
down<00:05:51.720> so<00:05:52.470> a<00:05:52.800> lot<00:05:52.980> more<00:05:53.160> work<00:05:53.280> to<00:05:53.340> be<00:05:53.400> done<00:05:53.490> but

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:53.670 
down so a lot more work to be done but

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.030 
down so a lot more work to be done but
definitely<00:05:54.030> it<00:05:54.180> could<00:05:54.420> have<00:05:54.540> set<00:05:55.410> him<00:05:55.620> up<00:05:55.650> for

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.040 
definitely it could have set him up for

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.540 
definitely it could have set him up for
a<00:05:56.070> quick<00:05:56.640> stock<00:05:57.360> but<00:05:57.660> team<00:05:58.080> site<00:05:58.740> going<00:05:59.250> in

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
a quick stock but team site going in

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.550 
a quick stock but team site going in
right<00:06:00.060> now<00:06:00.270> okay<00:06:00.660> yes<00:06:00.930> really<00:06:01.410> nice

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
right now okay yes really nice

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.470 
right now okay yes really nice
no-holds-barred<00:06:04.100> all<00:06:05.100> right<00:06:05.520> there<00:06:05.760> we<00:06:06.300> could

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:06.480 
no-holds-barred all right there we could

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.470 
no-holds-barred all right there we could
have<00:06:06.510> seen<00:06:06.810> maybe<00:06:07.620> one<00:06:07.920> more<00:06:08.070> regrab<00:06:08.580> from<00:06:09.300> Roy

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:09.480 
have seen maybe one more regrab from Roy

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.420 
have seen maybe one more regrab from Roy
cuz<00:06:10.440> that<00:06:10.560> was<00:06:10.620> dangerously<00:06:11.100> close<00:06:11.220> to<00:06:11.310> being

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
cuz that was dangerously close to being

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.710 
cuz that was dangerously close to being
right<00:06:11.700> in<00:06:11.850> that<00:06:11.970> Roizen<00:06:12.360> that<00:06:12.510> would've<00:06:12.660> been

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 
right in that Roizen that would've been

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.510 
right in that Roizen that would've been
definitely<00:06:13.110> the<00:06:13.290> hilt<00:06:13.440> of<00:06:13.560> the<00:06:13.620> blade<00:06:13.830> maybe

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
definitely the hilt of the blade maybe

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.120 
definitely the hilt of the blade maybe
we<00:06:14.610> got<00:06:14.730> in<00:06:14.820> the<00:06:14.880> full-back<00:06:15.240> back<00:06:15.480> in<00:06:15.690> the<00:06:15.780> 20%

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130 
we got in the full-back back in the 20%

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.090 
we got in the full-back back in the 20%
but<00:06:17.130> just<00:06:17.700> missed<00:06:17.880> it

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100 
but just missed it

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.350 
but just missed it
that's<00:06:20.100> why<00:06:20.250> it's<00:06:20.400> definitely<00:06:20.730> beneficial<00:06:20.880> to

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
that's why it's definitely beneficial to

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.820 
that's why it's definitely beneficial to
know<00:06:21.480> your<00:06:21.630> percents<00:06:22.080> when<00:06:22.410> it<00:06:22.500> comes<00:06:22.680> to

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
know your percents when it comes to

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.130 
know your percents when it comes to
combos<00:06:23.340> taint<00:06:23.760> grabs<00:06:23.970> and<00:06:24.300> even<00:06:24.660> killed
