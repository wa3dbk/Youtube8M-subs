00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.940
 Jeez yesterday we published the neighbor 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.799
 Cell hologram already rained 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.090
 there are many questions in the video 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.950
 cool questions 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.200
 so I decided to make a video without 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.000
 answer here on the blog to take these 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.100
 cruel doubts woe to those who watched the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.510
 video a funnier doubt I 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.210
 I saw how it got two videos one 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.550
 explaining the effect of the other hologram 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.600
 explaining how the magic of 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.560
 monga 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.029
 We had a person who spoke so but 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.560
 wait there how the monga left 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.720
 running after me when I went to 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.940
 playcenter when I went in the beto carreiro 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.040
 I do not know, lets go. 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.350
 it is based on the video that they do not 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.360
 watched this video still out of here soon 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.000
 these two very cool videos that 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.070
 recorded what is the cellular hologram and how 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.989
 how does the world effect work? 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.270
 long runs out after the person 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.059
 provided the explanation that Monga 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.410
 corresponds to that dinosaur imagines 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.210
 that the bomb was hidden behind the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.399
 The wall on that wall had black that I 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.379
 I put it only you turn the light off 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.570
 Dinosaur it runs close to you 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.000
 there is the real dinosaur he is 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.460
 being reflected that one sees the reflex more 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.979
 has a long live if a person is 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.460
 real gorilla is not only an image 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.979
 a real person person who is there is the 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.750
 reflection of her you see you can not 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.420
 Invert the magic you can place the 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.939
 in the place where the person in the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.009
 place of thabo mbeki red and then 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.710
 You 'll get the image of the 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.720
 the reflection of the girl and a real 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.280
 it can also use may deviate from 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.189
 glass and came up from you 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.329
 So the song can come to you. 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.729
 the magic 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.720
 I choked to talk because she exists she is 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.030
 a gorilla 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.590
 but it is not only the reflection does not have some 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.430
 animal that somebody needs to 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.680
 bug 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.939
 the pair that emerged the most to do 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.369
 that bigger if you can not make a 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.020
 program a very holographic illusion 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.270
 also if you want to go 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.920
 depending on the size of your glass and 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.180
 size of your screen then with a 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.100
 cell phone you can not do 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.210
 nothing much bigger than a screen of the 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.219
 cell phone 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.759
 if you use the 50 inch television 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:08.489
 and will be able to make a picture says 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.400
 almost 50 inches do not make so great 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.680
 because it is also a pyramid that keeps 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.420
 if 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.609
 so it ends up being another quarter of the screen 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.709
 gives you put a glass only one 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:19.469
 a medium video lying there at 45 degrees 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.790
 Then you can occupy the entire screen. 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:24.189
 so give it to me to do only what goes 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.239
 give a very big job goes 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:29.459
 need to put on the television in the 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:32.530
 horizontal and and glass and I do not know what it is 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.180
 even easier to have a good phone 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.099
 some people have complained that they do not 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.620
 cd cover because it does not exist anymore and 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.269
 Denise, world where I'm going to mark the 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.579
 get off of something very cool to do 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.730
 use those packaging steps each 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:47.109
 packaging is called blister I think 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.599
 anything against a pack of 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:51.099
 wood it comes inside a plastic 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.569
 hard he has a lot of things and 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.919
 shopping in the market selling a plastic 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.049
 hard transparent 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:57.760
 that transparent hard plastic is well 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.590
 fininho in the face of cutting them much more 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.329
 easy and cut the cover cd 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.739
 so it's good to do with him 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.780
 also you can do without problems if 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.219
 you do not have cdc head and nuzzles between 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.889
 garbage from your house will find something 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:11.290
 So many people also asked me. 

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:14.889
 leaves the arm apoel here was tiring 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.510
 A lot of people asked me if it's difficult. 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:18.790
 make that video I did that 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.260
 video divided into four parts divided 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.040
 the video in four pieces is not so 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.560
 difficult 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.659
 What is difficult is you make a background 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.810
 perfect black we spent less one 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:30.370
 time that only regulating light because people 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.439
 had to use this black background that 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.909
 here also has a black background here 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:35.889
 world manual 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:37.689
 only the light can not illuminate much 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:39.849
 background because if not the black turn mine 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:41.259
 exempted as black illuminated 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:42.729
 so he had to find a way to play 

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:44.530
 even my legs because sometimes 

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:46.900
 lacked a dark jeans she 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.739
 mixed with background is super complicated 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.150
 make perfect black background that he nor 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.259
 It was perfect if you looked close to the 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.239
 my foot is to see that there is one left 

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:57.879
 little bit more than black lighting 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.409
 but Lusa was great gives a lot 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:02.500
 Work then have to play an editor. 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:04.509
 video and take that picture do it 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.120
 will come in four pieces turn a penalty 

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:09.250
 for each side and then it is a video that 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.500
 has four neighbors inside it yet 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.269
 lateral cortex because on the side leaked 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.349
 these things that we call doing 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:17.889
 when something appears that should 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:19.989
 appear but the doorway voices aside here and 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.609
 there you ride we rode in the 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.700
 premier is not a very easy program to 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.860
 fiddle to whoever is starting to edit 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.190
 It's kind of chatty, so it's not 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.480
 so easy to do that there and then the pseudo 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.850
 But you can watch the other videos. 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.400
 of youtube showing a hologram 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.470
 And you can have a lot of fun 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.020
 another thing that people asked the 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.510
 apple not for you shoot a camera 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.000
 facing a camera on the other side of 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.400
 back on that side would still have 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.320
 four different pictures 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.230
 It would be very nice because the person 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.760
 really 3d tv if you look at the glass 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.400
 of the active front from the side of there 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.410
 from behind is even people who have already 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.870
 You did this with a photo but making a video is 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.970
 very difficult because because you will have 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.590
 four cameras and a camera will shoot the 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.930
 another will be facing each other 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.820
 front example is going to shoot here for 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.410
 even if you use a camera 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.780
 little hidden 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.810
 I'll need 360 degrees of cloth 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.330
 black that is almost impossible and more I 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.100
 I'll have to have 360 ​​degrees of light on me. 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:22.900
 illuminating on all sides where I 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.210
 I'm going to hide these black cloth lights . 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.570
 so it's very difficult and four cameras 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.550
 a week on each side and has an object 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:35.560
 in the middle without these cameras being 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:37.360
 the light is seen and this I 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.370
 This video was really cool. I liked it. 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:43.150
 very effect and the effect is sensational 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:45.760
 easy at home that was very right then 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.960
 worth embrace who ever entered the blog 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.580
 of the world's manual is a space to people 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.530
 puts the video response makes the 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.480
 neighbors simpler to talk 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.260
 You better subscribe to the channel. 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.260
