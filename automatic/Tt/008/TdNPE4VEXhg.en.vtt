00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.249 
ever graduate from this program because
science<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.670> are<00:01:35.970> really<00:01:36.270> time<00:01:36.509> consuming<00:01:37.049> and

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
science is are really time consuming and

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.380 
science is are really time consuming and
and<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:38.040> wasn't<00:01:38.280> sure<00:01:38.430> if<00:01:38.670> I<00:01:38.820> would<00:01:38.880> be<00:01:39.090> able<00:01:39.210> to
