00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
trend-setting show and I think when I

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.249 
trend-setting show and I think when I
say<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.759> can't<00:01:21.000> be<00:01:21.180> replaced<00:01:21.450> because<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:22.049> truly

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
say it can't be replaced because I truly

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.230

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.609 
think are some where derivatives of her
talk<00:01:44.939> show<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.509> think<00:01:45.720> she<00:01:45.869> we<00:01:46.380> have<00:01:46.530> to

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
talk show and I think she we have to

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.719 
talk show and I think she we have to
look<00:01:46.770> up<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.100> because<00:01:47.520> she's<00:01:47.640> a

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
look up to that because she's a

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.550 
look up to that because she's a
trendsetter<00:01:48.000> known<00:01:48.420> right<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:49.200> course<00:01:49.500> you

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
trendsetter known right of course you

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.410 
trendsetter known right of course you
see<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.040> similarities<00:01:50.729> are<00:01:50.850> there<00:01:50.939> with<00:01:51.329> the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
see the similarities are there with the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.819 
see the similarities are there with the
fact<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.659> she<00:01:51.840> gets<00:01:51.990> celebrities<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.649> get

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
fact that she gets celebrities you get

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.249 
fact that she gets celebrities you get
celebrities<00:01:53.549> your<00:01:53.880> talk<00:01:54.090> about<00:01:54.119> both<00:01:54.899> talk

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
celebrities your talk about both talk

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.499 
celebrities your talk about both talk
about<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.770> person<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:57.149> we<00:01:57.210> don't<00:01:57.329> dwell

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
about the person is and we don't dwell

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.539 
about the person is and we don't dwell
on<00:01:57.630> social<00:01:58.079> issues<00:01:58.350> or<00:01:58.590> issues<00:01:58.770> in<00:01:59.189> general

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
on social issues or issues in general

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.160 
on social issues or issues in general
and<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.570> think<00:02:00.750> there<00:02:00.869> are<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.020> lot<00:02:01.140> of

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
and I think there are a lot of

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.459 
and I think there are a lot of
similarities<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:02.340> course<00:02:03.350> there<00:02:04.350> are

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
similarities of course there are

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.440 
similarities of course there are
differences<00:02:04.770> as<00:02:05.009> well<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.219> think<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:05.939> don't<00:02:06.090> go

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
differences as well I think I don't go

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.240 
differences as well I think I don't go
into<00:02:06.689> like<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.380> emotional<00:02:07.829> angle<00:02:08.099> of

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
into like the the emotional angle of

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.650 
into like the the emotional angle of
their<00:02:08.429> personal<00:02:08.910> lives<00:02:09.000> their<00:02:09.270> childhood
