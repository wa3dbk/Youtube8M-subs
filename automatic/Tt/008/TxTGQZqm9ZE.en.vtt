00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.999 
there so let's go talk to crew chiefs
and<00:00:29.869> see<00:00:30.869> what<00:00:31.050> they're<00:00:31.230> doing<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.590> terms<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.920> a

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
and see what they're doing in terms of a

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.459 
and see what they're doing in terms of a
compromise<00:00:32.460> between<00:00:32.669> top<00:00:33.329> speed<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.930> drive

about<00:00:40.469> gearing<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:41.760> we<00:00:42.420> were<00:00:42.899> at<00:00:43.050> finian

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
about gearing so we were at finian

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.369 
about gearing so we were at finian
Infineon<00:00:43.980> which<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:45.140> shorter<00:00:46.140> gearing

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
Infineon which is a shorter gearing

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.290 
Infineon which is a shorter gearing
track<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:47.039> don't<00:00:47.190> use<00:00:47.370> very<00:00:47.579> many<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:48.120> the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
track you don't use very many of the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.729 
track you don't use very many of the
gears<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.719> are<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.930> gear<00:00:49.110> box<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.530> come

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
gears that are in the gear box you come

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.680 
gears that are in the gear box you come
here<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.190> you've<00:00:50.280> got<00:00:50.309> three<00:00:50.910> monstrous

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
here and you've got three monstrous

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.260 
here and you've got three monstrous
straights<00:00:52.110> plus<00:00:52.500> you've<00:00:52.710> got<00:00:52.739> drafting<00:00:53.520> so

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
straights plus you've got drafting so

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.139 
straights plus you've got drafting so
you've<00:00:54.420> got<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.719> put<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.110> taller<00:00:55.350> system

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
you've got to put in a taller system

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.160 
you've got to put in a taller system
well<00:00:57.149> that's<00:00:57.590> that's<00:00:58.590> debatable<00:00:58.980> they<00:01:00.170> we've

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
well that's that's debatable they we've

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.299 
well that's that's debatable they we've
learned<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.379> little<00:01:01.559> bit<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:01.770> year<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:02.070> Park

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
learned a little bit this year this Park

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.920 
learned a little bit this year this Park
is<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:02.640> different<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.180> our<00:01:03.300> last<00:01:03.510> year's<00:01:03.750> Bike

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
is so different to our last year's Bike

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.149 
is so different to our last year's Bike
Week<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.290> know<00:01:04.350> it's<00:01:05.689> everything<00:01:06.689> we<00:01:06.869> do

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
Week you know it's everything we do

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.320 
Week you know it's everything we do
doesn't<00:01:08.159> work<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.549> same<00:01:08.760> including<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
doesn't work the same including the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.890 
doesn't work the same including the
gearing<00:01:09.799> believe<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:10.920> or<00:01:11.010> not<00:01:11.159> this<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
gearing believe it or not this is the

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.539 
gearing believe it or not this is the
shortest<00:01:12.900> earring<00:01:13.350> we've<00:01:13.470> run<00:01:13.770> on<00:01:14.010> this

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
shortest earring we've run on this

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.640 
shortest earring we've run on this
motorbike<00:01:14.820> this<00:01:15.090> year<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:16.049> we've<00:01:16.229> been<00:01:16.380> to

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
motorbike this year so we've been to

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.649 
motorbike this year so we've been to
borrow<00:01:17.189> anybody<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.700> barber<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.180> an<00:01:18.270> opinion

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
borrow anybody to barber and an opinion

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.719 
borrow anybody to barber and an opinion
but<00:01:19.320> we<00:01:19.409> only<00:01:19.560> use<00:01:19.650> three<00:01:20.070> years<00:01:20.310> at<00:01:20.490> first

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
but we only use three years at first

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.810 
but we only use three years at first
second<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.060> third<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:22.259> we've<00:01:23.040> geared<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.430> and

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
second and third so we've geared it and

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.999 
second and third so we've geared it and
the<00:01:24.000> overall<00:01:24.360> gearing<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.350> actually<00:01:25.770> quite<00:01:25.979> a

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
the overall gearing is actually quite a

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.420 
the overall gearing is actually quite a
lot<00:01:26.189> taller<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.580> those<00:01:26.790> tracks<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.390> our<00:01:27.540> case

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
lot taller of those tracks in our case

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.520 
lot taller of those tracks in our case
here<00:01:29.430> we're<00:01:30.299> gearing<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.780> from<00:01:30.990> maximum

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
here we're gearing it from maximum

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.710 
here we're gearing it from maximum
acceleration<00:01:31.799> maximum<00:01:32.549> speed<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.390> we've<00:01:33.540> got

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
acceleration maximum speed so we've got

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.330 
acceleration maximum speed so we've got
a<00:01:33.750> short<00:01:34.020> as<00:01:34.439> we<00:01:34.530> can<00:01:34.680> get<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:34.950> without<00:01:35.159> running

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
a short as we can get it without running

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.310 
a short as we can get it without running
out<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.610> arc<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.970> other<00:01:36.119> end<00:01:36.299> Australian

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
out of arc the other end Australian

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.890 
out of arc the other end Australian
yes<00:01:37.980> because<00:01:38.220> if<00:01:38.550> you<00:01:38.700> do<00:01:38.910> run<00:01:39.150> first<00:01:39.510> gear

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
yes because if you do run first gear

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.720 
yes because if you do run first gear
it's<00:01:40.140> you've<00:01:40.500> got<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.860> make<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.190> tall<00:01:41.430> enough

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 
it's you've got to make it tall enough

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.610 
it's you've got to make it tall enough
to<00:01:41.790> make<00:01:42.120> first<00:01:42.360> gear<00:01:42.600> usable<00:01:43.080> that's<00:01:43.410> right

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:43.620 
to make first gear usable that's right

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.130 
to make first gear usable that's right
and<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.580> know<00:01:44.730> most<00:01:45.150> of<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.330> bikes<00:01:45.540> nowadays

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
and you know most of the bikes nowadays

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.020 
and you know most of the bikes nowadays
under<00:01:46.980> these<00:01:47.100> regulations

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
under these regulations

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.480 
under these regulations
you<00:01:48.390> only<00:01:48.540> have<00:01:48.750> one<00:01:49.080> old<00:01:49.530> certain<00:01:49.920> choice<00:01:50.160> and

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
you only have one old certain choice and

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.770 
you only have one old certain choice and
at<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.090> moment<00:01:51.360> we<00:01:51.420> don't<00:01:51.480> have<00:01:51.630> one

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
at the moment we don't have one

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.950 
at the moment we don't have one
homologated<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.440> we're<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.650> standard<00:01:53.100> V<00:01:53.220> Vox

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
homologated so we're on standard V Vox

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.180 
homologated so we're on standard V Vox
same<00:01:54.960> as<00:01:55.080> you<00:01:55.140> run<00:01:55.260> on<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.410> street<00:01:55.620> bike<00:01:55.770> so

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
same as you run on the street bike so

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.300 
same as you run on the street bike so
first<00:01:56.460> key<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.670> quite<00:01:56.820> low<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.450> yeah<00:01:58.080> it's<00:01:58.500> if

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
first key is quite low so yeah it's if

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.130 
first key is quite low so yeah it's if
you<00:01:59.850> get<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.450> get<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.660> gearing<00:02:00.900> too

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
you get that you get the gearing too

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.290 
you get that you get the gearing too
short<00:02:01.410> overall<00:02:01.860> but<00:02:02.370> it's<00:02:02.550> so<00:02:02.700> hard<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.210> get

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
short overall but it's so hard to get

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.650 
short overall but it's so hard to get
into<00:02:03.450> those<00:02:03.630> corners<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.910> then<00:02:05.910> there<00:02:06.540> was

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
into those corners and then there was

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.419 
into those corners and then there was
some<00:02:06.840> talk<00:02:07.050> that<00:02:07.110> you've<00:02:07.680> got<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.979> be<00:02:08.100> careful

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
some talk that you've got to be careful

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.340 
some talk that you've got to be careful
with<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.700> draft<00:02:09.030> too<00:02:09.300> because<00:02:09.750> that'll<00:02:10.140> suck

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
with the draft too because that'll suck

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.410 
with the draft too because that'll suck
you<00:02:10.470> along<00:02:10.679> faster<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.459> then<00:02:12.000> before<00:02:12.209> you

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
you along faster and then before you

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.090 
you along faster and then before you
know<00:02:12.630> it<00:02:12.780> you<00:02:12.900> hit<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.200> draft<00:02:13.470> and<00:02:13.800> then

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
know it you hit the draft and then

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.890 
know it you hit the draft and then
you're<00:02:14.430> on<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.880> rev<00:02:15.000> limiter<00:02:15.360> yeah

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
you're on the rev limiter yeah

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.890 
you're on the rev limiter yeah
classically<00:02:16.890> his<00:02:17.010> first<00:02:17.880> practice<00:02:18.120> yesterday

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
set their fastest speed trap time here

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.570 
set their fastest speed trap time here
at<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.470> start/finish<00:02:31.739> line<00:02:31.980> by<00:02:32.310> three<00:02:32.489> or

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
at the start/finish line by three or

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.460 
at the start/finish line by three or
four<00:02:32.640> mile<00:02:32.880> an<00:02:32.970> hour<00:02:33.060> but<00:02:33.840> as<00:02:34.050> soon<00:02:34.200> as<00:02:34.290> I<00:02:34.350> get

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
four mile an hour but as soon as I get

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.560 
four mile an hour but as soon as I get
out<00:02:34.530> of<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.739> draft<00:02:34.950> their<00:02:35.880> bike<00:02:36.030> starts<00:02:36.330> going

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
out of the draft their bike starts going

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.350 
out of the draft their bike starts going
slower<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.400> it's<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:38.850> have<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.120> layout

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
slower and it's you have to a layout

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.630 
slower and it's you have to a layout
here<00:02:39.920> we<00:02:40.920> allow<00:02:41.160> about<00:02:41.640> a<00:02:41.700> tooth<00:02:43.310> on<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.370> rear

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
here we allow about a tooth on the rear

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.790 
here we allow about a tooth on the rear
sprocket<00:02:45.060> one<00:02:45.750> too<00:02:45.900> tall<00:02:46.170> up<00:02:46.350> for<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.620> draft

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
sprocket one too tall up for the draft

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.060 
sprocket one too tall up for the draft
so<00:02:47.280> that<00:02:47.430> amount<00:02:47.640> 350<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.570> 400<00:02:48.989> rpm<00:02:49.080> you<00:02:49.920> need

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
so that amount 350 to 400 rpm you need

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.550 
so that amount 350 to 400 rpm you need
it<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:51.390> good<00:02:51.570> thing<00:02:51.780> here<00:02:51.959> is<00:02:52.019> a<00:02:52.110> start/finish

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
it the good thing here is a start/finish

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.460 
it the good thing here is a start/finish
line<00:02:52.590> it's<00:02:52.860> not<00:02:52.890> at<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.190> end<00:02:53.600> so<00:02:54.600> if<00:02:55.350> the

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
line it's not at the end so if the

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.740 
line it's not at the end so if the
start/finish<00:02:55.950> line<00:02:55.980> was<00:02:56.459> like<00:02:57.000> Daytona<00:02:57.450> you

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
start/finish line was like Daytona you

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.110 
start/finish line was like Daytona you
bent<00:02:57.959> over<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.410> as<00:02:58.470> close<00:02:58.739> to<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:58.980> end<00:02:59.130> it's

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
bent over and as close to the end it's

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.790 
bent over and as close to the end it's
actually<00:03:00.360> more<00:03:00.660> important<00:03:01.080> there

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
actually more important there

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.930
