00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.620
 before we had meant to play music now we come to the driving 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.500
 Mankell it is a little bit not loud Stenke a bit and it is 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.639
 Nevertheless, they do not believe they are very popular then they go to this old new one 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.639
 Trend on 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.730
 the critters the machines the passengers 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:25.039
 Men's dreams that have become steel do not care for crabs 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.039
 here it depends only on the size 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.570
 for smaller fouls declining 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.840
 furthermore 4 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.090
 but please a mail 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.820
 Ever wanted to memorials Norbert Michels on Wednesday very comfortable before 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.250
 they do not contain it but okay 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.360
 Quasthoff a neighbor tripled 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.610
 the specifications were 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.040
 So that's pure fun 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.050
 in the bright noise makes the fun even bigger 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.290
 However, this is probably only for the driver 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.400
 they sit on their machines the monkeys serve stones 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.210
 hence the name Monti at 1 no toys its nights motorcycles with 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.740
 to let eleven 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.109
 400 of them no tears even through northern Germany 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.810
 as early as the sixties, a Japanese manufacturer was the cops 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.230
 Bikes developed 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.850
 as a second vehicle for campers and noise opera for children they actually had 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.850
 a practical purpose 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.580
 From Japan they came to Europe at that time and also found in this country 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.000
 quickly imposed 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.540
 I'm lucky I think I discovered seven communities or carpenters 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.720
 Percent or 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.010
 how many people in Spain 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.710
 I can hardly keep it because these are not tilted by Sochi 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.150
 Coat place pollution Rolf Klein even higher 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.310
 although there are little ones on it 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.180
 Today, Patrick 38 is Stephan Ackermann with 18 employees 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.570
 and somehow still a little boy 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.370
 because the Japanese original he just come to Germany today a statement 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.219
 before they make it easy here in Hamburg 

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:11.989
 for two they only need a good hour is the base version is available 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.989
 Cost 1000 300 Euro 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.019
 but because wall boys are fun for them then the double starts 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.509
 become out of it 

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:22.999
 the triple or multiple 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:24.959
 for some children, percent appreciate 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.919
 two in check of his mandate 

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:30.939
 I was also often in favor of the old saying Nahrstedt in favor of a blanket 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:34.289
 over it then goals from not pressed the actual Butzmann EBITDA 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.800
 So far, almost only men are distributed in these hot songs 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.320
 Women are apparently less susceptible to the genome of Manfred Thierer 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.650
 Mike Frantz no one does not look for them depending on it 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.320
 But some people are already pretty busy and visitors are quick and easy 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.520
 you do not have to put on a station wagon, the man does not have to drive you crazy instead 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.090
 on and off Kuntze one has pretty much once and under 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.090
 meanwhile 

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:19.159
 some of my kids camp with 140 kilometers per hour on the asphalt 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.869
 could 

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:23.629
 In a big city like Hamburg it is abundantly unnecessary but the 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.649
 true size of the small then shows up at the finish 

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:30.229
 Parking problems Eckelmann with Mandl is definitely the case
