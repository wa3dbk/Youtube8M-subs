00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.810 

last<00:00:00.870> time<00:00:01.170> we<00:00:01.319> left<00:00:01.500> off<00:00:01.740> what<00:00:01.979> we<00:00:02.100> did<00:00:02.399> was<00:00:02.639> we

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
last time we left off what we did was we

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.559 
last time we left off what we did was we
had<00:00:03.000> took<00:00:03.300> all<00:00:03.990> of<00:00:04.049> the<00:00:04.680> connectors<00:00:05.609> and<00:00:05.910> we

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
had took all of the connectors and we

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.900 
had took all of the connectors and we
labeled<00:00:06.990> all<00:00:07.109> of<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.379> connectors<00:00:07.830> such<00:00:08.610> as

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
labeled all of the connectors such as

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.009 
labeled all of the connectors such as
oil<00:00:09.480> pressure<00:00:10.730> I<00:00:11.730> believe<00:00:12.210> this<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.599> crank

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
oil pressure I believe this is a crank

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.450 
oil pressure I believe this is a crank
sensor<00:00:13.290> here<00:00:14.210> we<00:00:15.210> have<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.450> cam<00:00:16.199> sensor<00:00:16.590> here<00:00:17.070> so

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
sensor here we have a cam sensor here so

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.300 
sensor here we have a cam sensor here so
we<00:00:17.550> label<00:00:17.940> then<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.140> next<00:00:19.439> step<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.830> after<00:00:20.010> you

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
we label then the next step is after you

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.349 
we label then the next step is after you
label<00:00:20.699> them<00:00:21.710> you<00:00:22.710> take<00:00:22.920> each<00:00:23.130> one<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:24.150> you

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
label them you take each one and you

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.720 
label them you take each one and you
find<00:00:24.630> out<00:00:24.779> their<00:00:24.990> pin<00:00:25.260> assignments<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.460> this

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
find out their pin assignments so this

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.330 
find out their pin assignments so this
one<00:00:26.970> here<00:00:27.269> says<00:00:27.570> I'll<00:00:28.320> turn<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.800> right-side<00:00:28.980> up

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
one here says I'll turn it right-side up

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.780 
one here says I'll turn it right-side up
so<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.580> can<00:00:29.699> see<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.029> is<00:00:30.779> our<00:00:31.170> 60<00:00:31.830> which<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.399> red

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
so you can see it is our 60 which is red

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.080 
so you can see it is our 60 which is red
60<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:34.230> one<00:00:34.440> down<00:00:34.590> here<00:00:34.880> B<00:00:35.880> 3<00:00:36.239> blue<00:00:36.590> 3<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:38.090> we

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
60 this one down here B 3 blue 3 and we

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.340 
60 this one down here B 3 blue 3 and we
did<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.450> for<00:00:39.570> all<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.840> wires<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.260> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
did that for all the wires in the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.100 
did that for all the wires in the
harness<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:41.100> after<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.520> we<00:00:42.360> laid<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.750> out<00:00:42.840> on

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
harness and after that we laid it out on

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.430 
harness and after that we laid it out on
the<00:00:43.469> engine<00:00:44.040> exact<00:00:44.550> same<00:00:44.969> way<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.690> it's

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
the engine exact same way that it's

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.160 
the engine exact same way that it's
going<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.649> be<00:00:46.860> when<00:00:47.250> he<00:00:47.460> has<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.760> in<00:00:48.000> his<00:00:48.180> car<00:00:48.450> so

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
going to be when he has it in his car so

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.680 
going to be when he has it in his car so
this<00:00:49.379> application<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.370> running<00:00:50.579> up<00:00:50.820> Victor

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
this application is running up Victor

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.200 
this application is running up Victor
jr.<00:00:51.840> intake<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:53.280> he's<00:00:53.460> running<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.789> throttle

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
jr. intake and he's running the throttle

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.080 
jr. intake and he's running the throttle
body<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:55.020> elbow<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.649> grotto<00:00:55.920> body<00:00:56.190> on<00:00:56.789> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
body the elbow in the grotto body on the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.569 
body the elbow in the grotto body on the
side<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:58.079> that's<00:00:58.230> why<00:00:58.440> there's<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.190> throttle

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
side so that's why there's a throttle

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.510 
side so that's why there's a throttle
position<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.270> idle<00:01:01.109> air<00:01:01.260> control<00:01:01.520> sensors

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
position and idle air control sensors

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.479 
position and idle air control sensors
are<00:01:02.699> on<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.879> passenger<00:01:03.539> side<00:01:03.890> and<00:01:04.890> he's<00:01:05.250> also

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
are on the passenger side and he's also

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.770 
are on the passenger side and he's also
going<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.909> need<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.360> intake<00:01:07.290> air<00:01:08.159> temp<00:01:08.580> sensor

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
going to need a intake air temp sensor

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.030 
going to need a intake air temp sensor
it's<00:01:09.780> also<00:01:10.020> going<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.350> be<00:01:10.439> on<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.590> passenger

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
it's also going to be on the passenger

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.890 
it's also going to be on the passenger
side<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.880> way<00:01:12.090> when<00:01:12.479> he's<00:01:12.600> running<00:01:12.840> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
side that way when he's running the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.740 
side that way when he's running the
speed<00:01:13.140> density<00:01:13.320> tune<00:01:13.770> he<00:01:14.580> can<00:01:14.790> dial<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.600> in

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
speed density tune he can dial it in

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.210 
speed density tune he can dial it in
with<00:01:16.460> using<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.580> intake<00:01:18.090> air<00:01:18.299> temp<00:01:18.600> as<00:01:19.500> well

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
with using this intake air temp as well

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.420 
with using this intake air temp as well
coils<00:01:21.030> are<00:01:21.270> over<00:01:21.509> here<00:01:21.930> passenger<00:01:22.619> side<00:01:22.860> coils

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.170 
coils are over here passenger side coils
it<00:01:23.939> was<00:01:24.119> just<00:01:24.299> plugging<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:24.780> like<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:26.000> also<00:01:27.000> has

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
it was just plugging in like so also has

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.760 
it was just plugging in like so also has
his<00:01:27.390> map<00:01:27.630> sensor<00:01:27.930> which<00:01:28.200> he's<00:01:28.350> going<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.590> mount

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
his map sensor which he's going to mount

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.390 
his map sensor which he's going to mount
inside<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.310> intake<00:01:29.579> here<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.689> then<00:01:31.259> on<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
inside the intake here and then on the

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.520 
inside the intake here and then on the
past<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.060> driver<00:01:33.299> side<00:01:33.420> he's<00:01:34.320> going

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
past and on the driver side he's going

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.800 
past and on the driver side he's going
to<00:01:34.590> run<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.220> low<00:01:35.549> mount<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.360> can<00:01:36.570> see<00:01:36.720> the

this<00:01:45.420> side<00:01:45.770> so<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.009> pretty<00:01:47.159> much<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.369> and

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
this side so this is pretty much it and

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.030 
this side so this is pretty much it and
then<00:01:48.299> we'll<00:01:48.450> take<00:01:48.630> this<00:01:48.869> these<00:01:49.439> are<00:01:49.619> all<00:01:49.799> of

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
then we'll take this these are all of

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.170 
then we'll take this these are all of
the<00:01:51.649> ignition<00:01:52.649> wires<00:01:52.829> for<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.310> injectors<00:01:54.060> on

the ignition wires for the injectors on
the<00:01:54.270> driver<00:01:54.509> side<00:01:54.630> we're<00:01:55.290> running<00:01:55.470> them<00:01:55.530> into

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
the driver side we're running them into

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.390 
the driver side we're running them into
one<00:01:55.860> single<00:01:55.890> wire<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.700> they'll<00:01:56.850> be<00:01:56.939> free

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
one single wire and they'll be free

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.000 
one single wire and they'll be free
one<00:01:57.520> fuse<00:01:57.850> on<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.630> driver's<00:01:58.990> side<00:01:59.170> and<00:01:59.590> then

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
one fuse on the driver's side and then

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.340 
one fuse on the driver's side and then
on<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.640> passenger<00:02:01.270> side<00:02:01.450> we<00:02:01.720> the<00:02:01.840> same<00:02:02.050> thing

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
on the passenger side we the same thing

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.570 
on the passenger side we the same thing
we'll<00:02:03.160> have<00:02:03.190> a<00:02:03.790> fuse<00:02:04.240> for<00:02:04.810> itself<00:02:05.140> for<00:02:05.580> the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
we'll have a fuse for itself for the

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.950 
we'll have a fuse for itself for the
bank<00:02:07.060> one<00:02:07.360> coil<00:02:08.170> pack<00:02:08.470> as<00:02:09.399> well<00:02:09.729> as<00:02:09.940> the<00:02:10.210> down

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
bank one coil pack as well as the down

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.900 
bank one coil pack as well as the down
here<00:02:11.200> somewhere

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
here somewhere

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.540 
here somewhere
Bank<00:02:12.910> two<00:02:13.240> coil<00:02:13.540> pack<00:02:13.780> yeah<00:02:14.320> after<00:02:15.220> that<00:02:15.340> all<00:02:15.520> I

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
Bank two coil pack yeah after that all I

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.570 
Bank two coil pack yeah after that all I
did<00:02:15.670> was<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:17.470> can<00:02:17.620> use<00:02:17.770> anything<00:02:18.220> I<00:02:18.370> use

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
did was to you can use anything I use

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.780 
did was to you can use anything I use
wire<00:02:18.850> as<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.690> had<00:02:19.900> a<00:02:20.160> little<00:02:21.160> bit<00:02:21.370> of<00:02:21.400> household

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
wire as I had a little bit of household

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.660 
wire as I had a little bit of household
wire<00:02:22.030> laying<00:02:22.300> around<00:02:22.620> 12:2<00:02:23.620> and<00:02:23.860> all<00:02:24.490> I<00:02:24.520> did

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
wire laying around 12:2 and all I did

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.180 
wire laying around 12:2 and all I did
was<00:02:24.790> I<00:02:25.000> measure<00:02:25.270> from<00:02:26.020> about<00:02:26.530> the<00:02:26.680> middle<00:02:26.920> of

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
was I measure from about the middle of

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.360 
was I measure from about the middle of
the<00:02:27.790> engine<00:02:28.240> the<00:02:28.690> mineral<00:02:29.110> intake<00:02:29.560> all<00:02:30.130> the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
the engine the mineral intake all the

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.060 
the engine the mineral intake all the
way<00:02:30.490> to<00:02:30.550> inside<00:02:31.090> again<00:02:31.690> like<00:02:31.870> I<00:02:31.990> said<00:02:32.230> this

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
way to inside again like I said this

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.640

that<00:02:44.080> I'm<00:02:44.230> using<00:02:44.470> here<00:02:44.830> this<00:02:45.700> is<00:02:45.880> just<00:02:46.090> the

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
that I'm using here this is just the

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.080 
that I'm using here this is just the
crank<00:02:46.870> position<00:02:47.050> sensor<00:02:47.890> here<00:02:48.160> and<00:02:48.700> it'll<00:02:48.970> run

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
crank position sensor here and it'll run

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.810 
crank position sensor here and it'll run
around<00:02:49.240> and<00:02:50.170> go<00:02:50.440> in<00:02:50.620> right<00:02:50.920> behind<00:02:51.250> the

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
around and go in right behind the

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.250 
around and go in right behind the
alternator<00:02:52.330> I<00:02:52.570> mean<00:02:52.780> right<00:02:52.959> behind<00:02:53.140> the

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
alternator I mean right behind the

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.680 
alternator I mean right behind the
starter<00:02:53.650> there<00:02:53.850> but<00:02:54.850> like<00:02:54.970> I<00:02:55.090> said<00:02:55.150> all<00:02:55.420> I<00:02:55.510> did

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
starter there but like I said all I did

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.610 
starter there but like I said all I did
was<00:02:55.810> took<00:02:55.990> the<00:02:56.200> romex<00:02:56.740> wire<00:02:56.770> and<00:02:57.400> I<00:02:57.850> ran<00:02:58.090> it<00:02:58.620> so

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
was took the romex wire and I ran it so

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.320 
was took the romex wire and I ran it so
we<00:02:59.740> can<00:02:59.890> see<00:03:00.100> about<00:03:00.340> where<00:03:00.610> we<00:03:00.790> need<00:03:00.820> to<00:03:01.000> lop<00:03:01.300> it

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:01.330 
we can see about where we need to lop it

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.490 
we can see about where we need to lop it
off<00:03:01.630> at<00:03:01.980> so<00:03:02.980> as<00:03:03.370> you<00:03:03.489> see<00:03:03.840> most<00:03:04.840> of<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.230> wires

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
off at so as you see most of the wires

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.210 
off at so as you see most of the wires
stop<00:03:06.310> before<00:03:06.550> the<00:03:06.970> end<00:03:07.000> of<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:08.650> Romans<00:03:09.010> wire

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
stop before the end of the Romans wire

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.130 
stop before the end of the Romans wire
so<00:03:09.459> they'll<00:03:09.670> all<00:03:09.880> have<00:03:10.209> to<00:03:10.269> be<00:03:10.510> lengthened<00:03:10.959> but

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
so they'll all have to be lengthened but

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.710 
so they'll all have to be lengthened but
we<00:03:11.260> have<00:03:11.500> a<00:03:11.769> few<00:03:12.430> that<00:03:12.880> are<00:03:12.940> about<00:03:13.269> the<00:03:13.510> right

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
we have a few that are about the right

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.020 
we have a few that are about the right
length<00:03:14.050> here<00:03:14.470> stop<00:03:15.130> out<00:03:15.340> at<00:03:15.519> the<00:03:15.580> right<00:03:15.730> spot

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
length here stop out at the right spot

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.229 
length here stop out at the right spot
then<00:03:16.660> we<00:03:16.780> have<00:03:16.959> a<00:03:16.989> few<00:03:17.440> that<00:03:17.980> are<00:03:18.040> a<00:03:18.489> lot<00:03:18.910> longer

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
then we have a few that are a lot longer

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.890 
then we have a few that are a lot longer
and<00:03:19.959> they'll<00:03:20.110> have<00:03:20.260> to<00:03:20.410> be<00:03:20.500> short<00:03:20.769> so<00:03:21.720> this<00:03:22.720> is

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
and they'll have to be short so this is

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.220 
and they'll have to be short so this is
it<00:03:23.110> basically<00:03:23.650> we<00:03:24.340> got<00:03:24.489> a<00:03:24.550> few<00:03:24.820> grounds<00:03:25.420> that

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
it basically we got a few grounds that

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.759 
it basically we got a few grounds that
are<00:03:26.440> hanging<00:03:26.950> out<00:03:27.190> here<00:03:28.050> and<00:03:29.050> these<00:03:29.230> grounds

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
are hanging out here and these grounds

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.880 
are hanging out here and these grounds
will<00:03:30.010> go<00:03:30.730> back<00:03:30.970> into<00:03:31.209> uh<00:03:31.450> we<00:03:32.320> have<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:32.650> ground

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
will go back into uh we have the ground

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.150 
will go back into uh we have the ground
the<00:03:33.610> cases<00:03:34.030> over<00:03:34.300> here<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.980> we'll<00:03:36.970> run<00:03:37.180> those

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
the cases over here and we'll run those

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.120 
the cases over here and we'll run those
you<00:03:39.160> have<00:03:39.340> four<00:03:39.870> grounds<00:03:40.870> for<00:03:41.019> the<00:03:41.110> PCM<00:03:41.650> that's

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
you have four grounds for the PCM that's

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.699 
you have four grounds for the PCM that's
all<00:03:42.459> in<00:03:42.640> this<00:03:42.760> little<00:03:42.970> pack<00:03:43.269> here<00:03:43.720> and<00:03:44.380> then<00:03:44.680> uh

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
all in this little pack here and then uh

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.910 
all in this little pack here and then uh
the<00:03:45.400> rest<00:03:45.640> will<00:03:45.880> come<00:03:46.150> off<00:03:46.360> a<00:03:46.690> little<00:03:47.260> tie<00:03:47.530> into

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
the rest will come off a little tie into

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.949 
the rest will come off a little tie into
somewhere<00:03:48.250> like<00:03:48.489> here<00:03:48.940> for<00:03:49.660> the<00:03:49.780> other

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
somewhere like here for the other

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.780 
somewhere like here for the other
grounds

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
grounds

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.809 
grounds
be<00:03:51.849> able<00:03:51.969> to<00:03:52.060> ground<00:03:52.360> it<00:03:52.599> to<00:03:52.989> the<00:03:53.019> block<00:03:53.730> to<00:03:54.730> the

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
be able to ground it to the block to the

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.660 
be able to ground it to the block to the
body<00:03:55.060> to<00:03:55.360> train<00:03:55.659> wherever<00:03:56.049> you<00:03:56.140> want<00:03:56.319> to

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
body to train wherever you want to

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.789 
body to train wherever you want to
grounded<00:03:57.670> to<00:03:57.959> and<00:03:58.959> that's<00:03:59.079> pretty<00:03:59.290> much<00:03:59.530> it

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
grounded to and that's pretty much it

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.580 
grounded to and that's pretty much it
got<00:04:00.579> a<00:04:00.609> few<00:04:00.819> more<00:04:00.969> wires<00:04:01.269> here<00:04:01.689> this<00:04:02.319> is<00:04:02.439> from

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
got a few more wires here this is from

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.289 
got a few more wires here this is from
another<00:04:02.829> harness<00:04:03.340> that<00:04:03.489> we're<00:04:03.640> doing<00:04:03.819> for<00:04:04.239> the

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
another harness that we're doing for the

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:08.849 
another harness that we're doing for the
s10<00:04:05.310> so<00:04:06.310> this<00:04:06.939> is<00:04:07.060> the<00:04:07.180> s10<00:04:07.569> harness<00:04:07.989> it's<00:04:08.650> all

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
s10 so this is the s10 harness it's all

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:11.369 
s10 so this is the s10 harness it's all
laid<00:04:09.099> out<00:04:09.370> so<00:04:10.299> that's<00:04:10.450> why<00:04:10.569> you<00:04:10.720> guys<00:04:10.930> haven't

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 
laid out so that's why you guys haven't
