okay<00:00:03.469> here<00:00:03.650> we<00:00:03.770> are<00:00:03.800> in<00:00:04.010> my<00:00:04.040> TDI<00:00:05.049> we've

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:06.049 
okay here we are in my TDI we've

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:09.580 
okay here we are in my TDI we've
installed<00:00:06.470> our<00:00:06.859> scan<00:00:07.580> gage<00:00:07.879> -<00:00:08.299> and<00:00:09.170> what<00:00:09.500> we're

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:09.590 
installed our scan gage - and what we're

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:10.570 
installed our scan gage - and what we're
gonna<00:00:09.650> do<00:00:09.889> is<00:00:10.010> we're<00:00:10.099> gonna<00:00:10.160> go<00:00:10.280> for<00:00:10.460> a<00:00:10.490> little

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580 
gonna do is we're gonna go for a little

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.850 
gonna do is we're gonna go for a little
Drive<00:00:10.700> I've<00:00:11.389> cleared<00:00:11.780> the<00:00:11.840> odometer<00:00:12.170> or<00:00:12.679> the

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
Drive I've cleared the odometer or the

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.740 
Drive I've cleared the odometer or the
trip<00:00:13.099> meter<00:00:13.370> and<00:00:13.759> we're<00:00:14.480> gonna<00:00:14.570> just

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
trip meter and we're gonna just

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.630 
trip meter and we're gonna just
illustrate<00:00:15.230> the<00:00:15.349> difference<00:00:15.620> between<00:00:15.830> the

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
illustrate the difference between the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.060 
illustrate the difference between the
190<00:00:17.180> on<00:00:17.270> the<00:00:17.360> water<00:00:17.570> gage<00:00:17.869> when<00:00:18.259> the<00:00:18.349> car

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
190 on the water gage when the car

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.249 
190 on the water gage when the car
indicates<00:00:19.489> it's<00:00:19.669> 190<00:00:20.180> and<00:00:20.480> when<00:00:20.930> the<00:00:21.020> scan

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:21.259 
indicates it's 190 and when the scan

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:23.019 
indicates it's 190 and when the scan
gauged<00:00:21.560> it's<00:00:21.739> 190<00:00:22.430> and<00:00:22.520> this<00:00:22.610> is<00:00:22.759> kind<00:00:22.939> of

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
gauged it's 190 and this is kind of

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:24.760 
gauged it's 190 and this is kind of
important<00:00:23.450> for<00:00:23.480> our<00:00:23.660> switch<00:00:24.290> over<00:00:24.590> to<00:00:24.619> a

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
important for our switch over to a

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.740 
important for our switch over to a
vegetable<00:00:25.250> oil<00:00:25.430> because<00:00:26.059> in<00:00:26.270> general<00:00:26.630> I

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
vegetable oil because in general I

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.510 
vegetable oil because in general I
generally<00:00:27.110> wait<00:00:27.290> or<00:00:27.619> used<00:00:27.919> to<00:00:28.070> wait<00:00:28.189> anyway

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
generally wait or used to wait anyway

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.760 
generally wait or used to wait anyway
until<00:00:28.669> the<00:00:28.849> meter<00:00:29.239> reached<00:00:29.509> 190<00:00:30.200> on<00:00:30.349> the<00:00:30.439> water

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
until the meter reached 190 on the water

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.830 
until the meter reached 190 on the water
gauge<00:00:31.040> and<00:00:31.399> then<00:00:32.180> I<00:00:32.239> would<00:00:32.360> throw<00:00:32.480> the<00:00:32.630> switch

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
gauge and then I would throw the switch

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.540 
gauge and then I would throw the switch
remote<00:00:33.110> on<00:00:33.200> bed.you<00:00:33.410> from<00:00:33.620> there<00:00:33.800> so<00:00:34.370> let's

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
remote on bed.you from there so let's

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.350 
remote on bed.you from there so let's
see<00:00:34.670> what<00:00:34.790> happens<00:00:35.090> I'm<00:00:35.210> gonna<00:00:35.360> start<00:00:35.900> the<00:00:36.050> car

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
see what happens I'm gonna start the car

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.090 
see what happens I'm gonna start the car
and<00:00:38.360> I'm<00:00:38.690> also<00:00:38.900> going<00:00:39.290> to<00:00:40.570> start<00:00:41.570> my<00:00:41.840> timer<00:00:42.770> and

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
and I'm also going to start my timer and

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.980 
and I'm also going to start my timer and
we're<00:00:43.940> gonna<00:00:44.030> go<00:00:44.150> for<00:00:44.300> a<00:00:44.330> little<00:00:44.390> Drive

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:44.990 
we're gonna go for a little Drive

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.980 
we're gonna go for a little Drive
I<00:00:45.040> will<00:00:46.040> check<00:00:46.730> this<00:00:46.910> guy<00:00:47.120> right<00:00:47.360> now<00:00:47.600> we'll

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:47.990 
I will check this guy right now we'll

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.540 
I will check this guy right now we'll
check<00:00:48.200> it<00:00:48.350> for<00:00:48.760> gauge<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:50.650> you<00:00:51.650> can<00:00:51.829> see<00:00:52.160> that

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
check it for gauge and you can see that

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.729 
check it for gauge and you can see that
the<00:00:52.730> water<00:00:52.940> temperature<00:00:53.210> is<00:00:53.750> currently<00:00:54.260> 51

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
the water temperature is currently 51

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.090 
the water temperature is currently 51
degrees<00:00:55.750> if<00:00:56.750> this<00:00:56.960> camera<00:00:57.320> would<00:00:57.500> focus<00:00:57.739> you'd

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
degrees if this camera would focus you'd

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.000 
degrees if this camera would focus you'd
see<00:00:58.310> that's<00:00:58.579> the<00:00:58.850> bottom<00:00:59.150> right<00:00:59.360> 51<00:01:00.010> it's

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
see that's the bottom right 51 it's

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.259 
see that's the bottom right 51 it's
gonna<00:01:01.130> jump<00:01:01.430> 67<00:01:03.460> and<00:01:04.460> it's<00:01:04.579> probably<00:01:04.939> the<00:01:05.030> 70s

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
gonna jump 67 and it's probably the 70s

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.820 
gonna jump 67 and it's probably the 70s
here<00:01:05.780> it's<00:01:06.229> not<00:01:06.380> real<00:01:07.300> not<00:01:08.300> real<00:01:08.510> warm<00:01:08.780> 51<00:01:09.740> is

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
here it's not real not real warm 51 is

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.469 
here it's not real not real warm 51 is
more<00:01:09.979> accurate<00:01:10.310> jumps<00:01:10.520> around<00:01:10.610> sometimes<00:01:11.210> but

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
more accurate jumps around sometimes but

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:12.880 
more accurate jumps around sometimes but
it<00:01:11.570> generally<00:01:11.840> hangs<00:01:12.050> on<00:01:12.229> the<00:01:12.290> one<00:01:12.409> number<00:01:12.620> so

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
it generally hangs on the one number so

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.170 
it generally hangs on the one number so
I<00:01:12.920> would<00:01:13.070> say<00:01:13.190> it's<00:01:13.280> about<00:01:13.370> 51<00:01:13.820> degrees<00:01:13.940> the

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
I would say it's about 51 degrees the

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.180 
I would say it's about 51 degrees the
car<00:01:14.330> sat<00:01:14.540> overnight<00:01:14.930> hasn't<00:01:15.890> been<00:01:15.979> driven

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
car sat overnight hasn't been driven

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.640 
car sat overnight hasn't been driven
that's<00:01:17.120> usually<00:01:17.479> what<00:01:17.600> I<00:01:17.630> find<00:01:17.990> it's<00:01:18.350> around

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
that's usually what I find it's around

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.149 
that's usually what I find it's around
50<00:01:18.860> 54<00:01:19.760> degrees<00:01:20.090> 51<00:01:20.659> when<00:01:21.620> it<00:01:21.710> sits<00:01:21.890> overnight

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
50 54 degrees 51 when it sits overnight

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:23.170 
50 54 degrees 51 when it sits overnight
and<00:01:22.340> I<00:01:22.370> haven't<00:01:22.549> touched<00:01:22.670> it<00:01:22.880> all<00:01:22.970> day<00:01:23.120> so

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
and I haven't touched it all day so

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.030 
and I haven't touched it all day so
we're<00:01:23.390> gonna<00:01:23.479> go<00:01:23.570> for<00:01:23.600> a<00:01:23.810> ride<00:01:23.960> it's<00:01:24.380> early

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
we're gonna go for a ride it's early

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.580 
we're gonna go for a ride it's early
afternoon<00:01:25.270> again<00:01:26.270> it's<00:01:26.420> in<00:01:26.540> the<00:01:26.630> 70s<00:01:27.110> and<00:01:27.260> I'll

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
afternoon again it's in the 70s and I'll

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.710 
afternoon again it's in the 70s and I'll
check<00:01:27.979> back<00:01:28.100> we<00:01:28.310> feel<00:01:28.460> a<00:01:28.490> little<00:01:28.700> bit<00:01:28.880> ok<00:01:29.659> so

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
check back we feel a little bit ok so

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.630 
check back we feel a little bit ok so
we've<00:01:29.990> been<00:01:30.110> driving<00:01:30.500> for<00:01:30.650> 8<00:01:31.010> minutes<00:01:31.250> 12

on the scan gauge and this is generally
what<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:46.979> find<00:01:47.280> happens<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.360> my<00:01:49.200> limited

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.880 
had the scan gauge
I<00:01:53.130> find<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.149> when<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.420> meter<00:01:54.689> says<00:01:54.990> 190<00:01:55.680> I

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
I find that when this meter says 190 I

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.999 
I find that when this meter says 190 I
am<00:01:56.880> basically<00:01:57.210> at<00:01:57.420> 150<00:01:58.080> and<00:01:58.500> according<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.890> the

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
am basically at 150 and according to the

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.330 
am basically at 150 and according to the
stand<00:01:59.310> gage<00:01:59.549> and<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:01.530> distance<00:02:01.920> at<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.159> time

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
stand gage and the distance at a time

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.380 
stand gage and the distance at a time
I've<00:02:02.520> traveled<00:02:02.939> really<00:02:03.149> isn't<00:02:03.270> that

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
I've traveled really isn't that

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.210 
I've traveled really isn't that
important<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.770> important<00:02:05.100> thing

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
important that the the important thing

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.230 
important that the the important thing
is<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.429> difference<00:02:05.700> between<00:02:05.789> these<00:02:06.000> two

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
is the difference between these two

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.809 
is the difference between these two
meters<00:02:06.570> because<00:02:07.140> if<00:02:08.130> you<00:02:08.280> have<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.429> manual

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
meters because if you have a manual

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.839 
meters because if you have a manual
system<00:02:09.300> as<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.539> did<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.380> I<00:02:11.069> based<00:02:11.340> everything

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
system as I did and I based everything

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.059 
system as I did and I based everything
upon<00:02:12.150> this<00:02:12.300> 194<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.170> switch<00:02:13.410> over<00:02:13.650> I<00:02:13.920> was

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
upon this 194 the switch over I was

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.830 
upon this 194 the switch over I was
obviously<00:02:14.250> switching<00:02:14.790> over<00:02:14.880> earlier<00:02:15.600> than<00:02:15.750> I

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
obviously switching over earlier than I

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.370 
obviously switching over earlier than I
should<00:02:16.049> have

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
should have

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.990 
should have
now<00:02:16.650> what's<00:02:17.069> going<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.250> happen<00:02:17.549> is<00:02:17.640> this<00:02:17.790> gauge

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
now what's going to happen is this gauge

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.759 
now what's going to happen is this gauge
is<00:02:18.030> going<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.420> pretty<00:02:18.870> much<00:02:18.959> stay<00:02:19.290> where<00:02:19.500> it<00:02:19.650> is

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
is going to pretty much stay where it is

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.210 
is going to pretty much stay where it is
but<00:02:20.489> as<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.700> continue<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.269> drive<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:22.620> scan

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
but as I continue to the drive the scan

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.009 
but as I continue to the drive the scan
gauge<00:02:23.459> will<00:02:23.670> get<00:02:23.790> up<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:24.000> 190<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:24.660> let's<00:02:24.810> see

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
gauge will get up to 190 so let's see

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.020 
gauge will get up to 190 so let's see
how<00:02:25.530> long<00:02:25.680> it<00:02:25.860> takes<00:02:26.069> for<00:02:26.280> that<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.549> happen<00:02:26.700> so

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
how long it takes for that to happen so

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.539 
how long it takes for that to happen so
here<00:02:27.269> we<00:02:27.390> are<00:02:27.420> we've<00:02:27.720> driven<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:28.319> total<00:02:29.190> of<00:02:29.280> 12

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
here we are we've driven a total of 12

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.210 
here we are we've driven a total of 12
minutes<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.120> 53<00:02:30.420> seconds<00:02:30.989> you<00:02:31.830> may<00:02:31.950> not<00:02:32.130> be

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
minutes and 53 seconds you may not be

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.190 
minutes and 53 seconds you may not be
able<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.400> see<00:02:32.610> that<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.060> I've<00:02:33.269> driven<00:02:33.450> 4.5

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
able to see that and I've driven 4.5

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.650 
able to see that and I've driven 4.5
miles<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:34.950> my<00:02:35.700> temperature<00:02:36.060> gauge<00:02:36.150> just

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
miles and my temperature gauge just

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.229 
miles and my temperature gauge just
about<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.900> minute<00:02:37.230> ago<00:02:37.410> reached<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:37.980> 190<00:02:38.549> on<00:02:38.760> the

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
about a minute ago reached to 190 on the

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.780 
about a minute ago reached to 190 on the
scan<00:02:39.630> gauge<00:02:39.900> I<00:02:40.200> think<00:02:40.890> as<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.040> general<00:02:41.310> rule

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
scan gauge I think as a general rule

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.460 
scan gauge I think as a general rule
that<00:02:42.150> if<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:42.750> were<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:42.930> have<00:02:43.019> a<00:02:43.080> manual

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
that if you were to have a manual

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.080 
that if you were to have a manual
vegetable<00:02:43.980> oil<00:02:44.130> system<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.790> should<00:02:44.820> at<00:02:45.060> least

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
vegetable oil system you should at least

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.590 
vegetable oil system you should at least
at<00:02:45.420> 50%<00:02:45.870> more<00:02:46.260> time<00:02:46.530> for<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:47.820> switchover

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
at 50% more time for the switchover

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.390 
at 50% more time for the switchover
after<00:02:49.079> the<00:02:49.200> temperature<00:02:49.590> gauge<00:02:49.739> on<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.190> car

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
after the temperature gauge on the car

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.019 
after the temperature gauge on the car
reaches<00:02:51.019> 190
