like<00:00:26.820> doing<00:00:27.060> these<00:00:27.150> little<00:00:27.330> projects<00:00:27.810> here

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
like doing these little projects here

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.089 
like doing these little projects here
and<00:00:28.109> there<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.289> it's<00:00:28.410> something<00:00:28.710> different

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
and there and it's something different

but do you guys ask me to show you how I
did<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:32.940> figured<00:00:33.270> I'd<00:00:33.360> make<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.540> quick

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
did it so I figured I'd make a quick

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.459 
did it so I figured I'd make a quick
video

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
video

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.160 
video
these<00:00:35.399> sd70m<00:00:36.120> actually<00:00:36.780> don't<00:00:36.930> have<00:00:37.020> any

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
these sd70m actually don't have any

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.250 
these sd70m actually don't have any
computer<00:00:37.620> screens<00:00:38.629> so<00:00:39.629> they<00:00:39.809> just<00:00:40.079> have

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
computer screens so they just have

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.040 
computer screens so they just have
gauges<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:40.980> that's<00:00:41.190> what<00:00:41.309> I'm<00:00:41.370> gonna<00:00:41.460> do<00:00:41.640> here

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
gauges so that's what I'm gonna do here

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.900 
gauges so that's what I'm gonna do here
here's<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.260> control<00:00:43.680> stand<00:00:44.010> as<00:00:44.309> we<00:00:44.579> see<00:00:44.760> we

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
here's the control stand as we see we

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.850 
here's the control stand as we see we
just<00:00:44.940> got<00:00:45.270> some<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.719> gauges<00:00:46.320> I'm<00:00:46.649> going<00:00:46.800> to

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
just got some of the gauges I'm going to

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.869 
just got some of the gauges I'm going to
backlight<00:00:47.309> these<00:00:47.579> with<00:00:48.050> green<00:00:49.050> LEDs<00:00:49.730> and<00:00:50.730> so

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
backlight these with green LEDs and so

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.299 
backlight these with green LEDs and so
what<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.059> did<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.649> when<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.680> drilled<00:00:53.010> out<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
what I did is I when I drilled out the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.360 
what I did is I when I drilled out the
holes<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.960> then<00:00:56.239> put<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.270> little<00:00:57.570> piece<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.750> clear

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
holes I then put a little piece of clear

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.279 
holes I then put a little piece of clear
styrene<00:00:59.370> behind<00:00:59.789> it<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.149> then<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.510> glued<00:01:01.079> on

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
styrene behind it and then I glued on

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.009 
styrene behind it and then I glued on
the<00:01:01.500> LEDs<00:01:01.980> with<00:01:02.640> canopy<00:01:03.180> glue<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.750> what<00:01:03.870> that

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
the LEDs with canopy glue and what that

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.050 
the LEDs with canopy glue and what that
does<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.979> will<00:01:05.070> help<00:01:05.189> disperse<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.729> light

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
does that will help disperse the light

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.080 
does that will help disperse the light
so<00:01:06.439> the<00:01:07.439> LED<00:01:07.860> on<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.010> left<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:08.670> actually

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
so the LED on the left is actually

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.350 
so the LED on the left is actually
shining<00:01:09.450> pointed<00:01:10.290> in<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.590> direction<00:01:11.360> and

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
shining pointed in this direction and

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.359 
shining pointed in this direction and
the<00:01:12.479> LED<00:01:12.869> on<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.110> right<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.590> kind<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:13.860> pointed

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
the LED on the right is kind of pointed

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.270 
the LED on the right is kind of pointed
in<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:15.150> direction<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.990> they'll<00:01:16.979> kind<00:01:17.130> of

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
in this direction so they'll kind of

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.310 
in this direction so they'll kind of
face<00:01:17.460> right<00:01:17.759> at<00:01:17.939> each<00:01:18.090> other<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:19.110> canna

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
face right at each other and the canna

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.190 
face right at each other and the canna
be<00:01:19.500> equally<00:01:19.770> will<00:01:19.950> help<00:01:20.130> disperse<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.200> and

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
be equally will help disperse it so and

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.920 
be equally will help disperse it so and
then<00:01:22.350> if<00:01:22.530> that's<00:01:22.770> still<00:01:23.040> too<00:01:23.280> bright<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:24.420> will

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
then if that's still too bright I will

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.200 
then if that's still too bright I will
fill<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.979> holes<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.759> can<00:01:26.850> see<00:01:27.060> their

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
fill in the holes you can see their

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.450 
fill in the holes you can see their
little<00:01:27.390> indents<00:01:27.810> there<00:01:28.110> with<00:01:28.710> white<00:01:29.040> paint

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
little indents there with white paint

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.020 
little indents there with white paint
and<00:01:29.700> that'll<00:01:29.939> give<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.329> nice<00:01:31.670> nice<00:01:32.670> color

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
and that'll give it a nice nice color

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.940 
and that'll give it a nice nice color
and<00:01:33.150> if<00:01:33.720> it's<00:01:33.900> too<00:01:34.110> bright<00:01:34.290> it'll<00:01:34.680> kind<00:01:34.890> of

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
and if it's too bright it'll kind of

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.469 
and if it's too bright it'll kind of
light<00:01:35.100> up<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.369> inside<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.850> cab<00:01:36.060> you<00:01:36.270> don't

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
light up the inside of the cab you don't

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.899 
light up the inside of the cab you don't
really<00:01:36.570> want<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.130> so<00:01:38.130> what<00:01:38.369> I'm<00:01:38.460> going<00:01:38.729> for

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
really want that so what I'm going for

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.580 
really want that so what I'm going for
is<00:01:39.030> just<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.509> have<00:01:39.720> enough<00:01:40.079> light<00:01:40.320> where<00:01:40.560> you

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
is just to have enough light where you

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.649 
is just to have enough light where you
can<00:01:40.770> see<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.070> it's<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.340> but<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.119> won't<00:01:42.360> be

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
can see that it's on but it won't be

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.620 
can see that it's on but it won't be
shining<00:01:43.590> into<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.950> cab<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.520> also<00:01:45.000> decided<00:01:45.479> to

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
shining into the cab I also decided to

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.350 
shining into the cab I also decided to
do<00:01:45.780> something<00:01:46.680> kind<00:01:46.829> of<00:01:46.950> fun<00:01:47.189> unique<00:01:47.579> Union

do something kind of fun unique Union

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.510 
do something kind of fun unique Union
Pacific<00:01:48.750> locomotives<00:01:49.350> have<00:01:49.530> cab<00:01:49.860> signaling

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
Pacific locomotives have cab signaling

with<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.009> Pete<00:01:53.280> might<00:01:53.430> think<00:01:53.670> this<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:53.939> kind

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
with you Pete might think this is kind

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.990 
with you Pete might think this is kind
of<00:01:54.180> cool<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.659> actually<00:01:54.810> added<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.490> cab<00:01:56.490> signal

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
of cool I actually added a cab signal

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.130 
of cool I actually added a cab signal
you'll<00:01:57.180> see<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.680> once<00:01:58.680> it's<00:01:58.860> installed<00:02:00.140> but

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
you'll see this once it's installed but

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.899 
you'll see this once it's installed but
anyways<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:02.040> just<00:02:02.219> went<00:02:02.369> in<00:02:02.460> built<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.729> little

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
anyways I just went in built a little

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.870 
anyways I just went in built a little
styrene<00:02:03.329> box<00:02:03.570> gotta<00:02:03.899> paint<00:02:04.409> up<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.950> touch<00:02:05.670> up

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
styrene box gotta paint up and touch up

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.479 
styrene box gotta paint up and touch up
some<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.180> the<00:02:06.240> areas<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.689> glued<00:02:07.489> there

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
some of the areas that I glued there

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.270 
some of the areas that I glued there
anyways<00:02:08.729> this<00:02:08.970> will<00:02:09.149> have<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.300> clear<00:02:10.050> signal<00:02:10.289> so

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
anyways this will have a clear signal so

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.870 
anyways this will have a clear signal so
it<00:02:11.310> won't<00:02:11.489> change<00:02:12.050> with<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.170> signals<00:02:13.530> along

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
it won't change with the signals along

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.610 
it won't change with the signals along
right<00:02:14.030> away<00:02:14.150> but<00:02:14.480> it'll<00:02:14.600> be<00:02:14.780> something<00:02:15.260> that<00:02:15.590> I

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
right away but it'll be something that I

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.440 
right away but it'll be something that I
don't<00:02:16.070> think<00:02:16.340> I've<00:02:16.430> seen<00:02:16.460> done<00:02:16.790> before<00:02:16.820> NHS

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
don't think I've seen done before NHS

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.540 
don't think I've seen done before NHS
skills<00:02:17.750> so<00:02:18.020> I'll<00:02:18.620> have<00:02:18.740> an<00:02:18.830> operating<00:02:19.340> cab

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
skills so I'll have an operating cab

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.070 
skills so I'll have an operating cab
signal<00:02:20.030> with<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.210> green<00:02:20.390> light<00:02:20.600> and<00:02:20.810> that's

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
signal with the green light and that's

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.200 
signal with the green light and that's
moderating<00:02:21.650> gauges<00:02:22.040> as<00:02:22.220> well<00:02:22.460> so<00:02:22.820> I'm<00:02:23.120> gonna

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
moderating gauges as well so I'm gonna

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.720 
moderating gauges as well so I'm gonna
I'll<00:02:23.540> open<00:02:23.870> up<00:02:23.960> the<00:02:24.020> side<00:02:24.320> window<00:02:24.680> again<00:02:24.800> on

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
I'll open up the side window again on

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.210 
I'll open up the side window again on
the<00:02:25.880> front<00:02:26.180> and<00:02:26.390> I'll<00:02:27.290> weather<00:02:27.500> this<00:02:27.800> up<00:02:28.010> I'll

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
the front and I'll weather this up I'll

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.480 
the front and I'll weather this up I'll
crack<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.090> door<00:02:29.210> in<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.570> front<00:02:29.840> there<00:02:30.050> so<00:02:30.530> I'm

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
crack the door in the front there so I'm

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.830 
crack the door in the front there so I'm
just<00:02:31.670> another<00:02:31.790> fun<00:02:32.060> little<00:02:32.210> project<00:02:32.630> very

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
just another fun little project very

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.320 
just another fun little project very
gonna<00:02:32.990> show<00:02:33.200> you<00:02:33.260> guys<00:02:33.790> what<00:02:34.790> I'm<00:02:34.910> doing<00:02:35.180> here

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
gonna show you guys what I'm doing here

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.870 
gonna show you guys what I'm doing here
and<00:02:35.420> how<00:02:35.540> I<00:02:35.570> did<00:02:35.810> this<00:02:35.960> here<00:02:36.770> is<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.370> magnet

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
and how I did this here is the magnet

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.580 
and how I did this here is the magnet
where<00:02:38.030> I'm<00:02:38.180> using<00:02:38.630> you<00:02:38.900> can<00:02:39.020> pick<00:02:39.170> this<00:02:39.290> up<00:02:39.410> at

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
where I'm using you can pick this up at

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.580 
where I'm using you can pick this up at
RadioShack<00:02:40.060> I<00:02:41.060> think<00:02:41.870> it<00:02:41.930> came<00:02:42.080> in<00:02:42.230> a<00:02:42.320> package

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
RadioShack I think it came in a package

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.380 
RadioShack I think it came in a package
of<00:02:42.860> three<00:02:43.010> different<00:02:43.340> sizes<00:02:43.580> this<00:02:44.000> is<00:02:44.060> just

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
of three different sizes this is just

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.420 
of three different sizes this is just
magnet<00:02:44.870> wire<00:02:45.050> I'm<00:02:45.470> not<00:02:45.590> sure<00:02:45.770> the<00:02:45.950> diameter

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
magnet wire I'm not sure the diameter

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.820 
magnet wire I'm not sure the diameter
but<00:02:46.670> I<00:02:46.910> can<00:02:47.390> tell<00:02:47.540> you<00:02:47.630> it's<00:02:47.780> small<00:02:48.110> and<00:02:48.560> then

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
but I can tell you it's small and then

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.560 
but I can tell you it's small and then
if<00:02:49.250> you<00:02:49.370> guys<00:02:49.460> want<00:02:49.670> to<00:02:49.730> see<00:02:49.820> the<00:02:49.940> LEDs<00:02:50.360> I'm

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
if you guys want to see the LEDs I'm

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:57.280 
if you guys want to see the LEDs I'm
using<00:02:52.960> these<00:02:53.960> are<00:02:54.170> them<00:02:54.380> there<00:02:54.800> I<00:02:55.630> got<00:02:56.630> red

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
using these are them there I got red

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.050 
using these are them there I got red
yellow<00:02:57.620> and<00:02:57.680> green<00:02:57.830> originally<00:02:58.520> for<00:02:58.670> a<00:02:58.700> signal

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
yellow and green originally for a signal

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.520 
yellow and green originally for a signal
project<00:02:59.480> but<00:02:59.660> since<00:02:59.870> that<00:03:00.020> got<00:03:00.230> delayed<00:03:00.470> I

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
project but since that got delayed I

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.080 
project but since that got delayed I
figured<00:03:00.920> I'd<00:03:01.040> throw<00:03:01.280> them<00:03:01.700> in<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:01.850> cab<00:03:02.060> with

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
figured I'd throw them in the cab with

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.870 
figured I'd throw them in the cab with
some<00:03:02.300> locomotives<00:03:02.990> so<00:03:03.230> they<00:03:03.920> are<00:03:03.980> very<00:03:04.400> small

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
some locomotives so they are very small

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.440 
some locomotives so they are very small
they're<00:03:05.120> pain<00:03:05.390> to<00:03:05.600> solder<00:03:05.870> but<00:03:07.000> you<00:03:08.000> can<00:03:08.180> see

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
they're pain to solder but you can see

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.690 
they're pain to solder but you can see
them<00:03:08.600> right<00:03:10.900> there<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:12.140> little<00:03:12.550> things<00:03:13.550> are

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
them right there the little things are

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.370 
them right there the little things are
being<00:03:13.910> held<00:03:14.180> in<00:03:14.300> by<00:03:14.510> that<00:03:14.720> clear<00:03:14.990> piece<00:03:15.230> of

being held in by that clear piece of

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.040 
being held in by that clear piece of
tape<00:03:15.590> those<00:03:15.860> are<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.100> LEDs<00:03:16.580> I'm<00:03:17.420> using<00:03:17.690> some

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
tape those are the LEDs I'm using some

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.980

1/4 watt and then what I do is I hold

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.520 
1/4 watt and then what I do is I hold
them<00:03:28.060> hold<00:03:29.060> little<00:03:29.300> LEDs<00:03:29.780> with<00:03:29.990> these<00:03:30.170> file

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
them hold little LEDs with these file

down tweezers very fine point and then

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.940 
down tweezers very fine point and then
I'll<00:03:34.280> solder<00:03:34.670> it<00:03:34.910> I<00:03:35.470> usually<00:03:36.470> put<00:03:36.710> it<00:03:36.770> on<00:03:36.860> the

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
I'll solder it I usually put it on the

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.190 
I'll solder it I usually put it on the
lowest<00:03:37.160> setting<00:03:37.900> which<00:03:38.900> is<00:03:39.460> the<00:03:40.540> 2500<00:03:41.540> degrees

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
lowest setting which is the 2500 degrees

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.180 
lowest setting which is the 2500 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:03:42.800> and<00:03:43.490> I<00:03:43.760> have<00:03:44.030> my<00:03:44.209> smallest<00:03:44.600> tip

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
Fahrenheit and I have my smallest tip

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.100 
Fahrenheit and I have my smallest tip
here<00:03:46.190> on<00:03:46.280> my<00:03:46.370> soldering<00:03:46.730> iron<00:03:46.790> so<00:03:47.240> anyways

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
here on my soldering iron so anyways

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:49.360 
here on my soldering iron so anyways
that's<00:03:48.230> how<00:03:48.350> I<00:03:48.440> do<00:03:48.530> it<00:03:48.709> I'll<00:03:48.950> go<00:03:48.980> ahead<00:03:49.160> and

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
that's how I do it I'll go ahead and

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.070 
that's how I do it I'll go ahead and

what it looks like when it's all done
alright<00:03:55.670> so<00:03:55.910> here's<00:03:56.180> the<00:03:56.300> finished<00:03:57.140> product<00:03:58.010> I

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
alright so here's the finished product I

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.280 
alright so here's the finished product I
just<00:03:58.280> need<00:03:58.520> to<00:03:58.610> put<00:03:58.790> it<00:03:58.850> all<00:03:58.910> back<00:03:59.060> together

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
just need to put it all back together

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.580 
just need to put it all back together
you<00:04:00.290> can<00:04:00.380> see<00:04:00.620> I<00:04:00.650> have<00:04:01.010> a<00:04:01.990> cab<00:04:02.990> light<00:04:03.200> working

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
you can see I have a cab light working

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.560 
you can see I have a cab light working
there<00:04:03.800> and<00:04:04.190> I<00:04:04.280> have<00:04:04.430> my<00:04:04.580> gauges<00:04:04.880> lit<00:04:05.270> up<00:04:05.390> as

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
there and I have my gauges lit up as

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.360 
there and I have my gauges lit up as
well<00:04:05.780> and<00:04:06.110> I<00:04:06.260> can<00:04:06.470> put<00:04:06.650> a<00:04:06.680> little<00:04:06.830> bit<00:04:06.920> of<00:04:07.100> paint

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
well and I can put a little bit of paint

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.400 
well and I can put a little bit of paint
on<00:04:07.550> there<00:04:07.730> to<00:04:07.970> dim<00:04:08.540> down<00:04:08.750> the<00:04:08.930> gauges<00:04:09.260> on<00:04:09.380> the

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
on there to dim down the gauges on the

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.530 
on there to dim down the gauges on the
right<00:04:09.650> so<00:04:10.010> anyways<00:04:10.850> I<00:04:10.940> haven't<00:04:11.180> just<00:04:11.300> hooked

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
right so anyways I haven't just hooked

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.020 
right so anyways I haven't just hooked
straight<00:04:11.900> up<00:04:12.020> to<00:04:12.260> track<00:04:12.680> power<00:04:13.010> here<00:04:13.400> yeah<00:04:13.760> my

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
straight up to track power here yeah my

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.199 
straight up to track power here yeah my
2.2<00:04:14.990> K<00:04:15.230> ohm<00:04:15.380> resistors<00:04:15.860> on<00:04:16.670> there<00:04:17.000> and<00:04:17.120> those

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
2.2 K ohm resistors on there and those

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.300 
2.2 K ohm resistors on there and those
are<00:04:17.239> just<00:04:17.450> hooked<00:04:17.720> right<00:04:17.870> up<00:04:18.049> to<00:04:18.170> the<00:04:18.310> track

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
are just hooked right up to the track

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.979 
are just hooked right up to the track
power<00:04:19.580> leads<00:04:19.940> coming<00:04:20.239> into<00:04:20.450> the<00:04:20.600> coder<00:04:20.870> so

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
power leads coming into the coder so

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.050 
power leads coming into the coder so
anyways<00:04:21.950> guys<00:04:22.100> that's<00:04:22.310> about<00:04:22.520> all<00:04:22.640> that's<00:04:22.790> new

more thing I actually painted the

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.620 
more thing I actually painted the
insides<00:04:32.419> of<00:04:32.570> the<00:04:32.690> gauges<00:04:32.900> of<00:04:33.140> light<00:04:33.350> and<00:04:34.630> that

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
insides of the gauges of light and that

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.990 
insides of the gauges of light and that
way<00:04:35.780> they're<00:04:36.080> not<00:04:36.110> quite<00:04:36.650> as<00:04:36.680> bright<00:04:37.250> and<00:04:37.580> also

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
way they're not quite as bright and also

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.070 
way they're not quite as bright and also
when<00:04:38.210> the<00:04:38.300> lights<00:04:38.510> are<00:04:38.660> off<00:04:40.479> you<00:04:41.479> can<00:04:41.660> see<00:04:41.870> that

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
when the lights are off you can see that

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.659 
when the lights are off you can see that
the<00:04:42.290> gauges<00:04:42.680> are<00:04:42.830> white<00:04:43.040> just<00:04:43.280> like<00:04:43.340> the<00:04:43.520> real

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
the gauges are white just like the real

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:46.030 
the gauges are white just like the real
ones<00:04:43.940> so<00:04:44.210> anyways<00:04:44.900> there<00:04:45.169> it<00:04:45.229> is<00:04:45.350> I<00:04:45.560> will<00:04:45.860> put

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
ones so anyways there it is I will put

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.190 
ones so anyways there it is I will put
it<00:04:46.100> all<00:04:46.190> back<00:04:46.340> together<00:04:46.490> and<00:04:46.820> then<00:04:47.300> I'll<00:04:47.840> show

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
it all back together and then I'll show

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.030 
it all back together and then I'll show
you<00:04:48.229> what<00:04:48.410> it<00:04:48.470> looks<00:04:48.590> like<00:04:50.620> alright<00:04:51.620> so<00:04:51.890> here

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
you what it looks like alright so here

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.420 
you what it looks like alright so here
you<00:04:52.130> go<00:04:52.280> you<00:04:52.970> can<00:04:53.030> see<00:04:53.470> the<00:04:54.470> cap<00:04:54.830> signal<00:04:55.310> up

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
you go you can see the cap signal up

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.040 
you go you can see the cap signal up
there<00:04:55.610> which<00:04:55.790> is<00:04:55.940> showing<00:04:56.210> a<00:04:56.270> green<00:04:56.540> light

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
there which is showing a green light

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.380 
there which is showing a green light
which<00:04:57.560> would<00:04:57.770> mean<00:04:57.919> that<00:04:58.130> the<00:04:58.370> signal<00:04:59.240> on<00:04:59.300> the

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
which would mean that the signal on the

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.990 
which would mean that the signal on the
side<00:04:59.600> of<00:04:59.630> the<00:04:59.780> track<00:04:59.990> should<00:05:00.229> be<00:05:00.410> green<00:05:00.850> -<00:05:01.850> like

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
side of the track should be green - like

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.880 
side of the track should be green - like
the<00:05:02.120> gauges<00:05:02.540> lit<00:05:02.750> up<00:05:02.870> in<00:05:03.020> there<00:05:03.169> as<00:05:03.290> well<00:05:03.470> so

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
the gauges lit up in there as well so

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.060 
the gauges lit up in there as well so
you<00:05:04.880> can<00:05:04.970> see<00:05:05.150> they're<00:05:05.300> not<00:05:05.419> too<00:05:05.660> bright

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
you can see they're not too bright

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.590 
you can see they're not too bright
they're<00:05:07.070> not<00:05:07.250> shiny<00:05:07.520> back<00:05:07.820> too<00:05:08.060> much<00:05:08.240> so

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:08.600 
they're not shiny back too much so

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.810 
they're not shiny back too much so
