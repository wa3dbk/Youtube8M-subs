it recognize these enemies Flags them on
your<00:00:28.400> table<00:00:28.760> and<00:00:29.000> track<00:00:29.330> and<00:00:29.539> on<00:00:29.600> some<00:00:29.779> screens

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
your table and track and on some screens

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.920 
your table and track and on some screens
so<00:00:30.529> you<00:00:30.560> have<00:00:30.859> your<00:00:30.980> TV<00:00:31.369> screen<00:00:31.670> so<00:00:31.970> basically

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
so you have your TV screen so basically

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.530 
so you have your TV screen so basically
as<00:00:33.290> you<00:00:33.770> can<00:00:33.950> its<00:00:34.190> standard<00:00:34.670> threefold<00:00:35.270> to

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
as you can its standard threefold to

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.510 
as you can its standard threefold to
show<00:00:35.720> the<00:00:35.780> view<00:00:35.989> on<00:00:36.230> the<00:00:36.320> camera<00:00:36.680> the<00:00:37.340> right

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
show the view on the camera the right

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.610 
show the view on the camera the right
analog<00:00:37.790> stick<00:00:37.940> controls<00:00:38.780> your<00:00:39.020> camera<00:00:39.469> view

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
analog stick controls your camera view

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.700 
analog stick controls your camera view
so<00:00:40.010> it<00:00:40.100> doesn't<00:00:40.719> it<00:00:41.719> controls<00:00:42.200> your<00:00:42.350> reticule

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
so it doesn't it controls your reticule

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:43.990 
so it doesn't it controls your reticule
so<00:00:42.890> it<00:00:42.950> doesn't<00:00:43.250> protect<00:00:43.520> the<00:00:43.640> camera<00:00:43.850> around

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
so it doesn't protect the camera around

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.950 
so it doesn't protect the camera around
a<00:00:44.239> player<00:00:45.340> and<00:00:46.340> going<00:00:47.120> into<00:00:47.239> Ironside<00:00:47.719> it's

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
I what I can also do is I don't know

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.179 
I what I can also do is I don't know
what<00:01:40.789> a<00:01:40.819> drone<00:01:41.090> is<00:01:41.210> I'm<00:01:41.659> gonna<00:01:41.950> take<00:01:42.950> out<00:01:43.159> my

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
what a drone is I'm gonna take out my

00:01:43.189 --> 00:02:04.149 
what a drone is I'm gonna take out my
drone<00:02:01.780> somehow<00:02:02.780> I<00:02:03.109> think<00:02:03.170> design<00:02:03.799> this<00:02:03.979> kind

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
drone somehow I think design this kind

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.410 
drone somehow I think design this kind
of<00:02:04.250> witness

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.619 

yeah<00:02:10.400> hey<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.670> think<00:02:11.730> we<00:02:12.030> can<00:02:12.150> safely<00:02:12.299> say<00:02:12.480> that

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
yeah hey I think we can safely say that

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.289 
yeah hey I think we can safely say that
design<00:02:13.200> one<00:02:13.769> yeah<00:02:14.549> yep

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
design one yeah yep

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.280 
design one yeah yep
you're<00:02:15.599> absolutely<00:02:15.749> right<00:02:16.439> well<00:02:16.799> that<00:02:16.950> summer
