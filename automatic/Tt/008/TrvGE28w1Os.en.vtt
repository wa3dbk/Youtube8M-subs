Valtor after that it allowed me to

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.700

the last last climb where it's actually
necessary<00:03:21.609> I<00:03:22.299> think<00:03:23.170> that<00:03:23.290> is<00:03:23.409> one<00:03:23.560> of<00:03:23.709> the

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.899 
necessary I think that is one of the
strengths<00:03:24.159> I<00:03:24.430> think<00:03:25.090> also<00:03:25.959> that<00:03:26.560> his

00:03:26.899 --> 00:03:26.909 
strengths I think also that his

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:29.759 
strengths I think also that his
mentality<00:03:27.909> is<00:03:28.180> is<00:03:28.810> a<00:03:28.870> strength<00:03:29.260> of<00:03:29.409> them<00:03:29.560> he's

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
mentality is is a strength of them he's

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.599 
mentality is is a strength of them he's
a<00:03:29.799> strong<00:03:30.430> rider<00:03:30.760> in<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.120> head<00:03:31.290> can<00:03:32.290> fight

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
a strong rider in the head can fight

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.009 
a strong rider in the head can fight
although<00:03:33.609> that<00:03:33.849> mental<00:03:34.209> strength<00:03:34.359> might<00:03:34.780> need

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
although that mental strength might need

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.920 
although that mental strength might need
a<00:03:35.049> little<00:03:35.319> honing<00:03:36.120> when<00:03:37.120> he<00:03:37.209> came<00:03:37.389> in<00:03:37.599> the<00:03:37.719> team
