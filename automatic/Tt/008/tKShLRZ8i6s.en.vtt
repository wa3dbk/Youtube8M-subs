weight right there

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.820 
weight right there
a<00:01:55.939> banks<00:01:56.569> anchor<00:01:56.929> snap<00:01:57.409> it<00:01:57.679> on<00:01:58.310> there<00:01:58.520> you<00:01:58.729> go

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
a banks anchor snap it on there you go

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.620 
a banks anchor snap it on there you go
yeah<00:02:00.430> and<00:02:00.550> when<00:02:00.640> I<00:02:00.670> say<00:02:00.910> with<00:02:01.090> these<00:02:01.210> big<00:02:01.420> fish

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
yeah and when I say with these big fish

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.180 
yeah and when I say with these big fish
it<00:02:01.930> doesn't<00:02:01.960> matter<00:02:02.350> a<00:02:02.410> lot<00:02:02.770> of<00:02:02.830> times<00:02:03.010> the

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
it doesn't matter a lot of times the

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.310 
it doesn't matter a lot of times the
Carolina<00:02:03.610> rig<00:02:03.820> slides<00:02:04.180> so<00:02:04.510> that<00:02:04.660> they<00:02:05.290> think

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
Carolina rig slides so that they think

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.530 
Carolina rig slides so that they think
it's<00:02:05.740> not<00:02:05.890> going<00:02:06.040> to<00:02:06.100> detect<00:02:06.460> and<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.910> fish

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
it's not going to detect and the fish

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.540 
it's not going to detect and the fish
but<00:02:07.900> this<00:02:08.200> the<00:02:08.560> fish<00:02:08.770> is<00:02:08.920> probably<00:02:09.160> so<00:02:09.310> big

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
but this the fish is probably so big

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.950 
but this the fish is probably so big
you're<00:02:09.970> not<00:02:10.119> even<00:02:10.330> going<00:02:10.450> to<00:02:10.479> make<00:02:10.780> this

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
you're not even going to make this

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.000 
you're not even going to make this
