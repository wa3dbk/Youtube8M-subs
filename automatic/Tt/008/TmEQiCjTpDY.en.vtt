some of the floor and some of the walls
just<00:01:34.390> to<00:01:34.479> see<00:01:34.659> the<00:01:34.960> progress<00:01:35.520> usually<00:01:36.520> I

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
just to see the progress usually I

just to see the progress usually I
finish<00:01:37.530> finished<00:01:38.530> walls<00:01:38.770> then<00:01:39.249> I<00:01:39.369> finished

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789

00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:43.569 
roof then I finished the floor but just

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:46.099 
roof then I finished the floor but just
to<00:01:43.630> show<00:01:43.810> you

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:46.109 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:50.849 

Lys<00:01:47.999> plankton<00:01:48.999> roof<00:01:49.240> are<00:01:49.689> made<00:01:50.229> from<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:50.679> same

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:50.859 
Lys plankton roof are made from the same

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:55.169 
Lys plankton roof are made from the same
material<00:01:51.399> as<00:01:51.549> I<00:01:52.469> talked<00:01:53.469> about<00:01:53.560> last<00:01:53.710> time<00:01:54.179> the

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
material as I talked about last time the

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:58.440 
material as I talked about last time the
waste<00:01:55.420> from<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:55.869> sole<00:01:56.229> meal<00:01:56.409> and<00:01:56.999> I<00:01:57.999> put<00:01:58.299> them

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
waste from the sole meal and I put them

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.120 
waste from the sole meal and I put them
like<00:01:58.979> one<00:02:00.420> up<00:02:01.420> here<00:02:01.810> and<00:02:02.020> then<00:02:02.289> I<00:02:02.409> just<00:02:02.439> squeeze

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
like one up here and then I just squeeze

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.599 
like one up here and then I just squeeze
the<00:02:03.609> others<00:02:03.880> in<00:02:04.119> and<00:02:04.359> nailed<00:02:05.289> them<00:02:05.590> down<00:02:05.889> so

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:06.609 
the others in and nailed them down so

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:10.130 
the others in and nailed them down so
the<00:02:07.420> layer<00:02:07.659> on<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.080> top<00:02:08.110> is<00:02:08.380> quite<00:02:08.619> thick<00:02:09.250> but

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
the layer on the top is quite thick but

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.450 
the layer on the top is quite thick but
as<00:02:11.140> you<00:02:11.290> can<00:02:11.410> see<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.830> materials<00:02:12.250> themselves

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
as you can see the materials themselves

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.110 
as you can see the materials themselves
and<00:02:13.240> not<00:02:13.600> that<00:02:13.840> thick<00:02:14.230> so<00:02:14.590> it<00:02:14.830> won't<00:02:15.190> be

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
and not that thick so it won't be

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:23.820 
and not that thick so it won't be
so<00:02:16.660> heavy<00:02:18.629> when<00:02:19.629> you<00:02:19.780> put<00:02:20.610> on<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.840> roof<00:02:23.019> these

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
so heavy when you put on the roof these

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:30.509 
so heavy when you put on the roof these
beams<00:02:26.819> these<00:02:27.819> beams<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:29.140> be<00:02:29.230> the<00:02:29.379> roof<00:02:29.560> it's<00:02:30.099> I

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
beams these beams to be the roof it's I

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.420 
beams these beams to be the roof it's I
think<00:02:31.120> it's<00:02:31.480> important<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:32.230> put<00:02:32.890> them<00:02:33.069> right

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
think it's important to put them right

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.199 
think it's important to put them right
on<00:02:33.730> top<00:02:33.790> of<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:36.340> pillars<00:02:36.760> that<00:02:37.000> this

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
on top of the pillars that this

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.610 
on top of the pillars that this
underneath<00:02:37.750> is<00:02:37.989> tough

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
underneath is tough

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:47.160 
underneath is tough
so<00:02:39.549> when<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.840> roof<00:02:44.670> this<00:02:45.670> plank<00:02:46.360> where<00:02:46.959> it

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
so when the roof this plank where it

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.830 
so when the roof this plank where it
needs<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.830> pillar<00:02:48.069> you<00:02:49.000> need<00:02:49.239> to<00:02:49.450> cut<00:02:49.690> the

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
needs the pillar you need to cut the

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.860 
needs the pillar you need to cut the
pillar<00:02:50.079> in<00:02:50.739> an<00:02:50.890> angle<00:02:51.250> like<00:02:51.579> that<00:02:51.849> so<00:02:52.180> if<00:02:52.329> this

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
pillar in an angle like that so if this

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.229 
pillar in an angle like that so if this
will<00:02:53.140> lean<00:02:53.440> well<00:02:53.980> on<00:02:54.510> on<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:55.660> pillar<00:02:55.870> and<00:02:57.239> I

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
will lean well on on the pillar and I

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.089 
will lean well on on the pillar and I
have<00:02:58.450> one<00:02:59.140> of<00:02:59.380> these<00:03:00.360> roof<00:03:01.360> beams<00:03:02.260> for<00:03:02.860> each

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
have one of these roof beams for each

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.030 
have one of these roof beams for each
pillar<00:03:03.519> and<00:03:04.120> last<00:03:04.569> time<00:03:04.870> I<00:03:05.049> actually<00:03:05.349> lied<00:03:05.799> to

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
pillar and last time I actually lied to

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.210 
pillar and last time I actually lied to
you<00:03:06.129> I<00:03:06.190> said<00:03:06.879> that<00:03:06.940> I<00:03:07.209> have<00:03:07.410> five<00:03:08.410> main<00:03:08.769> pillars

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220

didn't<00:03:11.440> I<00:03:11.680> counted<00:03:12.250> them<00:03:12.390> counted<00:03:13.390> them<00:03:13.510> once

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
didn't I counted them counted them once

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.979 
didn't I counted them counted them once
more<00:03:13.959> and<00:03:14.200> I<00:03:14.379> had<00:03:14.650> used<00:03:14.860> 70<00:03:15.370> I<00:03:15.720> don't<00:03:16.720> think

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
more and I had used 70 I don't think

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:23.280 
more and I had used 70 I don't think
there's<00:03:17.410> any<00:03:17.590> different<00:03:17.920> if<00:03:18.040> used<00:03:18.340> 15<00:03:21.780> yes<00:03:22.780> of

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
there's any different if used 15 yes of

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.440 
there's any different if used 15 yes of
course<00:03:23.560> now<00:03:23.980> it's<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.549> this<00:03:24.880> is<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.150> largest

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
course now it's the this is the largest

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.180 
course now it's the this is the largest
expense<00:03:26.109> to<00:03:27.010> your<00:03:27.310> cabin<00:03:27.750> the<00:03:28.750> top<00:03:29.069> but<00:03:30.069> then

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
expense to your cabin the top but then

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.319 
expense to your cabin the top but then
again<00:03:30.340> you<00:03:30.549> can<00:03:30.730> use<00:03:31.060> any<00:03:31.420> old<00:03:31.540> top<00:03:32.069> because

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
again you can use any old top because

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.819 
again you can use any old top because
you<00:03:34.329> don't<00:03:34.510> have<00:03:34.630> use<00:03:34.900> in<00:03:35.049> particular<00:03:35.530> kind<00:03:35.739> of

the cabin it looks like a huge top tent
at<00:04:59.860> the<00:04:59.979> moment<00:05:00.750> but<00:05:01.750> on<00:05:02.259> the<00:05:02.379> inside<00:05:02.740> here<00:05:03.009> I

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:03.159 
at the moment but on the inside here I

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:06.059 
at the moment but on the inside here I
will<00:05:03.279> use<00:05:03.430> the<00:05:03.550> same<00:05:03.789> material<00:05:04.620> both<00:05:05.620> in<00:05:05.919> the

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:06.069 
will use the same material both in the

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:08.730 
will use the same material both in the
roof<00:05:06.219> and<00:05:06.520> on<00:05:07.120> the<00:05:07.270> walls<00:05:07.479> I<00:05:07.719> thought<00:05:08.229> I<00:05:08.469> was

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
roof and on the walls I thought I was

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:14.580 
roof and on the walls I thought I was
going<00:05:09.069> to<00:05:09.279> use<00:05:12.449> branches<00:05:13.449> and<00:05:13.840> sticks<00:05:14.169> and

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
going to use branches and sticks and

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.559 
going to use branches and sticks and
things<00:05:14.830> like<00:05:15.069> that<00:05:15.129> as<00:05:15.490> I<00:05:15.610> had<00:05:15.789> in<00:05:16.060> my<00:05:16.300> other

things like that as I had in my other
cabin<00:05:16.990> cabin<00:05:17.319> but<00:05:18.310> I<00:05:18.520> really<00:05:19.150> think<00:05:19.419> that<00:05:19.509> will

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
cabin cabin but I really think that will

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.290 
cabin cabin but I really think that will
be<00:05:19.990> I<00:05:20.639> don't<00:05:21.639> have<00:05:22.029> the<00:05:22.240> the<00:05:22.479> sticks<00:05:23.909> on<00:05:24.909> my

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
be I don't have the the sticks on my

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.179 
be I don't have the the sticks on my
property<00:05:25.960> there<00:05:26.469> are<00:05:26.650> not<00:05:27.279> many<00:05:28.860> young<00:05:29.860> trees

00:05:30.179 --> 00:05:30.189 
property there are not many young trees

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:32.939 
property there are not many young trees
like<00:05:30.460> that<00:05:30.729> that<00:05:31.330> I<00:05:31.449> can<00:05:31.629> cut<00:05:31.870> so<00:05:32.620> I<00:05:32.680> will<00:05:32.800> use

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:32.949 
like that that I can cut so I will use

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:34.709 
like that that I can cut so I will use
the<00:05:33.129> same<00:05:33.339> material<00:05:33.759> inside<00:05:34.089> as<00:05:34.270> I<00:05:34.389> have<00:05:34.479> used

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:34.719 
the same material inside as I have used

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:37.079 
the same material inside as I have used
on<00:05:34.960> the<00:05:35.289> outside<00:05:35.680> with<00:05:36.039> the<00:05:36.069> top<00:05:36.370> in<00:05:36.669> between

00:05:37.079 --> 00:05:37.089 
on the outside with the top in between

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:39.390 
on the outside with the top in between
the<00:05:37.240> layers<00:05:37.449> just<00:05:38.409> to<00:05:38.560> keep<00:05:38.710> the<00:05:39.039> wind<00:05:39.310> from
