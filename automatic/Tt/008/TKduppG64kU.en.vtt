00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.590 

I<00:01:01.890> think<00:01:02.579> in<00:01:02.640> here<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:02.969> can<00:01:03.089> hear<00:01:03.179> that<00:01:03.359> says

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
I think in here you can hear that says

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.240 
I think in here you can hear that says
also<00:01:03.960> there's<00:01:04.140> plenty<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.409> see<00:01:04.680> er<00:01:04.710> there

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
also there's plenty to see er there

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.100 
also there's plenty to see er there
so<00:01:05.610> we're<00:01:05.759> sealing<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.420> juices<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
so we're sealing in the juices in the
