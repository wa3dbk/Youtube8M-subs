three<00:00:43.230> top<00:00:43.559> awards<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.629> think<00:00:45.629> for<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.250> first

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
three top awards I think for the first

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.029 
three top awards I think for the first
time<00:00:47.579> it's<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:48.530> product<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.559> really<00:00:49.950> is

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
time it's a product that really is

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.069 
time it's a product that really is
totally<00:00:50.460> original<00:00:51.030> when<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.180> say<00:00:51.420> original<00:00:51.930> not

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
totally original when I say original not

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.869 
totally original when I say original not
just<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:53.039> fact<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.550> looks<00:00:53.789> different

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
just the fact that it looks different

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.740 
just the fact that it looks different
but<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:54.989> really<00:00:55.110> does<00:00:55.789> offer<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:57.360> rather

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
but it really does offer a rather

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.650 
but it really does offer a rather
different<00:00:58.500> type<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.859> transport<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.420> sense

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
different type of transport in the sense

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.689 
different type of transport in the sense
that<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:01.050> is<00:01:01.260> predominantly<00:01:02.039> I<00:01:02.160> would<00:01:02.340> say<00:01:02.489> for

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
that it is predominantly I would say for

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.960 
that it is predominantly I would say for
adults<00:01:03.890> to<00:01:04.890> anticipate<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.489> question<00:01:05.880> you

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
adults to anticipate a question you

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.899 
adults to anticipate a question you
might<00:01:06.119> ask<00:01:06.330> me<00:01:06.450> about<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.049> fad<00:01:07.520> it<00:01:08.520> isn't

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
might ask me about is it a fad it isn't

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.600 
might ask me about is it a fad it isn't
a<00:01:09.000> fad<00:01:09.240> because<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:10.380> appeals<00:01:10.740> not<00:01:11.430> to

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
a fad because it appeals not to

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.670 
a fad because it appeals not to
teenagers<00:01:12.210> it's<00:01:12.390> basically<00:01:12.960> an<00:01:13.140> adult<00:01:13.260> bike

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
teenagers it's basically an adult bike

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.460 
teenagers it's basically an adult bike
it's<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.159> fashion<00:01:14.340> bike<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:15.030> as<00:01:15.180> much<00:01:15.450> as<00:01:15.720> the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
it's a fashion bike in as much as the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.460 
it's a fashion bike in as much as the
styling<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.070> radically<00:01:17.549> different<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:18.470> the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
styling is radically different and the

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.679 
styling is radically different and the
fact<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.220> we<00:01:20.460> have<00:01:20.610> got<00:01:20.640> certain<00:01:21.299> retail

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
fact that we have got certain retail

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:22.969 
fact that we have got certain retail
outlets<00:01:22.080> taking<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.530> on<00:01:22.650> who<00:01:22.770> have<00:01:22.920> never

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
handled a bike before I think indicates

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.819 
handled a bike before I think indicates
perhaps<00:01:26.150> the<00:01:27.150> stylistic<00:01:28.080> high<00:01:28.439> fashion

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
perhaps the stylistic high fashion

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.190 
perhaps the stylistic high fashion
appeal<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.280> has<00:01:29.490> but<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.360> don't<00:01:30.630> consider<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:31.079> a

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
appeal it has but I don't consider it a

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.950 
appeal it has but I don't consider it a
fashion<00:01:31.439> bike<00:01:31.920> in<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.970> sense<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.390> it'll<00:01:33.810> go

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
fashion bike in the sense that it'll go

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.170 
fashion bike in the sense that it'll go
out<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.500> fashion<00:01:34.680> any<00:01:35.009> more<00:01:35.250> than<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.670> mini

out of fashion any more than the mini
minor<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.290> just<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.650> bike<00:01:37.860> for<00:01:38.040> the
