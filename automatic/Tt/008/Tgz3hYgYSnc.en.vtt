00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
see in this picture right here it looks

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.609 
see in this picture right here it looks
like<00:00:20.220> mega<00:00:20.640> aerodactyl<00:00:21.510> was<00:00:21.720> just<00:00:22.020> confirmed

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
like mega aerodactyl was just confirmed

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.429 
like mega aerodactyl was just confirmed
which<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.400> pretty<00:00:23.519> cool<00:00:24.050> obviously<00:00:25.050> this<00:00:25.289> is

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
which is pretty cool obviously this is

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.529 
which is pretty cool obviously this is
one<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.710> pokemon<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.460> has<00:00:26.760> never<00:00:27.000> had<00:00:27.330> an

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
one of the pokemon that has never had an

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.720 
one of the pokemon that has never had an
evolution<00:00:28.019> prior<00:00:28.500> or<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:29.189> know<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.310> previous

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
evolution prior or you know a previous

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.580 
evolution prior or you know a previous
evolution<00:00:30.119> or<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.269> litter<00:00:30.510> evolution<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.439> it's

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
evolution or a litter evolution so it's

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.080 
evolution or a litter evolution so it's
kind<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.769> cool<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:31.980> see<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.489> Pokemon<00:00:32.910> being

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
kind of cool to see this Pokemon being

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.639 
kind of cool to see this Pokemon being
changed<00:00:33.420> up<00:00:33.570> just<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.840> little<00:00:33.989> bit<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.350> its<00:00:34.469> mega

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
changed up just a little bit in its mega

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.709 
changed up just a little bit in its mega
evolution<00:00:35.160> what<00:00:35.760> we<00:00:35.850> do<00:00:36.000> know<00:00:36.149> about<00:00:36.510> this

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
evolution what we do know about this

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.720 
evolution what we do know about this
evolution<00:00:37.559> though<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:37.890> it<00:00:38.370> actually

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
evolution though is that it actually

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.000 
evolution though is that it actually
gets<00:00:38.969> an<00:00:39.180> increase<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.629> its<00:00:40.020> speed<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.739> its

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
gets an increase to its speed and its

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.799 
gets an increase to its speed and its
physical<00:00:41.190> attack<00:00:41.730> at<00:00:42.239> least<00:00:42.450> that's<00:00:42.629> what<00:00:42.780> I

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
physical attack at least that's what I

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.229 
physical attack at least that's what I
read<00:00:43.110> which<00:00:43.590> is<00:00:43.710> absolutely<00:00:44.070> insane<00:00:44.520> when<00:00:45.149> you

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
read which is absolutely insane when you

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.790 
read which is absolutely insane when you
think<00:00:45.420> about<00:00:45.480> this<00:00:45.719> Pokemon<00:00:46.140> because<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.680> it

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
think about this Pokemon because of it

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.040 
think about this Pokemon because of it
having<00:00:47.190> one<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.820> highest<00:00:48.210> base<00:00:48.510> speeds<00:00:48.870> in

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
having one of the highest base speeds in

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.920 
having one of the highest base speeds in
the<00:00:49.079> game<00:00:49.320> already<00:00:49.590> with<00:00:50.399> base<00:00:50.579> 130<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.750> who

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the game already with base 130 so who

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.840 
the game already with base 130 so who
knows<00:00:52.140> how<00:00:52.410> much<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.890> speed<00:00:53.340> increase<00:00:53.370> this

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
knows how much of a speed increase this

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.939 
knows how much of a speed increase this
Pokemon<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.420> going<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.809> receive<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.829> is

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
Pokemon is going to receive but that is

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.680 
Pokemon is going to receive but that is
just<00:00:55.980> terrifying<00:00:56.640> because<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.059> how<00:00:57.210> fast<00:00:57.510> this

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
just terrifying because of how fast this

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.900 
just terrifying because of how fast this
Pokemon<00:00:58.140> already<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.829> meaning<00:00:59.609> that'll<00:00:59.789> be

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
Pokemon already is meaning that'll be

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.520 
Pokemon already is meaning that'll be
even<00:01:00.059> faster<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.719> even<00:01:00.870> more<00:01:01.020> powerful<00:01:01.320> with

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
even faster and even more powerful with

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.520 
even faster and even more powerful with
an<00:01:01.649> attack<00:01:01.949> increase<00:01:02.370> as<00:01:02.609> well<00:01:02.870> also<00:01:03.870> we<00:01:04.409> do

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
an attack increase as well also we do

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.780 
an attack increase as well also we do
know<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.979> gets<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.280> tough<00:01:05.549> claws

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
know that it gets the tough claws

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.780 
know that it gets the tough claws
ability<00:01:06.270> much<00:01:06.450> like<00:01:06.659> mega<00:01:06.990> Charizard<00:01:07.650> X<00:01:07.790> so

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
ability much like mega Charizard X so

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.370 
ability much like mega Charizard X so
that<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.090> very<00:01:09.270> cool<00:01:09.479> but<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.140> only<00:01:10.290> thing

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
that is very cool but the only thing

that is very cool but the only thing
that<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.680> had<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> problem<00:01:11.130> with<00:01:11.400> when<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.610> heard

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
now and then but you don't really see

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.390 
now and then but you don't really see
that<00:01:24.750> too<00:01:24.900> often<00:01:25.080> but<00:01:25.290> either<00:01:25.380> way<00:01:25.560> neither<00:01:26.100> of

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
those moves really make contact with the

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.719 
those moves really make contact with the
opponent<00:01:28.439> which<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:28.979> where<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.280> tough<00:01:29.490> claws
