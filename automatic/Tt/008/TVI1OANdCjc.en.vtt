00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.819 
the face and then you're covering the
tissue<00:01:56.520> paper<00:01:56.790> with<00:01:57.090> latex<00:01:57.509> but<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.649> tissue

tissue paper with latex but the tissue
paper<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.280> there<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.729> specifically<00:02:00.290> create<00:02:01.290> a

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
paper is there to specifically create a

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.609 
paper is there to specifically create a
barrier<00:02:01.619> between<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.460> skin<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.619> latex

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
barrier between the skin and the latex

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.219 
barrier between the skin and the latex
so<00:02:04.979> don't<00:02:05.430> put<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.060> liquid<00:02:06.240> latex<00:02:06.600> under<00:02:07.079> the

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
darken them too much at least under them

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.930 
darken them too much at least under them
you<00:02:22.110> want<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.260> keep<00:02:22.380> it<00:02:22.530> kind<00:02:22.620> of<00:02:22.710> light<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.160> I

you want to keep it kind of light and I

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.340 
you want to keep it kind of light and I
use<00:02:24.180> silver<00:02:24.510> because<00:02:24.660> it<00:02:24.750> reflects<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.230> light

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
use silver because it reflects the light

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.000 
use silver because it reflects the light
so<00:02:25.590> it'll<00:02:25.710> make<00:02:25.800> stars<00:02:26.040> seem<00:02:26.280> very<00:02:26.490> Hollow<00:02:26.640> and

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010

so it'll make stars seem very Hollow and

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
it's very painful because when you

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.230 
it's very painful because when you
remove<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:09.930> liquid<00:04:10.230> latex<00:04:10.530> it's<00:04:10.940> going<00:04:11.940> to<00:04:12.120> be

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
like removing rubber and the rubber will

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.090 
like removing rubber and the rubber will
seal<00:04:14.700> around<00:04:14.880> hair
