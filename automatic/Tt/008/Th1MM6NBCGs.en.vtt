00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.509
 I'll tell you about one more engine 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.780
 prepared by us for flight bass this 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:12.200
 16-valve engine vaz of 16 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:16.470
 td05 the turbine 20 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:22.100
 subara flanges engine assembled for 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:24.300
 Kherson clients brief his specs 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.970
 crankshaft standard lightweight connecting rods 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.130
 and standard lightweight 500 grams 500 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.899
 10 grams each weighs 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:36.960
 2110 pistons with Komi tsykov lightweight 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.040
 35 grams each head sawn 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.280
 saddles deployed 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.730
 valve profile has been changed 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.860
 camshaft valves usa 912 277 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.289
 degrees equally pair receiver green 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.079
 Kharkov production before he was 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.300
 green was therefore called green receiver 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.890
 very nice i like a few 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.680
 Once the engine was assembled with this receiver 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.690
 and every time they were with very good 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.799
 dedication to the top and without significant loss 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.619
 bottom fuel ramp without brother of what 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.900
 there will be an external pressure regulator 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.860
 fuel 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:16.970
 throttle fifty six 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.970
 millimeters reinforced oil feed 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:25.189
 turbine firm arashi this taiwan is very 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:29.610
 well proven turbine 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:32.520
 exhaust manifold stinger through 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.920
 on the quality of course well after the modifications 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.320
 least you had to see 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.400
 saw because the plate was 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.579
 deformed very much here you can see 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.430
 wait a second 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.460
 because on the step you see how she 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.970
 became east we took the load here 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.970
 so she became 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:58.070
 here so this oil is drained here it is oil 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.040
 drain and ice pallet rubber compound 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:07.700
 here below here here you see 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:09.760
 support here collector emphasis and more 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.800
 one stop here on top 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.770
 so that the turbine is not strong 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.970
 shifted relative to the motor exposed 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.350
 overlap phase 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.910
 per millimeter millimeter though recommended 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.590
 use recommended embed 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.400
 millimeter in pieces and a half on release 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.820
 we have a little covered issue here 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.000
 there is an exhaust temperature sensor 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.000
 of gases 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:43.120
 now oil cooling 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.930
 so this spacer is implemented 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.920
 from peugeot 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.700
 below is a thermo valve here in it 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:55.209
 there is a thermostat there is a pressure regulator 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.010
 here from him the oil out of the radiator 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:07.650
 will flow by gravity into the pan 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:13.680
 here is a fitting 16 mm internal section 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.680
 flywheel flywheel weighing 3 and 6 kilograms 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:24.459
 clutch 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:27.700
 my car cermet even already 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:30.040
 said engine 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.600
 theoretically with potential and about 400 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.260
 horsepower may be more turbine 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.819
 able to pump through itself 424 150 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.510
 forces 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:43.660
 the compression ratio of the engine 8 and 6 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.600
 principle, you can inflate 2 bars at 98 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.209
 gasoline will adjust previously 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.660
 Misha rs seems to see 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:55.620
 what is the result so that everyone 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.620
 Thanks for attention
