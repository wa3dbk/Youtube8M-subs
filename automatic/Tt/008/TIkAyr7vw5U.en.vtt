00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.350
 here 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.080
 do not 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.850
 body is very good today I bring you a 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.320
 small idea that you can incorporate to 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.670
 your cardio street routine from 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.100
 a while ago that will call with an idea 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.600
 very interesting and it's mixing speeds 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.220
 as we saw a few weeks ago in the video 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.960
 of the slow running susceptibility is 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.489
 very interesting to do things to a 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.199
 speed so the viewer can 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.449
 have to be happening especially in 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.890
 magic but also as I said in cat 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.930
 street now I'm just going to 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.610
 focus on the load section this 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.040
 I think it's really interesting the fact 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.799
 that with minis speeds in time 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.659
 real is to say that you start making a 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.920
 a routine at a very very very speed 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.180
 fast to the maximum that you can go 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.120
 suddenly 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.700
 paris the speed to then continue 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.140
 this idea came to me a few years ago when 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.730
 see a video of chiapas that I thought was 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:22.060
 super interesting the fact that I was doing 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:24.850
 a civilian and suddenly the speed the 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.620
 stopped and then it continued fast that 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.870
 although it is very interesting in car 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.520
 district mix speeds because that 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.410
 it was also an art element in what 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.440
 that you are raising because you are leaving a 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.000
 flat movement of a classic style of 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.070
 a style that makes everyone almost 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.570
 nobody combines speeds around the world 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.070
 makes more or less cuts and 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.050
 movements in handling and car 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.610
 district at the same speed the fact 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.259
 to combine speeds you can 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.580
 distinguish if it is true that this 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.750
 concept is aimed at people who 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.340
 have a more advanced level in car 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.530
 district and that already dominates the fact of 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.270
 make movements in an elegant way that 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.950
 have already reached a level is 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.200
 interesting that the people that you are 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.860
 starting to see that a premise that you 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.780
 a few days ago 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.860
 and is that in cardiff that is recommended 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.050
 When you first start watching the 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.850
 movements fluidly the fact of 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.970
 break with that premise and do 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.470
 fast and slow movements in it 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.819
 carl routine seen and if it's okay 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.709
 fact can be artistically very 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.629
 as I say it's a little idea that I wanted 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.219
 share with you I wanted to save 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.569
 for me because above all I think that you 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:23.400
 can inspire when you 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.840
 do with carl district very different 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.430
 to the rest and good to like it that you 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.469
 liked this kind of short video with 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.999
 a very fast and direct idea and we 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:31.999
 we see in the next video see you later
