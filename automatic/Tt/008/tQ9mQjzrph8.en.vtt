iPad battery life here at Apple iPad TV
we<00:00:23.130> have<00:00:23.279> been<00:00:23.490> getting<00:00:23.880> close<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.359> nine<00:00:24.660> hours

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
we have been getting close to nine hours

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.589 
we have been getting close to nine hours
of<00:00:25.140> battery<00:00:25.859> life<00:00:25.939> after<00:00:26.939> medium<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.480> heavy

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
of battery life after medium to heavy

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.560 
of battery life after medium to heavy
usage<00:00:27.840> doing<00:00:28.560> things<00:00:28.859> like<00:00:29.010> web<00:00:29.429> browsing

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
usage doing things like web browsing

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.069

watching videos and using applications

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.080 
watching videos and using applications
however<00:00:34.079> there<00:00:34.829> are<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.040> few<00:00:35.340> simple<00:00:35.700> but

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
however there are a few simple but

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.750 
however there are a few simple but
effective<00:00:36.420> things<00:00:37.020> we<00:00:37.230> can<00:00:37.500> do<00:00:37.710> in<00:00:38.250> order<00:00:38.610> to

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
effective things we can do in order to

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.869 
effective things we can do in order to
extend<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.329> battery<00:00:39.480> life<00:00:39.890> so<00:00:40.890> first<00:00:41.219> off<00:00:41.460> we

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
extend the battery life so first off we

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.930 
extend the battery life so first off we
can<00:00:42.120> reduce<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.600> brightness<00:00:42.809> now<00:00:43.520> the<00:00:44.520> iPad

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
can reduce the brightness now the iPad

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.880 
can reduce the brightness now the iPad
has<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.120> big<00:00:45.450> display<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.110> at<00:00:46.320> full<00:00:46.559> brightness

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
has a big display and at full brightness

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.560 
has a big display and at full brightness
it<00:00:47.550> looks<00:00:47.850> amazing

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
it looks amazing

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.110 
it looks amazing
but<00:00:48.989> doing<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:49.670> significantly<00:00:50.670> drains<00:00:50.969> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
but doing this significantly drains the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.290 
but doing this significantly drains the
battery<00:00:51.239> life<00:00:51.829> so<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.890> reduce<00:00:53.219> brightness<00:00:53.969> we

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
battery life so to reduce brightness we

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.680 
battery life so to reduce brightness we
simply<00:00:54.750> go<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.930> settings<00:00:56.120> brightness<00:00:57.120> on

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
simply go to settings brightness on

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.220 
simply go to settings brightness on
wallpaper<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.770> then<00:00:59.149> simply<00:01:00.149> reduce<00:01:00.539> the

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
wallpaper and then simply reduce the

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.210 
wallpaper and then simply reduce the
brightness<00:01:01.469> now<00:01:03.199> up<00:01:04.199> firstly<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.830> does<00:01:05.040> look

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
brightness now up firstly it does look

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.700 
brightness now up firstly it does look
quite<00:01:05.369> strange<00:01:05.850> but<00:01:06.180> after<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.900> few<00:01:07.170> days<00:01:07.350> you

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
quite strange but after a few days you

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.750 
quite strange but after a few days you
will<00:01:07.920> get<00:01:08.040> used<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.369> it

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
will get used to it

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.149 
will get used to it
now<00:01:09.510> we<00:01:09.570> currently<00:01:10.020> have<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.470> brightness<00:01:10.890> set

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
now we currently have the brightness set

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.880 
now we currently have the brightness set
at<00:01:11.340> around<00:01:11.850> 20<00:01:12.479> percent<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.650> will

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
at around 20 percent and this will

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.010 
at around 20 percent and this will
significantly<00:01:14.220> increase<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.479> amount<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.840> by

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
significantly increase the amount of by

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.380 
significantly increase the amount of by
try<00:01:16.290> if<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.470> have<00:01:16.650> if<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.180> usually<00:01:18.180> have<00:01:18.360> your

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
try if you have if you usually have your

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.130 
try if you have if you usually have your
iPad<00:01:19.320> set<00:01:19.590> at<00:01:19.799> 100<00:01:20.430> percent<00:01:20.549> brightness<00:01:21.140> now

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
iPad set at 100 percent brightness now

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.710 
iPad set at 100 percent brightness now
we<00:01:22.200> can<00:01:22.680> also<00:01:22.799> turn<00:01:23.490> off<00:01:23.520> auto<00:01:24.030> brightness<00:01:24.390> as

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
we can also turn off auto brightness as

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.410 
we can also turn off auto brightness as
well<00:01:24.930> which<00:01:25.560> also<00:01:25.770> helps<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.640> conserve

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
well which also helps to conserve

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.609 
well which also helps to conserve
battery<00:01:27.780> life<00:01:29.509> so<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.689> next<00:01:30.900> thing<00:01:31.140> we<00:01:31.259> can<00:01:31.470> do

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
battery life so the next thing we can do

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.399 
battery life so the next thing we can do
is<00:01:31.860> turn<00:01:32.159> off<00:01:32.220> Wi-Fi<00:01:32.670> Bluetooth<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.720> location

is turn off Wi-Fi Bluetooth and location

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.429 
is turn off Wi-Fi Bluetooth and location
services<00:01:35.150> now<00:01:36.150> obviously<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.720> lot<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.259> time

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
services now obviously a lot of the time

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.249 
services now obviously a lot of the time
you<00:01:37.950> will<00:01:38.159> need<00:01:38.460> these<00:01:38.790> settings<00:01:39.299> enabled<00:01:39.810> but

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
you will need these settings enabled but

iPad is to fetch data less frequently or
alternatively<00:02:23.840> we<00:02:24.110> can<00:02:24.440> turn<00:02:24.830> off<00:02:24.980> push<00:02:25.370> melt

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
alternatively we can turn off push melt

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.240 
alternatively we can turn off push melt
completely<00:02:26.110> so<00:02:27.110> if<00:02:27.320> you<00:02:27.470> need<00:02:27.680> frequent

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
completely so if you need frequent

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
access to emails then this tip is

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.020 
access to emails then this tip is
probably<00:02:30.380> not<00:02:30.560> for<00:02:30.680> you<00:02:30.740> but<00:02:31.460> if<00:02:31.520> you<00:02:31.730> want<00:02:31.910> to

have better battery life then doing the
following<00:02:34.340> will<00:02:34.670> definitely<00:02:35.180> help<00:02:35.620> so<00:02:36.620> we<00:02:36.860> go

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
following will definitely help so we go

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.430 
following will definitely help so we go

fetch<00:02:42.440> new<00:02:42.560> data<00:02:42.770> and<00:02:43.400> then<00:02:44.270> we<00:02:44.720> can<00:02:44.870> simply

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
fetch new data and then we can simply

fetch new data and then we can simply
turn<00:02:45.560> off<00:02:45.620> push<00:02:46.160> or<00:02:46.870> alternatively<00:02:47.870> we<00:02:48.560> can

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
turn off push or alternatively we can

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.870 
turn off push or alternatively we can
