00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
style now it wasn't directly mimicking

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:17.090 
style now it wasn't directly mimicking
but<00:05:15.030> they<00:05:15.210> definitely<00:05:15.510> use<00:05:15.990> that<00:05:16.020> as<00:05:16.590> jumping

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
off point they figured well if kids like

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.020 
off point they figured well if kids like
this<00:05:19.039> then<00:05:20.039> we'll<00:05:20.190> make<00:05:20.310> ourselves<00:05:20.430> look<00:05:20.850> like

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
this then we'll make ourselves look like
