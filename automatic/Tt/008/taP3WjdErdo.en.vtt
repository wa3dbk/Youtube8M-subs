00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.170
 the avenue of São Paulo has already been 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.670
 different angles but the photographer Claudio 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.830
 Peter wanted to innovate 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.580
 he used the reflection on a metal post 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.839
 light to record adversities 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.869
 local 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.900
 each one has its own scenario and 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.170
 so many perceptions almost three kilometers 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.369
 where hair world looks like it is 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.730
 places where people come to 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:35.030
 find the others to write to read 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.030
 traffic noise and today manifestation 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.290
 historical symbol post card to whom 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.580
 come from outside of São Paulo she can even 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.630
 scare 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.280
 For those who are mine, here is a street like this. 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:54.450
 with these giant buildings and 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.000
 on this huge scale everyone agitated 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.830
 who has never been here does not have a 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.900
 story a scene to tell 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.480
 imagine what happens every day avenue 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.910
 Paulo in inspiration sticks my cell phone 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.430
 for example has image of the paulista 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.280
 at night from São Paulo seen from above but already 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.710
 he imagined the reflection of São Paulo because 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.630
 who had this idea was the photographer 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.810
 Claudio Pepe and managed with angles 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.290
 transform common images into 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.290
 work of art 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.440
 I'll say a little bored because I 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.840
 made images very similar to what 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.470
 I had seen it until I discovered 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.810
 post 18 by chance and brought some 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.570
 different lenses by testing testing 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.009
 but I had the distinct feeling that I 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.220
 had finally discovered a new 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.350
 T-shaped cell avenue pictures 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.870
 paulista and the post of the paulista avenue 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.330
 came to stop here in the art gallery a 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.880
 exposure sp and marcel that my life 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.670
 because many people fe 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.690
 believed that the post like the one he has 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.490
 on the Paulista Avenue 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.890
 he did not really believe much less than he 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.270
 reflection is then the idea of 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.520
 bring the pole home exactly 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.100
 because people see I see 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.310
 this possibility and getting there look the 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.850
 result is there 24 copyrights 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.970
 colorful magnified full of movements 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.820
 and expressions faithful to what the law decapitated 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.410
 an affected reality that combines two 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.680
 visual planes 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.120
 the direct and the reflex in the show two 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.400
 curiosities 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.500
 who liked the picture can take a 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.740
 little souvenir one card 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:38.400
 It's free and it also has a soundtrack. 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.140
 pepe any idea of ​​having music has 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.540
 talk with the leftovers when I was 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.630
 photographing I noticed a heavy sound 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.790
 leaving the ifj cars and buses 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.930
 but when he looks at these photos on the 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.590
 computer 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.720
 I had a wonderful idea one thing 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.070
 very smooth without the interference of 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.230
 sound so I thought 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.900
 I called the pianist tony berto but that is 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.030
 my friend to make a trail that 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.980
 passed this idea a little and then he 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.980
 did the lady version of herself look 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:20.680
 exposure sp to my avenue 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.620
