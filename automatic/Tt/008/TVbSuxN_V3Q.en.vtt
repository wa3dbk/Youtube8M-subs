00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
we see a line like this there's a lot of

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.089 
we see a line like this there's a lot of
factors<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.750> that's<00:00:25.019> kind<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.320> what<00:00:25.500> holds<00:00:26.039> a

all<00:00:33.000> these<00:00:33.420> things<00:00:33.719> make<00:00:34.440> every<00:00:35.100> single<00:00:35.219> line

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
all these things make every single line

all these things make every single line
that<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.670> set<00:00:35.820> up<00:00:35.910> unique<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.450> when<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.200> get

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
that you set up unique and when you get

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.350 
that you set up unique and when you get
used<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.399> can<00:00:38.579> learn<00:00:38.760> lines<00:00:39.030> very

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
used to it and you can learn lines very

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.229 
used to it and you can learn lines very
quickly<00:00:40.100> those<00:00:41.100> factors<00:00:41.610> start<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.059> just

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
quickly those factors start to just

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.850 
quickly those factors start to just
become<00:00:42.510> normal<00:00:42.840> you<00:00:43.230> know<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.410> can<00:00:43.620> deal<00:00:43.800> with

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
become normal you know you can deal with

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.799 
become normal you know you can deal with
any<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.250> those<00:00:44.340> factors<00:00:44.820> right<00:00:45.510> on<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.719> spot

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
any of those factors right on the spot

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.709 
any of those factors right on the spot
and<00:00:46.760> when<00:00:47.760> I'm<00:00:47.879> out<00:00:48.059> there<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.450> am

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
and when I'm out there and I am

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.040 
and when I'm out there and I am
committing<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.680> free<00:00:49.890> solo<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.399> look<00:00:51.270> just<00:00:51.930> to

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
committing to a free solo I look just to

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.540 
committing to a free solo I look just to
the<00:00:52.140> end<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.410> line<00:00:52.559> that's<00:00:53.070> my<00:00:53.309> focus

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
the end of the line that's my focus

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.549 
the end of the line that's my focus
point<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.629> once<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.960> step<00:00:55.140> on<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.320> line

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
point and once you step on the line

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.830 
point and once you step on the line
you're<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.239> that's<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.629> commitment

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
you're in it and that's the commitment

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.279 
you're in it and that's the commitment
that<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.260> need<00:00:58.969> you<00:00:59.969> take<00:01:00.180> steps<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.870> it's<00:01:01.020> a

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
that you need you take steps and it's a

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.660 
that you need you take steps and it's a
little<00:01:01.710> bit<00:01:01.829> shaky<00:01:02.190> it's<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.370> little<00:01:02.550> bit

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
little bit shaky it's a little bit

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.189 
little bit shaky it's a little bit
controlled<00:01:03.120> it's<00:01:03.420> it's<00:01:03.660> kind<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.080> between

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
controlled it's it's kind of in between

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.539 
controlled it's it's kind of in between
and<00:01:04.619> that's<00:01:04.739> what<00:01:04.860> scares<00:01:04.979> people<00:01:05.309> with

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
and that's what scares people with

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.179 
and that's what scares people with
slacklining<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.229> you're<00:01:07.229> not<00:01:07.350> really<00:01:07.409> ever<00:01:07.890> in

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
slacklining is you're not really ever in

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.000 
slacklining is you're not really ever in
control<00:01:08.670> you're<00:01:09.360> kind<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.780> using<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> lines

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
control you're kind of using the lines

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.039 
control you're kind of using the lines
shakiness<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.939> control<00:01:12.270> yourself<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.900> that's

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
shakiness to control yourself and that's

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.140 
shakiness to control yourself and that's
where<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.320> gets<00:01:13.380> scary<00:01:13.710> it's<00:01:13.950> like<00:01:14.150> you're

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
where it gets scary it's like you're

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.780 
where it gets scary it's like you're
wobbling<00:01:15.590> but<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.740> wobble<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.400> what<00:01:17.549> keeps

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
wobbling but that wobble is what keeps

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.929
