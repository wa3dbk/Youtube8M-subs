00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
then what you want to do is you can just

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.930 
then what you want to do is you can just
actually<00:00:34.090> pull<00:00:34.480> it<00:00:34.570> out<00:00:35.730> just<00:00:36.730> like<00:00:36.880> that

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
actually pull it out just like that

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.270 
actually pull it out just like that
that's<00:00:37.780> how<00:00:37.930> you<00:00:37.990> remove<00:00:38.200> the<00:00:38.380> lens<00:00:39.090> okay<00:00:40.090> and

that's how you remove the lens okay and
then<00:00:42.280> to<00:00:42.430> remove<00:00:42.670> the<00:00:42.820> strap<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:44.230> might<00:00:44.410> not

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:44.560 
then to remove the strap you might not

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.560 
then to remove the strap you might not
be<00:00:44.680> able<00:00:44.770> to<00:00:44.830> see<00:00:45.010> this<00:00:45.220> might<00:00:46.030> take<00:00:46.180> a<00:00:46.210> picture

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
be able to see this might take a picture

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.210 
be able to see this might take a picture
but<00:00:47.730> let's<00:00:48.730> see<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:50.230> see<00:00:50.410> the<00:00:50.560> black<00:00:50.800> right

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:51.220 
but let's see you see the black right

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.210 
but let's see you see the black right
there<00:00:51.690> that's<00:00:52.690> actually<00:00:53.050> the<00:00:53.230> I<00:00:53.560> guess<00:00:54.070> the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
there that's actually the I guess the

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.280 
there that's actually the I guess the
hook<00:00:54.430> for<00:00:54.910> the<00:00:55.230> strap<00:00:56.490> with<00:00:57.490> this<00:00:57.610> part<00:00:58.290> so

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
hook for the strap with this part so

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.260 
hook for the strap with this part so
what<00:00:59.440> you<00:00:59.530> want<00:00:59.650> to<00:00:59.710> do<00:00:59.920> is<00:01:00.460> take<00:01:00.760> the<00:01:00.880> top<00:01:01.090> out

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
what you want to do is take the top out

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.700 
what you want to do is take the top out
first<00:01:01.540> because<00:01:01.780> the<00:01:01.900> bottom<00:01:02.170> you<00:01:02.260> can't<00:01:02.470> see

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
first because the bottom you can't see

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.139 
first because the bottom you can't see
it<00:01:02.829> it's<00:01:03.610> actually<00:01:04.089> inside<00:01:04.449> the<00:01:04.509> frame<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:06.159> I

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
it it's actually inside the frame so I

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:09.059 
it it's actually inside the frame so I
think<00:01:07.960> it's<00:01:08.200> easy<00:01:08.409> if<00:01:08.530> you<00:01:08.590> want<00:01:08.740> to<00:01:08.859> take<00:01:08.979> the

00:01:09.059 --> 00:01:09.069 
think it's easy if you want to take the

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:10.559 
think it's easy if you want to take the
strap<00:01:09.340> off<00:01:09.520> I<00:01:09.640> think<00:01:09.700> it's<00:01:09.939> easiest<00:01:10.329> to<00:01:10.539> take

00:01:10.559 --> 00:01:10.569 
strap off I think it's easiest to take

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:13.020 
strap off I think it's easiest to take
the<00:01:10.810> lens<00:01:11.049> out<00:01:11.200> and<00:01:11.439> then<00:01:11.560> take<00:01:11.829> the<00:01:12.039> strap<00:01:12.850> out

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
the lens out and then take the strap out

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.340 
the lens out and then take the strap out
because<00:01:13.240> it<00:01:13.359> gets<00:01:13.479> really<00:01:13.630> hard<00:01:13.869> to<00:01:14.020> try<00:01:14.229> and

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
because it gets really hard to try and

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.330 
because it gets really hard to try and
bend<00:01:14.649> the<00:01:15.609> frame<00:01:15.880> to<00:01:16.179> get<00:01:16.359> the<00:01:16.829> this<00:01:17.829> part<00:01:18.159> out

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
bend the frame to get the this part out

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.669 
bend the frame to get the this part out
with<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:18.789> lens<00:01:18.999> still<00:01:19.299> in<00:01:19.450> so<00:01:20.350> what<00:01:20.469> you<00:01:20.560> want

put the lens back in start with the

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.660 
put the lens back in start with the
bridge<00:02:30.340> in<00:02:30.490> the<00:02:30.580> nose<00:02:32.430> okay

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
bridge in the nose okay

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.180 
bridge in the nose okay
and<00:02:33.760> there's<00:02:34.300> also<00:02:34.450> there's<00:02:34.990> the<00:02:35.560> frame

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
and there's also there's the frame

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.180 
and there's also there's the frame
actually<00:02:36.580> has<00:02:36.700> slots<00:02:37.740> so<00:02:38.740> of<00:02:38.830> course<00:02:39.040> that's

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
actually has slots so of course that's

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.500 
actually has slots so of course that's
rib<00:02:39.400> it<00:02:39.580> you<00:02:39.760> know<00:02:39.850> that's<00:02:40.060> where<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.240> lens<00:02:40.420> is

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
rib it you know that's where the lens is

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.180 
rib it you know that's where the lens is
gonna<00:02:40.690> go<00:02:40.870> into<00:02:41.230> so<00:02:41.380> you<00:02:41.410> want<00:02:41.650> to<00:02:41.710> follow<00:02:41.860> that

gonna go into so you want to follow that

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.430 
gonna go into so you want to follow that
all<00:02:43.060> around<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.480> lens<00:02:43.690> so<00:02:43.990> start<00:02:44.260> with<00:02:44.350> the

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
all around the lens so start with the

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:52.170 
all around the lens so start with the
bridge<00:02:44.650> of<00:02:44.800> the<00:02:44.860> nose<00:02:46.440> okay<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:51.430> then<00:02:51.790> what

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
bridge of the nose okay and then what

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.370 
bridge of the nose okay and then what
you<00:02:52.270> want<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.510> do<00:02:52.630> is<00:02:52.750> you<00:02:52.840> want<00:02:53.020> to<00:02:53.050> put<00:02:53.260> in

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
each I'm gonna call reverse tabs you

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.400 
each I'm gonna call reverse tabs you
want<00:02:57.820> to<00:02:57.880> feed<00:02:58.120> each<00:02:58.420> of<00:02:58.660> those<00:02:58.780> into<00:02:59.230> the

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
that are closest to the bridge in the

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.570 
that are closest to the bridge in the
nose<00:03:05.170> and<00:03:05.970> then<00:03:06.970> feed<00:03:07.450> it<00:03:07.630> feed<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.770> frame<00:03:09.040> and

and then what you want to do from here

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.220 
and then what you want to do from here
is<00:03:26.010> feed<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.190> top<00:03:27.430> of<00:03:27.640> the<00:03:27.700> frame<00:03:28.140> over<00:03:29.140> the

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
is feed the top of the frame over the

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.430 
is feed the top of the frame over the
lens<00:03:29.550> okay<00:03:30.550> make<00:03:31.180> sure<00:03:31.209> that<00:03:31.510> the<00:03:31.660> entire<00:03:31.959> lens

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
lens okay make sure that the entire lens

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.470 
lens okay make sure that the entire lens
is<00:03:33.070> inside<00:03:33.550> the<00:03:33.670> frame<00:03:33.880> before<00:03:34.150> you<00:03:34.209> start

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
is inside the frame before you start

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.620 
is inside the frame before you start
popping<00:03:34.900> the<00:03:35.110> reverse<00:03:35.860> tabs<00:03:36.160> into<00:03:36.670> place<00:03:36.880> so

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
popping the reverse tabs into place so

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.199 
popping the reverse tabs into place so
once<00:03:37.810> you<00:03:37.930> have<00:03:38.050> the<00:03:38.320> entire<00:03:38.760> frame<00:03:39.760> over<00:03:40.090> the

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
once you have the entire frame over the

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:41.990 
once you have the entire frame over the
lens<00:03:40.390> and<00:03:40.690> all<00:03:40.780> you<00:03:40.870> need<00:03:41.020> to<00:03:41.110> do<00:03:41.200> is<00:03:41.350> just<00:03:41.530> pop

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
lens and all you need to do is just pop

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.150 
lens and all you need to do is just pop
each<00:03:43.000> reverse<00:03:43.390> tab<00:03:43.660> into<00:03:43.990> the<00:03:44.140> the<00:03:44.500> slots<00:03:44.830> in

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
each reverse tab into the the slots in

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.949 
each reverse tab into the the slots in
the<00:03:45.580> actual<00:03:46.000> frame<00:03:46.239> and<00:03:46.480> then<00:03:46.570> you're<00:03:46.720> good<00:03:46.870> to

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
the actual frame and then you're good to

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.989 
the actual frame and then you're good to
go
