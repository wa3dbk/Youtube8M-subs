that<00:01:38.640> down<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.750> should<00:01:40.490> lock<00:01:41.490> relatively

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
that down it should lock relatively

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.600 
that down it should lock relatively
quickly<00:01:42.479> but<00:01:42.840> then<00:01:42.960> fade<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.590> quite<00:01:43.920> slow<00:01:44.340> as

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
quickly but then fade in quite slow as

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.240 
quickly but then fade in quite slow as
you<00:01:44.850> can<00:01:44.970> see<00:01:45.180> just<00:01:45.210> like<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.829> obviously

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
you can see just like that so obviously

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.620 
you can see just like that so obviously
there's<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.549> ton<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.850> customization<00:01:48.450> I'm<00:01:48.540> not

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
there's a ton of customization I'm not

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.789 
there's a ton of customization I'm not
going<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.810> go<00:01:48.899> through<00:01:49.020> each<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.409> every<00:01:49.619> one

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
going to go through each and every one

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.350 
going to go through each and every one
of<00:01:49.860> these<00:01:50.100> but<00:01:50.729> there's<00:01:50.850> just<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.030> lot<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.270> can

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
of these but there's just a lot you can

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.660 
of these but there's just a lot you can
do<00:01:51.509> for<00:01:51.659> example<00:01:52.079> in<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.439> folders<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.640> can

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
do for example in the folders you can

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.120 
do for example in the folders you can
allow<00:01:54.030> nested<00:01:54.450> folders<00:01:54.659> blow<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.590> background

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
allow nested folders blow a background

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.289 
allow nested folders blow a background
folders<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:56.670> there's<00:01:56.850> just<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.060> lot<00:01:57.240> of

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
folders so there's just a lot of

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.090 
folders so there's just a lot of
customization<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:58.409> it's<00:01:58.560> definitely<00:01:58.920> worth

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
customization and it's definitely worth

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.889 
customization and it's definitely worth
a<00:01:59.250> look<00:01:59.490> next<00:02:00.060> up<00:02:00.149> we<00:02:00.210> have<00:02:00.240> another<00:02:00.540> couple<00:02:00.810> of

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
a look next up we have another couple of

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.539 
a look next up we have another couple of
tweaks<00:02:01.110> which<00:02:01.350> work<00:02:01.560> together<00:02:01.740> very<00:02:02.159> well<00:02:02.219> we

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
tweaks which work together very well we

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.910 
tweaks which work together very well we
have<00:02:02.670> flip<00:02:03.000> launch<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.540> flip<00:02:04.020> control<00:02:04.469> center

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
have flip launch and flip control center

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.770 
have flip launch and flip control center
flip<00:02:05.340> control<00:02:05.729> center<00:02:06.030> allows<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.600> have

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
flip control center allows you to have

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.070 
flip control center allows you to have
many<00:02:07.229> more<00:02:07.290> toggles<00:02:07.860> in<00:02:08.069> your<00:02:08.700> control<00:02:09.629> center

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
many more toggles in your control center

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.869 
many more toggles in your control center
toggles<00:02:10.530> list<00:02:10.679> so<00:02:10.860> as<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.340> can<00:02:11.430> see<00:02:11.610> we<00:02:11.760> got

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
toggles list so as you can see we got

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.880 
toggles list so as you can see we got
things<00:02:12.120> like<00:02:12.440> respring<00:02:13.440> the

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
things like respring the

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.950 
things like respring the
en<00:02:14.069> you<00:02:14.520> can<00:02:14.640> put<00:02:14.760> your<00:02:14.850> data<00:02:15.120> toggles<00:02:15.540> in<00:02:15.660> here

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
en you can put your data toggles in here

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.390 
en you can put your data toggles in here
so<00:02:16.319> I'm<00:02:16.380> going<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.560> go<00:02:16.650> and<00:02:16.800> touch<00:02:16.920> that<00:02:17.190> and

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
so I'm going to go and touch that and

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.559 
so I'm going to go and touch that and
that<00:02:17.520> will<00:02:17.640> respring<00:02:18.150> my<00:02:18.300> device

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
that will respring my device

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.780 
that will respring my device
automatically<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.530> if<00:02:20.130> we<00:02:20.250> just<00:02:20.400> go<00:02:20.520> into<00:02:20.700> the

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
automatically and if we just go into the

there's a ton in here and that brings me

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.330 
there's a ton in here and that brings me
to<00:02:41.280> flip<00:02:42.030> launched<00:02:42.330> with<00:02:42.660> it<00:02:42.810> another<00:02:43.340> control

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
to flip launched with it another control

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.010 
to flip launched with it another control
center<00:02:44.700> add-on<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:45.630> allows<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:45.959> to

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
center toggles kind of interface so i'll

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.310 
center toggles kind of interface so i'll
just<00:02:51.030> select<00:02:51.270> google<00:02:51.750> drive<00:02:51.900> as<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:52.110> can<00:02:52.230> see

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
just select google drive as you can see

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.250 
just select google drive as you can see
I've<00:02:52.440> also<00:02:52.560> got<00:02:52.800> a<00:02:52.920> few<00:02:53.390> selected<00:02:54.390> here<00:02:54.600> so

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
I've also got a few selected here so

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.949 
I've also got a few selected here so
let's<00:02:55.769> just<00:02:56.040> slide<00:02:56.250> along<00:02:56.550> and<00:02:57.360> you<00:02:57.600> can<00:02:57.780> see

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
let's just slide along and you can see

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.610 
let's just slide along and you can see
that<00:02:57.989> we<00:02:58.200> have<00:02:58.230> tweet<00:02:58.680> bot<00:02:58.950> TW<00:03:00.050> CH<00:03:01.050> which<00:03:01.440> i

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
that we have tweet bot TW CH which i

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.710 
that we have tweet bot TW CH which i
believe<00:03:01.709> is<00:03:01.980> chrome<00:03:02.580> so<00:03:03.060> if<00:03:03.239> you<00:03:03.330> just<00:03:03.450> tap<00:03:03.690> the

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
believe is chrome so if you just tap the

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.690 
believe is chrome so if you just tap the
TW<00:03:04.410> and<00:03:04.590> it<00:03:04.650> will<00:03:04.739> automatically<00:03:05.130> go<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.400> my

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
TW and it will automatically go to my

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.910 
TW and it will automatically go to my
Twitter<00:03:05.970> client<00:03:06.150> which<00:03:06.480> is<00:03:06.630> tweet<00:03:06.930> bot<00:03:07.170> and

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
Twitter client which is tweet bot and

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.220 
Twitter client which is tweet bot and
then<00:03:08.070> bring<00:03:08.220> that<00:03:08.370> up<00:03:08.400> again<00:03:08.840> as<00:03:09.840> you<00:03:09.989> can<00:03:10.080> see

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
then bring that up again as you can see

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.229 
then bring that up again as you can see
and<00:03:10.440> then<00:03:10.560> go<00:03:10.709> to<00:03:10.769> Chrome<00:03:11.220> just<00:03:11.700> like<00:03:11.850> that<00:03:12.030> so

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
and then go to Chrome just like that so

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.940 
and then go to Chrome just like that so
very<00:03:12.269> very<00:03:12.510> simple<00:03:13.080> and<00:03:13.290> a<00:03:13.500> couple<00:03:13.680> of<00:03:13.800> really

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
very very simple and a couple of really

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.259 
very very simple and a couple of really
good<00:03:14.040> tweaks<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:14.519> work<00:03:14.730> very<00:03:14.940> well<00:03:15.000> together

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
good tweaks that work very well together

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.509 
good tweaks that work very well together
next<00:03:16.050> up<00:03:16.140> is<00:03:16.260> better<00:03:16.530> folder<00:03:17.040> if<00:03:17.130> we<00:03:17.250> just<00:03:17.400> go

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519
