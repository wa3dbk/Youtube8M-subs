00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 equipment like this presents you the best 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.740
 here 20 splendors were fulfilled one had 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.750
 commented this time playing being the q2 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.349
 steinhardt this gameplay is 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:18.480
 really old that fucking gameplay 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.820
 for months already good a month ago if 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.800
 more than a month ago this game then 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.869
 five fact cases level 17 and 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.029
 currently put the level of prestige 3 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.789
 I played a lot but I had this one 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.220
 double explain playing downtown but 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.530
 one does not use the grain 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.300
 I want you to know why it has not gone up 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.980
 gameplays I told them that I was not going to upload 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.080
 a lot of minecraft because I'm very 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.370
 concentrated playing the game and if not 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.650
 I want to comment something if not 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.600
 I feel like playing campus man like 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.980
 that I'm not going to play, although 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.360
 they are awakening me the desire to return 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.180
 to play causes me but with something different 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.010
 or as hardcore or some map 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.989
 survival but make an adventure 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.820
 like compact craft this is to play 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.530
 minecraft with benitez that I think is 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.989
 so they watch the videos of minecraft 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.290
 not because it's compact but with some 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.600
 mods or maybe hardcore 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.290
 or maybe some survival map does not 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.650
 I know but basically I have not been able to upload 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.200
 videos because there is the photo of 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.729
 converter that they sent me or those of 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.259
 amazon I 've never had any problems 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.090
 with Amazon and in fact, I do not have it 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.950
 this converted so they claimed as 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.770
 can see in the first image 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.660
 the bots where the pinche cables go 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.759
 components is broken or is 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.170
 as well as they are telling you the photo in 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.300
 where it says that it did not come as a box 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.160
 metal that has been made in china and 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.080
 converters to link or it cost me 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.400
 2 in fact like 20 dollars and look at one 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.790
 Photo 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.180
 it's a kind a fucking memory I do not know that 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.880
 is it all scratched is it back 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.340
 as rebuilt re soldered the parts 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.800
 with glue I do not know that it's okay 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.170
 fucking compass then you can not 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.610
 play because the signal goes then with 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.100
 but another one is like this it cost me a little more 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.380
 clear as 50 dollars but it is assumed that 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.000
 they connected to those of emery that is me 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.270
 I got to Canada good a friend passed me a 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.450
 emery channel 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:11.300
 a competitive player because I think that 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.180
 of citigroup or something like that does not happen to me 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.980
 Count's number played this and he 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.590
 recommended a converter for those who 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.690
 they will use this monitor to their 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.610
 that I with whom I use forgiveness and 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.620
 then I already buy it 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.560
 then it arrives to me tomorrow tuesdays were 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.800
 I 'm recording this on Monday the 17th I think 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.200
 I'm going to upload this on Tuesday 18 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:36.230
 then today my converter arrives not 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.750
 means that my gameplays will be able to go 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.879
 so if it's the reason why not 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.680
 could go up to a larger study because it 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.780
 I have that desire as well as say bitch 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.099
 you comment, remember the video that 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.360
 I made May if they are mike followers 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.370
 appel which video here is talking about 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.170
 about the gym and that said why 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.519
 stupid and really if I was 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.660
 excited playing me in cafes because 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.760
 I really wanted to play minecraft 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.170
 so if you want to hear comments 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.450
 like this one I have to have a lot of desire 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.270
 to play minecraft another thing compass is 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.930
 what went out 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:08.170
 vintage of black ops 2 deus lines is 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.110
 the g3 ink that we went up before 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.870
 someone comment on where are the 15 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.640
 benítez good in the first instance there is 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.310
 a clip of mine that is a triple headshot 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.550
 fit is I know it's hard is hardcore and 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.350
 with a tail sv gives us is not a prick 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.000
 but for me it is like that to the cock 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.130
 a triple done type that I'm not 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.720
 sniper and also my work in deus no 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.550
 is to remove clips my work on fingers is 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.070
 administer the channel I'm the manager of the 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.570
 channel what I do upload the videos what 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.400
 what I do is right now we have to 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.960
 he will take care of the partner of the shots 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.340
 of the descriptions of the titles I 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.350
 twitter order of twitter of all 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.760
 whatever it is to manage the channel 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.040
 this may be that the publicist 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.750
 administrator and all that and then up 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.440
 certain way 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.660
 as if I am a founder I have some 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.260
 rights over others but leaders 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:58.510
 are the ampayers and raul that can be 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.620
 say they are the best of the 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.600
 better but the best of the clan 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.740
 then that is why they are the 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.480
 leaders they are the ones who actually 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.310
 they have the knowledge and skills 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.380
 in order to be a leader I am not a 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.170
 leader only administered them in 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.360
 external issues did not trade the 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.470
 partner like when to upload a video as 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.010
 when to put a title of some 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.510
 description as is all that type of 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.660
 things I am the one that lakes in my work 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.250
 you could say that the deuce is not to take out 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.950
 clips then if I take out a clip it's 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.810
 like that was a benítez took a click and it's 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.210
 because the game with them like that if they see the 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.280
 25-player roster because tank in 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.200
 an xbox and I play with them but for 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.910
 example if you see a designer like rex 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.460
 just be designers but in 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.850
 players because he does not play with fingers 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.860
 symmetrical it's like I 'm a player 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.450
 but my function in deus not to take clips 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.120
 my function in fingers is to manage the 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.350
 channel girls that everything is aware and 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.900
 maybe I do a little publicity 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.340
 pass them ink gesture of the videos to one 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.470
 had a little bit big for us 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.440
 actually support in this ink g 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:03.100
 the silva tics editor gave him the video 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.710
 Afro I know he is a Spanish sniper and frost 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.930
 he is friends with stacks then stacks himself 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.539
 stack be with pilla of a willy rex 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.130
 tweet me and gave him I like our 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.560
 inks then the ink that basically 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.300
 beat beat at the end of the video les 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.190
 I'm going to leave the promo to be seen and 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.949
 also in the description and everything goes 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.270
 to be the video the ink je so that what 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:23.440
 go and see if you have not seen it yet 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.530
 you have seen it most of you and 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.780
 is not that all but anyway another 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.570
 thing with peace is that they are already 25 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.039
 questions to ask benítez what 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.389
 which means that soon the 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:36.460
 video of questions to benítez I said 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:39.010
 when they were 30 but could it be 25 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.050
 so I think he leaves it at 25 when 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.190
 we got this little fact when 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.039
 we come to the tape asks if it's going to be 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.530
 the question benitez but not yet 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:50.139
 come those 30 questions then I can 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.150
 do with 25 then a video that is 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:54.460
 that is close I think it's going to be that 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.620
 compass the question of benitez or 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.389
 is also asked on facebook les 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.260
 I asked that they have video and I told myself in 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:02.800
 a majority 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:04.660
 this is liking zombies then you 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.250
 wait zombies and well I think that 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.380
 it would be all compasses I say it has not come up 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.720
 videos because my shit converter was 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.400
 shit the ink head is already 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.930
 uploaded and the I believe that the following 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.330
 videos are going to be zombies and 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.650
 ask benítez if he wants to make me 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.720
 any question just go to 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:22.990
 twitter ask me a question 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:26.290
 twitter that is stealing duct is with z with 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:29.050
 hashtag eg ave Initials 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:31.150
 ask benítez and whatever 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.260
 compass is what sounds best take care if 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.760
 they liked the video they had not give me a 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.150
 Like or leave a comment 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.150
 I see them there 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:18.530
 bahrain view then they last longer 

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.000
 I live the day 

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:28.480
 do not
