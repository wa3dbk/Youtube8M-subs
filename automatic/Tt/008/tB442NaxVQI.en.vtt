challenger<00:02:47.580> um<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.510> think<00:02:48.630> it's<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:48.960> little<00:02:49.020> bit

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
challenger um I think it's a little bit

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.720 
challenger um I think it's a little bit
of<00:02:49.260> both<00:02:49.380> you<00:02:49.590> know<00:02:49.740> you<00:02:50.130> look<00:02:50.250> at<00:02:50.430> it<00:02:50.520> in<00:02:50.640> the

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
of both you know you look at it in the

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.610 
of both you know you look at it in the
terms<00:02:50.910> of<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.300> fact<00:02:51.570> is<00:02:51.750> we<00:02:51.990> wanted<00:02:52.410> to<00:02:52.470> make

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
terms of the fact is we wanted to make

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.830 
terms of the fact is we wanted to make
an<00:02:52.770> expansion<00:02:53.370> pack<00:02:53.400> out<00:02:54.150> of<00:02:54.270> this<00:02:54.360> game<00:02:54.600> and

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
an expansion pack out of this game and

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.530 
an expansion pack out of this game and
we<00:02:55.080> didn't<00:02:55.260> want<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.470> be<00:02:55.590> just<00:02:56.300> just<00:02:57.300> you<00:02:57.450> know

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
every time we do a major change or

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.070 
every time we do a major change or
update<00:04:14.100> we<00:04:14.730> post<00:04:15.000> a<00:04:15.180> lot<00:04:15.390> of<00:04:15.540> those<00:04:15.690> changes

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
update we post a lot of those changes

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.140 
update we post a lot of those changes
what<00:04:16.260> they<00:04:16.380> are

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
what they are

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.670 
what they are
slightly<00:04:18.150> tweaking<00:04:18.600> or<00:04:18.690> balancing<00:04:19.230> weapons

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
slightly tweaking or balancing weapons

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.890 
slightly tweaking or balancing weapons
is<00:04:20.160> a<00:04:20.550> really<00:04:20.850> big<00:04:20.970> thing<00:04:21.209> making<00:04:21.420> sure<00:04:21.690> that

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
is a really big thing making sure that

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.510 
is a really big thing making sure that
you<00:04:22.440> know<00:04:22.590> something<00:04:22.980> seems<00:04:23.220> like<00:04:23.370> it's

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
you know something seems like it's

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.860 
you know something seems like it's
slightly<00:04:23.640> over<00:04:24.000> underpowered<00:04:24.480> you<00:04:24.750> can

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
slightly over underpowered you can

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.300 
slightly over underpowered you can
adjust<00:04:24.960> it<00:04:25.410> you<00:04:25.470> can<00:04:25.620> tweak<00:04:25.830> them<00:04:26.010> and<00:04:26.160> tune

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
adjust it you can tweak them and tune

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.070 
adjust it you can tweak them and tune
them<00:04:26.430> and<00:04:26.940> so<00:04:27.210> I<00:04:27.240> think<00:04:27.360> that's<00:04:27.690> one<00:04:27.930> of<00:04:27.990> the

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
them and so I think that's one of the

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.210 
them and so I think that's one of the
big<00:04:28.200> things<00:04:28.230> you<00:04:28.590> know<00:04:28.680> if<00:04:28.740> you<00:04:28.830> look<00:04:29.010> even

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
big things you know if you look even

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.340 
big things you know if you look even
back<00:04:29.550> before<00:04:29.850> the<00:04:29.910> game<00:04:30.030> came<00:04:30.240> out<00:04:30.360> the<00:04:31.140> beta

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
back before the game came out the beta

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.560 
back before the game came out the beta
is<00:04:31.530> that<00:04:31.650> we<00:04:31.770> ran<00:04:32.060> giving<00:04:33.060> people<00:04:33.300> the<00:04:33.420> option

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
is that we ran giving people the option

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.840 
is that we ran giving people the option
to<00:04:33.750> give<00:04:34.050> us<00:04:34.170> feedback<00:04:34.290> on<00:04:34.590> a<00:04:34.620> non<00:04:35.190> final<00:04:35.550> game

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
to give us feedback on a non final game

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.750 
to give us feedback on a non final game
and<00:04:36.060> then<00:04:36.570> see<00:04:36.810> those<00:04:36.990> changes<00:04:37.040> in<00:04:38.040> action

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
and then see those changes in action

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.760 
and then see those changes in action
when<00:04:39.210> they<00:04:39.300> finally<00:04:39.540> loads<00:04:39.810> disk<00:04:40.110> in<00:04:40.260> a<00:04:40.320> tray<00:04:40.560> I

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
when they finally loads disk in a tray I

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.230 
when they finally loads disk in a tray I
think<00:04:41.130> it's<00:04:41.250> only<00:04:41.340> rewarding<00:04:41.970> for<00:04:42.090> those

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
think it's only rewarding for those

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.880 
think it's only rewarding for those
players<00:04:42.450> but<00:04:43.050> it's<00:04:43.170> also<00:04:43.320> very<00:04:43.620> beneficial

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
players but it's also very beneficial

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.010 
players but it's also very beneficial
for<00:04:44.490> everyone<00:04:44.970> the<00:04:45.270> whole<00:04:45.390> experience<00:04:45.540> we

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.110 
for everyone the whole experience we
come<00:04:46.170> out<00:04:46.290> with<00:04:46.410> a<00:04:46.440> game<00:04:46.680> that<00:04:46.860> already<00:04:47.790> had

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
come out with a game that already had

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.780 
come out with a game that already had
testing<00:04:48.780> on<00:04:48.900> it<00:04:49.050> in<00:04:49.260> waves<00:04:49.710> like<00:04:49.890> that<00:04:50.070> so<00:04:50.310> the

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
talk about the setting itself until we

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.810 
talk about the setting itself until we
have<00:05:15.840> the<00:05:15.990> same<00:05:16.230> modes<00:05:16.560> that<00:05:16.920> we've<00:05:17.460> had<00:05:17.610> about

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
have the same modes that we've had about

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.030 
have the same modes that we've had about
coming<00:05:18.270> to<00:05:18.450> but<00:05:18.690> this<00:05:18.810> this<00:05:19.140> map<00:05:19.500> itself<00:05:19.860> is

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
coming to but this this map itself is

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.520 
coming to but this this map itself is
called<00:05:20.250> foo<00:05:20.460> by<00:05:20.610> valley<00:05:21.080> so<00:05:22.080> as<00:05:22.170> you<00:05:22.230> can<00:05:22.320> see

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
called foo by valley so as you can see

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.420 
called foo by valley so as you can see
is<00:05:22.650> what<00:05:22.800> we're<00:05:22.890> talking<00:05:23.070> about<00:05:23.100> like<00:05:23.340> the

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
is what we're talking about like the

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.400 
is what we're talking about like the
dense<00:05:23.670> bullets<00:05:24.210> and<00:05:24.360> stuff<00:05:24.540> like<00:05:24.660> that<00:05:24.720> we

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
dense bullets and stuff like that we

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:26.930 
dense bullets and stuff like that we
have<00:05:25.560> four<00:05:25.860> total<00:05:26.070> maps<00:05:26.400> and<00:05:26.700> they<00:05:26.790> are

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
have four total maps and they are

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.760 
have four total maps and they are
there's<00:05:27.420> good<00:05:27.750> variety<00:05:28.140> within<00:05:28.290> those<00:05:28.500> maps

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
there's good variety within those maps

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.490 
there's good variety within those maps
themselves<00:05:29.010> as<00:05:29.550> well<00:05:29.760> so<00:05:30.120> this<00:05:30.960> is<00:05:31.080> just<00:05:31.230> one

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:31.500 
themselves as well so this is just one

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.679 
themselves as well so this is just one
one<00:05:31.800> of<00:05:31.830> the<00:05:31.950> many<00:05:32.130> to<00:05:32.280> show

00:05:34.679 --> 00:05:34.689 

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:37.199

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:37.209 
and you'll recognize its kind of

00:05:37.209 --> 00:05:41.339 
and you'll recognize its kind of
traditional<00:05:37.599> conquest<00:05:38.169> mode<00:05:38.289> oh<00:05:40.139> so<00:05:41.139> now<00:05:41.289> I'm

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:41.349
