00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.130 
but hypothetically speaking if you're to
put<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.000> in<00:01:36.090> your<00:01:36.240> pair<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.720> skinny<00:01:37.049> jeans

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
put it in your pair of skinny jeans

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.950 
put it in your pair of skinny jeans
either<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.189> phone<00:01:38.460> will<00:01:38.759> explode<00:01:39.270> or<00:01:39.659> your

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
either the phone will explode or your

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.539 
either the phone will explode or your
genes<00:01:40.439> will<00:01:40.590> explode<00:01:41.220> like<00:01:41.430> blah<00:01:41.970> blah<00:01:42.600> blah

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
genes will explode like blah blah blah

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.380 
genes will explode like blah blah blah
that's<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.670> sound<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:45.000> skinny<00:01:45.329> jeans

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
that's the sound of skinny jeans

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.999 
that's the sound of skinny jeans
exploding<00:01:46.049> apparently<00:01:46.409> i<00:01:46.500> don't<00:01:46.710> own<00:01:46.860> an

exploding apparently i don't own an
android<00:01:47.340> device<00:01:47.369> myself<00:01:48.030> but<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.329> know<00:01:48.450> what

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
android device myself but you know what

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.850 
android device myself but you know what
i<00:01:48.630> think<00:01:48.720> it's<00:01:48.960> kind<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.170> annoying<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.680> fact

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
i think it's kind of annoying the fact

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.560 
i think it's kind of annoying the fact
that<00:01:49.950> new<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.399> your<00:01:50.610> firmwares<00:01:51.090> come<00:01:51.299> out<00:01:51.420> at

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
that new and your firmwares come out at

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.819 
that new and your firmwares come out at
different<00:01:51.780> times<00:01:52.229> for<00:01:52.470> different<00:01:52.530> devices

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
different times for different devices

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.030 
different times for different devices
say<00:01:53.369> for<00:01:53.610> example<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:54.180> don't<00:01:54.840> know<00:01:54.930> android<00:01:55.350> 2.3

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040

when<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.000> comes<00:01:57.270> up<00:01:57.479> every<00:01:57.960> single<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.530> your

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
when that comes up every single and your

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.289 
when that comes up every single and your
device<00:01:58.950> should<00:01:59.219> have<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.640> but<00:01:59.790> that's<00:01:59.909> not<00:02:00.149> the

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
device should have it but that's not the

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.789 
device should have it but that's not the
case<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.750> only<00:02:00.930> device<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.380> be<00:02:01.469> getting<00:02:01.710> it

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
case the only device to be getting it

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.100 
case the only device to be getting it
would<00:02:01.979> be<00:02:02.130> say<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.729> google<00:02:03.030> nexus<00:02:03.210> one<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.930> lot
