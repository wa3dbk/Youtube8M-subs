then second thoughts
crazy<00:00:28.500> stiff<00:00:29.359> almost<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.689> good<00:00:31.109> way

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
crazy stiff almost in a good way

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.270 
crazy stiff almost in a good way
as<00:00:31.529> you<00:00:32.219> can<00:00:32.340> see<00:00:32.579> by<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.800> downtube<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.070> going

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
as you can see by the downtube and going

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.180 
as you can see by the downtube and going
into<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.640> sea<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:38.719> a<00:00:39.719> fatness<00:00:40.530> going<00:00:40.860> on<00:00:40.980> down

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
into the sea to a fatness going on down

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.090 
into the sea to a fatness going on down
there<00:00:41.510> which<00:00:42.510> translates<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.290> very<00:00:43.620> very

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
there which translates to a very very

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.049 
there which translates to a very very
stiff<00:00:44.460> bike<00:00:45.559> but<00:00:46.559> because<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.250> Seas<00:00:47.670> days<00:00:47.910> are

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
stiff bike but because the Seas days are

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.740 
stiff bike but because the Seas days are
so<00:00:48.180> slim<00:00:48.539> it<00:00:49.350> doesn't<00:00:49.770> feel<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.610> stiff<00:00:51.539> I

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
so slim it doesn't feel that stiff I

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.860 
so slim it doesn't feel that stiff I
know<00:00:51.809> it's<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.260> stiff<00:00:52.949> yet<00:00:53.190> compliant

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
know it's that stiff yet compliant

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.799 
know it's that stiff yet compliant
rubbish<00:00:54.870> but<00:00:55.820> it<00:00:56.820> doesn't<00:00:57.149> feel<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:57.510> stiff

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
rubbish but it doesn't feel this stiff

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.330 
rubbish but it doesn't feel this stiff
is<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.370> might<00:00:59.370> do<00:01:00.410> but<00:01:01.410> possibly<00:01:01.859> too<00:01:02.039> stiff

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
is it might do but possibly too stiff

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.820 
is it might do but possibly too stiff
for<00:01:02.370> me<00:01:02.579> I'm<00:01:03.149> not<00:01:03.210> such<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.899> powerful<00:01:04.199> rider<00:01:04.530> so

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830
