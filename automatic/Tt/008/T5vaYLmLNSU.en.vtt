00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
going on just like a keychain once you

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.310 
going on just like a keychain once you
get<00:01:52.640> it<00:01:52.789> started<00:01:52.909> it's<00:01:53.420> easy<00:01:53.659> it's<00:01:54.020> just

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
get it started it's easy it's just

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
starting at the tart okay and it pops

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.270 
starting at the tart okay and it pops
right<00:01:57.259> back<00:01:57.320> on<00:01:57.770> there<00:01:57.979> I<00:01:59.079> was<00:02:00.079> having<00:02:00.320> a<00:02:00.530> heck

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
right back on there I was having a heck

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.010 
right back on there I was having a heck
of<00:02:01.310> a<00:02:01.520> time<00:02:01.700> trying<00:02:01.939> to<00:02:02.090> figure<00:02:02.420> out<00:02:02.450> how<00:02:02.689> to<00:02:02.750> do

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
of a time trying to figure out how to do

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.830 
of a time trying to figure out how to do
it<00:02:03.170> but<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:04.159> keychain<00:02:04.430> method<00:02:05.180> seems<00:02:05.539> to<00:02:05.719> be

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
it but the keychain method seems to be

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.499 
it but the keychain method seems to be
the<00:02:05.990> easiest<00:02:06.020> way<00:02:06.590> to<00:02:06.770> work<00:02:07.090> and<00:02:08.090> that's<00:02:08.299> it

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
the easiest way to work and that's it

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.259 
the easiest way to work and that's it
thanks<00:02:08.810> for<00:02:08.840> watching
