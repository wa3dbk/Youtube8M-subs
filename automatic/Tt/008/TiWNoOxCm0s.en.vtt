00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
to go you're going to play on the first

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.070 
to go you're going to play on the first
beat<00:01:25.160> of<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:25.429> measure<00:01:25.670> again<00:01:26.330> we've<00:01:26.569> got<00:01:26.780> four

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
beat of the measure again we've got four

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.370 
beat of the measure again we've got four
beats<00:01:27.289> in<00:01:27.410> a<00:01:27.500> measure<00:01:27.679> like<00:01:27.770> 1<00:01:28.190> 2<00:01:28.789> 3<00:01:29.270> 4<00:01:29.959> so

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
beats in a measure like 1 2 3 4 so

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.499 
beats in a measure like 1 2 3 4 so
you're<00:01:30.470> going<00:01:30.590> to<00:01:30.649> play<00:01:30.800> one<00:01:31.429> and<00:01:31.759> then<00:01:32.390> you're

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
you're going to play one and then you're

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.780 
you're going to play one and then you're
going<00:01:32.599> to<00:01:32.690> play

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
going to play

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.000 
going to play
and<00:01:34.940> those<00:01:35.840> are<00:01:35.870> eighth<00:01:36.230> notes<00:01:36.530> on<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:36.770> second

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
and those are eighth notes on the second

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.360 
and those are eighth notes on the second
date<00:01:37.160> so<00:01:37.280> it's<00:01:37.340> one<00:01:37.610> two<00:01:38.770> and<00:01:39.770> then<00:01:39.920> three

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
date so it's one two and then three

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.130 
date so it's one two and then three
you're<00:01:40.670> not<00:01:40.850> going<00:01:41.090> to<00:01:41.150> play<00:01:41.300> you're<00:01:41.960> going<00:01:42.080> to

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
you're not going to play you're going to

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.770 
you're not going to play you're going to
come<00:01:42.350> back<00:01:42.530> up

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.290 

so<00:01:46.780> I<00:01:47.140> like<00:01:47.710> to<00:01:47.740> think<00:01:48.100> of<00:01:48.250> this<00:01:48.490> rhythm<00:01:48.820> as<00:01:49.150> my

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
so I like to think of this rhythm as my

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.030 
so I like to think of this rhythm as my
hand<00:01:49.570> is<00:01:49.720> constantly<00:01:50.290> doing<00:01:50.500> eighth<00:01:50.770> notes

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
hand is constantly doing eighth notes

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.400 
hand is constantly doing eighth notes
like<00:01:51.130> this<00:01:51.280> one<00:01:51.730> and<00:01:51.970> two<00:01:52.390> and<00:01:52.660> three<00:01:52.720> and<00:01:53.140> four

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
like this one and two and three and four

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.180 
like this one and two and three and four
and<00:01:53.830> so<00:01:54.310> just<00:01:54.490> don't<00:01:54.730> play<00:01:55.060> and<00:01:55.510> just<00:01:56.020> let<00:01:56.890> your

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
and so just don't play and just let your

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.250 
and so just don't play and just let your
hand<00:01:57.760> go<00:01:57.910> really<00:01:58.330> loosely<00:01:58.600> like<00:01:58.780> this<00:01:58.930> and<00:01:59.110> say

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
hand go really loosely like this and say

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.790 
hand go really loosely like this and say
one<00:01:59.710> and<00:02:00.010> two<00:02:00.490> and<00:02:00.760> three<00:02:00.850> and<00:02:01.390> four<00:02:01.690> and<00:02:02.200> and

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
one and two and three and four and and

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.170 
one and two and three and four and and
now<00:02:03.340> what<00:02:03.550> you're<00:02:03.670> going<00:02:03.790> to<00:02:03.880> do<00:02:03.970> is<00:02:04.090> you're

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
now what you're going to do is you're

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.390 
now what you're going to do is you're
just<00:02:04.240> going<00:02:04.510> to<00:02:04.570> omit<00:02:05.080> certain<00:02:05.650> patterns<00:02:06.220> but

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
just going to omit certain patterns but

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:14.160 
just going to omit certain patterns but
when<00:02:06.820> I<00:02:06.850> play<00:02:07.210> this<00:02:12.480> just<00:02:13.480> constantly<00:02:13.990> going

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
when I play this just constantly going

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.290 
when I play this just constantly going
like<00:02:14.410> this<00:02:14.560> down<00:02:14.890> up<00:02:15.130> down<00:02:15.160> up<00:02:15.370> so<00:02:15.700> that<00:02:15.880> I<00:02:16.060> get

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
like this down up down up so that I get

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.590 
like this down up down up so that I get
in<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.720> flow<00:02:17.170> of<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.560> music<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.310> I'm

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
in the flow of the music and I'm

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.760 
in the flow of the music and I'm
subdividing<00:02:19.600> in<00:02:19.720> those<00:02:20.140> eighth<00:02:20.380> note

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
subdividing in those eighth note

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.850 
subdividing in those eighth note
patterns<00:02:21.370> so<00:02:22.000> that<00:02:22.110> I'm<00:02:23.110> not<00:02:23.140> trying<00:02:23.590> to<00:02:23.650> think

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
patterns so that I'm not trying to think

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.560 
patterns so that I'm not trying to think
mechanically<00:02:24.460> is<00:02:24.700> like<00:02:24.910> a<00:02:24.940> series<00:02:25.300> of<00:02:25.360> like

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
mechanically is like a series of like

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.350 
mechanically is like a series of like
down<00:02:25.990> down<00:02:26.260> up<00:02:26.410> up<00:02:26.650> up<00:02:27.010> down<00:02:27.430> up<00:02:27.730> you<00:02:28.210> know

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
down down up up up down up you know

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.960 
down down up up up down up you know
which<00:02:28.630> by<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.110> way<00:02:29.230> I<00:02:29.380> mean<00:02:29.650> you<00:02:30.130> can<00:02:30.580> we<00:02:30.790> can

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
which by the way I mean you can we can

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.900 
which by the way I mean you can we can
reference<00:02:31.180> that<00:02:35.160> but<00:02:36.160> what<00:02:36.460> I<00:02:36.490> want<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:36.760> to

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
reference that but what I want you to

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.540 
reference that but what I want you to
think<00:02:37.150> about<00:02:37.390> is<00:02:37.810> is<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.680> eighth<00:02:38.920> notes<00:02:39.250> one

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
think about is is the eighth notes one

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.080 
think about is is the eighth notes one
and<00:02:39.820> two<00:02:40.300> and<00:02:40.570> three<00:02:40.870> and<00:02:41.110> four<00:02:41.380> and<00:02:41.830> and<00:02:42.340> you

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
and two and three and four and and you

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.750 
and two and three and four and and you
know<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:44.290> may<00:02:44.500> have<00:02:44.709> your<00:02:44.740> gene<00:02:45.130> your<00:02:45.340> senior

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
know you may have your gene your senior

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.490 
know you may have your gene your senior
d<00:02:45.910> together<00:02:46.209> and<00:02:46.390> you<00:02:46.450> think<00:02:46.720> oh<00:02:46.840> this<00:02:47.050> is<00:02:47.230> easy

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
d together and you think oh this is easy

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.830 
d together and you think oh this is easy
but<00:02:48.040> let<00:02:48.250> me<00:02:48.280> tell<00:02:48.520> you<00:02:48.640> playing<00:02:49.000> that<00:02:49.150> pattern

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
but let me tell you playing that pattern

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.320 
but let me tell you playing that pattern
and<00:02:50.050> giving<00:02:50.620> it<00:02:50.739> a<00:02:50.800> great<00:02:51.130> feel<00:02:51.670> say<00:02:52.090> with<00:02:52.300> a

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
and giving it a great feel say with a

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.470 
and giving it a great feel say with a
metronome<00:02:52.720> is<00:02:53.320> a<00:02:53.650> whole<00:02:54.070> nother<00:02:54.400> deal<00:02:54.790> so<00:02:55.239> you

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
metronome is a whole nother deal so you

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.030 
metronome is a whole nother deal so you
really<00:02:55.959> got<00:02:56.080> to<00:02:56.230> work<00:02:56.350> on<00:02:56.530> that<00:02:56.709> that's

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
really got to work on that that's

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.520 
really got to work on that that's
strumming<00:02:57.459> i'm<00:02:57.580> also<00:02:57.790> using<00:02:58.000> a<00:02:58.420> thin<00:02:58.780> pick<00:02:59.140> I

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
strumming i'm also using a thin pick I

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.100 
strumming i'm also using a thin pick I
like<00:03:00.130> a<00:03:00.160> thin<00:03:00.520> pic<00:03:00.820> when<00:03:01.090> I'm<00:03:01.180> just<00:03:01.510> strumming

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
like a thin pic when I'm just strumming

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.960 
like a thin pic when I'm just strumming
because<00:03:02.380> it<00:03:02.500> just<00:03:02.650> it<00:03:02.950> makes<00:03:03.430> me<00:03:03.670> feel<00:03:03.790> like

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
because it just it makes me feel like

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.850 
because it just it makes me feel like
I'm<00:03:04.150> floating<00:03:04.420> on<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:04.750> clouds<00:03:05.110> it's<00:03:05.440> just<00:03:05.680> a

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
I'm floating on the clouds it's just a

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.070 
I'm floating on the clouds it's just a
really<00:03:06.250> light<00:03:06.730> sound<00:03:07.269> you<00:03:07.720> know<00:03:07.750> you're

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
really light sound you know you're

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.560 
really light sound you know you're
thinking<00:03:08.440> especially<00:03:09.130> when<00:03:09.220> i'm<00:03:09.340> recording

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
thinking especially when i'm recording

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.570 
thinking especially when i'm recording
and<00:03:10.570> i<00:03:10.660> get<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.019> sound<00:03:11.380> of<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:11.800> pic<00:03:12.100> i<00:03:12.400> really

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.130 

so<00:03:16.580> again<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:17.240> pattern<00:03:17.569> is<00:03:17.690> going<00:03:17.840> to<00:03:17.900> go<00:03:18.020> like

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
so again the pattern is going to go like

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.910 
so again the pattern is going to go like
this

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.339 

and<00:03:22.280> start<00:03:22.970> forget<00:03:23.450> about<00:03:23.480> changing<00:03:24.080> courts

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
and start forget about changing courts

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:26.080 
and start forget about changing courts
just<00:03:24.560> play<00:03:24.800> on<00:03:24.950> one<00:03:25.220> chord<00:03:25.610> and<00:03:25.849> get

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
just play on one chord and get

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:34.120 
just play on one chord and get
comfortable<00:03:26.360> with<00:03:26.569> the<00:03:26.660> right<00:03:26.870> hand

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.140 

Oh

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.630 

and<00:03:40.750> I'm<00:03:40.840> holding<00:03:41.230> the<00:03:41.349> pic<00:03:41.560> really<00:03:42.010> light<00:03:42.280> and

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
and I'm holding the pic really light and

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.240 
and I'm holding the pic really light and
again<00:03:43.390> my<00:03:43.569> hand<00:03:43.840> is<00:03:43.930> just<00:03:44.140> so<00:03:44.500> loose<00:03:44.799> it's<00:03:45.040> like

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
again my hand is just so loose it's like

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.220 
again my hand is just so loose it's like
I'm<00:03:45.400> strumming<00:03:45.849> a<00:03:45.939> ukulele<00:03:45.970> in<00:03:46.840> a<00:03:46.930> pineapple

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
I'm strumming a ukulele in a pineapple

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.949 
I'm strumming a ukulele in a pineapple

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
field so again here's the chord

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.410 
field so again here's the chord
progression<00:03:50.670> here's<00:03:51.670> here's<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.120> pattern

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
progression here's here's the pattern

00:03:52.420 --> 00:04:08.790 
progression here's here's the pattern
through<00:03:52.659> the<00:03:52.810> corporation

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.170

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
thumb up over and I just mute that

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.039 
thumb up over and I just mute that
string<00:04:16.010> or<00:04:16.430> if<00:04:16.670> that's<00:04:16.880> hard<00:04:17.150> for<00:04:17.269> you<00:04:17.450> have

lightly come into contact with the

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.250 
lightly come into contact with the
string<00:04:21.950> so<00:04:22.250> I'm<00:04:22.610> not<00:04:22.910> pushing<00:04:23.300> down<00:04:23.780> I'm<00:04:24.110> not

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
string so I'm not pushing down I'm not

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.220 
string so I'm not pushing down I'm not
fretting<00:04:24.770> them<00:04:25.160> out<00:04:25.280> like<00:04:25.460> this<00:04:25.640> but<00:04:26.020> um<00:04:27.020> but

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
strength so that it's muted because I

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.710 
strength so that it's muted because I
