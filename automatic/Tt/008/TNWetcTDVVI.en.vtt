00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
right we've got beyond that stage now

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.910 
right we've got beyond that stage now
livings<00:00:02.100> come<00:00:02.310> down<00:00:02.490> to<00:00:02.730> fences<00:00:03.389> as<00:00:03.920> Michael

Pollan<00:00:05.160> was<00:00:05.310> saying<00:00:05.660> if<00:00:06.660> we<00:00:06.960> shall<00:00:08.179> we<00:00:09.179> say<00:00:09.330> in

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
Pollan was saying if we shall we say in

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.720 
Pollan was saying if we shall we say in
theory<00:00:09.690> discard<00:00:10.320> that<00:00:10.559> 12<00:00:13.280> then<00:00:14.280> that<00:00:14.519> would

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
theory discard that 12 then that would

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.450 
theory discard that 12 then that would
give<00:00:14.940> in<00:00:15.179> theory<00:00:15.839> again<00:00:16.199> Island<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.890> score<00:00:17.190> of

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
give in theory again Island a score of

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.080 
give in theory again Island a score of
12<00:00:18.119> so<00:00:18.449> he's<00:00:19.289> got<00:00:19.470> two<00:00:19.650> fences<00:00:20.070> in<00:00:20.279> that<00:00:20.490> well

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
12 so he's got two fences in that well

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.390 
12 so he's got two fences in that well
if<00:00:21.420> he<00:00:21.510> if<00:00:22.050> he<00:00:22.109> has<00:00:22.320> two<00:00:22.529> fences<00:00:22.769> down<00:00:22.980> then

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
if he if he has two fences down then

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.700 
if he if he has two fences down then
never<00:00:24.119> really<00:00:24.300> on<00:00:24.449> patting<00:00:24.869> me<00:00:25.230> on<00:00:25.260> time<00:00:25.529> yeah

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710
