works normally on a strat you have
volume<00:00:22.350> tone<00:00:22.920> tone<00:00:23.570> the<00:00:24.570> blender<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.760> little

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
volume tone tone the blender is a little

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.120 
volume tone tone the blender is a little
more<00:00:26.880> simplified<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.230> gives<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.650> several

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
more simplified and it gives you several

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.060 
more simplified and it gives you several
other<00:00:29.640> pickup<00:00:30.269> combinations<00:00:31.050> you've<00:00:31.830> got<00:00:32.040> a

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
other pickup combinations you've got a

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.380 
other pickup combinations you've got a
master<00:00:32.669> volume<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:33.950> master<00:00:34.950> tone<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.550> then

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
master volume a master tone and then

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.330 
master volume a master tone and then
this<00:00:36.540> bottom<00:00:36.809> knob<00:00:37.380> down<00:00:37.680> here<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
this bottom knob down here is the

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.630 
this bottom knob down here is the
blender<00:00:38.730> pot<00:00:38.989> okay<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:41.129> still<00:00:41.370> got<00:00:41.489> the

three pickups on at once and the blender

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.000 
three pickups on at once and the blender
pots<00:00:59.940> nice<00:01:00.329> because<00:01:00.870> instead<00:01:01.170> of<00:01:01.289> just<00:01:01.469> having

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
pots nice because instead of just having

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.549 
pots nice because instead of just having
a<00:01:02.250> push<00:01:02.520> pull<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.120> kicks<00:01:03.449> on<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.350> bridge

now<00:02:39.319> when<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.709> switch<00:02:39.890> is<00:02:40.040> any<00:02:40.489> position<00:02:41.950> we

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
now when the switch is any position we

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.930 
now when the switch is any position we
have<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.159> master<00:02:43.640> volume<00:02:44.920> pretty<00:02:45.920> typical<00:02:46.220> of

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
have the master volume pretty typical of

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.180 
have the master volume pretty typical of
how<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.209> strat<00:02:47.690> works<00:02:47.989> and<00:02:48.260> then<00:02:48.769> we<00:02:48.890> have<00:02:49.040> the

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
how the strat works and then we have the

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.660 
how the strat works and then we have the
master<00:02:49.430> tone<00:02:49.879> so<00:02:50.150> that<00:02:50.330> works<00:02:50.629> and<00:02:50.870> any<00:02:51.230> pickup

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
master tone so that works and any pickup

00:02:51.670 --> 00:03:04.650 
master tone so that works and any pickup
setting<00:02:52.670> as<00:02:52.790> well

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
I have a go for 7 paper oil capacitor in

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.170 
I have a go for 7 paper oil capacitor in
here<00:03:08.230> I<00:03:08.260> like<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.830> old<00:03:09.250> four<00:03:09.580> 7s<00:03:09.970> with<00:03:10.120> the

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
here I like the old four 7s with the

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.600 
here I like the old four 7s with the
single<00:03:10.660> coil<00:03:10.840> now<00:03:11.560> let's<00:03:11.830> look<00:03:12.280> at<00:03:12.400> how<00:03:12.460> the

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
single coil now let's look at how the

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.270 
single coil now let's look at how the
blender<00:03:13.120> works<00:03:13.330> all<00:03:13.600> the<00:03:13.870> way<00:03:13.960> back<00:03:14.280> position

number one with the bridge pickup on if

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.540 
number one with the bridge pickup on if
I<00:03:21.640> start<00:03:22.000> to<00:03:22.210> roll

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
I start to roll

I start to roll
on<00:03:23.790> that<00:03:24.180> pot<00:03:24.450> then<00:03:25.200> on<00:03:25.560> means<00:03:25.890> going<00:03:26.430> from<00:03:26.730> ten

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
on that pot then on means going from ten

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.620 
on that pot then on means going from ten
to<00:03:27.150> say<00:03:27.330> seven<00:03:28.460> it<00:03:29.460> starts<00:03:29.880> to<00:03:30.030> blend<00:03:30.240> in<00:03:30.510> the

to say seven it starts to blend in the

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:38.470 
to say seven it starts to blend in the
neck<00:03:30.840> pickup

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.270

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
and you have the blender pot if I happen

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.210 
and you have the blender pot if I happen
to<00:04:33.680> be<00:04:33.860> on<00:04:34.100> my<00:04:34.400> neck<00:04:34.640> pick<00:04:34.910> up<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:36.530> blender<00:04:37.010> pot

to be on my neck pick up the blender pot

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.520 
to be on my neck pick up the blender pot
works<00:04:37.520> the<00:04:38.240> same<00:04:38.480> way<00:04:38.690> it's<00:04:39.020> going<00:04:39.230> to<00:04:39.290> start

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:21.420 

and<00:05:17.759> that<00:05:18.719> can<00:05:18.930> bridge

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.760 

okay<00:05:22.360> so<00:05:22.419> you<00:05:22.780> understand<00:05:23.199> how<00:05:23.259> that<00:05:23.380> works

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
okay so you understand how that works

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.680

middle or the middle and the neck and I
use<00:05:34.090> the<00:05:34.449> blender<00:05:34.810> pot<00:05:35.080> it'll<00:05:35.979> like<00:05:36.460> say<00:05:36.699> if

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
use the blender pot it'll like say if

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.529 
use the blender pot it'll like say if
I'm<00:05:36.970> in<00:05:37.320> position<00:05:38.320> two<00:05:38.770> with<00:05:39.220> the<00:05:39.699> bridge<00:05:39.970> in

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:40.539 
I'm in position two with the bridge in

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:42.810 
I'm in position two with the bridge in
the<00:05:40.720> middle<00:05:40.960> on<00:05:41.110> it'll<00:05:42.009> start<00:05:42.250> to<00:05:42.310> blend<00:05:42.580> in

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:42.820 
the middle on it'll start to blend in

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:44.610 
the middle on it'll start to blend in
the<00:05:43.180> neck<00:05:43.389> pickup<00:05:43.660> so<00:05:43.930> I<00:05:43.990> can<00:05:44.169> get<00:05:44.289> all<00:05:44.470> three

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
the neck pickup so I can get all three

00:05:44.620 --> 00:06:00.549 
the neck pickup so I can get all three
pickups<00:05:44.979> on<00:05:45.220> at<00:05:45.370> once

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
to do the same thing but it's going to

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.450 
to do the same thing but it's going to
add<00:06:18.870> in<00:06:19.080> the<00:06:19.170> bridge<00:06:19.410> pickup<00:06:19.800> so<00:06:19.980> there's<00:06:20.220> the

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:38.080 

and<00:06:28.879> now<00:06:29.060> it<00:06:29.659> adds<00:06:29.810> in<00:06:30.050> the<00:06:30.110> fridge

in any of those positions in the master
volume<00:06:46.130> so<00:06:46.430> this<00:06:46.940> is<00:06:47.150> one<00:06:47.330> of<00:06:47.360> the<00:06:47.480> most

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:48.520

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:01.880 
and the bridge pickup on at the same

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.940 
and the bridge pickup on at the same
time<00:07:02.120> and<00:07:02.420> you<00:07:03.050> can<00:07:03.080> also<00:07:03.380> get<00:07:03.590> all<00:07:03.770> three

time and you can also get all three
pickups<00:07:04.220> on<00:07:04.430> at<00:07:04.580> once<00:07:04.790> and<00:07:05.030> I<00:07:05.630> think<00:07:05.690> it's<00:07:05.960> a

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:06.020 
pickups on at once and I think it's a

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:07.450 
pickups on at once and I think it's a
little<00:07:06.170> easier<00:07:06.530> to<00:07:06.680> use<00:07:06.710> with<00:07:07.010> the<00:07:07.100> master

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:07.460 
little easier to use with the master

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.540 
little easier to use with the master
volume<00:07:07.610> master<00:07:08.090> tone<00:07:08.360> then<00:07:09.110> that<00:07:09.380> extra<00:07:09.950> tone

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:10.550 
volume master tone then that extra tone

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.610 
volume master tone then that extra tone
pot<00:07:10.850> and<00:07:11.180> a<00:07:11.390> lot<00:07:11.540> of<00:07:11.570> strats<00:07:11.960> don't<00:07:12.230> even<00:07:12.470> have

the tone pot wired to the bridge unless
you<00:07:14.540> do<00:07:14.660> the<00:07:14.810> jumper<00:07:15.230> so<00:07:15.410> this<00:07:15.620> you<00:07:16.130> get<00:07:16.280> two

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:16.430 
you do the jumper so this you get two
