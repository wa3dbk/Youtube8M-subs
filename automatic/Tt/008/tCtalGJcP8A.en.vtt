I'm<00:03:39.040> very<00:03:39.160> inquisitive<00:03:39.700> as<00:03:40.060> to<00:03:40.150> how<00:03:40.390> things

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
I'm very inquisitive as to how things

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.780 
I'm very inquisitive as to how things
really<00:03:41.200> work<00:03:41.350> can<00:03:41.920> you<00:03:41.980> move<00:03:42.160> that<00:03:42.220> like<00:03:42.640> the

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
really work can you move that like the

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.100 
really work can you move that like the
top<00:03:42.940> works<00:03:43.180> or<00:03:43.390> did<00:03:43.480> you<00:03:43.570> have<00:03:43.660> exact<00:03:43.900> your

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
top works or did you have exact your

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.810 
top works or did you have exact your
time<00:03:44.290> though<00:03:44.740> I<00:03:44.770> break<00:03:45.190> it<00:03:45.340> till<00:03:45.520> you<00:03:45.580> do<00:03:45.730> it

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
time though I break it till you do it

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.450 
time though I break it till you do it
and<00:03:46.720> I<00:03:46.780> started<00:03:47.170> get<00:03:47.320> very<00:03:47.530> interested<00:03:47.890> in<00:03:48.280> the

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.460 
and I started get very interested in the

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.910 
and I started get very interested in the
way<00:03:48.580> the<00:03:48.760> top<00:03:49.000> of<00:03:49.120> a<00:03:49.180> guitar<00:03:49.480> works<00:03:49.920> because

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
way the top of a guitar works because

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.530 
way the top of a guitar works because
it's<00:03:51.100> crucial<00:03:51.490> to<00:03:51.520> the<00:03:51.640> planes<00:03:51.880> always<00:03:52.390> like

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
it's crucial to the planes always like

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.450 
it's crucial to the planes always like

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
stripes is the most important thing but

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.640 
stripes is the most important thing but
you'd<00:04:16.450> still<00:04:16.510> rather<00:04:16.780> have<00:04:17.200> the<00:04:17.320> old<00:04:17.350> like

this particular sort of saron bored that
i'm<00:04:21.580> on<00:04:21.790> earth<00:04:22.530> and<00:04:23.530> the<00:04:24.250> middle<00:04:24.580> is<00:04:24.730> much

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
i'm on earth and the middle is much

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.300 
i'm on earth and the middle is much
stiffer<00:04:25.210> right<00:04:25.930> the<00:04:26.440> edges<00:04:26.830> are<00:04:26.860> much<00:04:27.130> more

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
stiffer right the edges are much more
