00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.009
 If I asked you how do you recognize a clown, what would you say to me? 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.630
 Her multicolored hair, her oversized shoes or her big red nose? 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.059
 Hi, I'm Joelle Meijer. 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.710
 Today, I propose to make a clown nose with simple material! 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.320
 Start by separating two cells from an egg box. 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.180
 Then, trim the edges of each cell with small scissors. 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.789
 With white glue, glue the two cells together 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:35.399
 so that the edges exactly match. 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.729
 In this way, the glued cells form almost a ball. 

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:45.539
 When the glue is completely dry, take the ball 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.999
 and with a pencil draw what will become the opening to slide the nose. 

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:53.999
 The opening of the nose is done on only one of the two cells. 

00:00:53.999 --> 00:01:00.100
 Start by tracing both sides of a triangle on one side of the cell 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.460
 to the stop of the cell. 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.299
 Then turn the ball to have the flat side of the cell up 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.960
 and extend the lines you started with parallel lines. 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.560
 And to finish, still turn the cell 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.939
 and extend the lines by two sides of a triangle symmetrical to the first. 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:26.700
 Take small, pointed scissors and cut along the lines you have drawn 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.299
 and remove this part of the cell. 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:34.149
 You have just created the opening that will allow you to jam the ball 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:40.530
 on your nose. Before painting, test if indeed the opening corresponds 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.700
 at the size of your nose. 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.149
 As I have already indicated in other projects, 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.090
 the red paint is rather transparent 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.009
 and it is best to start by painting the cells 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.799
 using white paint to hide the gray of the egg box. 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.799
 Let the first coat of paint dry and then 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.450
 put one or two coats of red paint. 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.960
 In this case you can see how the red paint is transparent 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.319
 and I have no choice but to put at least a second coat of paint 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.870
 to get a beautiful bright red! To get a nice finish, 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.239
 you can add a layer of clear acrylic varnish. 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:24.170
 This clown nose model is good for older children or adults. 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.540
 For younger children, I suggest a more stable nose model. 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.750
 Take a cell of egg carton and trim the edges. 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.980
 As before, start by painting the cell in white and when the white paint 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.989
 is dry, put one or two coats of red paint. 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.170
 Finish by making two small holes on either side of the cell 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.560
 with sharp scissors. 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.159
 Pass a round elastic end in one of the holes and tie a knot. 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:02.019
 Measure the length of elastic needed to walk around the child's head 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.549
 and pass the other end of the elastic in the other hole 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:05.879
 and make a knot on that side. 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:11.579
 Add a hot glue point on each side as reinforcement. 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:18.569
 And now, the clown nose is ready to be used! 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.780
 To celebrate his 20 years, the organization "Clowns Without Borders" asks everyone who dares 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.610
 to send a "selfie" with a red nose. Do you want to participate? 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.939
 It's obvious that as soon as you put on a red nose you look like a clown ... 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:34.650
 here is the proof! 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.340
 For those who do not know "Clowns Without Borders", 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.469
 it is a humanitarian association that works in different countries. 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:47.709
 Some professional artists volunteer for shows in camps 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.530
 refugees, orphanages and centers for street children. 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.489
 A great initiative that aims to make people laugh and give a glimmer of hope 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.390
 in the lives of thousands of children and adults. 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.040
