00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
then it jumped into it the funny thing

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.319 
then it jumped into it the funny thing
is<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.530> think<00:00:47.430> I've<00:00:47.550> seen<00:00:47.730> this<00:00:47.910> animation

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.090 
is I think I've seen this animation
somewhere<00:00:48.870> it's<00:00:49.050> just<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.379> got<00:00:49.620> no<00:00:49.829> clue

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
you can actually see it here let's try

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.460 
you can actually see it here let's try
zooming<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.290> there<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.729> bit<00:01:09.390> like<00:01:10.140> there<00:01:10.350> is

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
zooming in there is a bit like there is

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.310 
zooming in there is a bit like there is
a<00:01:10.500> lot<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.799> detail<00:01:11.340> all<00:01:11.670> right<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.229> we're<00:01:13.229> gonna

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
a lot of detail all right so we're gonna

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.719 
a lot of detail all right so we're gonna
try<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.590> zoom<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:13.979> here<00:01:14.010> there's<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.400> lot<00:01:14.610> of

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
try to zoom in here there's a lot of

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.450 
try to zoom in here there's a lot of
detail<00:01:15.210> in<00:01:15.420> its<00:01:15.780> body<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:16.890> think<00:01:17.130> that's

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
detail in its body so I think that's

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.660 
detail in its body so I think that's
pretty<00:01:17.670> cool<00:01:18.409> so<00:01:19.409> what<00:01:20.130> we're<00:01:20.220> gonna<00:01:20.310> do<00:01:20.549> is

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
pretty cool so what we're gonna do is

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.520 
pretty cool so what we're gonna do is
just<00:01:20.700> wait<00:01:21.030> for<00:01:21.210> him<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.509> do<00:01:21.659> his<00:01:21.840> animation

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
just wait for him to do his animation

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.399 
just wait for him to do his animation
all<00:01:22.650> right<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.450> he<00:01:24.450> shoots<00:01:24.720> some<00:01:25.049> sort<00:01:25.320> of

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
all right so he shoots some sort of

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.850 
all right so he shoots some sort of
arrow<00:01:25.740> stuff<00:01:26.430> now<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.729> did<00:01:27.150> look<00:01:27.450> up<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.590> name

the<00:01:35.820> elven<00:01:36.360> dragon<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:36.869> think<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.470> no

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
the elven dragon I think this is the no

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.440 
the elven dragon I think this is the no
wait<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.400> Sylvan<00:01:38.939> drawing<00:01:39.180> all<00:01:39.329> right

wait this is a Sylvan drawing all right

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.170 
wait this is a Sylvan drawing all right
so<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.750> basically<00:01:40.500> uh<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.579> know<00:01:41.700> somewhere

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
so that basically uh you know somewhere

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.530 
so that basically uh you know somewhere
around<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.689> bow<00:01:42.990> arrow<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:44.270> shooting<00:01:45.270> type

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
around the bow arrow and shooting type

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.679 
around the bow arrow and shooting type
of<00:01:45.780> dragon<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.320> there<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.890> sort<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.939> magical

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
of dragon so there is sort of magical

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.289 
of dragon so there is sort of magical
mystical<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.950> don't<00:01:50.460> even<00:01:50.549> know<00:01:50.729> if<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:50.880> is

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
mystical I don't even know if that is

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.319 
mystical I don't even know if that is
flames<00:01:52.100> but<00:01:53.100> if<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.490> know<00:01:53.640> what<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:53.970> I

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
flames but if you know what it is I

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.990 
flames but if you know what it is I
think<00:01:54.689> it's<00:01:55.079> some<00:01:55.259> sort<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:56.000> concentrated

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
think it's some sort of concentrated

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.020 
think it's some sort of concentrated
energy<00:01:57.290> yeah<00:01:58.290> all<00:01:59.250> right<00:01:59.430> so<00:01:59.640> we're<00:01:59.909> gonna

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
energy yeah all right so we're gonna

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.060 
energy yeah all right so we're gonna
evolve<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.630> into<00:02:00.780> its<00:02:01.140> final<00:02:01.350> form<00:02:01.680> let's<00:02:01.950> see

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
evolve it into its final form let's see

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.260 
evolve it into its final form let's see
what<00:02:02.250> it<00:02:02.340> does<00:02:02.579> with<00:02:02.820> its<00:02:03.110> powerful<00:02:04.110> energy

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
what it does with its powerful energy

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.550 
what it does with its powerful energy
and<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.329> thing<00:02:06.509> is<00:02:06.659> it's<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:07.049> has<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.350> same
