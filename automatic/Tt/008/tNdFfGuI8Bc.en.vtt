00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.620 
just make this glitch a lot easier so
all<00:02:01.070> the<00:02:01.220> second<00:02:01.550> person<00:02:01.820> has<00:02:01.880> to<00:02:02.060> do<00:02:02.210> is<00:02:02.390> stand

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
all the second person has to do is stand

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.600 
all the second person has to do is stand
in<00:02:02.840> this<00:02:02.960> corner<00:02:03.350> and<00:02:03.530> that<00:02:03.800> is<00:02:03.950> basically<00:02:04.130> it

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
in this corner and that is basically it

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.700 
in this corner and that is basically it
the<00:02:04.820> glitch<00:02:05.090> is<00:02:05.119> now<00:02:05.540> working<00:02:05.810> all<00:02:06.229> the

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
the glitch is now working all the

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.320 
the glitch is now working all the
zombies<00:02:06.860> will<00:02:07.070> now<00:02:07.400> pile<00:02:07.670> up<00:02:07.940> in<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.149> middle

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
zombies will now pile up in the middle

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.759 
zombies will now pile up in the middle
of<00:02:08.420> the<00:02:08.540> town<00:02:08.720> and<00:02:08.780> you<00:02:09.140> can<00:02:09.320> either<00:02:09.470> have<00:02:09.739> a

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
of the town and you can either have a

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:11.620 
of the town and you can either have a
third<00:02:10.160> person<00:02:10.429> shoot<00:02:10.880> all<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.180> zombies<00:02:11.330> in

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
third person shoot all the zombies in

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.630 
third person shoot all the zombies in
the<00:02:11.720> pile<00:02:11.959> or<00:02:12.230> you<00:02:12.739> can<00:02:12.920> look<00:02:13.160> over<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.610> your

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
the pile or you can look over to your

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.460 
the pile or you can look over to your
right<00:02:13.910> and<00:02:14.150> throw<00:02:14.390> grenades<00:02:14.780> out<00:02:14.989> the<00:02:15.140> window

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
right and throw grenades out the window

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.009 
right and throw grenades out the window
or<00:02:15.709> shoot<00:02:16.040> some<00:02:16.340> of<00:02:16.430> them<00:02:16.550> in<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.820> pile<00:02:17.090> now

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
or shoot some of them in the pile now

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.660 
or shoot some of them in the pile now
the<00:02:18.080> only<00:02:18.320> downside<00:02:18.800> to<00:02:18.950> this<00:02:19.100> glitch<00:02:19.340> is<00:02:19.370> that

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
the only downside to this glitch is that

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.400 
the only downside to this glitch is that
sometimes<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.300> zombie<00:02:20.660> will<00:02:20.810> drop<00:02:21.019> down<00:02:21.050> from

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
sometimes a zombie will drop down from

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.780 
sometimes a zombie will drop down from
the<00:02:21.530> roof<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:21.950> this<00:02:22.100> is<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.310> only<00:02:22.459> one<00:02:22.730> that

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
the roof and this is the only one that

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.640 
the roof and this is the only one that
will<00:02:23.000> be<00:02:23.030> able<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.330> hit<00:02:23.450> you<00:02:23.660> but<00:02:24.260> an<00:02:24.380> easy

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
will be able to hit you but an easy

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.500 
will be able to hit you but an easy
solution<00:02:24.920> of<00:02:25.310> this<00:02:25.430> is<00:02:25.640> you<00:02:25.880> can<00:02:26.030> do<00:02:26.150> it<00:02:26.269> one<00:02:26.480> of

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
solution of this is you can do it one of

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.360 
solution of this is you can do it one of
the<00:02:26.630> god<00:02:26.780> mode<00:02:27.019> glitches<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.709> look<00:02:27.980> down<00:02:28.190> at

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
the god mode glitches to look down at

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.699 
the god mode glitches to look down at
the<00:02:28.459> ground<00:02:28.489> and<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.989> zombie<00:02:30.290> will<00:02:30.410> not<00:02:30.560> be

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
the ground and the zombie will not be

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:31.960 
the ground and the zombie will not be
able<00:02:30.800> to<00:02:30.950> hit<00:02:31.070> you<00:02:31.220> will<00:02:31.370> just<00:02:31.580> stand<00:02:31.790> there

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
able to hit you will just stand there

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.970 
able to hit you will just stand there
but<00:02:32.630> this<00:02:32.900> shouldn't<00:02:33.140> be<00:02:33.290> a<00:02:33.350> problem<00:02:33.680> because

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
but this shouldn't be a problem because

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.800 
but this shouldn't be a problem because
they<00:02:34.280> only<00:02:34.459> come<00:02:34.730> one<00:02:34.940> by<00:02:34.970> one<00:02:35.360> so<00:02:35.570> you<00:02:35.630> could

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
they only come one by one so you could

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.290 
they only come one by one so you could
easily<00:02:36.019> shoot<00:02:36.230> them<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:36.830> pick<00:02:37.010> them<00:02:37.040> off<00:02:37.340> so

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
easily shoot them and pick them off so

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.030 
easily shoot them and pick them off so
I'm<00:02:38.540> actually<00:02:38.720> not<00:02:39.110> sure<00:02:39.170> who<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.650> founder<00:02:39.980> of

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
I'm actually not sure who the founder of

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.979 
I'm actually not sure who the founder of
