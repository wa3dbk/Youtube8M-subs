00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:09.450
 one of the projects that have done most 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.000
 success here on air and 42 was the support 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.280
 notebook for being very useful and 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.240
 A lot of people decided to invest in 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.190
 idea 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.119
 so to enjoy that winter is 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.250
 arriving 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.930
 Let's learn how to build another model. 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.480
 support for notebooks 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.070
 but this time with a cushion on the base 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.869
 perfect for you to use your 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.410
 computer on your lap in the comfort of your 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.410
 bed 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:40.399
 let's go to the list of necessary materials 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:45.200
 four pvc knees 25 mm 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:48.450
 four joints understands pvc 25mm 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:52.530
 three pieces of pvc pipe 25 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.379
 millimeters with 31 centimeters each 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.460
 pieces of pvc 25mm pipe with 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.879
 nine centimeters every four pieces of 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.689
 pvc pipe 25 mm with 3,5 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.210
 centimeters each drain become 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:13.619
 100mm square one piece cooler 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.409
 pc with 80mm one usb cable one 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:19.439
 cushion or pillow some strips of 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.990
 needle and thread fabric 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.570
 besides these materials we will use 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.000
 some hot glue tools and a 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.000
 director to fix some parts of the 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.340
 more firmly this piece does not 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.710
 is mandatory but will allow a design 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.259
 more solid at the time of assembly 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.509
 We're going to fiddle with cutting tools. 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.200
 therefore we must be attentive to 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.409
 Dangers Do not Forget to Wear Gloves 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.939
 mask and goggles 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.040
 Let's start the assembly by measuring 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.500
 notebook to know what should be the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.140
 size of the media to do this 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.930
 we placed two joints in having one in 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.670
 each side of the unit then measure 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.310
 the distance between them 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:07.259
 then we cut three equal parts 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:09.720
 with the measure found later we will 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.790
 hold two solutions hundreds first 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.810
 two bars and two knees in the 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.940
 third 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.670
 The next step is to find out what the 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.530
 necessary fulfillment of our support 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.379
 we need to learn the first two 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:27.640
 bars in each other and between them the raul 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:28.870
 If we become to do this, we 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.060
 drain between them 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.610
 we measure the distance of a junction in 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.900
 to the other and cut two more pieces 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.900
 with this measure 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.549
 now just mount everything to mend the 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.000
 last bar we can cut two parts 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:49.329
 of pvc smaller each with about 3.5 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.340
 cm long at the 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.319
 we must leave the last two 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.690
 facing up 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.940
 this party shall be responsible for insuring 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.420
 the notebook and prevent it from slipping 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.579
 behind one of the most 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.560
 important in this project is the cooler 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:08.290
 because as notebook will be on 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.140
 homophobia you have to make sure that 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.690
 it will not overheat the first 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.849
 step is to measure the height of the cooler as 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:21.069
 it will be necessary to cut a 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:23.620
 Piece of the piece the average cooler 2.5 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:25.389
 centimeters tall then let's dial 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.290
 a line three centimeters high 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:30.880
 from the bottom of the drain 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:34.500
 now let's cut the side of the piece 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.500
 to create an air intake 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.920
 after cutting the side we will cut 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:55.599
 the piece as it was made our 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:57.730
 marking to continue we need 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:00.580
 the cooler on the grill that closes the 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:03.129
 so we can use it 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.349
 four screws as the surface of the 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:07.239
 bracket must be completely flat 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.519
 to ensure stability 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.590
 the club needs to be positioned in the same 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.540
 height of all parts 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.790
 we will secure the drain in the holder with 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.680
 the help of four rivets to leave the 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.900
 firmer set 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.950
 first we will do four holes two of 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.530
 each side 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:27.450
 then position after attaching 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.450
 applying the rivets from the inside 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.850
 to complete we will glue the grid with 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:39.220
 the cooler using a little glue 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:41.410
 to supply power to the 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.680
 cooler we will bare one end of the 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.630
 USB cable into the cable we have several 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.000
 wires of different colors 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.120
 let's separate the red and the black and 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.430
 cut others to complete amend 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.820
 the usb cable in the two children of the 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.820
 cooler 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.110
 now let's prepare the cushion that 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.030
 will be under the stand 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.220
 Let's start by positioning the bracket 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:18.130
 on the pillow and marking with a 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.320
 a place where we should cut the 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:25.390
 The fabric lining can be cut with 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:27.430
 scissors and foam with a stylus to 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.650
 that this is not exposed we need 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:34.750
 sew was again that of the fabric 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:36.790
 we have just cut the last stage of 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.670
 assembly to learn this cushion in the 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:41.250
 support using two tissue strips 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.690
 let's fasten one on each side 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:47.160
 taking advantage of fabric lining of the cushion 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.160
 to sew everything 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.960
 remember you can modify this 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.820
 Support way you want only 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.590
 be sure to keep the inside of the 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.280
 well ventilated notebook 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.280
 to avoid problems 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:07.330
 Would you like to join in the time and 42? 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:10.120
 you can do this in two ways: 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.370
 first sending suggestions and ideas and 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.770
 sending photos of projects that 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.200
 You built with what we show here. 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:19.750
 remember to caprichar in the photos who 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:23.080
 travels together his full name, age and 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:26.700
 city ​​sent an email to area 42 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:29.380
 at bx c dot com com 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.570
 the first participation of the week of the 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.430
 felipe angelo it turned 

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.260
 completely your USB stick with the 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.080
 pieces of a magic cube 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:42.180
 israel built a paper beast 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.180
 exactly as we taught here 

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:48.490
 luiz henrique went further built 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.130
 two different projects 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:53.520
 the loudspeaker with the old hd and two 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:56.050
 miniature robozzies 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.630
 lucas rodrigues was not intimidated by the 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:01.090
 design of the refrigerator and usb and decided 

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:03.100
 build your own version by applying 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:08.740
 improvements and increasing the efficiency of 

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:10.960
