a baby's breath in that it has the low
foliage<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.250> then<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:21.060> inference<00:01:21.630> come<00:01:21.840> up

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
foliage and then the inference come up

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.950 
foliage and then the inference come up
in<00:01:22.259> early<00:01:22.680> spring<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:23.549> think<00:01:24.150> about<00:01:24.240> April<00:01:24.840> or

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
in early spring I think about April or

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.289 
in early spring I think about April or
so<00:01:25.200> they<00:01:25.920> are<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.280> bloom<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:26.850> will<00:01:27.030> stay

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
so they are in bloom and that will stay

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.300 
so they are in bloom and that will stay
looking<00:01:27.509> like<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:28.080> through<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> lot<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
looking like this through a lot of the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.010 
looking like this through a lot of the
winter<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:29.880> if<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.090> have<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.479> planet<00:01:30.900> in

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
winter so if you have this planet in

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.679 
winter so if you have this planet in
another<00:01:31.530> perennial<00:01:31.950> bed<00:01:32.310> even<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:33.210> has<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
another perennial bed even it has the

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.100 
another perennial bed even it has the
same<00:01:33.930> look<00:01:34.200> as<00:01:34.350> baby's<00:01:35.159> breath<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.670> bouquet

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
same look as baby's breath and a bouquet

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.200 
same look as baby's breath and a bouquet
and<00:01:37.110> then<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.860> one<00:01:38.040> that's<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.549> side<00:01:38.759> here

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
and then the one that's on the side here

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.340 
and then the one that's on the side here
is<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.869> millennia<00:01:40.770> called<00:01:41.369> more<00:01:41.820> flame<00:01:42.350> this

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
is a millennia called more flame this

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.789 
is a millennia called more flame this
particular<00:01:43.649> one<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:44.070> think<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.640> not<00:01:45.200> in<00:01:46.200> enough

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
particular one I think is not in enough

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.219 
particular one I think is not in enough
