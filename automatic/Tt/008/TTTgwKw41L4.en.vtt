00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
how these work internally there's a lot

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.560 
how these work internally there's a lot
of<00:01:59.320> what<00:01:59.979> we<00:02:00.100> like<00:02:00.250> to<00:02:00.310> call<00:02:00.460> fake<00:02:01.060> volume

we're going to go ahead and take the end
off<00:02:19.790> of<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.560> reservoir<00:02:21.560> here<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:23.620> you<00:02:24.620> can

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
off of the reservoir here and you can

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.180 
off of the reservoir here and you can
see<00:02:24.920> that<00:02:25.070> it<00:02:25.250> is<00:02:25.430> a<00:02:25.790> a<00:02:26.060> -<00:02:26.120> and<00:02:26.980> how<00:02:27.980> this

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
see that it is a a - and how this

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.810 
see that it is a a - and how this
operates<00:02:29.140> is<00:02:30.140> inside<00:02:30.710> the<00:02:30.950> tube<00:02:31.190> you're<00:02:31.520> going

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
operates is inside the tube you're going

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.020 
operates is inside the tube you're going
to<00:02:31.970> have<00:02:32.150> two<00:02:32.570> sealed<00:02:33.550> pistons<00:02:34.550> and<00:02:34.790> you<00:02:34.850> can

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
to have two sealed pistons and you can

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.360 
to have two sealed pistons and you can
see<00:02:35.150> there's<00:02:35.360> rubber<00:02:35.570> seals<00:02:35.930> on<00:02:36.230> those<00:02:36.500> and

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
see there's rubber seals on those and

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.220 
see there's rubber seals on those and

fluid back into the shock we're going to
go<00:03:13.070> ahead<00:03:13.220> at<00:03:13.730> this<00:03:13.760> time<00:03:14.420> and<00:03:14.600> I'm<00:03:14.660> going<00:03:14.690> to

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
go ahead at this time and I'm going to

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.370 
go ahead at this time and I'm going to
put<00:03:16.550> these<00:03:16.700> in<00:03:17.000> didn't<00:03:17.630> use<00:03:17.750> a<00:03:17.810> little<00:03:18.110> bit<00:03:18.230> of

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
put these in didn't use a little bit of

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:25.330 
put these in didn't use a little bit of
a<00:03:19.330> little<00:03:20.330> bit<00:03:20.450> of<00:03:20.480> shock<00:03:20.870> oil<00:03:23.830> to<00:03:24.830> slide<00:03:25.130> that

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
a little bit of shock oil to slide that

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.940 
a little bit of shock oil to slide that
in<00:03:25.400> and<00:03:26.320> then<00:03:27.320> the<00:03:27.440> spring<00:03:27.800> goes<00:03:28.010> in<00:03:29.860> and<00:03:30.860> then

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
in and then the spring goes in and then

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.790 
in and then the spring goes in and then
we're<00:03:31.070> gonna<00:03:31.160> go<00:03:31.370> ahead<00:03:31.489> and<00:03:31.640> put<00:03:31.910> the<00:03:32.030> other

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
we're gonna go ahead and put the other

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.740 
we're gonna go ahead and put the other
piston<00:03:33.800> in<00:03:34.060> and<00:03:35.290> that<00:03:36.290> screws<00:03:36.680> down<00:03:36.980> on<00:03:37.970> top

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
piston in and that screws down on top

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.410 
piston in and that screws down on top
just<00:03:39.590> like<00:03:39.650> so<00:03:40.090> it<00:03:41.200> is<00:03:42.200> sealed<00:03:42.500> off<00:03:43.360> now<00:03:44.360> the

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
just like so it is sealed off now the

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.240 
just like so it is sealed off now the
reason<00:03:44.989> that<00:03:45.020> I<00:03:45.170> did<00:03:45.500> this<00:03:45.739> is<00:03:46.010> as<00:03:46.220> the<00:03:48.250> shock

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
reason that I did this is as the shock

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.540 
reason that I did this is as the shock
goes<00:03:49.760> into<00:03:50.510> or<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.350> fluid<00:03:51.680> goes<00:03:51.830> in<00:03:52.130> here

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
goes into or the fluid goes in here

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.510 
goes into or the fluid goes in here
that's<00:03:52.880> going<00:03:53.150> to<00:03:53.239> compress<00:03:55.360> the<00:03:56.360> spring<00:03:56.660> and

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
that's going to compress the spring and

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.150 
that's going to compress the spring and
there's<00:03:58.520> also<00:03:58.760> a<00:03:58.970> built<00:03:59.510> on<00:03:59.770> adjustment<00:04:00.770> tool

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
there's also a built on adjustment tool

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.390 
there's also a built on adjustment tool
on<00:04:01.520> the<00:04:02.239> back<00:04:02.450> that<00:04:03.170> you<00:04:03.320> can<00:04:03.530> adjust<00:04:03.650> to<00:04:04.040> help

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
on the back that you can adjust to help

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.350 
on the back that you can adjust to help
with<00:04:05.390> positive<00:04:06.020> or<00:04:06.260> negative<00:04:06.739> pressure

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
with positive or negative pressure

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.420 
with positive or negative pressure
within<00:04:08.360> the<00:04:08.540> system<00:04:09.110> as<00:04:09.290> your<00:04:09.890> shock<00:04:10.130> moves

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
within the system as your shock moves

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.640 
within the system as your shock moves
back<00:04:10.700> and<00:04:10.910> forth<00:04:11.000> and<00:04:11.450> it's<00:04:11.600> a<00:04:11.780> great<00:04:12.140> tuning

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
back and forth and it's a great tuning

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.570 
back and forth and it's a great tuning
tool<00:04:13.300> so<00:04:14.300> this<00:04:14.480> is<00:04:14.720> the<00:04:15.470> volume<00:04:15.650> compensators

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580
