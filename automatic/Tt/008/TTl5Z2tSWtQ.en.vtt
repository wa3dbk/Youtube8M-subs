00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:13.610
 If it is game style 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:17.810
 I'm thinking of using my skill as usual because I got a lot of head 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:21.130
 The level is still lower and 50 people 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.130
 I am loyal 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.420
 Shall we go there again ? 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.490
 It looks like a character that has been pushed quite recently 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:38.980
 Well, if you say it briefly 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.980
 It means low fuel consumption, is it a skill ? 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:47.210
 Skills Itchiga 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.210
 I think it's a fairly important Gallactor 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.760
 Let's go ahead 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:59.570
 At first it is skill 1 but consumption sp is 15 here 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.750
 Oh like this 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.750
 It is fast motion 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.060
 I wonder if it will be a character that is quite suitable for high-speed laps 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.659
 Not only that 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.659
 Auto skill 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:23.170
 Auto still skill consumption 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.170
 -20 Parker Because there is this, this earth skill is finally- 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.750
 If so strike at 12 I 10 mm's 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.650
 Good for heart 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:37.690
 There is too much ban Bang Prohibition Ku after all 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.500
 It 's very important to fight while keeping stable or invincible time of skill effective 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.730
 I think it will come 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.900
 Skills with good skill rotation 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.659
 It's easy-to-use Well 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:50.399
 Yeah Character Not only that 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:53.970
 It is the same as Mr. Hao who only makes limit breakthrough once 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:57.050
 It seems that you can take the speaker f 4 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.440
 Speaking of short three more times specific in 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.360
 We say that we change Japan's first holiday 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.100
 Molly 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.909
 Think strong 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.250
 Which day of the week the quest's high-speed lap is going to be amazing or whatever 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.210
 It's too hot and it's too fast 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.210
 It is like this 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.209
 Well for the second squib 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.980
 That's right, I think it's about now 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.100
 Maa it 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:31.170
 Although it is moderate, it will be strong 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.950
 Easy to use maersk match 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.950
 æ¥½ water mud 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:43.390
 It's pretty deep, I guess 4 is silk thread and sp recovery 4 is pretty strong 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.390
 That's why 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:51.030
 Really'm dense person is or was at once three-body 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.030
 It feels like it will be unlimited once 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.680
 Emmer died but that's why 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.750
 Thank you for watching it was a sense of skiv use of that destination Caldina 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:13.010
