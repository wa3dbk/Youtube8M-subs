00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
you can get like experience points and

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.819 
you can get like experience points and
you<00:01:37.329> can<00:01:37.479> make<00:01:37.689> those<00:01:37.840> experience<00:01:38.349> points<00:01:38.529> go

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
you can make those experience points go

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:41.069 
you can make those experience points go
towards<00:01:39.249> a<00:01:39.340> different<00:01:39.759> attribute<00:01:39.969> so<00:01:40.599> if<00:01:40.899> you

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
towards a different attribute so if you

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.050 
towards a different attribute so if you
level<00:01:41.289> up<00:01:41.499> you<00:01:41.770> get<00:01:41.920> one<00:01:42.159> point<00:01:42.189> that<00:01:42.849> one

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
level up you get one point that one

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.480 
level up you get one point that one
point<00:01:43.329> could<00:01:43.659> go<00:01:43.959> towards<00:01:44.319> you<00:01:45.189> know<00:01:45.279> the

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
point could go towards you know the

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.609 
point could go towards you know the
damage<00:01:45.759> or<00:01:46.060> range<00:01:46.240> I<00:01:46.509> don't<00:01:47.049> know<00:01:47.259> if<00:01:47.409> that'll

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619 
damage or range I don't know if that'll

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.679 
damage or range I don't know if that'll
be<00:01:47.829> the<00:01:47.950> ways<00:01:48.130> to<00:01:48.310> actually<00:01:48.490> take<00:01:49.179> this<00:01:49.450> I

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
be the ways to actually take this I

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:51.870 
be the ways to actually take this I
highly<00:01:50.380> doubt<00:01:50.709> it<00:01:50.770> but<00:01:50.950> that's<00:01:51.130> just<00:01:51.219> a<00:01:51.369> theory

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
highly doubt it but that's just a theory

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.639 
highly doubt it but that's just a theory
that<00:01:51.999> I've<00:01:52.209> just<00:01:52.539> came<00:01:52.749> up<00:01:52.899> with<00:01:53.049> on<00:01:53.200> top<00:01:53.439> of<00:01:53.560> my

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
that I've just came up with on top of my

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.219 
that I've just came up with on top of my
head<00:01:53.829> but<00:01:54.669> the<00:01:54.969> paint<00:01:55.329> shop<00:01:55.419> definitely

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
head but the paint shop definitely

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.739 
head but the paint shop definitely
sounds<00:01:56.619> like<00:01:56.679> some<00:01:57.069> top<00:01:57.279> of<00:01:57.609> garage<00:01:57.939> where<00:01:58.569> you

00:01:58.739 --> 00:01:58.749 
sounds like some top of garage where you

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:00.989 
sounds like some top of garage where you
can<00:01:58.959> maybe<00:01:59.770> potentially<00:02:00.069> make<00:02:00.609> your<00:02:00.819> own

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:00.999 
can maybe potentially make your own

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:03.419 
can maybe potentially make your own
custom<00:02:01.630> camo<00:02:02.079> a<00:02:02.259> lot<00:02:02.770> of<00:02:02.859> similar<00:02:03.099> to<00:02:03.249> maybe

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
custom camo a lot of similar to maybe

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.219 
custom camo a lot of similar to maybe
the<00:02:03.579> minecraft<00:02:04.179> skins<00:02:04.539> where<00:02:04.779> you<00:02:04.869> can<00:02:05.020> just

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
the minecraft skins where you can just

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.169 
the minecraft skins where you can just
go<00:02:05.380> in<00:02:05.409> and<00:02:05.770> make<00:02:05.950> whatever<00:02:06.159> skin<00:02:06.579> you<00:02:06.759> want<00:02:06.969> to

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:07.179 
go in and make whatever skin you want to

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:09.479 
go in and make whatever skin you want to
