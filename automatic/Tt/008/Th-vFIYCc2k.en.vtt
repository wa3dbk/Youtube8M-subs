00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.560 
like that to do a pic he's going to do a
reverse<00:02:00.750> pivot<00:02:01.189> so<00:02:02.189> he's<00:02:02.729> obviously<00:02:03.060> trailing

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
reverse pivot so he's obviously trailing

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.139 
reverse pivot so he's obviously trailing
him<00:02:03.659> this<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.200> reverse<00:02:05.009> pivot<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.579> then<00:02:05.969> on

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
him this is a reverse pivot and then on

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.089 
him this is a reverse pivot and then on
that<00:02:06.750> reverse<00:02:06.960> pivot<00:02:07.350> what<00:02:07.710> he's<00:02:07.799> going<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:07.979> do

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
that reverse pivot what he's going to do

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.410 
that reverse pivot what he's going to do
is<00:02:08.220> just<00:02:08.280> go<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.640> give<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:08.819> little<00:02:08.879> hand<00:02:09.209> off<00:02:09.390> to

a look at Adams going to bring that into
the<00:02:45.900> picture<00:02:47.690> okay<00:02:48.690> I'm<00:02:48.750> just<00:02:48.810> going<00:02:49.020> to<00:02:49.080> play

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
the picture okay I'm just going to play

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.220 
the picture okay I'm just going to play
it<00:02:49.320> in<00:02:49.530> real<00:02:50.100> speed<00:02:50.540> see<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.630> pass<00:02:51.810> is<00:02:52.020> made

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
it in real speed see the pass is made

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.290 
it in real speed see the pass is made
he's<00:02:53.130> trailing<00:02:53.430> them<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.850> little<00:02:54.030> bit<00:02:54.210> of

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
he's trailing them a little bit of

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.470 
he's trailing them a little bit of
reverse<00:02:54.570> pivot<00:02:54.780> handoff<00:02:55.550> okay<00:02:56.550> that's<00:02:57.300> kind

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
reverse pivot handoff okay that's kind

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.860 
reverse pivot handoff okay that's kind
of<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.600> front<00:02:57.840> pivot<00:02:58.020> but<00:02:59.360> it's<00:03:00.360> supposed<00:03:00.630> to<00:03:00.720> be

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
of a front pivot but it's supposed to be

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.180 
of a front pivot but it's supposed to be
a<00:03:00.900> reverse<00:03:01.200> pivot<00:03:01.410> so<00:03:01.620> that's<00:03:01.800> it<00:03:02.040> that's

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
a reverse pivot so that's it that's

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.910 
a reverse pivot so that's it that's
simple<00:03:02.610> that's<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:03.030> first<00:03:03.740> counter<00:03:04.740> the

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
simple that's the first counter the

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.780 
simple that's the first counter the
first<00:03:05.160> option<00:03:05.780> depending<00:03:06.780> on<00:03:07.200> again<00:03:07.790> triangle

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
first option depending on again triangle

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.900 
first option depending on again triangle
offense<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.300> all<00:03:09.450> about<00:03:10.790> reading<00:03:11.790> and

that's the second option handoff and
jumper<00:03:45.980> ok<00:03:47.000> so<00:03:48.000> in<00:03:48.420> this<00:03:49.080> situation<00:03:49.260> he's

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
jumper ok so in this situation he's

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.120 
jumper ok so in this situation he's
driving<00:03:50.130> in<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.250> hoop<00:03:50.400> with<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:51.570> first

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
driving in the hoop with the first

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.590 
driving in the hoop with the first
diagram<00:03:53.130> but<00:03:53.430> we're<00:03:54.150> showing<00:03:54.360> you<00:03:54.480> the

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
diagram but we're showing you the

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.850 
diagram but we're showing you the
handoff<00:03:54.900> in<00:03:55.020> jumper<00:03:55.290> so<00:03:55.410> he's<00:03:55.440> not<00:03:55.650> going<00:03:55.710> to

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
handoff in jumper so he's not going to

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.160 
handoff in jumper so he's not going to
drive<00:03:56.040> there<00:03:56.310> but<00:03:56.700> also<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:57.660> other<00:03:57.750> option<00:03:58.110> of

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
drive there but also the other option of

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.770 
drive there but also the other option of
course<00:03:58.230> is<00:03:58.530> to<00:03:58.710> feed<00:03:58.890> the<00:03:59.010> post<00:03:59.220> v5<00:04:00.620> alright<00:04:01.640> so

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
course is to feed the post v5 alright so

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.090 
course is to feed the post v5 alright so
and<00:04:03.780> again<00:04:05.300> normally<00:04:06.300> in<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:06.810> situation<00:04:07.500> one

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
and again normally in the situation one

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.500 
and again normally in the situation one
would<00:04:08.370> come<00:04:08.520> all<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.790> way<00:04:08.820> down<00:04:08.910> here<00:04:09.090> they'd

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
would come all the way down here they'd

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.720 
would come all the way down here they'd
pass<00:04:09.750> 233<00:04:10.500> might<00:04:10.650> be<00:04:10.800> a<00:04:10.830> little<00:04:11.100> bit<00:04:11.280> wider<00:04:11.490> and

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
pass 233 might be a little bit wider and

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.220 
pass 233 might be a little bit wider and

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
to try to set up the role now so let's

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.350 
to try to set up the role now so let's
going<00:04:25.320> to<00:04:25.380> throw<00:04:25.560> x3<00:04:26.250> in<00:04:26.370> here<00:04:26.640> guard

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
going to throw x3 in here guard

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
going to throw x3 in here guard
alright<00:04:28.360> so<00:04:28.510> x3<00:04:28.810> is<00:04:29.020> guarding<00:04:30.180> we've<00:04:31.180> got<00:04:31.420> the

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
alright so x3 is guarding we've got the

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.980 
alright so x3 is guarding we've got the
trail<00:04:33.450> all<00:04:34.450> right<00:04:34.690> so<00:04:35.020> pass<00:04:35.770> is<00:04:36.040> made<00:04:36.720> now<00:04:37.720> what

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
trail all right so pass is made now what

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.080 
trail all right so pass is made now what
happens<00:04:38.380> here<00:04:38.800> is<00:04:38.890> let's<00:04:39.670> say<00:04:41.430> we<00:04:42.430> got<00:04:42.610> x3

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
happens here is let's say we got x3

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.510 
happens here is let's say we got x3
switching<00:04:43.860> all<00:04:44.860> right<00:04:45.010> now<00:04:45.160> look<00:04:45.310> at<00:04:45.400> this

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
switching all right now look at this

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.340 
switching all right now look at this
opportunity<00:04:46.210> we<00:04:46.540> got<00:04:46.750> right<00:04:46.900> now<00:04:47.020> the<00:04:47.110> ball<00:04:47.320> is

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
opportunity we got right now the ball is

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.800 
opportunity we got right now the ball is
going<00:04:47.470> to<00:04:47.590> be<00:04:47.710> right<00:04:47.890> here<00:04:48.180> three<00:04:49.180> is<00:04:49.510> on<00:04:49.690> the

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
going to be right here three is on the

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.310 
going to be right here three is on the
roll<00:04:50.020> 5<00:04:51.150> has<00:04:52.150> his<00:04:52.480> man<00:04:52.720> guarding<00:04:53.170> them

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
roll 5 has his man guarding them

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.900 
roll 5 has his man guarding them
obviously<00:04:53.470> that<00:04:53.920> could<00:04:54.310> be<00:04:54.430> a<00:04:54.460> little<00:04:54.670> bit<00:04:54.850> of

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
obviously that could be a little bit of

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.730 
obviously that could be a little bit of
a<00:04:54.970> problem<00:04:55.150> but<00:04:55.300> we<00:04:55.390> got<00:04:55.540> a<00:04:55.570> mismatch<00:04:55.960> so<00:04:56.410> I

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
a problem but we got a mismatch so I

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.490 
a problem but we got a mismatch so I
just<00:04:57.340> clear<00:04:57.610> that<00:04:57.760> guy<00:04:57.910> out<00:04:58.030> of<00:04:58.090> their<00:04:58.500> role

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
just clear that guy out of their role

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.760 
just clear that guy out of their role
this<00:04:59.650> guy<00:04:59.830> to<00:04:59.890> the<00:05:00.070> hoop<00:05:01.230> x1's<00:05:02.230> gotta<00:05:02.470> follow

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
this guy to the hoop x1's gotta follow

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.860 
this guy to the hoop x1's gotta follow
on<00:05:03.040> maybe<00:05:03.460> the<00:05:03.640> guy<00:05:03.670> who's<00:05:04.060> guarding<00:05:04.300> x5<00:05:04.750> is

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
on maybe the guy who's guarding x5 is

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.330 
on maybe the guy who's guarding x5 is
going<00:05:05.020> to<00:05:05.080> come<00:05:05.260> in<00:05:05.410> on<00:05:05.650> the<00:05:05.740> split<00:05:06.010> and<00:05:06.130> help

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
going to come in on the split and help

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.030 
going to come in on the split and help
but<00:05:06.550> in<00:05:07.330> this<00:05:07.630> situation<00:05:07.840> we<00:05:08.350> got<00:05:08.650> speed

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
but in this situation we got speed

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.270 
but in this situation we got speed
mismatch<00:05:09.490> we<00:05:09.850> could<00:05:10.000> feed<00:05:10.210> it<00:05:10.330> into<00:05:10.450> 3<00:05:10.960> or<00:05:11.740> of

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
mismatch we could feed it into 3 or of

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.550 
mismatch we could feed it into 3 or of
course<00:05:12.550> we've<00:05:12.760> got<00:05:12.910> reversal<00:05:13.360> options<00:05:13.690> to<00:05:14.020> 24

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
course we've got reversal options to 24

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.120 
course we've got reversal options to 24
and<00:05:14.910> then<00:05:16.200> we<00:05:17.200> start<00:05:17.470> the<00:05:17.560> triangle<00:05:17.980> offense

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
and then we start the triangle offense

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.400 
and then we start the triangle offense
all<00:05:18.550> over<00:05:18.820> again<00:05:19.000> on<00:05:19.150> the<00:05:19.240> other<00:05:19.390> side<00:05:19.600> so

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
all over again on the other side so

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.440 
all over again on the other side so
that's<00:05:20.590> it<00:05:20.800> for<00:05:20.830> today<00:05:21.280> those<00:05:21.550> are<00:05:21.580> the<00:05:21.760> I
