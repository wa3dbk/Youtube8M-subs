Penance monsters now the first thing you
should<00:00:22.650> do<00:00:22.859> as<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.010> collective<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.670> run<00:00:23.820> to

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
the north and call out for the attacker

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.439 
the north and call out for the attacker
um

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
um

collector<00:00:30.449> is<00:00:30.630> generally<00:00:31.320> considered<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.830> be

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
collector is generally considered to be

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.030 
collector is generally considered to be
the<00:00:32.070> easiest<00:00:32.669> role<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.480> do<00:00:33.660> because<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.920> don't

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
the easiest role to do because you don't

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.860 
the easiest role to do because you don't
actually<00:00:35.250> have<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.790> kill<00:00:36.149> anything<00:00:36.600> all<00:00:36.780> you

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
actually have to kill anything all you

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.260 
actually have to kill anything all you
have<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.079> do<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.260> pick<00:00:37.469> up<00:00:37.620> eggs<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.160> load<00:00:39.090> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
have to do is pick up eggs and load the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.160 
have to do is pick up eggs and load the
cannon<00:00:40.010> and<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.370> that's<00:00:41.780> adds<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:43.020> the

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
cannon and so that's adds to the

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.819 
cannon and so that's adds to the
simplicity<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.579> role<00:00:45.649> the<00:00:46.649> most

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
simplicity of the of the role the most

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:47.930 
simplicity of the of the role the most
important<00:00:47.250> thing<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.489> should<00:00:47.520> do<00:00:47.760> as<00:00:47.910> a

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
important thing you should do as a

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.310 
important thing you should do as a
collector<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.690> call<00:00:48.870> out<00:00:49.079> for<00:00:49.230> the

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
collector is to call out for the

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.069 
collector is to call out for the
attacker<00:00:49.850> because<00:00:50.850> collecting<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.750> such<00:00:51.930> an

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
attacker because collecting is such an

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.439 
attacker because collecting is such an
easy<00:00:52.230> build<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.710> do<00:00:52.860> there<00:00:53.579> should<00:00:53.730> be<00:00:53.850> um<00:00:54.090> lots

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
easy build to do there should be um lots

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.930 
easy build to do there should be um lots
of<00:00:54.539> opportunity<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.230> call<00:00:55.620> call<00:00:56.489> out<00:00:56.699> rather

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
of opportunity to call call out rather

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.900 
of opportunity to call call out rather
than<00:00:57.090> other<00:00:57.440> roles<00:00:58.440> which<00:00:58.680> generally<00:00:59.520> require

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
than other roles which generally require

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.600 
than other roles which generally require
a<00:00:59.940> lot<00:01:00.239> more<00:01:00.270> work<00:01:03.589> and<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:04.830> once<00:01:05.070> you've<00:01:05.369> got

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
a lot more work and so once you've got

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.539 
a lot more work and so once you've got
the<00:01:05.760> correct<00:01:06.000> call<00:01:06.299> from<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.659> attacker<00:01:07.549> pick

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
the correct call from the attacker pick

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.210 
the correct call from the attacker pick
up<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.909> eggs<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.390> are<00:01:09.930> called<00:01:10.140> out<00:01:10.350> now<00:01:11.040> if

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
up the eggs that are called out now if

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.660 
up the eggs that are called out now if
these<00:01:11.400> happen<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.760> be<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.090> wrong<00:01:12.270> eggs<00:01:13.670> you'll

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
these happen to be the wrong eggs you'll

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.160 
these happen to be the wrong eggs you'll
get<00:01:14.850> 50<00:01:15.180> damage<00:01:15.479> on<00:01:15.600> yourself<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.080> egg

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
get 50 damage on yourself and the egg

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.020 
get 50 damage on yourself and the egg
will<00:01:16.350> explode<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.340> also<00:01:17.430> lose<00:01:17.759> points

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
will explode and you also lose points

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.570 
will explode and you also lose points
for<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.420> at<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.600> end<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.930> game<00:01:19.280> so<00:01:20.280> if<00:01:20.460> you

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
for it at the end of the game so if you

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.460 
for it at the end of the game so if you
do<00:01:20.729> happen<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.119> get<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.450> wrong<00:01:21.630> call<00:01:21.900> or<00:01:22.140> if

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
do happen to get the wrong call or if

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.870 
do happen to get the wrong call or if
you<00:01:22.560> accidentally<00:01:23.100> happen<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.460> pick<00:01:23.610> up<00:01:23.759> the

you accidentally happen to pick up the

the collector dispensing machine which

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.410 
the collector dispensing machine which

is the port from the left Islam takes
quite<00:03:01.720> a<00:03:01.780> long<00:03:01.930> time<00:03:02.170> and<00:03:02.470> I<00:03:03.069> generally<00:03:03.640> don't

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
quite a long time and I generally don't

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.430 
quite a long time and I generally don't
recommend<00:03:03.940> it<00:03:04.299> but<00:03:04.360> if<00:03:04.900> you<00:03:05.049> don't<00:03:05.230> want<00:03:05.379> to

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
recommend it but if you don't want to

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.680 
recommend it but if you don't want to
drop<00:03:05.620> destroy<00:03:06.099> them<00:03:06.310> that's<00:03:06.489> fine<00:03:06.700> just<00:03:06.910> just

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
drop destroy them that's fine just just

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.440 
drop destroy them that's fine just just
fill<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.620> dispenser<00:03:09.459> and<00:03:09.640> then<00:03:09.790> this<00:03:10.180> will

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
fill the dispenser and then this will

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.080 
fill the dispenser and then this will
turn<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.230> eggs<00:03:11.410> into<00:03:11.680> other<00:03:11.829> eggs<00:03:12.069> and<00:03:12.370> some

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
turn the eggs into other eggs and some

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.369 
turn the eggs into other eggs and some
of<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.329> eggs<00:03:13.510> will<00:03:13.660> be<00:03:13.690> destroyed<00:03:14.140> in<00:03:14.290> the

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 
of the eggs will be destroyed in the

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.539 
of the eggs will be destroyed in the
process<00:03:15.959> so<00:03:16.959> this<00:03:17.709> gives<00:03:17.950> you<00:03:18.010> more<00:03:18.220> room<00:03:18.370> to

process so this gives you more room to

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:19.729 
process so this gives you more room to
pick<00:03:18.670> up<00:03:18.850> more<00:03:19.000> eggs

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739
