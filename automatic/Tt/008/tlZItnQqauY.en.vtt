 emulator in my case I will choose Spanish 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.780
 Spain you can choose the language of 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.230
 preference or the language that most 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:39.110
 agree and we give ok now so if 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.299
 we are already inside the emulator now 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.910
 as you remember earlier I said that 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.940
 we had three skin two of them are from 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.250
 roms pages to download 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.049
 nintendo 64 games in my case I already 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.900
 had downloaded one then we're going to 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.849
 where the file we give to open and I'm going 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.420
 to open the rom that I had to unveil 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:01.220
 Mario 64 we are going to open and since then 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.099
 would start the round directly 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.920
 charging may take a little while 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:09.720
 it starts from ram good my salary and 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.260
 well I would be starting 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.690
 ok now let's stop the game let's go 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.110
 to pause we do not cause and we're going to see the 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.940
 characteristics of this stimulator for 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.270
 start let's give you file and here 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.580
 we can open new rom finish the 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.230
 emulation is working in my case of 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.940
 games and I'm going to stop them or if I 'm going 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.650
 to finish it would remove the rom vale 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.910
 then well let's go to load it 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:38.810
 to continue explaining we reload 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.260
 we give systems that is the following 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.780
 language 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.760
 here we can select languages ​​in case 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.650
 that you want to select for example 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.590
 English or any other language is worth 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.170
 system here we can restart the game 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.960
 here we can continue after having 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.030
 stopped and here we can capture can 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.640
 make a screenshot here 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:02.690
 We can save the game status voucher 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.940
 here we can restore it and good when 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.160
 we save it we can select where 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.750
 we want to save the game here we can 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.220
 see some tricks but I do not know this 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.830
 how it works then I can not explain 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.930
 ok next options we can put the 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:17.150
 game in full screen let's see 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.700
 if it works well let's remove the 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.930
 full screen is worth a function of 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.670
 full game because the game is not 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.400
 really started then well let's go 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:28.280
 to the next section configuration 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.780
 of the graphics plugin we are going to give a 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.970
 click and then in the first section 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.010
 we have the resolution that we want 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.470
 have the window the emulator window 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.690
 without being in full screen in my 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.680
 case I will leave the joy by default 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.539
 OK 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.150
 then it tells us full screen resolution 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:47.449
 this means the highest good the 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:50.990
 resolution in full screen that 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:52.699
 would be the 1080 then this one I do not know 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.180
 what is it good for I do not know what it is for 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:58.639
 this the truth full screen I do not know that no 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:01.860
 I know what you have to know what it says 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:04.349
 if you can not find it and it would be 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.700
 and this would leave it as it is and you 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:09.410
 we give ok we go to options 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.680
 what sounds to you this is a plugin 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:15.890
 totally normal is the tubing for 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:19.430
 up and down the audio of the program and 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:22.880
 would be options control good plugin of 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:25.970
 control this if we have different here 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.200
 players is worth if you have more friends and 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.510
 this when with more friends in a 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:33.740
 split screen because you can configure 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:35.780
 more profiles or even modify the 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.960
 first profile is valid to modify them 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:42.050
 you select the box this time 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.660
 selecting and give you a whole you give 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:48.270
 to the icon that you want to change 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:50.250
 You can also select profiles and 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.950
 the guards is good then this 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.600
 would be all seen let's move on to 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.520
 next section that is configuration 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.280
 here in configuration we will have more 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.840
 directories and more more directories where 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.230
 you would find the plugins worth 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.690
 directories where the 

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:07.110
 batteries from nintendo 64 is the 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.880
 drums 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:11.190
 then they would find the games 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.930
 saved from the snapshot guard the 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.180
 same folder that you would be able to 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.430
 change them or look back from 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.710
 saved anywhere and the 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.750
 would charge if it's already good then more or 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.060
 less this is already this is already everything 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.820
 same 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.530
 I think that he 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:30.460
 I think the resident works a lot 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.690
 alright then well I'm going to resume and 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.770
 well it is already put in full screen 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.690
 this because he had left 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:36.760
 before and good as you can see the 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.560
 it's true that it looks pretty good it looks 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.060
 very good then well let's make a 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.490
 little bit of let's try it a little bit 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.930
 let's try it now the tutorial that 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:47.260
 had finished then well let's go to 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:49.990
 let's try it the truth is that it is 

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:51.370
 great looks good or bad that the rom 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:55.090
 that I downloaded well in English 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:56.770
 you remember to download roms in 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.330
 Spanish is valid or in the language of 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.310
 preference and that's it and it's that in my 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.600
 case I downloaded it in English because it was 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.850
 to do only tutorial I do not have 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.370
 no kind of intention to play it like that 

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:08.550
 how good are we going to see 

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:10.370
 the view avoid so it looks good it looks 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:13.200
 and you can 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:16.130
 of 7 the sound also very pure 

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.130
 it sounds very good 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:21.270
 we would be going out of the complete 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:24.990
 pressing escape and we already closed the 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:27.420
 emulator and it's already installed already you 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:29.190
 there is a shortcut on the desktop 

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.930
 and if you can not find it through the menu 

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:32.820
 start was going to all the programs
