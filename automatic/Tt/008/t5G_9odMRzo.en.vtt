program yes and I feel like in the past

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.150 
program yes and I feel like in the past
couple<00:01:06.280> years<00:01:06.460> it's<00:01:07.060> it's<00:01:08.020> kind<00:01:08.590> of<00:01:08.680> plateaued

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
couple years it's it's kind of plateaued

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.270 
couple years it's it's kind of plateaued
in<00:01:09.460> a<00:01:09.850> way<00:01:10.000> which<00:01:10.240> means<00:01:10.450> like<00:01:10.660> it<00:01:11.260> hasn't<00:01:11.710> had

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
in a way which means like it hasn't had

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.490 
in a way which means like it hasn't had
the<00:01:12.490> chance<00:01:12.700> to<00:01:12.940> get<00:01:13.090> better<00:01:13.360> because<00:01:13.990> it's

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
the chance to get better because it's

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.870 
the chance to get better because it's
been<00:01:14.650> struggling<00:01:14.950> with<00:01:15.130> like<00:01:15.340> low<00:01:15.520> numbers

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
been struggling with like low numbers

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.080 
been struggling with like low numbers
and<00:01:15.910> stuff<00:01:16.360> like<00:01:16.510> that<00:01:16.570> so<00:01:17.230> I<00:01:17.500> think<00:01:17.530> that<00:01:18.280> in

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
and stuff like that so I think that in

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.580 
and stuff like that so I think that in
the<00:01:19.270> next<00:01:19.390> couple<00:01:19.630> years<00:01:19.780> we<00:01:20.200> have<00:01:20.320> to<00:01:20.440> like

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
the next couple years we have to like

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.800 
the next couple years we have to like
improve<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.430> program<00:01:21.610> by<00:01:21.970> building<00:01:22.360> upon<00:01:22.630> it

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
improve the program by building upon it

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.170 
improve the program by building upon it
and<00:01:22.990> like<00:01:23.560> going<00:01:24.400> back<00:01:24.580> to<00:01:24.610> some<00:01:25.030> of<00:01:25.060> the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
and like going back to some of the

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.300 
and like going back to some of the
original<00:01:25.300> things<00:01:25.840> we<00:01:25.990> used<00:01:26.170> to<00:01:26.260> uphold<00:01:26.710> you

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310

have<00:01:28.780> to<00:01:28.930> know<00:01:29.050> that<00:01:29.290> um<00:01:29.580> like<00:01:30.840> everybody<00:01:31.840> has

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
have to know that um like everybody has

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.090 
have to know that um like everybody has
to<00:01:32.050> be<00:01:32.290> where<00:01:32.470> they're<00:01:32.590> supposed<00:01:32.710> to<00:01:32.890> be<00:01:33.010> at

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
to be where they're supposed to be at

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.560 
to be where they're supposed to be at
the<00:01:33.250> right<00:01:33.430> times<00:01:33.820> it's<00:01:34.060> not<00:01:34.180> even<00:01:34.480> though

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
the right times it's not even though

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.940 
the right times it's not even though
those<00:01:34.720> things<00:01:34.930> aren't<00:01:35.110> most<00:01:35.260> necessarily

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
those things aren't most necessarily

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.940 
those things aren't most necessarily
like<00:01:36.160> benefit<00:01:37.150> for<00:01:37.750> the<00:01:37.840> students<00:01:38.230> they<00:01:38.680> make

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
like benefit for the students they make

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.340 
like benefit for the students they make
the<00:01:39.160> program<00:01:39.340> more<00:01:39.760> fun<00:01:40.000> you<00:01:40.690> know<00:01:40.810> so<00:01:41.080> I<00:01:41.110> think

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
the program more fun you know so I think

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.350 
the program more fun you know so I think
like<00:01:41.890> we<00:01:42.130> need<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.310> build<00:01:42.520> it<00:01:42.700> back<00:01:42.790> up<00:01:42.850> get<00:01:43.270> our

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
like we need to build it back up get our

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.660 
like we need to build it back up get our
numbers<00:01:43.510> back<00:01:43.840> up<00:01:43.870> again<00:01:44.320> and<00:01:44.560> that<00:01:45.280> way<00:01:45.430> more

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
numbers back up again and that way more

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.190 
numbers back up again and that way more
kids<00:01:45.910> can<00:01:46.090> enjoy<00:01:46.120> it<00:01:46.540> and<00:01:46.630> more<00:01:46.780> kids<00:01:46.930> can<00:01:47.140> get

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
kids can enjoy it and more kids can get

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.780 
kids can enjoy it and more kids can get
more<00:01:47.350> out<00:01:47.470> of<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:47.620> program<00:01:48.900> like<00:01:50.460> it's<00:01:51.460> still

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
more out of the program like it's still

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.880 
more out of the program like it's still
fun<00:01:52.090> for<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.480> students<00:01:52.840> but<00:01:53.200> it<00:01:53.500> can<00:01:53.620> be<00:01:53.740> so

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
fun for the students but it can be so

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.170 
fun for the students but it can be so
much<00:01:54.010> better<00:01:54.190> I'm<00:01:54.760> not<00:01:54.850> starting<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.210> say<00:01:55.330> like

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
much better I'm not starting to say like

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.490 
much better I'm not starting to say like
couple<00:01:56.480> years<00:01:56.540> like<00:01:56.810> aw<00:01:56.930> it's<00:01:57.110> gotten<00:01:57.320> worse

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.050 
it hasn't really it's just it still has

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:08.950 
it hasn't really it's just it still has
so<00:02:00.290> much<00:02:04.870> I<00:02:06.970> think<00:02:07.970> one<00:02:08.240> of<00:02:08.270> the<00:02:08.390> most

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
so much I think one of the most

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.690 
so much I think one of the most
frustrating<00:02:09.140> part<00:02:09.500> for<00:02:09.770> me<00:02:10.070> was<00:02:10.100> when<00:02:10.310> I<00:02:10.550> was

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
frustrating part for me was when I was

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.880 
frustrating part for me was when I was
in<00:02:10.820> high<00:02:10.850> school<00:02:10.970> and<00:02:11.240> trying<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.600> recruit

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
in high school and trying to recruit

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
everybody thought it was like a like a

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.990 
everybody thought it was like a like a
hardcore<00:02:15.440> civics<00:02:15.980> program<00:02:16.490> that<00:02:16.760> we<00:02:16.850> were

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
hardcore civics program that we were

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.160 
hardcore civics program that we were
like<00:02:17.180> we<00:02:17.330> had<00:02:17.450> to<00:02:17.570> learn<00:02:17.720> all<00:02:17.990> this<00:02:18.110> stuff

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
like we had to learn all this stuff

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.310 
like we had to learn all this stuff
about<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:18.770> and<00:02:18.950> a<00:02:19.700> lot<00:02:20.570> of<00:02:20.630> the<00:02:20.810> students<00:02:21.170> i

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320
