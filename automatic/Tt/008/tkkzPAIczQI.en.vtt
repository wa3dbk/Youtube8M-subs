 Even with the right hand 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.590

 Shuriken removal is just a button here 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.600
 While pressing here 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.250
 It is unlocking when pressing the Shuriken double-tenbe button 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.520
 Since the assumption of the shuriken is also recognized only with this switch, the sound will be the same no matter what the shuriken is inserted 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:19.000
 is 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:24.710

 Pull out left and right here in parts and is the completion of the bow mode 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:39.259
 There are no grips in the basement with two grip switches 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:45.430
 The same way as a child, it may be a bow gun style 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:48.940
 Like this 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:53.340
 Huh we are seeing it is a good severe pain 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.340
 When you pull the lever, you will hear a finger attack sound 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:10.090
 I set the shuriken in this state 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.090
 th 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:29.129
 The button in this mode is the nail's special move 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:29.129
 Good for bow mode 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:55.970

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:02.820
 And remove the three laps key 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:08.480
 The grip is as it is now This is the bow mode though 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:08.480
 It is completed only by bending the tip . 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.960
 It is a special move here 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.800
 he 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:32.960
 When pulling the tip in nail mode 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:45.960

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:10.729
 Of course the exam can be combined with the Deluxe Shuriken 

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:13.729
 The face parts of the part of the shuriken core are raised to 90 degrees and bought as it is 

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:16.330
 It would be very interesting if the robot's face turned into this even during the play 

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:21.479
 Is it just a toy gimmick? 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:21.479
 Although I feel that there is anything like hugeness in the name of Ninpo, though 

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:29.920
 Was a trick smattering videos So yes 

00:07:25.289 --> 00:07:32.950
 I think it's great as a weapon, but it's a bit expensive, isn't it? 

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:37.780
 It seems that human sovereignty itself will come out alone 

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:40.620
 Your viewing person is waiting towards the mercenary daily ticket was happy to say that more than might Iikamo 

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.620
