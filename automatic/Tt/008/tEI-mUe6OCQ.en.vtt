00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.920
 downtime inexpensive very practical 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.499
 drywall is the perfect material 

00:00:05.499 --> 00:00:08.410
 for repair the main thing to treat him 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.419
 right 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:12.210
 align the walls and ceiling 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.170
 make partitions and even 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.640
 lay the floor drywall with such 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.000
 repair material 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.310
 an apartment 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.289
 if you know a few tricks 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.179
 let's start with drywall tools very 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:27.140
 fragile thread word will have to buy 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.560
 new drive with save will help here 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.779
 such a protopop grab with him 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.129
 easy to carry even the most 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:36.020
 large sheets 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.530
 one more fixture 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.530
 stand it come in handy if you do 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.160
 repairing it alone is easy 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.350
 fix the drywall plants 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.680
 now you can mount 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.110
 scratched material here will help out 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.540
 reinforced paper tape 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.050
 but first you need to expand 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.320
 knife damage is simple enough 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.540
 cut off the edges 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.089
 propaganda care contracts 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:05.300
 providing 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.600
 arum 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.000
 by the way staff where to get only for 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.509
 show 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:11.990
 another will crack wait to dry 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.990
 Once the form must immediately glue paper 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.690
 then squeeze with a spatula 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.690
 drywall and cracking as was 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.250
 need to bend the sheet there are two ways 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.010
 first on the outside of the sheet doing 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.160
 knife deep serif us gm not 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.840
 less than three centimeters then 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.230
 we put drywall 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.180
 Europe bend it 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.490
 according to him he led 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.720
 about a dog 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.720
 the number of attempts 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.060
 second for those who do not want to mess with 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.810
 solution 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.590
 on the inside of drywall 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.549
 we make many small holes 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.549
 like this custom symbolizes 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.960
 then wet the material with water and 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.040
 leave to dry for several hours 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.190
 then whip it true there is 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.409
 a little tourist disadvantage can burst 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.569
 if you bend strongly 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.929
 Now profile they will help make 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.249
 just like that 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:16.409
 scissors make cuts every 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.699
 five centimeters 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:21.539
 then the profile itself will start 

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:23.869
 put it on drywall I enter 

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:25.939
 a pencil 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:29.089
 then the guy and cut the workpiece 

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:32.309
 again we attach a profile to it 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:35.599
 and fasten it with screws arch ready 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.249
 but the shelves and the drywall picture is better 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:40.159
 screw butterflies to 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.159
 you will need to install them 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:43.429
 tool 

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:45.779
 using it is easy to make holes and 

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:47.769
 do not damage the material but just paste 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.329
 NTV opening is not enough 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.419
 Guatemala riots come from 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:52.609
 mother's 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.609
 and in the end u guys 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.779
 think a shelf or picture will fall nothing 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:02:59.739
 like 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.010
 each such species stands 15 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.959
 kilograms 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.569
