competing in my first national

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.680 
competing in my first national
championship<00:02:30.080> so<00:02:31.450> everything<00:02:32.450> that<00:02:32.480> I'm

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
championship so everything that I'm

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.350 
championship so everything that I'm
doing<00:02:32.930> right<00:02:33.050> now<00:02:33.110> is<00:02:33.260> really<00:02:33.590> just<00:02:33.709> leaving

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
doing right now is really just leaving

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.750 
doing right now is really just leaving
to<00:02:34.600> that<00:02:35.110> one<00:02:35.260> big<00:02:35.530> competition<00:02:36.220> and<00:02:36.460> while<00:02:36.730> I

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
to that one big competition and while I

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.610 
to that one big competition and while I
don't<00:02:36.880> expect<00:02:37.090> her<00:02:37.480> in<00:02:37.570> my<00:02:37.720> pro<00:02:37.960> card<00:02:38.140> yet<00:02:38.410> this

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
don't expect her in my pro card yet this

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.340 
don't expect her in my pro card yet this
year<00:02:38.920> that<00:02:39.730> is<00:02:39.850> certainly<00:02:40.150> an<00:02:40.510> end<00:02:41.080> goal<00:02:41.320> of

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350

mine
