00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
with the way my frame is looking today I

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.600 
just want to recap the past few days and
the<00:02:26.519> things<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:26.909> I<00:02:26.970> have<00:02:27.120> done<00:02:27.390> to<00:02:27.659> my<00:02:28.110> frame

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
the things that I have done to my frame

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.050 
the things that I have done to my frame
the<00:02:29.610> first<00:02:29.790> day<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.599> used<00:02:31.560> Eastwood's<00:02:32.340> internal

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
the first day I used Eastwood's internal

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.050 
the first day I used Eastwood's internal
frame<00:02:33.299> coating<00:02:33.810> system<00:02:34.290> and<00:02:34.739> what<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.430> is<00:02:35.790> is

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
frame coating system and what that is is

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.420 
frame coating system and what that is is
it<00:02:36.209> encapsulates<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:37.379> neutralizes<00:02:38.069> the<00:02:38.190> rust

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
it encapsulates and neutralizes the rust

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.089 
it encapsulates and neutralizes the rust
inside<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.209> frame<00:02:39.480> before<00:02:40.410> I<00:02:40.440> did<00:02:40.709> that<00:02:40.739> I

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
inside the frame before I did that I

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.819 
inside the frame before I did that I
blew<00:02:41.459> it<00:02:41.640> out<00:02:41.760> with<00:02:41.940> some<00:02:42.120> air<00:02:42.420> this<00:02:43.140> frame<00:02:43.560> had

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
blew it out with some air this frame had

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:44.930 
blew it out with some air this frame had
never<00:02:44.040> been<00:02:44.220> off-roading

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
never been off-roading

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.509 
never been off-roading
if<00:02:45.120> you<00:02:45.480> have<00:02:45.659> a<00:02:45.690> frame<00:02:46.079> that<00:02:46.560> has<00:02:46.739> dirt<00:02:47.069> in<00:02:47.280> it

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
if you have a frame that has dirt in it

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.119 
if you have a frame that has dirt in it
you're<00:02:48.299> gonna<00:02:48.510> have<00:02:48.599> to<00:02:48.900> really<00:02:49.260> wash<00:02:49.590> it<00:02:49.950> out

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
you're gonna have to really wash it out

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.410 
you're gonna have to really wash it out
really<00:02:50.670> well<00:02:51.150> before<00:02:51.780> you<00:02:52.019> use<00:02:52.200> this<00:02:52.620> coating

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
really well before you use this coating

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.849 
really well before you use this coating
and<00:02:54.420> to<00:02:54.750> do<00:02:54.870> that<00:02:55.049> make<00:02:55.260> sure<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.680> inside

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
and to do that make sure that the inside

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.099 
and to do that make sure that the inside
is<00:02:56.069> totally<00:02:56.609> dry<00:02:56.879> before<00:02:56.940> you<00:02:57.569> even<00:02:57.750> start

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
is totally dry before you even start
