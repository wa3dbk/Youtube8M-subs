00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 Hi, how are you this video today? 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.090
 which I hope you find useful for 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.190
 your studies or to remember them the 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.530
 troposphere is the lowest layer 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.289
 next to the earth's surface of the 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.660
 atmosphere of the earth as it 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.020
 rises decreases the temperature in the 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.029
 troposphere in the troposphere the 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.630
 phenomena that make up what we call 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.599
 weather the weather is the average time 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.030
 for many years the time can 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.390
 change every day but the weather 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.120
 the changes always remain the same 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.390
 of time occur during the day of 24 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.550
 The time also changes with the 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.680
 stations due to the inclination of the 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.800
 land as it rotates around the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.440
 sun the weather is the result of the 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.719
 atmosphere of the earth there where the 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.230
 atmosphere does not exist on the moon by 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.660
 example time does not exist some 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.750
 factors that determine the time are the 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.240
 temperature the precipitation the fronts 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.579
 the types of clouds and the wind 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.920
 and other severe weather conditions 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:14.430
 are hurricanes and tornadoes 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.530
 thunderstorms the stratosphere is 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.080
 the second layer of the atmosphere of the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.500
 land as you climb the 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.750
 temperature in the stratosphere increases 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.030
 Ozone causes the temperature to rise 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.270
 since it absorbs the dangerous light of the sun 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.460
 and turns it into heat the mesosphere is 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.429
 the third layer of the atmosphere of the 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.100
 Earth the temperature decreases as 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:40.920
 that goes up as it happens in the troposphere 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.429
 it can be up to less than 90 g 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.500
 it is the coldest area of ​​the atmosphere the 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:49.229
 thermosphere is the fourth layer of the 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.649
 Earth 's atmosphere is 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.929
 above the mesosphere at this height the 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.869
 air is very dim the temperature changes 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.560
 with solar activity if the sun is 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.810
 active 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.010
 temperatures in the thermosphere can 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.140
 get to 1500 degrees centigrade 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.740
 the thermosphere of the earth also 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.810
 includes the region called ionosphere the 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:15.020
 ionosphere is a special part of the 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.140
 atmosphere is not a separate layer but 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.600
 that is part of the thermosphere the 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.490
 long distance communication by radio 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.590
 it is possible since the different 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.770
 regions of the ionosphere reflect the 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.390
 radial waves back to earth to 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.120
 as it ascends in the ionosphere 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.180
 the temperature increases 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.490
 this is where auroras happen 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.970
 last layer of the atmosphere of the earth 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.760
 is the exosphere this is the area where 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.830
 atoms escape into space 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.230
 I wish that your expectations in the 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.590
 video have been fulfilled and you get good 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.720
 notes if you liked it and you have been 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.820
 utility for saleh the video to your 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.709
 classmates 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.560
 You can also give it a thumbs-up 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:05.530
 point up I like 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.530
 thank you have a good day
