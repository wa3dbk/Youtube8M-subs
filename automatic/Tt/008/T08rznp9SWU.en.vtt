everything's going good I just switched

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.930 
everything's going good I just switched
to<00:03:35.590> defensive<00:03:36.010> stance<00:03:36.250> because<00:03:36.370> I<00:03:36.519> was<00:03:36.639> taking

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
to defensive stance because I was taking

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.890 
to defensive stance because I was taking
some<00:03:37.810> damage<00:03:38.260> this<00:03:39.040> is<00:03:39.160> an<00:03:39.280> interesting

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
some damage this is an interesting

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.670 
some damage this is an interesting
question<00:03:41.280> about<00:03:42.280> these<00:03:42.579> stances<00:03:42.850> like<00:03:43.299> I<00:03:43.680> in

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
question about these stances like I in

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.129 
question about these stances like I in
battlegrounds<00:03:45.579> I<00:03:45.730> go<00:03:46.150> mostly<00:03:46.510> with<00:03:46.750> battle

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:47.139 
battlegrounds I go mostly with battle

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:49.080 
battlegrounds I go mostly with battle
sense<00:03:47.380> I<00:03:47.500> only<00:03:47.650> switch<00:03:48.040> to<00:03:48.310> that<00:03:48.459> fancy<00:03:48.670> one

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
sense I only switch to that fancy one

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.569 
sense I only switch to that fancy one
when<00:03:49.840> I'm<00:03:49.989> losing<00:03:50.380> quite<00:03:50.560> health<00:03:50.799> in<00:03:51.040> arena<00:03:51.340> I

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
when I'm losing quite health in arena I

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.190 
when I'm losing quite health in arena I
think<00:03:51.910> it's<00:03:52.060> I<00:03:52.329> think<00:03:52.750> you<00:03:52.870> should<00:03:53.049> go

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
think it's I think you should go

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.890 
think it's I think you should go
definitely<00:03:53.500> with<00:03:53.889> defensive<00:03:54.850> stance<00:03:55.150> like

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
definitely with defensive stance like

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.940 
definitely with defensive stance like
pretty<00:03:56.260> much<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:57.910> thumb<00:03:58.180> rule<00:03:58.420> I<00:03:58.450> guess

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
pretty much the thumb rule I guess

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.490 
pretty much the thumb rule I guess
unless<00:03:59.950> I<00:04:00.549> mean<00:04:01.450> but<00:04:01.600> it<00:04:01.750> depends<00:04:02.079> with<00:04:02.319> the

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
unless I mean but it depends with the

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.009 
unless I mean but it depends with the
with<00:04:03.400> watch<00:04:03.760> compositions<00:04:04.540> you're<00:04:04.690> dealing

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
with watch compositions you're dealing

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.890 
with watch compositions you're dealing
with<00:04:05.049> if<00:04:05.410> it's<00:04:05.590> some<00:04:06.190> burst<00:04:06.519> you<00:04:07.030> know<00:04:07.150> which

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
with if it's some burst you know which

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.210 
with if it's some burst you know which
this<00:04:08.859> is<00:04:09.099> missile<00:04:09.880> burst<00:04:10.389> area<00:04:11.220> something

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
this is missile burst area something

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.400 
this is missile burst area something
like<00:04:12.400> that<00:04:12.609> you<00:04:13.299> should<00:04:13.510> be<00:04:13.690> inside

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
like that you should be inside

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.370 
like that you should be inside
yeah<00:04:14.560> it's<00:04:15.520> really<00:04:15.760> it<00:04:16.180> is<00:04:16.570> up<00:04:16.930> a<00:04:17.050> little<00:04:17.260> bit

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
yeah it's really it is up a little bit

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.520 
yeah it's really it is up a little bit
definitely<00:04:17.890> does<00:04:18.120> and<00:04:19.120> yeah<00:04:19.720> here<00:04:20.290> it<00:04:20.380> goes

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
definitely does and yeah here it goes
