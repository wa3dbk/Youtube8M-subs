00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.260
 and Lot broke driven for you 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.540
 present so this series a series of 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.180
 tutorials so I tried with humility 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.820
 really can put my paw in 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.380
 the tutorial and not stupidly what has already 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.290
 been told what everybody 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.750
 maybe knows it's necessary to 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.700
 talk about basics anyway try to 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.590
 show you a bit my design so 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.270
 this is really a tutorial dribble my 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.700
 design of dribbling to explain to a 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.640
 little concept c to you after two of 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.079
 create your style of play with that and 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.699
 here we will go immediately to 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.739
 training put back two defenders 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.660
 it's very much precision dribbling for 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.129
 reminder christian dribbling it's the 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:54.210
 two triggers ps3 l2 r2 and xbox 360 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.379
 lt and rt a dribble which therefore places in 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.480
 movement as we can see 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:01.050
 so this is a band that's great 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.570
 effective that allows to see to have and 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.790
 total control of the balloon to have the 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.290
 ball very close to the player of fit to 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.260
 any time to change direction 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.530
 quite quickly setback and a while 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.899
 facing the goal 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.729
 so something very useful 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:20.759
 precision dribbling can be used so 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.950
 so short so in the race 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.740
 so here it was a loan to a 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.500
 very dark shot and bing that allows that's it 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.840
 you see to really see the clips of 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.630
 change game orientation all of 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.740
 continuation and to always have a good 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.979
 control of the ball every time 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.020
 really to a dribble who who is very 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.719
 effective and it's still one of 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.060
 finally bases of fifa when we want 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:46.829
 start to become a good player there 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.490
 must know how to use precision 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.930
 dribbling there I face my goal so 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.070
 I use the precision drilling one can 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.479
 see that the player right away is going to get 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.250
 return 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.310
 so a movement that can be helpful to 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.829
 also so briefly there really 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.990
 allows if we use it quickly 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.549
 allows behind to give false 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.220
 tracks and right away to speed up 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.679
 behind so I'll give you in 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.480
 example - dribbles that I like to do 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:16.830
 which is very very useful if I run 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.280
 here I am pretending to go right 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.810
 in precision dribbling then I'm going 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.700
 try to do it maybe quickly 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.440
 then it's not really good market coup 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.250
 of acceleration and I'm going left in 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.849
 simply 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.989
 so here's a little idea the idea of 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.550
 precision dribbling after as I 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.230
 say it's up to you to see 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.180
 the use that you will make of it if 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.030
 you're going to use it a lot or not 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.540
 anyway it's always good to know 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.599
 then use it a little bit another 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.950
 thing so that's going to be related this is the 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.319
 bullet protection then I would tell you 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.180
 a little later why are you going to be bound 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.310
 the ball protection all people 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.709
 use it and yet it's a thing 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.079
 that can really help then just 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:05.840
 to press the deceleration button 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:10.890
 so on ps3 cr2 by default always 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:13.410
 xbox 360 c ar t you have to be stopped 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.540
 a jap us on and there you and that my 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:20.130
 player puts himself back but eventually in 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:25.130
 opposition back to the opposing players in 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.130
 opposition to the ball 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.850
 so it is for that's nothing when 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.140
 himself this bullet protection can 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:38.130
 to be really useful for dribbling 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:42.300
 we see it here 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.010
 that's really first 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.150
 cards and the balloon to keep the 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.520
 ball possession again 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.520
 it's a really cool thing 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:59.520
 here you see that there I touch nothing 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.380
 the player turns himself and 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.210
 that's it's still super great 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.070
 helpful and you see that it's really 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.710
 really easy to use it's 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.120
 very very simple things to do 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.950
 so why do I tell you then that 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.920
 celje because we 're actually going to see a mix 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.590
 between the bullet protection is between 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.930
 the precision dribbling here and it's a 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.890
 precision dribbling finally gold I 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.049
 will you explain it right now 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:26.310
 so it's enough to protect his 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.690
 balloon with so r2 or rt is to use 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.700
 the two triggers so as we saw 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.160
 for to make precision dribbling 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.080
 so there are only two keys press 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.240
 one obviously but I start first 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.770
 to protect my balloon that's 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.660
 essential is to start with 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.360
 protect the balloon is then to press 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.830
 on the trigger to go into precision 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.240
 dribbling actually dribbling impression 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.220
 there that is different from just now 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.760
 say that the player does not face the 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.990
 goal with not hunted like that see 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:56.340
 how useful it can be 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:59.370
 we have seen simplicity simply 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:02.340
 bypassed the player bypassed the 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:04.170
 defender that there are few people who 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.800
 use it from people who have to 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:09.990
 know this dribble there which is yet 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.670
 super effective so bullet protection 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.820
 more precision dribbling something 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:18.510
 from super simple nothing complicated after 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.670
 it's up to you obviously to owe them 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.470
 opportunities available to you when 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.860
 you'll use it something you can 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:30.450
 to make this idea like that it's 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.890
 imagine I overflow the protection of 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:33.780
 ball I'm pretending to go left 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.420
 and there acceleration shot to go 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.740
 finally on the right and miss 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:41.849
 completely 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:44.789
 that's the idea and then it's up to you 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:46.740
 each to the utility that is 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:48.360
 he will want to enter it already I believe that 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.490
 it's good bases and cdc 1 it's a 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.960
 good little trick we already see against a 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.090
 so the dribbling that I give you 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.720
 it's really to be done against 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:59.910
 players then I say that especially for you 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.270
 perhaps surely for the next 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.160
 videos 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.990
 because that seems to work 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.699
 rather a lot of them tell me I 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:09.360
 am a player who plays essentially 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:10.650
 online so all my advice it 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.659
 is going to be more for players who are going 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.490
 play online so here I think it 

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:17.639
 we had a little tour around 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:21.720
 dribbling precision so I remind him 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:26.270
 l2 r2 or rtl t on the xbox 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:28.680
 I hope this tutorial will be useful 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.180
 do not hesitate to subscribe if you 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.250
 are curious to see a little what I this 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.630
 that I propose here I leave you for 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.120
 an upcoming video 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:42.169
 we'll see it will surely be complete due to 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:42.169
 ring go hi to all ciao ciao 

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.400
