00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.050 

don't<00:04:12.730> you<00:04:12.940> see<00:04:13.240> like<00:04:13.510> this<00:04:14.310> now<00:04:15.310> it's<00:04:15.550> a<00:04:15.730> half

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
don't you see like this now it's a half

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.590 
don't you see like this now it's a half
off<00:04:16.390> his<00:04:16.720> head

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.500 

now<00:04:20.230> black<00:04:20.590> and<00:04:20.620> put<00:04:21.040> one<00:04:21.340> three<00:04:21.700> millimeter<00:04:22.180> I

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
now black and put one three millimeter I

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.550 
now black and put one three millimeter I
used<00:04:22.930> black<00:04:23.830> diamond<00:04:24.310> and<00:04:24.610> then<00:04:25.390> pass<00:04:25.750> black

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
used black diamond and then pass black

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.430 
used black diamond and then pass black
and<00:04:26.830> into<00:04:27.250> next<00:04:27.610> be<00:04:27.910> next<00:04:28.600> to<00:04:28.720> the<00:04:28.870> eyes<00:04:28.990> this

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
and into next be next to the eyes this

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.930 
and into next be next to the eyes this
one

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.590 

so<00:04:36.570> you<00:04:36.630> can<00:04:37.020> see<00:04:37.320> that<00:04:37.530> this

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
so you can see that this

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.070 
so you can see that this
read<00:04:40.260> input<00:04:40.560> three<00:04:41.570> jet-black<00:04:42.570> four
