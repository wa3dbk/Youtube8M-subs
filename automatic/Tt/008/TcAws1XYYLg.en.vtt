00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.980
 Hi, I'm Santi and today we're going to repair this deposit 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.820
 We are going to cover it with fiberglass 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.020
 To give more resistance and cover the ... hole 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.160
 You see, it's all cracked and this does not work 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.080
 I'm going to use the Quimibase 2000 resin 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.620
 It is thixotroped and accelerated 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.940
 CLARIFICATION ((Tixotropada reduces the drop)) 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.660
 CLARIFICATION ((Accelerated is that it only needs to be reactive or catalyst to harden)) 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.180
 It's pre-accelerated 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.120
 One liter of resin corresponds to 2% 20 ... ((cubic centimeters decatalizer)) 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.640
 I mix it in a separate container 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.600
 So n spoil the jug of measures that is always more expensive. 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.020
 After using the syringe, we clean it with solvent or if the rubber does not ... the rubber is undone, ... and you have to buy another one. 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.360
 I keep the roller in a taper with solvent or acetone. 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.320
 To keep him tender, 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.520
 That the resin rests of teas sometimes do not stay, ... 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.360
 dry and we have to, .. use another roller 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.120
 We mix the resin well 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.860
 rubbing on the walls so that no parts 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.580
 without mixing with the peroxide 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.240
 CLARIFICATION ((Peroxide is the catalyst or accelerator)) 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.700
 With seal 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.020
 let's cover 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.920
 the break for the resin to get inside. 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:13.720
 Here I have covered the two exits of the tank so as not to cover them with resin and keep the threads of the plugs 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.200
 SO, NO, NO, NO. 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.460
 I TRIED 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.700
 COVER IT WITH ONE SINGLE 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.040
 GLASS FIBER PIECE 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.060
 IT'S NOT THE BEST OPTION 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.800
 A PART IS BETTER 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.640
 AND THEN THE OTHER 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.600
 BEFORE IT HAS DRYED 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.860
 TO IMPROVE 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.900
 THE GRIP BETWEEN RESINS 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.740
 SO IF 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.040
 We return to the attack 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.000
 Now 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.380
 we will do it by sections 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.240
 Let us be the ones who send and not the resin 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.820
 FIRST WE GIVE RESIN IN THE DEPOSIT 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.320
 WE PUT THE FIBER 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.480
 AND GIVE MORE RESINA 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.880
 UNTIL THE FIBER HAS THE COLOR OF THE RESIN 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.680
 THAT IS THAT THERE IS NO AIR 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.840
 WE CAN REINFORCE MORE EASY ZONES 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.460
 We take advantage of the same curve as the fiber ((WAS TO HAVE FOLDED)) 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.280
 so that it is in its place 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.760
 BY PUTTING A NEW FIBER LAYER 

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.800
 WE APPROVE WELL TO MIX THE FIBERS 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.220
 THAT THERE ARE PLACES WITH WHICH WE PUT 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.840
 AND REMOVE THE AIR 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.460
 We are going to do it without ... 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.480
 without supporting it to avoid undoing 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.460
 what we have already done 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.120
 I'm going to fix this a little ((THE PLUG THREAD)) 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.240
 Because a deposit without a hole, ((ENTRY)) 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.480
 It's not a deposit, it's a bag. 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.480
 And now before it dries, 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.920
 we will give it with white spray so that it will not be seen, 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.820
 both the patch 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:51.540
 SO THE PAINT BECOMES BETTER THAN THE RESIN 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.540
 THIS IS THE FIXING POINTS OF THE DEPOSIT 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.200
 YOU HAVE TO LEAVE THEM WELL 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.560
 TO BE ABLE TO PLACE IT AGAIN ON YOUR SITE 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.300
 Now before it hardens at all 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.040
 we cut 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.980
 THE INPUT OF THE SENSOR AND THE PLUG 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.780
 It is important to do it now because ... 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.960
 now with a simple cutter we can fix it 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.060
 and then a tool will be needed 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.380
 and we can spoil what hems arranged 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.200
 I've put it in the sun, so, .. 

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.900
 it was a little faster 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.900
 and it has gone faster than 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.360
 THE MORE HEAT, THE FASTER THE REACTION 

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.460
 AND THE COOLER THE MORE SLOW THE REACTION 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.680
 The resin and paint have dried 

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.860
 and now we are going to take away all the aspect 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.700
 This way, dispelled that makes you ugly with the sandpaper. 

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.600
 a painting repasito, ... 

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.920
 Here we have it 

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.900
 You have seen 

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.400
 the problems that happen when a single 

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.840
 and sometimes you also learn from mistakes 

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.660
 because you see how n has to be done 

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.160
 and there is only the way of how to do it 

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.700
 or you discover ways of how you do not have to do it. 

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.040
 Until next time.
