00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.530
 today we are going to see a game developed 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.029
 by ubisoft montreal that are more 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.369
 known for developing games like 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.680
 click Luisa Perez and the president 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.180
 watts docs but the title that we're going to 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.220
 see today is a little away from all 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.470
 the action games chain of light is 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.239
 a tribute to Japanese role-playing games 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.930
 but it presented a fable form 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.930
 European 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.500
 it is more or less as if final fantasy the 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.550
 little prince dark version come together and 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.550
 they focused on a video game 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.949
 so let's see if it's worth the 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.440
 penalty or if it ends up making a 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:47.300
 failed experiment is counted the 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.370
 story of aurora a falling princess 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.320
 in a deep sleep and enter the magical 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.179
 world of he died his main objective 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.769
 is to return home to see his father 

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:57.500
 but for this you must fight against 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.420
 dark forces in the end ends up being 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.489
 more a metaphor of how a girl has 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.170
 that mature face the situations and 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.780
 become the princess who saves a 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.670
 kingdom the characters and their stories are 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.649
 lovely all the dialogues are 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.210
 written in the form of poems and rhymes what 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:13.180
 which reinforces the impression that this 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.190
 it was a fairy tale 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.900
 the graphic engine is the same as 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.370
 he used the king man legends which 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.290
 allows the illustrations of the 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.810
 artists move directly to the game 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.340
 the hair effects the details in the 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.530
 scenario and the transitions between 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.510
 scenes everything is summed up that art in 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.460
 This game is beautiful and at all times 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.160
 it looks like it was an interactive painting 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.990
 made in watercolor they were even 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.550
 involved producers of the tsja I think 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.350
 law to ensure that the experience is 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.360
 magic and surreal 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.400
 most games happen in this 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.140
 world in 2d that most resembles a game 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.880
 of platforms but now we're going to 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.060
 start in a combat so they can see how 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.640
 works now I'm going to attack this spider 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.530
 then have tomorrow techniques well 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.060
 interesting that there were not in others in 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.560
 other games for example the first and the 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.060
 more important that is the one that you can 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.189
 buy this light that is called and myths 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.130
 he played nothing and what he can do is 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:05.140
 encourage the attack of the enemies to 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.060
 that attack slower the interesting thing is 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.709
 that he falls in it several characters in 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.200
 simultaneous and at any time you can 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.360
 change then on let's change 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.910
 the magician who theoretically has powers 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.920
 magic and that are more effective against 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.510
 the spiders and one of the most 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.220
 important in combat is this line of 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.989
 time that tells you when you are going to 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.459
 attack each character the interesting thing about 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.500
 enemy management attacks you when you are 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.720
 about to attack 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.390
 you go back in the timeline and 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.720
 everything you created with the strategy behind 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.730
 that you simply click on that does not 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.400
 you just want to attack everything is a good 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.370
 complex but it was once something 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.049
 that rhythm feels very good 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.360
 Music melancholic tone color 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.099
 precise with the piano melodies and 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.560
 during the fights I felt the pressure of 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:52.480
 violins and drums 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.700
 by parts the game becomes quite 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.290
 easy and repetitive and the story is 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.500
 is a bit short of what could have been 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.090
 been I did not die even once when playing it 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.310
 in normal mode and after a while 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.959
 there are so many characters that take longer 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.370
 time to decide where to invest the 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.890
 experience points instead of 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.450
 enjoy the game itself is to take some 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.190
 14 hours finish the story by 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.140
 first time but then they can go back to 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.160
 play it in a more difficult way with all 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.160
 the skills they have acquired 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.519
 it's definitely not as epic as 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.379
 for 17 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.180
 beltrán and cox and probably it 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.739
 have more fun playing things for 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.900
 guys and we made recently 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.549
 but only 15 to return will be surprised 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.620
 of all the content that chardón flight 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.849
 has to offer and I'm glad you have 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.850
 titles like this in the market that 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.040
 they create variety 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.140
 and it ends up being one of the most games 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.940
 beautiful and unique that tasted the 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.520
 recent months and despite being somewhat 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.650
 repetitive and the story is predictable 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.690
 the way they are represented make 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.680
 all the difference and make it an easy 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.680
 recommendation for all
