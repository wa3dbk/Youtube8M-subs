gluing this shoe but for now I'm just

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.910 
gluing this shoe but for now I'm just
doing<00:03:20.970> one<00:03:21.180> hour<00:03:21.299> session<00:03:21.900> so<00:03:22.380> yeah<00:03:22.560> it's<00:03:22.829> a

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
doing one hour session so yeah it's a

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.979 
doing one hour session so yeah it's a
huge<00:03:23.160> difference<00:03:23.639> from<00:03:23.760> before<00:03:23.940> as<00:03:24.660> you<00:03:24.750> can

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
huge difference from before as you can

huge difference from before as you can
see<00:03:26.389> see<00:03:27.389> it<00:03:27.510> Lizzie<00:03:27.810> started<00:03:28.049> with<00:03:28.290> gluing

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
see see it Lizzie started with gluing

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.080 
see see it Lizzie started with gluing
everything<00:03:28.709> together<00:03:29.100> so<00:03:29.730> I'm<00:03:29.790> gonna<00:03:29.910> start

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
everything together so I'm gonna start

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.210 
everything together so I'm gonna start
off<00:03:30.209> by<00:03:30.269> gluing<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.930> midsole<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:31.799> uppers

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
off by gluing the midsole to the uppers

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.819 
off by gluing the midsole to the uppers
first<00:03:32.579> and<00:03:32.880> then<00:03:33.150> after<00:03:33.540> that<00:03:33.690> I'm<00:03:34.200> a<00:03:34.440> glue<00:03:34.650> the

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
first and then after that I'm a glue the

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.220 
first and then after that I'm a glue the
sole<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.609> the<00:03:35.730> midsole<00:03:36.150> so<00:03:36.600> let's<00:03:36.750> get<00:03:36.870> started

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
sole to the midsole so let's get started

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.720 
sole to the midsole so let's get started
alright<00:03:37.560> y'all<00:03:37.889> so<00:03:37.920> the<00:03:38.160> glue<00:03:38.340> I'm<00:03:38.430> gonna<00:03:38.579> be

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
alright y'all so the glue I'm gonna be

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.509 
alright y'all so the glue I'm gonna be
using<00:03:39.150> is<00:03:39.299> a<00:03:39.480> petrol<00:03:40.079> Neos<00:03:40.519> master

using is a petrol Neos master
all-purpose<00:03:42.299> I<00:03:42.450> purchased<00:03:42.840> this<00:03:42.930> glue<00:03:43.170> from

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
all-purpose I purchased this glue from

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.680 
all-purpose I purchased this glue from
Angela's<00:03:43.799> direct<00:03:44.190> comm<00:03:44.670> C<00:03:45.269> I'm<00:03:45.420> gonna<00:03:45.540> be

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
Angela's direct comm C I'm gonna be

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.539 
Angela's direct comm C I'm gonna be
using<00:03:45.840> this<00:03:46.049> glue<00:03:46.350> to<00:03:46.590> go<00:03:46.769> ahead<00:03:47.069> and<00:03:47.220> glue<00:03:47.400> the

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
using this glue to go ahead and glue the

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.690 
using this glue to go ahead and glue the
uppers<00:03:48.079> together<00:03:49.079> to<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:49.500> midsole<00:03:49.950> and<00:03:50.340> I

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
uppers together to the midsole and I

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.039 
uppers together to the midsole and I
know<00:03:50.850> you're<00:03:50.970> probably<00:03:51.150> wondering<00:03:51.540> why<00:03:51.690> using

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
know you're probably wondering why using

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.690 
know you're probably wondering why using
this<00:03:52.139> glue<00:03:52.380> this<00:03:52.500> time<00:03:52.739> you<00:03:52.889> usually<00:03:53.040> use<00:03:53.400> bars

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
this glue this time you usually use bars

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.550 
this glue this time you usually use bars
infinity<00:03:54.209> cement<00:03:54.600> now<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:54.959> reason<00:03:55.260> I'm<00:03:55.350> using

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
infinity cement now the reason I'm using

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.470 
infinity cement now the reason I'm using
this<00:03:55.739> is<00:03:55.889> because<00:03:56.220> I'm<00:03:56.340> out<00:03:56.519> of<00:03:56.700> bars<00:03:56.940> infinity

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
this is because I'm out of bars infinity

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.539 
this is because I'm out of bars infinity
cement<00:03:57.959> so<00:03:58.440> you<00:03:58.500> can<00:03:58.739> also<00:03:58.920> use<00:03:59.190> barter

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
cement so you can also use barter

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.580 
cement so you can also use barter
infinity<00:03:59.940> cement<00:04:00.359> but<00:04:00.690> today<00:04:01.079> I'm<00:04:01.319> just<00:04:01.349> going

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
infinity cement but today I'm just going

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.589 
infinity cement but today I'm just going
to<00:04:01.650> be<00:04:01.769> using<00:04:01.980> this<00:04:02.099> Petronius<00:04:02.790> master

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
to be using this Petronius master

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.780 
to be using this Petronius master
all-purpose<00:04:04.440> of<00:04:04.620> man<00:04:04.799> however<00:04:05.130> you<00:04:05.519> pronounce

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
all-purpose of man however you pronounce

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.970 
all-purpose of man however you pronounce
it<00:04:06.150> so<00:04:06.480> let's<00:04:06.660> get<00:04:06.780> into<00:04:07.049> it<00:04:07.170> and<00:04:07.290> to<00:04:07.650> clamp

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
it so let's get into it and to clamp

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.319 
it so let's get into it and to clamp
down<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:08.220> shoe<00:04:08.609> I'm<00:04:08.790> just<00:04:08.970> gonna<00:04:09.060> be<00:04:09.209> using

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
down the shoe I'm just gonna be using

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:38.290 
down the shoe I'm just gonna be using
some<00:04:09.660> regular<00:04:09.840> shoe<00:04:10.290> laces

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.790 

all<00:04:39.300> right<00:04:39.540> yeah<00:04:39.690> so<00:04:39.870> I<00:04:39.900> finished<00:04:40.380> completely

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
all right yeah so I finished completely

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.130 
all right yeah so I finished completely
gluing<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:41.610> midsole<00:04:42.090> to<00:04:42.300> the<00:04:42.420> uppers<00:04:42.870> as<00:04:43.020> you

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
gluing the midsole to the uppers as you

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.530 
gluing the midsole to the uppers as you
can<00:04:43.320> see<00:04:43.560> it's<00:04:43.770> a<00:04:43.890> very<00:04:43.920> very<00:04:44.520> very<00:04:44.820> clean

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
can see it's a very very very clean

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.660 
can see it's a very very very clean
flush<00:04:45.930> reglue<00:04:46.530> so<00:04:46.950> yeah<00:04:47.070> guys<00:04:47.250> that's<00:04:47.310> the

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
flush reglue so yeah guys that's the

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.940 
flush reglue so yeah guys that's the
whole<00:04:47.970> midsole<00:04:48.450> reglue<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:49.050> next<00:04:49.410> step<00:04:49.590> is<00:04:49.800> to

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
whole midsole reglue the next step is to

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.700 
whole midsole reglue the next step is to
go<00:04:50.130> ahead<00:04:50.280> and<00:04:50.670> glue<00:04:50.820> the<00:04:51.120> icy<00:04:51.570> sole<00:04:51.840> back<00:04:52.470> on

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
go ahead and glue the icy sole back on

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.800 
go ahead and glue the icy sole back on
to<00:04:52.890> the<00:04:52.980> midsole<00:04:53.490> so<00:04:53.820> yeah<00:04:53.970> let's<00:04:54.210> get<00:04:54.360> started

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
to the midsole so yeah let's get started

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.630 
to the midsole so yeah let's get started
all<00:04:55.050> right<00:04:55.350> as<00:04:55.500> I'm<00:04:55.710> gluing<00:04:55.950> the<00:04:56.160> sole<00:04:56.430> right

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
all right as I'm gluing the sole right

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.700 
all right as I'm gluing the sole right
now<00:04:56.820> and<00:04:57.090> I'm<00:04:57.420> just<00:04:57.570> showing<00:04:57.750> out<00:04:57.960> the<00:04:58.110> clamp<00:04:58.500> I

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
now and I'm just showing out the clamp I

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.220 
now and I'm just showing out the clamp I
do<00:04:58.770> when<00:04:59.250> I<00:04:59.280> redo<00:04:59.730> these<00:04:59.940> Souls<00:05:00.230> basically

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
do when I redo these Souls basically

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.810 
do when I redo these Souls basically
what<00:05:01.380> I<00:05:01.410> do<00:05:01.500> is<00:05:01.800> just<00:05:01.830> ball<00:05:02.220> up<00:05:02.400> some<00:05:02.610> paper

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
what I do is just ball up some paper

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.150 
what I do is just ball up some paper
towels<00:05:03.210> place<00:05:03.990> them<00:05:04.200> the<00:05:04.290> over<00:05:04.530> the<00:05:04.650> area<00:05:04.980> that

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
towels place them the over the area that

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.010 
towels place them the over the area that
needs<00:05:05.310> pressure<00:05:05.730> and<00:05:06.090> then<00:05:06.270> tie<00:05:06.540> them<00:05:06.690> tightly

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
needs pressure and then tie them tightly

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.290 
needs pressure and then tie them tightly
with<00:05:07.410> some<00:05:07.590> shoelaces<00:05:08.040> and<00:05:08.430> that's<00:05:08.910> about<00:05:09.120> it

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
with some shoelaces and that's about it

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.670 
with some shoelaces and that's about it
yeah<00:05:09.510> all<00:05:09.720> right<00:05:09.900> yet<00:05:10.020> so<00:05:10.140> the<00:05:10.260> next<00:05:10.530> step

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
yeah all right yet so the next step

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.380 
yeah all right yet so the next step
we're<00:05:10.800> going<00:05:10.890> to<00:05:10.950> go<00:05:11.010> ahead<00:05:11.220> and<00:05:11.430> do<00:05:11.610> is<00:05:11.820> remove

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
we're going to go ahead and do is remove

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.240 
we're going to go ahead and do is remove
the<00:05:12.600> ankle<00:05:13.050> creases<00:05:13.530> right<00:05:13.560> here<00:05:13.770> in<00:05:14.100> the

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
the ankle creases right here in the

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.490 
the ankle creases right here in the
ankle<00:05:14.640> area<00:05:14.850> this<00:05:15.600> other<00:05:15.810> is<00:05:15.990> really<00:05:16.200> really

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
ankle area this other is really really

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.980 
ankle area this other is really really
soft<00:05:16.890> as<00:05:17.160> you<00:05:17.250> know<00:05:17.430> these<00:05:17.640> are<00:05:17.820> from<00:05:18.150> 2000<00:05:18.900> so

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
soft as you know these are from 2000 so
