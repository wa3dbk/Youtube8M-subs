00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.519 
to fold an origami duck begin with a
square<00:00:05.700> piece<00:00:05.940> of<00:00:05.970> paper<00:00:06.120> with<00:00:06.899> a<00:00:06.930> card<00:00:07.319> side

square piece of paper with a card side
down<00:00:07.770> so<00:00:08.040> that<00:00:08.250> you<00:00:08.340> have<00:00:08.460> a<00:00:08.490> colored<00:00:08.790> duck<00:00:09.230> to

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
down so that you have a colored duck to

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.070 
down so that you have a colored duck to
make<00:00:10.349> your<00:00:10.469> first<00:00:10.679> fold<00:00:11.210> make<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.450> diagonal

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
make your first fold make a diagonal

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.049 
make your first fold make a diagonal
fold<00:00:13.400> across<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.549> square

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
fold across the square

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.450 
fold across the square
by<00:00:15.599> taking<00:00:15.809> one<00:00:16.109> corner<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.680> making<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.279> lie

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
by taking one corner and making it lie

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.000 
by taking one corner and making it lie
exactly<00:00:17.789> on<00:00:18.240> top<00:00:18.690> of<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:19.439> other<00:00:19.619> corner

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
exactly on top of the other corner

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.330 
exactly on top of the other corner
opposite<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.769> try<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.830> be<00:00:22.980> as<00:00:23.070> neat<00:00:23.250> as

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
opposite it try to be as neat as

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.460 
opposite it try to be as neat as
possible<00:00:23.400> if<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.539> make<00:00:24.720> your<00:00:24.960> fold<00:00:25.199> sloppy

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
possible if you make your fold sloppy

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.349 
possible if you make your fold sloppy
you'll<00:00:25.980> end<00:00:26.160> up<00:00:26.279> with<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.670> sloppy<00:00:27.150> duck<00:00:28.039> unfold

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
you'll end up with a sloppy duck unfold

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:31.759 
you'll end up with a sloppy duck unfold
our<00:00:30.359> next<00:00:30.630> fold<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:30.960> called<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.260> kite<00:00:31.470> fold

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
our next fold is called the kite fold

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.650 
our next fold is called the kite fold
that<00:00:32.160> means<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.610> take<00:00:32.790> one<00:00:33.239> edge<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.540> the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
that means you take one edge of the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.510 
that means you take one edge of the
square<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.200> lie<00:00:34.320> on<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.649> diagonal<00:00:35.250> crease

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
square to lie on that diagonal crease

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:45.950 
square to lie on that diagonal crease
you<00:00:35.700> just<00:00:35.760> made<00:00:41.540> like<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:43.340> do<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.520> same<00:00:44.780> on<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
you just made like so do the same on the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:54.830 
you just made like so do the same on the
other<00:00:46.110> side

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.130 

when<00:00:55.840> you're<00:00:55.989> done<00:00:56.290> you<00:00:57.040> should<00:00:57.070> have<00:00:57.520> a<00:00:58.140> kite

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
when you're done you should have a kite

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.530 
when you're done you should have a kite
shaped<00:00:59.970> object<00:01:01.020> which<00:01:02.020> is<00:01:03.000> called<00:01:04.000> the<00:01:04.210> kite

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
shaped object which is called the kite

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.690 
shaped object which is called the kite
base<00:01:04.900> I<00:01:05.470> wonder<00:01:06.369> why<00:01:07.800> anyway<00:01:08.800> it'd<00:01:08.920> take<00:01:09.159> the

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
base I wonder why anyway it'd take the

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.290 
base I wonder why anyway it'd take the
skinny<00:01:10.030> point<00:01:10.570> of<00:01:10.900> your<00:01:11.259> kite<00:01:11.530> base<00:01:11.770> and<00:01:12.300> fold

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
skinny point of your kite base and fold

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.660 
skinny point of your kite base and fold
it<00:01:13.420> up<00:01:13.540> to<00:01:14.110> where<00:01:14.320> the<00:01:14.710> original<00:01:15.100> two<00:01:15.250> corners

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
it up to where the original two corners

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
it up to where the original two corners
of<00:01:15.729> the<00:01:15.790> square<00:01:16.140> meet<00:01:17.430> which<00:01:18.430> would<00:01:18.670> be<00:01:18.880> right

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
of the square meet which would be right

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.090 
of the square meet which would be right
here<00:01:21.270> taking<00:01:22.270> that<00:01:22.390> same<00:01:22.630> point<00:01:23.050> fold<00:01:23.770> it<00:01:23.890> down

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
here taking that same point fold it down

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.120 
here taking that same point fold it down
just<00:01:24.399> a<00:01:24.520> little<00:01:24.759> ways<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:26.619> don't<00:01:26.800> need<00:01:26.920> to<00:01:27.039> be

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
just a little ways you don't need to be

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.859 
just a little ways you don't need to be
exact<00:01:27.520> there's<00:01:27.759> no<00:01:27.910> reference<00:01:28.330> point<00:01:28.630> just

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
exact there's no reference point just

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.540 
exact there's no reference point just
fold<00:01:29.080> it<00:01:29.170> down<00:01:29.320> a<00:01:29.380> little<00:01:29.530> bit<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:31.600> that<00:01:32.550> turn

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
fold it down a little bit like that turn

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.340 
fold it down a little bit like that turn
over<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:35.140> want<00:01:35.320> to<00:01:35.380> fold<00:01:35.560> this<00:01:35.830> in<00:01:36.130> half<00:01:37.350> like

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
over you want to fold this in half like

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.990 
over you want to fold this in half like
so<00:01:39.270> here's<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.420> fun<00:01:40.660> part<00:01:41.009> take<00:01:42.009> this<00:01:42.220> point

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
so here's the fun part take this point

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.300 
so here's the fun part take this point
grasp<00:01:43.390> it<00:01:43.600> and<00:01:43.750> slide<00:01:44.619> it<00:01:44.740> up<00:01:44.860> just<00:01:45.100> a<00:01:45.280> little

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
grasp it and slide it up just a little

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.370 
grasp it and slide it up just a little
bit<00:01:46.170> like<00:01:47.170> that<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.610> then<00:01:49.060> take<00:01:49.330> this<00:01:50.020> point

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
bit like that and then take this point

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.830 
bit like that and then take this point
which<00:01:50.560> is<00:01:50.710> a<00:01:50.740> beak<00:01:51.039> and<00:01:51.850> slide<00:01:52.149> it<00:01:52.270> out<00:01:52.479> just

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
which is a beak and slide it out just

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:00.710 
which is a beak and slide it out just
like<00:01:52.960> you<00:01:53.020> did<00:01:53.320> with<00:01:53.440> a<00:01:53.500> neck<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:57.599> voila

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.099 

here<00:02:01.720> is<00:02:01.959> your<00:02:02.259> completed<00:02:02.709> duck
