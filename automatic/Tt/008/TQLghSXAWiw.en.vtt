00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.960
 hello everybody, everything good 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:10.250
 today we will have the episode 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.250
 lost of flapjack 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.349
 We all know flip jack that 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.899
 boy the blond hair of the cartoon 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.370
 network always annoying the captain 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:39.190
 phalanx and such 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.949
 well for those who do not know the episode 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.220
 animators left outside the area and 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:47.290
 very disturbing black jack was 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.839
 canceled a short time ago and the 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.290
 animators asking to close the series with 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:56.110
 the shocking episode but did they 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.570
 made a copy of the final episode but 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.010
 did not launch because the drawing was seen 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.860
 by a small audience 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.580
 coincidentally I was in the middle of this 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.650
 group meeting the animators and he 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.170
 led to a special exhibition 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.580
 but what I saw was completely 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.180
 imaginable 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.470
 the cartoon started normally 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.900
 with the introduction and such 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:24.400
 the title card for the episode was 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:26.200
 kurt by lep g just plain text 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.450
 with black background 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.100
 instead of a silly song in lively 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.810
 when showing the title card 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.240
 there was no sound 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.500
 only the weak whisper I could not 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.470
 understand south 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:42.250
 but I think I said to God repeatedly 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.950
 lep jack beginning of episode showed 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.590
 sectec jumping around the dock 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.060
 then the phalanx captain prevents him from 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.540
 say something Latin 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.750
 from what I could understand he had said 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.159
 substitute 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:00.250
 the course was internalized which means 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:02.770
 to go on the dock so well that 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.479
 I had learned Latin high school but 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.120
 I was wondering why the hell 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.610
 they would have done it 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.040
 suddenly knows already that he begins to laugh at 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.200
 a very scary way, and then 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.519
 looks at the captain a very 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.190
 empty 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:21.760
 looked and swam toward them 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:24.700
 and when he arrives, he asked quietly what 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.170
 It's happening around here, you phalanx. 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.370
 you are teaching what you know is that you should 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.549
 do 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.280
 and starts laughing a lot maniac Feb 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.480
 jec looked very sad bubble starts to 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.659
 shout at the captain 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:40.450
 parents to laugh next every 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:43.390
 drawing characters have stopped 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.659
 everything was silent black jack looks 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.209
 to the screen an empty look then until 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:52.150
 remained static for 10 seconds 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.190
 The scene then goes back to the jetty 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.709
 ran towards the candy store 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.650
 how very sad depressive appearance 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.230
 in his face he enters the candy store and 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.250
 there was nobody there it was all dark 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.940
 and suddenly Jack sits down and starts to 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.519
 cry 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.890
 then for Luis Mint leaves the room of the 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:16.030

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.849

 face very nervous and dismiss the expression 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.970
 from him I shiver even to the hairs of my 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.310
 back 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.349
 he then ran out of the store 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.780
 Candy towards the wharf 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:29.739
 The captain was sitting on the bench in 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.069
 sea front 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:35.709

 Then he looks at the phalanx and shouts. 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.349
 with a desperate voice 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.450

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.829
 Is wrong with you? 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.840

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:08.200
 I've seen in my life. 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:11.470
 one of the citizens says it's too late 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.359
 the doctor looks flapjack and finally says in 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.079
 a very low voice 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:18.669
 he is dead all citizens are 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.560
 drooping heads 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.169
