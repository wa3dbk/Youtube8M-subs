00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.689
 yes 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:36.850
 hi friends youtuber os i am your friend 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.510
 na look in this video tutorial les 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.550
 I will teach how to draw on the paint ulsa and 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.950
 I made this video with the greatest effort 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:47.559
 possible and I will be brief I hope you 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.590
 understand without saying more 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:53.890
 let's start first that nothing opens its 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.200
 painting and I will teach them to draw on 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.110
 the easy way since the difficult one is not yet 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.270
 I learn it well my easy way to draw 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.150
 is to highlight over an image 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.730
 already done I used to not 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.670
 copy images draw them by hand and 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:13.000
 pass them to my laptop but they will decide 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.130
 you once opened your paint in the 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.740
 the upper left corner is the 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.770
 file option you click and put in 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.290
 open by doing so this will appear 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.110
 window go to the folder where they have 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.920
 the image you want to highlight selection 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.280
 in the and open the I choose this one 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.200
 as you will see it looks very small as above 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.930
 of the image comes the option of 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.810
 size percentage make it great for 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.970
 can see it well then to start 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.070
 remark do not do it in the image 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.009
 original for that on the left 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.470
 below select the line layer option 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.140
 world now yes to start remarking 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.210
 just use line word select the 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.000
 color they will use for the edges of the 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.189
 drawing I use the black selection in 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.759
 curve in the tools and the size of 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:05.460
 the line and already begin to highlight them 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.590
 I will say how it is highlighted just click and 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.840
 in the next curve, click again 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.000
 and so when I finish in a place of in 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.760
 two clicks in a row and the line will end 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.280
 now I will give you a note at the moment 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.470
 highlight if the original image does not 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.170
 lets see very well where the lines are 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.090
 that will highlight selection in the layer 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.269
 1 which is the original and in opacity 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.760
 lower it to 72 percent and you will see 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:32.069
 the image clearer here you will see a 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.810
 example of the opacity the before and the 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.940
 then see what difference 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.760
 I recommend that at the time of 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.640
 draw the eyes if they are anime type 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.920
 drawing with the pen tool once 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.319
 that they finish highlighting their character or 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.569
 drawing will use the tool 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.940
 pressure and selecting it will appear 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.880
 these green and yellow dots in the 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.370
 drawing if they enlarge it they will see better the 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.280
 small dots serve to grab them and make 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.590
 the thinnest or thickest line if not 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.540
 move to the right will be thicker and the 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.760
 left thinner 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.120
 I usually do more thin lines 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.340
 how thick some could be like 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.080
 wrinkles of the hand those of the clothes 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.319
 hair or the folds of 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:20.080
 joints and when making thick they would be 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.209
 like those of a long line once 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.670
 already have ready the re-marked for 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.250
 start painting remove the background but do not 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.190
 delete it just remove the eye of the 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.500
 layer that they want to disappear now for 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.410
 paint they will use another layer now they 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.540
 will click on the new layer and always 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.730
 paint a new character that will dry 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.620
 I will paint more in the future I open another 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.959
 canvas to store the colors there 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.510
 if they want to do it as I do this 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.730
 they open and then again they can 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.060
 put on your new canvas a name of 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.489
 cover as I the squares above 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.310
 they show several colored bars the most 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.079
 used is that of the rainbow circle but 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.780
 if it's about colors you're going to do 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:05.049
 dark or lighter use the bars 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.720
 h sv to save the colors can 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:10.120
 Do small specks in a row can 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.489
 put in a line the different parts 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.489
 of the character like me that I put those of 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:18.609
 hair followed I always put the color 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:20.739
 solid the shadow and the light reflection if 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.320
 they want to use another color again 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.479
 they are no longer using just grab the 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.699
 color selector tool and denle 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:30.070
 click on the color you want to have again 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:33.460
 can make rows of colors like 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:35.420
 hair skin eyes clothes even the 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.580
 mouth and his teeth 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.130
 and now to start painting 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.440
 selection line work layer and grab 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.690
 the magic wand tool and go 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.090
 to the place where they will paint the first 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.490
 place that I select is the hair 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.800
 You can also use the tool 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.930
 selection if they are mistaken of place of 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.750
 selection they run the wrong thing with the 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.610
 selection draft once finished 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.580
 to select what you are going to paint with 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.740
 the same color go to layer 2 and in 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.650
 mode change from none to multiply 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.870
 once changed use the pen 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.960
 with a large brush size like the 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.300
 100 or 200 now for the shadows and 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.460
 Reflections of light The technique is the same 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.650
 just grab the color of the shadow and 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:22.280
 use the airbrush tool and 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.500
 go down read the density as to 30% and 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.930
 start painting with a brush more 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.510
 small the shadow and then the reflection 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.030
 of light and once finished in this case 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:34.310
 the hair goes to the york line and erases the 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.100
 Selection selection elsewhere for 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.470
 paint go to layer 2 and paint it with 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:42.060
 the same technique as the hair for 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.700
 paint always uses the same technique 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:47.280
 already when you finish it to save it you 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:49.620
 you go to file and put save as if 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.380
 you want the background to be transparent 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:56.220
 you put in png file and you give it in the 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:58.320
 option 32 ppp to rgb remember that in this 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.350
 file type everything white 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.330
 It will be transparent so I recommend you 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:05.520
 that what goes to white like the eyes or 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:08.190
 your teeth paint it one more white 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.430
 low if you do not want it with the background 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:14.550
 transparent just save it in jpg 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:17.040
 put a name and save it well that 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:19.260
