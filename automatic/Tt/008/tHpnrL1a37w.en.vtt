a<00:02:03.460> new<00:02:03.580> chapter<00:02:03.820> though<00:02:04.149> that<00:02:04.390> it's<00:02:04.689> a<00:02:04.810> club

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
a new chapter though that it's a club

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.170 
a new chapter though that it's a club
sort<00:02:05.200> of<00:02:05.259> clean<00:02:05.500> slate<00:02:05.860> in<00:02:06.040> a<00:02:06.100> way<00:02:06.250> yeah<00:02:06.789> I<00:02:06.820> feel

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
sort of clean slate in a way yeah I feel

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.699 
sort of clean slate in a way yeah I feel
like<00:02:07.299> this<00:02:07.509> show<00:02:07.840> will<00:02:08.020> probably<00:02:08.319> lead<00:02:08.500> us

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
like this show will probably lead us

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.440 
like this show will probably lead us
into<00:02:09.100> a<00:02:09.310> new<00:02:09.819> direction

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
into a new direction

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.120 
into a new direction
but<00:02:10.690> it's<00:02:10.840> just<00:02:11.110> a<00:02:11.200> continuation<00:02:11.650> of<00:02:12.010> a

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
but it's just a continuation of a

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.460 
but it's just a continuation of a
similar<00:02:12.520> attitude<00:02:12.730> I<00:02:13.180> think<00:02:13.209> an<00:02:13.750> evolutionary

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
similar attitude I think an evolutionary

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.330 
similar attitude I think an evolutionary
leap<00:02:14.819> through<00:02:15.819> you<00:02:16.000> to<00:02:16.120> judge
