00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello here is your everything and everyone 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.269
 hate always highly motivated 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.790
 favorite commentator wapiti's for that 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.799
 is known for being incredibly brutal 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.500
 good aiming is mega gross good 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:21.029
 understanding of the game and especially for his 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.859
 about crass gameplay and of course for 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.289
 his kindness towards others 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.210
 I am a call of duty player 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.510
 known to the people who do not know me 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.820
 know 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.579
 and yes this is a gameplay as 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.860
 I have aiming killstreaks here 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.030
 first reached on the zero 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.940
 still not like you all the time 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.300
 but you will not have it then 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.260
 the escorting without the the the the go 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.520
 there and the dogs that was actually 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.200
 actually the most important thing about the gameplay 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.180
 the class itself is no matter of the rp7 with 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.070
 silencers and quickly pull though 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.930
 The weapons do not make so many kills anyway 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.340
 So maybe I'm fifteen or so 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.219
 so no idea the rest makes c4 and 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.060
 kills so I have ne 115 of the children 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:09.240
 Now it works and I have a 28er 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.840
 weapons series so no nuclear I have 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.130
 I do not have one 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.810
 I will probably never get it 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.630
 because I never synonymous with drone camera or 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.040
 blackboard so play on it and well 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.330
 I too much later 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.409
 I never stay long in lobbies and yes 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.960
 that's probably what I'm called 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.740
 about 15 to 20 kills if anything 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.350
 yes with the mp 7 and otherwise I would be 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.530
 actually only wild through the area and 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.850
 for example now she already has 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.990
 actually that 's pretty blatant 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.579
 play sc four or just always 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.049
 stronger in the 2 the four flies 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.810
 about half a meter wide then 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.090
 just explodes almost nothing 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.470
 ok then in black ops 2 c4 flies all the way 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.869
 good explodes well too 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.920
 either three then one more 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.409
 a little better is really funny 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.850
 flown his disabled with leprosy 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.560
 he should be thrown there will be a 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.140
 use arm fall apart or 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.700
 so funny is that flown nothing 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.670
 against leprosy ill i am i feel with 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.560
 you brother brothers peace anyway 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.360
 and he is in the buy himself 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.770
 just let half meppen that 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.410
 also the half- map to go in the air 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.120
 and thereby a shit many kills 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:16.020
 especially in the community 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:20.340
 combination with the park which in the 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.349
 second few slot is yes and from 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.489
 so it's actually pretty funny 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.349
 or actually a bit 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.739
 shit what you make here for games 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:33.120
 can weapons without real effort 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:36.420
 kills cool or why why because 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.440
 also boring weapons kills but me 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.640
 I do not have any guts anymore 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.200
 but to play gameplay where I am then 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.540
 with drone control black at 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.280
 go in because I always think so 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.989
 now comes raid domination there could 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.550
 I still theoretical gameplay play 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.920
 then that will correct killstreaks 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.510
 with mostly blackbird dog before 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.730
 I can not reach there with just then 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.530
 I'm pissed witte out thinking thinks 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.220
 suicide or so on you can 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.599
 you like to use a round think for a moment 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.269
 attack a bit do not understand 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.610
 then suicides and suicide 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.840
 then I'll search again and think summer 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.760
 go again with tricks 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.530
 and then comes and then I brought 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.930
 war with yours does not reach rage 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.909
 think of hanging on and keep it up 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.760
 that's it's a shit circle run 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:20.280
 unfortunately can not do anything against 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.050
 but yes no idea because I do not like that anyway 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.049
 really really plays black 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.159
 ops 2 currently playing on the weekend 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.530
 I walk a lot because of that 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:33.750
 greatest luxury but well for hama 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.159
 what should I say now no 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.049
 idea 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:39.659
 So that's my highest kdg play 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:43.110
 with 117 to one I have no higher one 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:47.370
 second highest is now 75 to 1 or else 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.989
 I go more and more death and users 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.159
 by the way, I have a few 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.349
 other good gameplay for example in 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:55.560
 yukon gameplay what loosen 170 km 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:58.379
 gameplay could have been but luck 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.939
 is on my side friends yes and no 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.680
 mw2 live commentary I also earlier 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:04.909
 i've got myself almost 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.830
 my village blew up 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.760
 and I was just before his little one 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.170
 letter to write as 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:15.989
 Newspaper article letters so i have 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.759
 your son then I am within the 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.440
 next few days the parents of the 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.970
 The guy had sent me then 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.690
 consistently refund 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:26.520
 game and yes that so clever and the 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.770
 just kidnapped before and then no 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.270
 I had never suspected of female killing 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.610
 Ransom demanded or so I know 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.410
 not even see what way it is a 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.630
 been brief would be what is still cool so 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.230
 could market on youtube so blatantly 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.030
 abduction action baywa petit who knows 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:47.490
 and now comes right bad moment 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:50.310
 now for now no no no no no 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.380
 I have 50 raise in the game 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.080
 player can play team almost like that 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.930
 the howling inside is really bad 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:00.570
 what happens and what happens to everyone 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.520
 already go and only the appetite of 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.780
 is of course excluded and at 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.010
 It takes a sign to see it 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.970
 so cool from a hall has killstreaks 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.840
 little if that down there so nice 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.880
 lit and you know exactly dearest 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:15.870
 Two minutes I would be very many kills 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.590
 do it and sometimes it is natural 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.600
 also so that you can stay a little bit longer 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.300
 So child makes me think so 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.560
 bullshit that's normal 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.669
 shit what I was in the 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.020
 wanted to say 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.400
 we'll come back to that and 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.350
 I will not get a box here 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.810
 cut something out where I am so 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.890
 completely bullshit moderately publishers with it 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.020
 somehow probably addressed 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.880
 my mother or so easy the song 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.580
 changed on itunes or something but 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.479
 I'll be lucky for a moment 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.000
 of course that when i died 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.350
 But I'm completely normal now comes yet 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.240
 on this topic old now directs then 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.890
 not even from abastard age so old 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.940
 what I wanted to say 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.080
 I've had that at some time recently 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.530
 the commentators I do not remember 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.600
 better if it maybe not 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.180
 Anyway, if I like 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.760
 always very often say whatever 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.440
 is it that I'm so close to him that way 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.610
 said it's good a bad one 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.870
 to be playing better one 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.160
 I'm a bad player 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.720
 I thought so too and that's it too 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.410
 which I have always preached 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:13.350
 somehow had written a comment 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:16.770
 pull up your nose and that if you 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:18.419
 is reasonably good player and really 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.970
 well above the average 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:23.070
 and that's what I'm really got then 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.140
 really little fun in the game before 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.910
 especially if you play alone so 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:28.260
 in that I got better, I had 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.640
 no longer bothering to play with others 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.440
 That's how it comes alone 

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.180
 play 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.830
 in that I got better and more 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.780
 idea of game get more idea 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.300
 generally shooters and more means 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.250
 I generally got gaming from everyone 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.630
 death was the choice of any death 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.490
 undeserved that was not everyone 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.530
 is required and therefore deserves 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:50.010
 really so indeed no fun I 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:51.570
 my for serious and yes it stirs 

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:54.300
 just stop when you really are 

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:57.360
 it's a little bit good and it really is 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.110
 not not not cool actually as the 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.400
 means if you like that a bit 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.870
 worse is for casual and easy 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.700
 only fun plays there it is really good 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.080
 I do not play anymore I'm out 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.970
 just play it out in the gameplay 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.770
 earn playplays 

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:10.710
 that is the only reason for me 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:13.380
 actually meanwhile that a bit 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:14.250
 sad but no idea i see 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.630
 no sense in it when I for example 

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:17.220
 a fund form at the very beginning of 

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:21.510
 then I know that will play gameplay 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:22.850
 nothing in the gameplay goes out and stuff like that 

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:25.620
 that is with me 

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.700
 and yes I do not know why I have 

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.290
 also less fun at play 

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.550
 that's why not say I have black ops 

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:31.350
 2 is a bad game which is 

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:34.770
 In my opinion really apart 

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:36.180
 of every dead or is so entirely on 

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:38.100
 Their relationship to that is said to everyone 

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.240
 it really is in my opinion 

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.770
 a bad game due to hit 

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.510
 box connection blablabla et cetera et 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:44.610
 cetera 

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.900
 and when it comes mostly cherry 

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.220
 People are next full of the good game 

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.140
 I was that fun I was there 

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.190
 Do not look so far behind and with that 

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:54.450
 I do not necessarily mean denser now 

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:54.750
 from the monitor but you where else what 

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:57.660
 always 

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:59.040
 Anyway, I hope I like it 

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:00.570
 is it totally renova and 

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:03.000
 probably every third in the 

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:06.260
 comments are written by Hofburg 

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.490
 I was not or will be 

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:10.860
 yes I hope you liked it 

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:15.500
 again while I treat myself now 

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:18.500
 another nice buttercream lasagne 

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.500
 well
