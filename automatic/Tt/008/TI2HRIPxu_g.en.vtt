00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:12.750
 feel like doing new videos for 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.210
 finally, numerous columns and today 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.359
 I will do something specifically 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.130
 referring to the elena tips section is me 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.260
 came to mind the other day yes 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.689
 premix only in the bathroom I get me 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.609
 Whale in the minds of these things my 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.750
 trick that I use practically from 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:34.260
 I always always take so much for granted 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.640
 I'm dying to give volume to the roots 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.500
 of hair 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.590
 I don't know if you know it but surely 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.660
 many of you know it already above all 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.420
 that has been following me for some time 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.899
 I have curly hair but not a hedgehog 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.289
 drink an undefined kinky curly e 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.860
 especially in forms here to cuddle 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:59.100
 we say and therefore especially during 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.109
 winter i smooth hair melis shot 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.539
 because I feel more comfortable with me 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.659
 same for the various our reasons of 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.590
 our various women's whistles here and there 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.909
 so I use the plate and hair dryer 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.860
 unfortunately I know that my hair is ruined 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.729
 but I feel more at ease like that 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.560
 But here it is and what to do what 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.240
 when using a plate for example 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.030
 flat like this 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.659
 the risk you run is to do 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.090
 just the very flat hair effect 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.460
 tendon a qualcomm and use yes 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.470
 they used a little as they used in the 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.450
 years that were the 90s in which yes 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.150
 they used to crush my hair 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.310
 school do you remember that then in reality 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.659
 they were only good for some why 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.729
 also depends a little on the 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.880
 face conformation 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.700
 then I don't lose myself in the talk I go 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.220
 my plate that you have already seen me 2,300 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.579
 times in my various videos and this is the 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.770
 infrared controls of ninety that there was 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:03.689
 honored by Rowenta herself 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:05.050
 when I did the event the short one of the 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.760
 tutorial 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.660
 so what easy, for example, here 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:13.300
 this part of hair where it is 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.430
 all squashed on here practically 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.730
 then wash your hair two days ago 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.370
 I'm already in the fad phase then yes 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.440
 part from behind you see given me 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.420
 approached so you can see better not 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.750
 notice my white hair because 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.290
 I have someone who always ticks all the 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.020
 days 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.390
 do things that I would talk about grizzled 25 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.240
 years so think for a moment how it is 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:41.260
 put my genetic stock then I leave 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.060
 from here, the upper lock la 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.380
 ciocca we say problematic between 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:49.890
 quotes with my flat plate the 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:54.670
 I take the root and then what I do 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.350
 pull towards how can I say the part 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:02.950
 lower than the back of the 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:04.900
 head and see that you already see we do 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.340
 the mirror also comes from here 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.340
 I'm doing with the screen 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:17.380
 you see that more beautiful so done a little 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:21.330
 more otherwise you can always do 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.680
 now here I have very little hair so here 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:29.200
 you can do the same procedure as 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:33.330
 before or otherwise you can do more 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:36.400
 however this is difficult to rotate and then down 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.840
 see, however, you have a slight effect 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.020
 different 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.670
 now here I sky this part always here 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.770
 fight a little because under the hair 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.680
 broken that keep me up practically 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:49.480
 but we also do the other side 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.900
 like these videos a lot 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:58.090
 confidential we say so 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:06.269
 and let's start from here this ciocchetti 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:06.269
 nacua and I also go back here 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.270
 see how it changes already how beautiful the 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:26.380
 up this effect if I do n't insist 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:26.380
 meanwhile ok also here and back 

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:40.409
 then he defends a moment from you from what 

00:04:35.649 --> 00:04:40.409
 you want to do them more swollen 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:58.260
 just to give a little bit of volume then 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:02.270
 you can very well play the net today 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:04.080
 turn your row move it do it 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:09.050
 all wrong 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.050
 maybe cover some spots on the forehead 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:18.870
 see how already different then another 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.520
 secret is definitely inflate too 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.940
 this part down here 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.100
 oh well that one can do a maybe a 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.780
 video tutorial on the bloated effect 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.090
 obviously if you want this to remain 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.970
 effect a little bit of mud and lacquer 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:36.210
 proceed with what you prefer 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.860
 kate moss effect is called boys 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.140
 this is very simple, of course 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.150
 phone book really includes videos 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:45.600
 very short fast they are small 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:48.360
