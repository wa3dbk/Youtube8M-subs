00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello love hot stocks friends 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.299
 Welcome to the first word stocks 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.980
 video on this channel so to that 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.780
 first word stocks video that I now 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.610
 could pick up properly and where 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.710
 I do not use trailer material 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.630
 Today I have to show you to warm 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.090
 first six different tail 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.740
 possibilities around the world of hot 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.539
 to influence stocks 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.550
 otherwise there is still a short 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.900
 first impression and if you already that 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.800
 played game you write please 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.840
 in the comments 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.730
 which console you play on and how 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.840
 he finds it so far in the next 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.059
 days I still find finally 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.559
 More time for more words and floor 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.930
 right now gta videos too here 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.290
 So do people stay tuned now goes 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.480
 But first off if I so on pc 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.070
 Stink like the taste me then 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.640
 you can easily solve the problem 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.910
 remedy 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.539
 this because there are many so 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.579
 explosive devices in the city of me 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.170
 do not know where the explosives 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.489
 is that can be ignited 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.020
 maybe such an underground one 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.969
 gas pipe or something in the 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.920
 direction you can in any case 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.559
 different things in the game world in 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.390
 chase the air 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.100
 that the npcs in rottstock is not the 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.960
 You can also be cleverest at the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.610
 You can recognize these traffic lights 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.610
 also hedge and state by one 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.799
 cause mass harvest because 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.110
 somehow to make nonsense 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.250
 that other people are equal to the boys 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.930
 retracting crossing 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.110
 but well, there are some 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.759
 funny situation arise in the book 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.009
 how seen in many trailers 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.189
 you can also have such roads 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.619
 bollards from the ground would have that 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.530
 different locations in the game world 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.600
 as you can see it also cars 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.549
 let overturn even if the 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.350
 Delivery van a pretty relaxed here 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.090
 it seems that his dare on the 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.649
 head lies and goes on without 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.509
 that it really itches him too 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.159
 other passers-by are not so 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.909
 done by the sweeping 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.860
 delivery trucks 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.299
 In addition, you can hedge the railway 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.829
 So stop trains and get them back 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.540
 Let's go let's have a nice time 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.369
 that would work in real life 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.920
 I I for my part have the 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.210
 missed train often and this is probably 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.610
 never happened the next 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.610
 Possibility to provide such street signs 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.170
 on the highway, for example, have the 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.790
 actually not a big benefit 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.290
 probably sooner 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.260
 such an easter egg metal funny 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.510
 sayings and the last possibility for 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.370
 this video I want to show you 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.800
 The bridges are also very common 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.990
 in chicago, you'll see how you react 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.630
 synonymous here the npcs I say one 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.220
 on it the garbage truck in front seems 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.250
 At least pretty much the orientation 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.470
 lost and then there comes 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.840
 no longer somehow down to everyone 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.920
 fall into the newest method around the world 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.540
 to change 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.640
 if you have more options 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.680
 that's not all there is to it 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.300
 such a hecking skill bombing where 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.010
 you keep getting new skills 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.080
 can unlock to hedge more 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.220
 to be able to write that in just 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.330
 the comments again maybe I 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.610
 another video with the 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.530
 remaining hecking possibilities it 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.209
 in the game that is as already said 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.740
 now short video so I ever times 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.850
 a little bit too much of a word, stick it up 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.560
 can show the channel 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.959
 otherwise my previous first 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.670
 impression is first so that's one 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:03.650
 solid play is in my opinion 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.300
 but for example against he goes as 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.130
 can not really befit 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.160
 that has a few reasons for example 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.340
 that it did not compare so well 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.260
 to be able to go yes because well me 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.540
 would say it is more of a kind 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.370
 Assassin's creed in the area 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.590
 you have to hedge freely and in these 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.810
 Areal further mini mission 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.400
 to unlock but at least that is 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.989
 campaign in my opinion actually 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.150
 at least the cool made quite cool 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.220
 previous commission in the stream 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.560
 Since we have already come to the 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.720
 Next thing I do in the week 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.370
 here almost any performance increase so 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.860
 if you see a little something 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.250
 with live commentary then just want 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.739
 stop by times occurs tv-talker 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.030
 couch also does not forget anymore 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.040
 comments to write the game 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.900
 So far, which console is bought 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.489
 and if you're up to those ultimately 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.019
 youtube then wants to look up too 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.970
 the sugar coach channel over the 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.650
 colleague for how coldplay that there 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.910
 namely, where I sometimes even one 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.799
 guest appearance will have 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.299
 Well, thank you 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:05.209
 watch this first word stocks 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:07.549
 video how about if we were the 30th 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:12.340
 could otherwise crack up to 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:12.340
 next video action shot
