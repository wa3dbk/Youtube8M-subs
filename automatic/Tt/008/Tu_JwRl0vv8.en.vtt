 Hello everyone and welcome to another one 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.690
 our enter.co videos where they 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.010
 We teach how to do several things today 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.930
 for example let's show them how 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.029
 configure the facebook version to the 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.830
 Colombian specific for our country 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.750
 with several elements and words of the 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.339
 changed interface to make chords 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.529
 the area to configure this we 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:27.470
 we go to our menu and settings 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:29.390
 here we choose language and we make sure 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.220
 that this Spanish but not any 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.850
 Spanish has to be specific Spanish 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:38.000
 from colombia so we headed there 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.739
 we keep the changes and from now on we are going to 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.839
 see the new elements reflected in 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.550
 our social network as for example in 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:45.289
 start time now says boot to 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.760
 side of our profile name we 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.379
 we go to our home and to 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.480
 ask what we are doing and what is 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.430
 our state now asks what is your 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.839
 Curiously roll one of the words 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.229
 which replaced facebook for this version 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:58.699
 they were the likes for bacano so 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:01.039
 on the page inside for example says that 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.289
 to 21 of my friends -among them it seems very 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.729
 bacano if we go to our profile 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.440
 staff let's see several changes 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.750
 also instead of work he will ask 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.539
 where you changed before and the name of the 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.159
 Friends is now partners in our 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:14.509
 mobile phone we can also appreciate 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.500
 all these changes we should only 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.450
 direct us to m.facebook.com and from there 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.740
 perform a series of steps very similar 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.259
 which we had made from 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.299
 our browser we go to configuration 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.640
 and we made sure that the language 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.740
 Colombian Spanish is selected 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.569
 We do have Spanish, Colombia 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.450
 so what remains is to see the 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:36.440
 terms that changed in this version 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.079
 if we go back to the main interface 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.630
 let's see what we have partners instead 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:44.869
 of friends and our groups 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.399
 patches in addition to that in the timeline 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.110
 principal instead of like here if 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.579
 we can appreciate that he asks us if we 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.710
 it seems bacano here we can say that 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.320
 this seems very bacano to us that bacano and 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.000
 to share says rotate it so 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.070
 We will defeat information to our 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.539
 good contacts this was all for today in
