00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 even then today I want to propose you one 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.950
 drink that you have already seen in the video 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.320
 previous where I demonstrated the 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.300
 bag of the bomb so yes 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.369
 call the balls the balls balls 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:19.920
 natural tapioca shot and we'll do 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.199
 today I show how I prepared the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.869
 mine is a bit faces it is not at all difficult 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.410
 he knows exactly what a little more complicated 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.359
 just find the bobba balls though 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.450
 you can easily succeed in 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.809
 find online or in some jean 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.870
 marc very much supplied or still 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.629
 better or in Rome in the Chinese area 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.059
 or in Milan's chinatown for sure 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.010
 there will be supermarkets where 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.300
 you can buy your bobba for 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.309
 because I loved these splints of two 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.510
 colors both black and what exactly 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:57.750
 that I have me or white or better 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.260
 colored small theoretical note the bubble 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:06.630
 of a drink in Chinese is called 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.580
 Nyjah that is precisely the milk and you is cia 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.799
 true sends me known by email 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.299
 especially Taiwan the trafficking and juan 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:18.030
 around the 90s, yes, yes, it is 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:20.490
 expanded all over the world in america 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.340
 well known in europe enough 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.830
 germany i know there is a fashion of its own 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.170
 d'elba faces and Italy clearly no 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.240
 it is still not nearly known at all 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.119
 hoping that some will start e 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.810
 spread because it is a fashion etc. 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.490
 but I really like it so much 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.619
 let's say a little curious about 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.570
 know how it will turn out that anyway 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.790
 this I salute you I leave the video and 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.159
 let me know our way you 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.109
 prepare the faces for soon countries em 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.679
 sorry for this recipe 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:56.619
 item the tapioca pearls that you can 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:59.969
 find in some at the market extremely 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.289
 provided or I took it online 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.630
 release however indiscretion also the 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.979
 site where I bought them I have not 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.920
 paid very little 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.170
 but I paid them a little but in the 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.420
 meaning if you find some offer 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.849
 part that is about to begin this 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.269
 of cane sugar or sugar 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:21.519
 normal tea bags 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.769
 if you want ginger is optional e 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:27.209
 if you want milk with the pan I have 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:31.590
 put some boiling water I will go to pour 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.590
 and my balls 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.100
 in days tapioca must remain 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.420
 slowly we have to keep them that way 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.230
 5 minutes approx 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:56.060
 so much water will die very soon 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.060
 meanwhile put the water to boil for tea 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:13.410
 then we removed the theme 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:16.560
 from the fire and now we put it 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:20.070
 sugar that actually and tapioca pellets 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.450
 not just caloric heaters and I was 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.980
 saying caloric 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.380
 but I am caloric what comes 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.650
 put into the tea right now there is 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:32.190
 who puts white sugar so many things 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:37.140
 in short, sweeteners or sugar 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:40.220
 cane because I only have this we turn a 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.700
 I put a little bit of ginger in it 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.090
 clearly optional 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.090
 but yes 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.160
 consistency if you ask me is 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.290
 soggy has a consistency 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.670
 the tapioca in the video is very special 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.400
 previous I showed you when I got 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:05.070
 discarded the package and or even tasted 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:07.610
 the tapioca we say is hard and it's not possible 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.610
 explain 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.770
 what a short spring 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.350
 expect 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:36.340
 the core ulissi but instead it was very hard 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.720
 when it's not cooked it's a little thumbs up thing 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.440
 Yes a little bit 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.970
 if how to explain this is his 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.230
 consistency so you may like it or not 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.400
 pleasure because to many this 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.560
 consistency doesn't like it bothers now 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.550
 what do we do 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:57.850
 I take a colander bye I see you yes bye 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:00.240
 I take a colander and in here 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:05.170
 and then the rinses in cold water 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:08.920
 ready your balls site here 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:10.270
 then we take our glasses ho 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.040
 you can take any glass you can't 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.960
 take glasses even truer more 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.120
 big plus we say even more 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:21.900
 but this seemed to me spectacular 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.900
 cute and i take this i put the balls 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.400
 here they are 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.050
 let's add our time 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.169
 here you see when it seems to you see less 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:44.699
 as long as you like 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:47.409
 and then if you really want to do it ad hoc 

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:50.319
 add a little milk I pezzotta 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:52.680
 this of rice because I am intolerant 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:52.680
 with lactose 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:14.510
 imola is ready, here he is clearly 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.580
 you can also use the risks of 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.660
 fruit you can use milk 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.660
 cold 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:22.490
 if you see these dots and ginger e 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.410
 written these other specks are the 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:27.230
 specks of my camera that 

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.430
 by now you know that it is stained and who 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.830
 other wanted to say you can too 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:33.890
 use milk ie the lands where 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:37.900
 you can use ice etc. 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:40.850
 the only thing missing is the typical le 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:42.470
 large straws that I can't 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.730
 really find no part of me 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.160
 I hope you enjoyed that you had 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.640
 did discover a new thing tell me if you 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.160
 like it 

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:52.520
 if you try it if you buy these 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.050
 balls and nothing with this anyway 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.160
 I greet you I will try to do also others 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.160
 recipes in this regard
