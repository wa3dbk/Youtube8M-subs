welcome<00:00:02.879> to<00:00:03.300> this<00:00:03.480> video<00:00:03.659> on<00:00:04.080> why<00:00:05.009> I<00:00:05.040> think

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
welcome to this video on why I think

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.550 
welcome to this video on why I think
managers<00:00:06.150> this<00:00:06.299> crease<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:06.720> chemistry<00:00:07.170> in

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
managers this crease the chemistry in

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.000 
managers this crease the chemistry in
your<00:00:07.919> ultimate<00:00:08.490> team<00:00:08.790> now<00:00:09.660> I<00:00:10.290> had<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.679> lot<00:00:10.980> of

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
your ultimate team now I had a lot of

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.339 
your ultimate team now I had a lot of
requests<00:00:11.429> for<00:00:11.490> this<00:00:11.730> video<00:00:12.059> I<00:00:12.360> really<00:00:13.259> don't

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
requests for this video I really don't

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.200 
requests for this video I really don't
know<00:00:13.469> whether<00:00:13.679> my<00:00:13.799> theories<00:00:14.370> valid<00:00:14.700> enough<00:00:14.940> or

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
know whether my theories valid enough or

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.849 
know whether my theories valid enough or
I'm<00:00:15.719> going<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.960> sound<00:00:16.109> like<00:00:16.230> an<00:00:16.379> absolute

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
I'm going to sound like an absolute

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.970 
I'm going to sound like an absolute
idiot<00:00:17.660> but<00:00:18.660> this<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.930> my<00:00:19.080> theory<00:00:19.350> this<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.770> what

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
idiot but this is my theory this is what

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.130 
idiot but this is my theory this is what
I've<00:00:20.070> always<00:00:20.189> gone<00:00:20.490> from<00:00:20.760> for<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.660> run<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.900> past

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
I've always gone from for a run the past

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.740 
I've always gone from for a run the past
few<00:00:22.289> months<00:00:22.410> now<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.910> you<00:00:23.910> know<00:00:24.060> this<00:00:24.269> you

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
few months now and you know this you

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.240 
few months now and you know this you
know<00:00:24.869> not<00:00:25.080> using<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.439> manager<00:00:25.740> has<00:00:25.830> really<00:00:26.099> paid

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
know not using a manager has really paid

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.490 
know not using a manager has really paid
off<00:00:26.310> for<00:00:26.430> me<00:00:26.670> I<00:00:27.180> felt<00:00:27.900> you<00:00:28.050> know<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.289> team

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
off for me I felt you know the team

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.929 
off for me I felt you know the team
plays<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.740> lot<00:00:28.980> more<00:00:29.130> better<00:00:29.250> than<00:00:29.369> with<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.699> cat

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
plays a lot more better than with a cat

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.569 
plays a lot more better than with a cat
with<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> manager<00:00:30.650> but<00:00:31.650> this<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:31.980> my<00:00:32.099> reason<00:00:32.279> why

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
with a manager but this is my reason why

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.850 
with a manager but this is my reason why
as<00:00:33.180> you<00:00:33.329> can<00:00:33.390> see<00:00:33.570> here<00:00:33.809> in<00:00:34.079> this<00:00:34.440> team<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.739> have

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
as you can see here in this team I have

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.650 
as you can see here in this team I have
nine<00:00:35.130> chemistry<00:00:35.730> on<00:00:35.910> every<00:00:36.180> single<00:00:36.300> player

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
nine chemistry on every single player

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.990 
nine chemistry on every single player
non<00:00:37.500> chemistry<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.129> maximum<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:38.879> can

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
non chemistry is a maximum that you can

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.310 
non chemistry is a maximum that you can
get<00:00:39.120> on<00:00:39.210> every<00:00:39.420> single<00:00:39.510> player<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:39.930> can't<00:00:40.170> get

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
get on every single player you can't get

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.709 
get on every single player you can't get
ten<00:00:41.059> chemistry<00:00:42.059> on<00:00:42.120> every<00:00:42.329> single<00:00:42.420> player

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
ten chemistry on every single player

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.119 
ten chemistry on every single player
because<00:00:42.899> then<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.230> know<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.680> will<00:00:43.829> go<00:00:43.950> up<00:00:43.980> to

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
because then you know it will go up to

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.619 
because then you know it will go up to
110<00:00:44.670> chemistry<00:00:45.590> but<00:00:46.590> basically<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:48.239> maximum

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
110 chemistry but basically the maximum

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.450 
110 chemistry but basically the maximum
chemistry<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.140> can<00:00:49.289> get<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.530> any<00:00:49.770> team<00:00:50.039> with<00:00:50.430> a

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
chemistry you can get on any team with a

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.580 
chemistry you can get on any team with a
manager<00:00:50.879> or<00:00:51.030> without<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.390> manager<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.960> at

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
manager or without a manager is at

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.010 
manager or without a manager is at
one-hundred<00:00:52.739> chemistry<00:00:53.629> obviously<00:00:54.629> without

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
one-hundred chemistry obviously without

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.170 
one-hundred chemistry obviously without
a<00:00:55.199> manager<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:56.070> can<00:00:56.190> only<00:00:56.280> get<00:00:56.460> 99<00:00:56.789> like<00:00:57.149> I

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
a manager you you can only get 99 like I

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.520 
a manager you you can only get 99 like I
said<00:00:57.859> but<00:00:58.859> my<00:00:59.840> theory<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:00.960> when<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.379> add<00:01:01.500> a

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
said but my theory is when you add a

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.889 
said but my theory is when you add a
manager<00:01:01.949> as<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.670> can<00:01:02.730> see<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.030> still<00:01:03.629> has<00:01:03.719> 9

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
manager as you can see this still has 9

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.710 
manager as you can see this still has 9
chemistry<00:01:04.700> on<00:01:05.700> every<00:01:06.030> single<00:01:06.150> player<00:01:06.450> even

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
chemistry on every single player even

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.770 
chemistry on every single player even
when<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:06.960> add<00:01:07.310> sir<00:01:08.310> alex<00:01:08.580> focusing<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.210> he<00:01:09.600> is

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
when I add sir alex focusing in he is

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.010 
when I add sir alex focusing in he is
you<00:01:10.020> know<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.229> correct<00:01:10.439> formation<00:01:11.090> and<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.780> he

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
you know the correct formation and so he

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.080 
you know the correct formation and so he
will<00:01:13.140> add<00:01:13.290> on<00:01:13.439> 10<00:01:13.619> chemistry<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.250> don't<00:01:14.970> know<00:01:15.030> if

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
will add on 10 chemistry I don't know if

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.660 
will add on 10 chemistry I don't know if
any<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.420> know<00:01:15.570> as<00:01:15.689> well<00:01:15.900> but<00:01:16.580> for<00:01:17.580> any

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
any of you know as well but for any

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.640 
any of you know as well but for any
players<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.720> your<00:01:18.810> team<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.170> match<00:01:19.380> their

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
players in your team that match their

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.890 
players in your team that match their
managers<00:01:20.070> nationality<00:01:20.790> that's<00:01:21.570> going<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.810> add

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
managers nationality that's going to add

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.130 
managers nationality that's going to add
on<00:01:22.080> another<00:01:22.520> plus-one<00:01:23.520> chemistry<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:24.930> for

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
on another plus-one chemistry so for

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.240 
on another plus-one chemistry so for
example<00:01:25.170> if<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.680> had<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:26.130> know<00:01:26.630> five<00:01:28.250> scotch

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
example if you had you know five scotch

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.499 
example if you had you know five scotch
blares<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.640> your<00:01:29.759> team<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.450> know<00:01:31.400> six

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
blares in your team and you know six

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.999 
blares in your team and you know six
random<00:01:33.509> other<00:01:33.720> nationalities<00:01:34.710> in<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.920> new

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
random other nationalities in the new

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.429 
random other nationalities in the new
added<00:01:35.250> man<00:01:35.630> Alex<00:01:36.630> focusing<00:01:36.990> into<00:01:37.140> your<00:01:37.259> team

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
added man Alex focusing into your team

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.530 
added man Alex focusing into your team
you<00:01:38.009> would<00:01:38.070> then<00:01:38.280> get<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.549> 15<00:01:39.030> chemistry

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
you would then get a 15 chemistry

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.510 
you would then get a 15 chemistry
because<00:01:39.720> 10<00:01:40.049> chemistry<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.740> just<00:01:41.250> for<00:01:41.460> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
because 10 chemistry is just for the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.340 
because 10 chemistry is just for the
manager<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.060> formation<00:01:42.570> being<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.259> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
manager and the formation being in the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.980 
manager and the formation being in the
correct<00:01:43.590> position<00:01:44.119> and<00:01:45.119> then<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.899> know

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
correct position and then you know

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.530 
correct position and then you know
obviously<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.409> plaza<00:01:46.619> 5<00:01:46.860> 45<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:48.299> scratch

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
obviously the plaza 5 45 of a scratch

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.170 
obviously the plaza 5 45 of a scratch
players<00:01:49.100> but<00:01:50.100> what<00:01:50.310> my<00:01:50.399> theory<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:50.759> when

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
players but what my theory is when

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.469 
players but what my theory is when
whenever<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.049> add<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.200> manager<00:01:52.619> into<00:01:52.920> a<00:01:52.950> team<00:01:53.189> I

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
whenever you add a manager into a team I

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.709 
whenever you add a manager into a team I
believe<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.290> know<00:01:55.409> has<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.369> have<00:01:56.719> has

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
believe that it you know has to have has

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.160 
believe that it you know has to have has
to<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.829> know<00:01:58.880> have<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.210> 10<00:02:00.450> chemistry<00:02:00.960> that

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
to you know have the 10 chemistry that

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.730 
to you know have the 10 chemistry that
it<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:01.619> there<00:02:01.920> for<00:02:02.250> all<00:02:03.500> you<00:02:04.500> know<00:02:04.590> obviously

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
it is there for all you know obviously

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.990 
it is there for all you know obviously
if<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.100> have<00:02:05.189> scratch<00:02:05.399> players<00:02:05.640> going<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.880> be

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
if you have scratch players going to be

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.290 
if you have scratch players going to be
more<00:02:06.119> whatever<00:02:06.509> whatever<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.439> like<00:02:07.619> but<00:02:07.950> I

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
more whatever whatever you like but I

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.190 
more whatever whatever you like but I
think<00:02:09.300> whenever<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.629> add<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.750> manager<00:02:10.140> it's

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
think whenever you add a manager it's

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.350 
think whenever you add a manager it's
just<00:02:10.440> going<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.649> bump<00:02:11.220> your<00:02:11.430> actual<00:02:12.060> player

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
just going to bump your actual player

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.790 
just going to bump your actual player
chemistry<00:02:13.080> down<00:02:13.620> to

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
chemistry down to

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.430 
chemistry down to
90<00:02:14.220> now<00:02:15.150> I'm<00:02:15.270> gonna<00:02:15.360> that's<00:02:16.050> obviously<00:02:16.350> going

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
90 now I'm gonna that's obviously going

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.560 
90 now I'm gonna that's obviously going
to<00:02:16.590> sound<00:02:16.740> incredibly<00:02:17.250> weird<00:02:17.550> but<00:02:18.540> I

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
to sound incredibly weird but I

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.850 
to sound incredibly weird but I
personally<00:02:19.260> believe<00:02:19.320> that<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:19.650> personally

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
personally believe that I personally

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.920 
personally believe that I personally
believe<00:02:20.040> that's<00:02:20.430> what<00:02:20.670> happened<00:02:21.030> happens

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
believe that's what happened happens

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.960 
believe that's what happened happens
when<00:02:22.500> you<00:02:22.590> add<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.710> manager<00:02:23.160> which<00:02:23.640> is<00:02:23.790> why<00:02:23.940> I

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
when you add a manager which is why I

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.600 
when you add a manager which is why I
kind<00:02:24.240> of<00:02:24.300> stray<00:02:24.510> away<00:02:24.630> from<00:02:24.750> using<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.230> manager

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
kind of stray away from using a manager

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.090 
kind of stray away from using a manager
only<00:02:26.610> if<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:26.760> really<00:02:27.540> really<00:02:27.750> have<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:27.980> maybe<00:02:28.980> if

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
only if I really really have to maybe if

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.980 
only if I really really have to maybe if
players<00:02:29.370> done<00:02:29.520> have<00:02:29.610> nine<00:02:29.790> chemistry<00:02:30.300> at<00:02:30.750> all

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
players done have nine chemistry at all

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.230 
players done have nine chemistry at all
but<00:02:31.140> this<00:02:31.440> theory<00:02:31.680> is<00:02:31.770> really<00:02:32.280> only<00:02:32.460> 49<00:02:32.970> kemah

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
but this theory is really only 49 kemah

but this theory is really only 49 kemah

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
talking about and stuff like that but

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.020 
talking about and stuff like that but
this<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:51.780> unless<00:02:52.020> he<00:02:52.140> just<00:02:52.380> my<00:02:52.590> opinion<00:02:53.070> on<00:02:53.790> why

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
this is unless he just my opinion on why

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.370 
this is unless he just my opinion on why
I<00:02:54.060> don't<00:02:54.300> use<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.420> manager<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:54.930> really<00:02:55.230> don't

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
I don't use a manager I really don't

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.750 
I don't use a manager I really don't
know<00:02:55.440> where<00:02:55.620> for<00:02:55.770> expect<00:02:56.100> wherever<00:02:56.640> I've

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
know where for expect wherever I've

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.370 
know where for expect wherever I've
explained<00:02:57.210> it<00:02:57.390> very<00:02:57.570> well<00:02:58.110> whatsoever

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
explained it very well whatsoever

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.450 
explained it very well whatsoever
hopefully<00:03:01.380> you<00:03:01.440> guys<00:03:01.530> understand<00:03:02.100> what<00:03:02.340> I've

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
hopefully you guys understand what I've

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.190 
hopefully you guys understand what I've
just<00:03:02.490> said<00:03:02.990> and<00:03:03.990> you<00:03:04.890> know<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.070> can<00:03:05.190> try<00:03:05.640> and

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
just said and you know you can try and

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.420 
just said and you know you can try and
make<00:03:07.200> a<00:03:07.230> team<00:03:07.530> with<00:03:07.680> nine<00:03:07.890> chemistry<00:03:08.280> on<00:03:08.340> each

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
make a team with nine chemistry on each

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.170 
make a team with nine chemistry on each
player<00:03:08.900> and<00:03:10.280> don't<00:03:11.280> use<00:03:11.460> a<00:03:11.490> manager<00:03:11.880> and<00:03:11.970> see

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
player and don't use a manager and see

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.690 
player and don't use a manager and see
what<00:03:12.330> you<00:03:12.420> think<00:03:12.800> but<00:03:13.800> you<00:03:14.160> know<00:03:14.250> give<00:03:14.460> me<00:03:14.550> some

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
what you think but you know give me some

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.400 
what you think but you know give me some
feedback<00:03:14.880> on<00:03:15.090> whether<00:03:15.690> you<00:03:15.870> think<00:03:16.050> this<00:03:16.230> is

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
feedback on whether you think this is

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.010 
feedback on whether you think this is
true<00:03:16.650> or<00:03:16.740> not<00:03:16.830> I<00:03:17.730> really<00:03:18.360> don't<00:03:18.510> know<00:03:18.600> it's

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
true or not I really don't know it's

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.630 
true or not I really don't know it's
just<00:03:19.170> my<00:03:19.290> theory<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:19.860> I've<00:03:20.340> gone<00:03:20.459> with<00:03:20.610> it

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
just my theory and I've gone with it

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.300 
just my theory and I've gone with it
what<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.060> while<00:03:21.330> I<00:03:21.600> seem<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.650> play<00:03:22.800> bit<00:03:22.980> of<00:03:23.100> you

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
what a while I seem to play bit of you

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.710 
what a while I seem to play bit of you
know<00:03:23.340> players<00:03:23.670> with<00:03:23.850> just<00:03:24.090> nine<00:03:24.239> chemistry

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
know players with just nine chemistry

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.840 
know players with just nine chemistry
and<00:03:24.900> no<00:03:25.320> manager<00:03:25.709> whereas<00:03:26.100> to<00:03:26.340> you<00:03:26.580> know<00:03:26.700> with

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
and no manager whereas to you know with

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.340 
and no manager whereas to you know with
players<00:03:27.090> with<00:03:27.330> eight<00:03:27.570> or<00:03:27.720> nine<00:03:27.870> chemistry

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
players with eight or nine chemistry

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.199 
players with eight or nine chemistry
seven<00:03:29.070> chemistry<00:03:29.430> or<00:03:29.489> wherever<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:29.970> a

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
seven chemistry or wherever and a

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.479 
seven chemistry or wherever and a
manager<00:03:30.480> so<00:03:31.100> hopefully<00:03:32.100> you<00:03:32.160> guys<00:03:32.250> have

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
manager so hopefully you guys have

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.070 
manager so hopefully you guys have
enjoyed<00:03:32.520> this<00:03:32.940> and<00:03:33.180> given<00:03:33.510> you<00:03:33.660> you<00:03:33.989> know

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
enjoyed this and given you you know

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.750
