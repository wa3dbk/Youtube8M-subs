it's<00:02:44.150> a<00:02:44.420> ring<00:02:44.720> I<00:02:45.020> guess<00:02:45.200> for<00:02:45.530> Nina<00:02:46.220> fingers

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
it's a ring I guess for Nina fingers

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.880 
it's a ring I guess for Nina fingers
because<00:02:46.850> it<00:02:47.000> doesn't<00:02:47.390> fit<00:02:47.540> on<00:02:47.660> mine<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.290> it's

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
because it doesn't fit on mine and it's

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.790 
because it doesn't fit on mine and it's
a<00:02:49.010> flower<00:02:50.000> looks<00:02:50.570> kind<00:02:50.750> of<00:02:50.810> pretty<00:02:50.959> now<00:02:51.620> rock

Santa's toy has frustrated us and turned
our<00:02:53.930> fingers<00:02:54.230> blue<00:02:54.500> in<00:02:54.740> theory<00:02:55.520> this<00:02:55.670> is<00:02:55.850> a

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
our fingers blue in theory this is a

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.360 
our fingers blue in theory this is a
cool<00:02:56.150> toy<00:02:56.420> it's<00:02:56.720> a<00:02:56.810> little<00:02:57.080> pen<00:02:57.350> and<00:02:57.650> when<00:02:58.220> you

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
cool toy it's a little pen and when you

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.560 
cool toy it's a little pen and when you
assemble<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:58.970> whole<00:02:59.000> thing<00:03:01.390> and<00:03:02.390> when<00:03:02.510> you

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
assemble the whole thing and when you

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.790 
assemble the whole thing and when you
assemble<00:03:02.870> all<00:03:03.260> the<00:03:03.440> pieces<00:03:03.620> it's<00:03:04.550> a<00:03:05.410> top<00:03:06.410> that

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
assemble all the pieces it's a top that

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.230 
assemble all the pieces it's a top that
you<00:03:06.950> can<00:03:06.980> spin<00:03:07.430> and<00:03:07.610> it<00:03:07.700> will<00:03:07.730> draw<00:03:08.000> on<00:03:08.120> your

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
you can spin and it will draw on your

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.000 
you can spin and it will draw on your
paper<00:03:08.420> hope<00:03:08.780> you<00:03:08.930> can't<00:03:09.230> get<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.620> thing<00:03:09.830> to

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
paper hope you can't get the thing to

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.890 
paper hope you can't get the thing to
stay<00:03:10.220> together<00:03:10.370> so<00:03:10.880> in<00:03:11.060> theory<00:03:11.300> this<00:03:11.570> might<00:03:11.780> be

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
stay together so in theory this might be

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.960 
stay together so in theory this might be
a<00:03:11.930> cool<00:03:12.140> toy<00:03:12.350> in<00:03:12.650> practice<00:03:13.520> isn't<00:03:13.760> quite

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
a cool toy in practice isn't quite
