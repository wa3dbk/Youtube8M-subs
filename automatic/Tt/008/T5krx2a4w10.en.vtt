something that should be able to hold it
in<00:00:32.430> place<00:00:32.640> so<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.480> begin<00:00:34.110> by<00:00:34.800> making<00:00:35.160> an

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
in place so you begin by making an

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.860 
in place so you begin by making an
armature<00:00:36.559> first<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.800> take<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.040> piece<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.870> block

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
armature first you take a piece of block

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.700 
armature first you take a piece of block
of<00:00:40.110> wood<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.710> block<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.730> wood<00:00:41.760> in<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.440> which

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
of wood a block of wood in to to which

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.270 
of wood a block of wood in to to which
you<00:00:44.840> position<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.020> armature<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.530> fix<00:00:47.039> it

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
you position the armature and fix it

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.389 
you position the armature and fix it
with<00:00:47.309> nails<00:00:48.350> armature<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.829> sort<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.190> earth

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
with nails armature is a sort of earth

with nails armature is a sort of earth
as<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.360> can<00:00:51.539> understand<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> little

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
as you can understand it is a little

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.729 
as you can understand it is a little
tall<00:00:53.699> whatever<00:00:54.539> height<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.320> require

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
tall whatever height that you require

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.790 
tall whatever height that you require
that<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.670> tall<00:00:57.120> piece<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.899> can<00:00:58.109> be<00:00:58.140> wire

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
that is a tall piece of it can be wire

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.389 
that is a tall piece of it can be wire
it<00:00:59.250> can<00:00:59.520> be<00:00:59.730> wood<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.690> can<00:01:01.079> be<00:01:01.289> it's<00:01:01.859> entirely

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
it can be wood it can be it's entirely

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.929 
it can be wood it can be it's entirely
up<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.149> what<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:04.409> are<00:01:04.439> really<00:01:05.040> targeting<00:01:05.700> to

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
up to what you are really targeting to

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.070 
up to what you are really targeting to
make<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:07.080> then<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.979> have<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.970> put<00:01:09.299> maybe<00:01:09.869> you

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
make and then you have you put maybe you

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.460 
make and then you have you put maybe you
put<00:01:10.290> another<00:01:10.619> stick<00:01:11.369> across<00:01:11.820> or<00:01:12.240> whatever<00:01:13.049> it

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
put another stick across or whatever it

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.649 
put another stick across or whatever it
depends<00:01:13.890> entirely<00:01:14.250> on<00:01:14.460> what<00:01:14.909> really<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.509> are

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
depends entirely on what really you are

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.560 
depends entirely on what really you are
aiming<00:01:15.869> at<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:17.159> first<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.700> make<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.909> armature

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
aiming at so first you make the armature

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.820 
aiming at so first you make the armature
and<00:01:18.810> then<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.500> wind<00:01:20.340> her<00:01:20.970> rope<00:01:21.240> or<00:01:21.960> iron<00:01:22.380> wire

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
and then you wind her rope or iron wire

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.179 
and then you wind her rope or iron wire
and<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.970> put<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.020> round<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.650> round<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.100> round

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
and you put it round and round and round

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.600 
and you put it round and round and round
so<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:26.840> this<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.380> ensure<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:28.920> when<00:01:29.430> you

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
so that this is to ensure that when you

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.260 
so that this is to ensure that when you
apply<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.530> clay<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.610> clay<00:01:32.909> doesn't

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
apply the clay on it the clay doesn't

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.539 
apply the clay on it the clay doesn't
fall<00:01:33.780> or<00:01:34.079> doesn't<00:01:34.530> disintegrate

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
fall or doesn't disintegrate

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.420 
fall or doesn't disintegrate
Cynthia<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.600> rope<00:01:37.320> or<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.680> surface<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.280> the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
Cynthia the rope or the surface of the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.219 
Cynthia the rope or the surface of the
rope<00:01:38.640> or<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:40.189> auto<00:01:41.189> wire<00:01:41.640> holds<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:42.960> place

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
rope or the auto wire holds it in place

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.149 
rope or the auto wire holds it in place
for<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:44.189> long<00:01:44.520> time<00:01:44.970> until<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.079> done<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:46.619> you

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
for a long time until it is done so you

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.840 
for a long time until it is done so you
work<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.420> armature<00:01:49.140> by<00:01:49.890> putting<00:01:50.549> and

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
work on that armature by putting and

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.190 
work on that armature by putting and
heading<00:01:51.390> subtracting<00:01:52.380> and

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
heading subtracting and

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.920 
heading subtracting and
and<00:01:53.350> as<00:01:53.560> you<00:01:53.860> see<00:01:54.159> while<00:01:54.939> you<00:01:55.180> are<00:01:55.270> making<00:01:55.450> you

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
and as you see while you are making you

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.499 
and as you see while you are making you
know<00:01:56.110> exactly<00:01:56.470> what<00:01:56.860> you<00:01:57.070> really<00:01:57.310> want<00:01:57.729> so<00:01:58.450> you

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
know exactly what you really want so you

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.310 
know exactly what you really want so you
have<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:59.080> have<00:01:59.259> a<00:01:59.460> till<00:02:00.460> you<00:02:00.729> feel<00:02:01.060> that<00:02:01.320> you
