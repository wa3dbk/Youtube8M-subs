00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.600
 here at the mobile congress in barcelona ago 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:13.600
 definitely before android 5.0 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.640
 lollipop on 6 to 3 comfort and z3 e 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.349
 we see the separative lollipop 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.179
 in action we see it through the end 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:22.570
 notification through the task manager 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:26.439
 but let's see what and added sony di su 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.329
 in addition to a typical keys interface to 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.550
 on his smartphones he was present on 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.980
 kit cup showing this menu ad 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.059
 example in draw wars and modification 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:40.030
 some icons here with lollipop allows 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.620
 also going to change for example 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.750
 the quick steps in itself within the 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.579
 then notifications of these 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.219
 I did not know if they will still behave 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.929
 like us but we are sure that we can 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.300
 modify through these 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:57.519
 settings we can go to move 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:00.910
 a goal and then remove another one 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:02.949
 order in short and then find them with the 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.440
 double swipe downwards 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:08.050
 this can be done either by three 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.570
 both with a compact or even three 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.310
 can go or better open the 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.450
 applications in pop as usual 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.010
 so for example they are more than browsers 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.880
 instead we can open the calculator e 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:25.690
 other applications always with these pop 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.280
 up then a typicality and other sony 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.200
 things other things in the menu 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.630
 settings we have a 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.060
 layout in our opinion improved given 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.740
 that there are these colorful and well icons 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.140
 more visible are more visible more 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.899
 the items we go to about phone for 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.869
 see the version accurately 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.310
 legacy point 0.2 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.220
 so this and this cannot 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.350
 more news of lollipop on the sounds if 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.899
