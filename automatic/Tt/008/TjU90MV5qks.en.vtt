00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Good day, dear friends with 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.069
 you again perpetuum or alexander and 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.210
 Today I decided to provide you immediately 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.880
 two fashion 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.490
 why two probably because 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.440
 they are not really big and do not deserve 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.250
 separate issue well friends 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.890
 let's go first mod adds these 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.789
 here are interesting unusual giant 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.710
 and little portals are friends for all of us 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.289
 long ago there were not enough portals of different types 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.600
 different designs now portals can 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.309
 be for example horizontal this i 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.770
 more than sure you definitely lacked 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.489
 to complete your 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.500
 the image of your house the image of your house 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.289
 portal can be of any kind it can 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.660
 take on any look and any size be it 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.239
 in one block or there are 100 in 1000 blocks 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.550
 so that's how big it is 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.930
 we just need to choose a square on 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.940
 which will be the portal 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.250
 surround her with obsidian and something is not right 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.250
 did she let's redo so so 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.930
 so surrounded by obsidian which spoke 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.570
 damn it again something I'm not at all in the spirit 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.450
 So 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:18.979
 let's put ourselves around us 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:22.310
 obsidian as i promised come on so 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.500
 and the final touch is ok it turns out the portal 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.330
 also this portal is now possible 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.680
 color us with dye 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.780
 just need to go to the portal 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.479
 select dye and press right 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.090
 click the dye on the portal here it is 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.000
 turned blue soft color again 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.300
 purple about yellow everything depends on 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.440
 your taste and your preference 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.690
 portal can be again I repeat 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.680
 small in one block or gigantic 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.680
 in 1000 blocks it all depends on you 2 modes 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.789
 adds here is such an interesting 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.000
 steampunk balloon which 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.890
 sick he is really cool for even no words 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.840
 to describe it look how much 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.119
 cool textures here 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.910
 so stylish he emphasizes here 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.530
 such a mechanic to the world of minecraft on 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.509
 This balloon can fly 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.100
 We approach it right click 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.739
 We find ourselves in it and about 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.810
 we flew but fly just like that 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.450
 it will turn out for flight we will need 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.580
 fuel specifically in this case is 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.860
 coal we need regular coal 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.260
 have and is in our inventory already 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.840
 coal and we can fly if we have coal 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.329
 it won't be ok let's throw it all 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.640
 coal we will not be able to fly even though no 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:33.110
 now in this case we can because 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.680
 decline are already inside our 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.840
 engine 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.190
 let's get down now and see how 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.320
 You can craft such an interesting one 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.930
 balloon that worked 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.820
 literally down to the smallest details for 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.560
 we will need this workbench and 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.780
 now we need to create several 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.700
 parts of which will be given 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.620
 balloon first 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.769
 floor and the ball itself 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.510
 put 8 pieces of skin is obtained here 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.549
 such a ball now we need to create 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.519
 two engines to create 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:04.010
 engine we need a piston and 8 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.230
 pieces of iron arranged in a circle in 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.260
 In this case, we need two engines 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.569
 About it turns out two engines further us 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.909
 you need to create a ball for us 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.799
 need a boat 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:18.739
 which we put here right here to us 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:22.310
 We need two engines 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:24.410
 need a thread arranged it like that 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.790
 here's the way the ball itself is needed and us 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.890
 need a stove which will 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.540
 melt coal bake in coal and from 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.480
 which the furnace will operate the engine and 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.609
 what a stupid set of words incoherent 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.599
 okay sense again 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:39.140
 it turns out such an airship ball 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.569
 airship 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.959
 general then we put it on the ground take 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.579
 coal and flew my friends flew to 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.950
 in general, it turned out like this 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.500
 quick review of mods 2 mods which 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:58.120
 not quite big but rather interesting 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:58.120
 themselves were perpetuum or alexander yet
