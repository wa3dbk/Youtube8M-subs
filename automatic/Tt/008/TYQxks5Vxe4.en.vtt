00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:20.949 
bracelet a little it will count the

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:26.129 
bracelet a little it will count the
steps<00:05:23.520> there<00:05:24.520> you<00:05:24.639> go<00:05:24.819> I<00:05:25.060> just<00:05:25.449> walked<00:05:25.750> 10

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
steps or not let me stop that and let's

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:35.370 
steps or not let me stop that and let's
see<00:05:32.440> what<00:05:32.680> we<00:05:32.949> also<00:05:33.400> have<00:05:33.639> here<00:05:33.870> now<00:05:34.870> this<00:05:35.139> one

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
see what we also have here now this one

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.029 
see what we also have here now this one
is<00:05:35.590> called<00:05:35.830> a<00:05:36.130> sleep<00:05:36.880> monitor<00:05:37.509> and<00:05:37.889> to<00:05:38.889> be

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:39.039 
is called a sleep monitor and to be

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.480 
is called a sleep monitor and to be
honest<00:05:39.490> I<00:05:39.699> have<00:05:39.970> no<00:05:40.599> idea<00:05:41.110> what<00:05:41.380> it<00:05:41.530> does<00:05:41.710> now

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:42.490 
honest I have no idea what it does now

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:44.760 
honest I have no idea what it does now
you<00:05:42.550> can<00:05:42.849> start<00:05:43.180> a<00:05:43.330> timer<00:05:43.690> and<00:05:44.050> it<00:05:44.229> says<00:05:44.440> good

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
you can start a timer and it says good

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.490 
you can start a timer and it says good
right<00:05:45.039> here<00:05:45.400> I'm<00:05:45.699> guessing<00:05:46.360> all<00:05:46.750> it<00:05:47.050> does<00:05:47.229> is

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
right here I'm guessing all it does is

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.850 
right here I'm guessing all it does is
that<00:05:47.560> it<00:05:48.180> measures<00:05:49.180> your<00:05:49.409> movements<00:05:50.409> with

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
that it measures your movements with

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.969 
that it measures your movements with
within<00:05:51.729> your<00:05:52.000> sleep<00:05:52.330> and<00:05:52.719> the<00:05:53.409> less<00:05:53.590> you<00:05:53.620> move

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979 
within your sleep and the less you move

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:57.480 
within your sleep and the less you move
the<00:05:54.550> better<00:05:54.909> your<00:05:55.150> sleepers<00:05:55.659> I<00:05:56.219> really<00:05:57.219> don't

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
the better your sleepers I really don't

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.450 
the better your sleepers I really don't
know<00:05:58.440> what<00:05:59.440> do<00:05:59.620> we<00:05:59.740> have<00:05:59.860> next

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460 
know what do we have next

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:05.610 
know what do we have next
we<00:06:00.699> have<00:06:00.909> a<00:06:01.120> remote<00:06:01.659> camera<00:06:02.550> so<00:06:03.659> if<00:06:04.659> we<00:06:05.050> start

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
we have a remote camera so if we start

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.939 
we have a remote camera so if we start
that<00:06:06.120> you<00:06:07.120> can<00:06:07.330> actually<00:06:07.680> remotely<00:06:08.680> take

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:08.949 
that you can actually remotely take

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:14.430 
that you can actually remotely take
pictures<00:06:09.820> with<00:06:10.240> your<00:06:10.509> cell<00:06:10.900> phone<00:06:11.520> and<00:06:13.440> it

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
pictures with your cell phone and it

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.820 
pictures with your cell phone and it
captures<00:06:15.219> whatever<00:06:15.909> you're<00:06:16.360> aiming<00:06:16.599> at

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
captures whatever you're aiming at

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.830 
captures whatever you're aiming at
and<00:06:19.220> I<00:06:19.729> think<00:06:20.229> this<00:06:21.229> is<00:06:21.440> pretty<00:06:21.800> much<00:06:21.949> it<00:06:22.840> last

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 
and I think this is pretty much it last

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.469 
and I think this is pretty much it last
but<00:06:24.050> not<00:06:24.199> least<00:06:24.409> we<00:06:24.680> have<00:06:24.710> the<00:06:25.340> settings<00:06:26.090> where

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 
but not least we have the settings where

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:29.619 
but not least we have the settings where
you<00:06:26.509> can<00:06:26.930> select<00:06:27.229> your<00:06:27.500> language<00:06:28.430> you<00:06:29.120> can<00:06:29.360> set

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:29.629 
you can select your language you can set

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:32.020 
you can select your language you can set
an<00:06:29.780> alarm<00:06:30.080> you<00:06:30.470> can<00:06:30.680> set<00:06:30.979> your<00:06:31.159> time<00:06:31.460> zone<00:06:31.490> and

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.030 
an alarm you can set your time zone and

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.089 
an alarm you can set your time zone and
your<00:06:32.180> time<00:06:32.449> and<00:06:32.870> I<00:06:33.050> think<00:06:33.470> this<00:06:33.650> is<00:06:33.800> pretty

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:34.099 
your time and I think this is pretty

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:36.640 
your time and I think this is pretty
much<00:06:34.250> it<00:06:34.520> I<00:06:34.729> think<00:06:35.509> it's<00:06:35.659> a<00:06:35.750> fun<00:06:35.930> little<00:06:35.960> gadget

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
much it I think it's a fun little gadget

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.409 
much it I think it's a fun little gadget
