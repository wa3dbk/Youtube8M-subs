00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
we're going to cut this off but first I

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.800 
we're going to cut this off but first I
like<00:03:45.660> to<00:03:45.840> take<00:03:46.050> my<00:03:46.320> nails<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:47.100> I<00:03:47.850> don't<00:03:48.480> really

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810
