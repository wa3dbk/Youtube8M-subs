job to interview young scientists and

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:47.610 
job to interview young scientists and
get<00:00:44.800> ideas<00:00:44.890> for<00:00:45.159> new<00:00:45.280> robot<00:00:45.579> masters<00:00:45.940> and<00:00:46.620> then

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
get ideas for new robot masters and then

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.860 
get ideas for new robot masters and then
basically<00:00:47.829> we<00:00:48.159> steal<00:00:48.339> them<00:00:48.519> now<00:00:49.390> my<00:00:49.569> office

basically we steal them now my office

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.869 
basically we steal them now my office
isn't<00:00:50.019> much<00:00:50.289> it's<00:00:50.949> basically<00:00:51.249> just<00:00:51.339> a<00:00:51.579> garage

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
isn't much it's basically just a garage

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.329 
isn't much it's basically just a garage
we<00:00:52.600> need<00:00:52.749> to<00:00:52.809> keep<00:00:52.929> a<00:00:53.019> low<00:00:53.139> profile<00:00:53.620> to<00:00:54.039> prevent

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
we need to keep a low profile to prevent

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:56.160 
we need to keep a low profile to prevent
our<00:00:54.489> enemies<00:00:54.879> and<00:00:55.089> law<00:00:55.300> enforcement<00:00:55.420> from

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
our enemies and law enforcement from

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.319 
our enemies and law enforcement from
finding<00:00:56.440> our<00:00:56.530> location<00:00:56.979> so<00:00:57.879> what<00:00:58.149> have<00:00:58.239> you

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
finding our location so what have you

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.270 
finding our location so what have you
got<00:00:58.479> for<00:00:58.510> us<00:00:58.719> today<00:00:58.809> okay<00:00:59.589> so<00:00:59.889> you<00:00:59.949> know<00:01:00.100> how

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
got for us today okay so you know how

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.160 
got for us today okay so you know how
androids<00:01:00.940> have<00:01:01.179> a<00:01:01.239> problem<00:01:01.690> working<00:01:01.839> in

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
androids have a problem working in

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.410 
androids have a problem working in
extreme<00:01:02.559> high<00:01:02.769> temperatures<00:01:03.370> they<00:01:03.969> don't<00:01:04.180> but

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
extreme high temperatures they don't but

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.480 
extreme high temperatures they don't but
go<00:01:04.600> on<00:01:04.659> say<00:01:05.229> hello<00:01:05.530> to<00:01:05.590> the<00:01:05.890> fiberglass

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
go on say hello to the fiberglass

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.210 
go on say hello to the fiberglass
insulation<00:01:06.790> man<00:01:07.510> uses<00:01:08.440> the<00:01:08.590> sheets<00:01:08.860> of<00:01:09.070> the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
insulation man uses the sheets of the

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.039 
insulation man uses the sheets of the
wall<00:01:09.430> insulation<00:01:10.030> to<00:01:10.329> observe<00:01:10.840> room

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
wall insulation to observe room

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:13.020 
wall insulation to observe room
temperature<00:01:11.590> so<00:01:11.799> only<00:01:12.070> overheating<00:01:12.880> the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
temperature so only overheating the

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.670 
temperature so only overheating the
circuitry<00:01:13.479> of<00:01:13.539> your<00:01:13.780> foes<00:01:13.990> as<00:01:14.289> well<00:01:14.560> as

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
circuitry of your foes as well as

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.920 
circuitry of your foes as well as
simultaneously<00:01:15.490> reducing<00:01:16.149> the<00:01:16.360> cost<00:01:16.600> of<00:01:16.810> your

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
simultaneously reducing the cost of your

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.660 
simultaneously reducing the cost of your
home<00:01:17.079> heating<00:01:17.320> bills<00:01:17.710> yeah<00:01:17.920> assuming<00:01:18.640> that

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
home heating bills yeah assuming that

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.230 
home heating bills yeah assuming that
works<00:01:19.060> and<00:01:19.479> it<00:01:19.689> won't<00:01:19.899> at<00:01:20.560> all<00:01:20.880> when<00:01:21.880> upping

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
works and it won't at all when upping

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.609 
works and it won't at all when upping
the<00:01:22.329> temperature<00:01:22.750> just<00:01:23.109> cause<00:01:23.259> a<00:01:23.289> robot

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
the temperature just cause a robot

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.429 
the temperature just cause a robot
master<00:01:23.920> himself<00:01:24.009> to<00:01:24.340> overheat<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:25.689> haven't

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
master himself to overheat I haven't

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.670 
master himself to overheat I haven't
thought<00:01:26.590> of<00:01:26.649> that<00:01:27.359> what<00:01:28.359> if<00:01:28.539> we<00:01:28.570> are<00:01:28.930> used

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
thought of that what if we are used

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.010 
thought of that what if we are used
asbestos<00:01:30.340> no<00:01:30.670> going<00:01:30.969> off<00:01:31.180> of<00:01:31.210> the<00:01:31.539> health<00:01:31.750> risk

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
asbestos no going off of the health risk

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.560 
asbestos no going off of the health risk
angle<00:01:32.500> and<00:01:32.770> we<00:01:33.250> could<00:01:33.460> call<00:01:33.909> them<00:01:34.030> asbestos

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
angle and we could call them asbestos

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.870 
angle and we could call them asbestos
pad<00:01:34.810> yeah<00:01:35.079> we're<00:01:35.649> fighting<00:01:35.950> androids<00:01:36.429> there

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
pad yeah we're fighting androids there

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.300 
pad yeah we're fighting androids there
are<00:01:37.060> no<00:01:37.299> health<00:01:37.539> risks<00:01:37.960> and<00:01:38.289> besides<00:01:38.890> didn't

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
are no health risks and besides didn't

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.310 
are no health risks and besides didn't
moreville<00:01:39.579> already<00:01:39.789> do<00:01:39.909> asbestos<00:01:40.450> man<00:01:40.659> mmm

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
moreville already do asbestos man mmm

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.899 
moreville already do asbestos man mmm
it's<00:01:42.159> a<00:01:42.280> stupid<00:01:42.729> idea<00:01:42.969> I<00:01:43.570> know<00:01:44.399> next<00:01:45.399> picture

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
it's a stupid idea I know next picture

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.109 
it's a stupid idea I know next picture
this<00:01:46.299> mailman<00:01:46.990> he's<00:01:47.920> exactly<00:01:48.460> like<00:01:48.549> cop<00:01:48.909> man

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
this mailman he's exactly like cop man

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.270 
this mailman he's exactly like cop man
except<00:01:49.719> instead<00:01:49.869> of<00:01:50.020> scissors<00:01:50.469> he<00:01:50.920> attacks

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
except instead of scissors he attacks
