00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:05.120
Testing of Djuro Scuba 1st
stage regulator

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.020
I've told you once.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.930
No you haven't.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.110
Yes I have.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.700
When?

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:11.690
Just now.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.880
No you didn't.
Yes I did.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:13.660
You didn't
I did!

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.040
You didn't!
I'm telling you I did!

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.650
You did not!!

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.550
Oh, I'm sorry, Is this the 
five minute argument

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.660
or the full half hour?

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.990
Oh, just the five minutes.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.000
- Ah, thank you. Anyway, I did
- You most certainly did not

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.130
Now let's get something quite clear
I most definitely told you

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:32.390
- You did not
- Yes I did

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.300
- You did not
- Yes I did

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.240
- Didn't
- Yes I did

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.210
- Didn't
- Yes I did

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.530
- Look, this isn't an argument
- Yes it is

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.680
- No it isn't. It's just contradiction
- No it isn't

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.770
- Yes it is!
- It is not

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.440
- It is, you just contradicted me
- No, I didn't

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.530
- Oh you did!!
- No, no, no, no, no, no

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.430
- You did just then
- No, no, nonsense!

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.000
- Oh, this is futile!
- No it isn't

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.590
I came here for a good argument

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.210
No you didn't, you came
here for an argument

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.760
Well, an argument is not the
same as contradiction

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:54.900
It can be

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.340
No it can't

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.830
An argument is a connected
series of statements

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.140
to establish a
definite proposition

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.300
- No it isn't
- Yes it is! It isn't just contradiction

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.880
Look, if I argue with you,
I must take up a contrary position

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.210
But it isn't just saying
'No it isn't.'

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.330
- Yes it is!
- No it isn't!

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.930
Argument is an intellectual process
Contradiction is just the automatic

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.150
gainsaying of anything
the other person says

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.510
- No it isn't
- Yes it is

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.760
- Not at all
- Now look...

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.200
Thank you
Good Morning

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.720
What?

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:25.760
That's it. Good morning

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.230
- I was just getting interested
- Sorry, the five minutes is up

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.610
That was never five minutes
just now

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.760
I'm afraid it was
No, it wasn't

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.150
Sorry, I'm not allowed to
argue anymore

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.950
What?!

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.630
If you want me to go on arguing, 
you'll have to pay

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.750
for another five minutes

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.870
But that was never
five minutes, just now

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.350
Oh come on!

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.530
This is ridiculous

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.700
I'm very sorry, but I told you 
I'm not allowed to argue

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.000
unless you've paid!

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:54.800
Oh, all right

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.580
- There you are
- Thank you

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.610
- Well?
- Well what?

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.230
That wasn't never five 
minutes, just now

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.560
I told you, I'm not allowed 
to argue unless you've paid

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.380
I just paid!

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.810
- No you didn't
- I did! - You didn't

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.780
- I did! 
-  You didn't

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.320
- I did!
- You most certainly did not

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.310
Look, I don't want to 
argue about that

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.770
Well, I'm very sorry,
but you didn't pay

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.640
Aha. Well, if I didn't pay, 
why are you arguing? 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.660
- Got you!
- No you haven't

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.810
Yes I have

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.660
If you're arguing,
I must have paid

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.510
Not necessarily. I could be
arguing in my spare time

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.030
Oh I've had enough of this

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.580
- No you haven't
- Oh Shut up
