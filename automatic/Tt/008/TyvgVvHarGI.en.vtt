00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.550 

without<00:01:54.939> very<00:01:55.179> good<00:01:55.390> at<00:01:55.479> carpet<00:01:55.899> sorting<00:01:56.289> so

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
without very good at carpet sorting so

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:19.740 
without very good at carpet sorting so
you<00:01:56.890> got<00:01:57.039> home<00:01:57.490> into<00:02:16.140> any<00:02:17.140> store<00:02:17.680> I<00:02:17.709> think<00:02:18.750> but

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
I think it'd be cheaper if you got them

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:26.430 
I think it'd be cheaper if you got them
online<00:02:22.560> mine<00:02:23.560> came<00:02:23.829> really<00:02:24.160> quickly
