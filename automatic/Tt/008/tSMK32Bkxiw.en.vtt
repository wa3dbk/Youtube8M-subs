00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.579 

okay<00:00:02.310> so<00:00:02.370> here<00:00:02.700> I<00:00:02.760> am<00:00:02.879> with<00:00:03.210> my<00:00:03.290> super<00:00:04.290> track

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
okay so here I am with my super track

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.880 
okay so here I am with my super track
hub<00:00:04.920> and<00:00:05.549> I<00:00:06.359> thought<00:00:06.629> I<00:00:06.690> could<00:00:06.839> replace<00:00:07.410> the

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
hub and I thought I could replace the

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.940 
hub and I thought I could replace the
nipples<00:00:08.340> of<00:00:08.690> the<00:00:09.690> original<00:00:10.170> meaning<00:00:10.620> just

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
nipples of the original meaning just

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.620 
nipples of the original meaning just
keep<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.340> old<00:00:11.429> spokes<00:00:11.849> and<00:00:12.120> replace<00:00:12.480> the

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
keep the old spokes and replace the

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.720 
keep the old spokes and replace the
nipples<00:00:12.990> with<00:00:13.799> brass<00:00:14.040> nipples<00:00:14.460> but<00:00:14.670> I

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
nipples with brass nipples but I

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.550 
nipples with brass nipples but I
couldn't<00:00:15.179> so<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.480> ended<00:00:15.780> up<00:00:15.839> cutting<00:00:16.139> all<00:00:16.350> the

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
couldn't so I ended up cutting all the

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.010 
couldn't so I ended up cutting all the
old<00:00:16.680> spokes<00:00:17.010> off<00:00:17.250> with<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.119> store-bought<00:00:18.480> new

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
old spokes off with a store-bought new

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.490 
old spokes off with a store-bought new
spokes<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:20.310> new<00:00:20.460> nipples<00:00:20.930> and<00:00:21.930> I'm<00:00:22.230> going<00:00:22.380> to

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
spokes and new nipples and I'm going to

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.460 
spokes and new nipples and I'm going to
see<00:00:23.279> if<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.519> can<00:00:23.820> build<00:00:24.480> this<00:00:24.720> wheel<00:00:25.019> I've<00:00:25.260> done

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
see if I can build this wheel I've done

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.650 
see if I can build this wheel I've done
it<00:00:25.619> once<00:00:25.800> before<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.519> it's<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.390> little

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
it once before and it's a little

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.830 
it once before and it's a little
different<00:00:28.080> than<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.349> front<00:00:28.680> wheel<00:00:29.840> because

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
different than the front wheel because

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.780 
different than the front wheel because
it<00:00:31.080> has<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.619> torque<00:00:31.949> can<00:00:32.219> all<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:32.520> stuff

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
it has the torque can all that stuff

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.910 
it has the torque can all that stuff
attached<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.930> can't<00:00:34.350> just<00:00:34.620> stick

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
attached to it so you can't just stick

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.000 
attached to it so you can't just stick
the<00:00:35.070> spokes<00:00:35.399> out<00:00:35.640> radially<00:00:36.469> you<00:00:37.469> have<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.829> have

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
the spokes out radially you have to have

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.280 
the spokes out radially you have to have
them<00:00:38.219> coming<00:00:38.489> off<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.239> hub<00:00:39.450> at<00:00:39.690> an<00:00:39.780> angle

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
them coming off of the hub at an angle

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.880 
them coming off of the hub at an angle
you<00:00:40.320> can<00:00:40.620> see<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.040> marks<00:00:41.460> where<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.850> old

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
you can see the marks where the old

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.100 
you can see the marks where the old
spokes<00:00:43.890> came<00:00:44.250> off<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:44.910> fine<00:00:45.270> fit<00:00:45.899> wood

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
spokes came off of this fine fit wood

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.369 
spokes came off of this fine fit wood
hub<00:00:46.350> which<00:00:46.649> by<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:46.920> way<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.840> just<00:00:48.840> as<00:00:49.020> smooth

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
hub which by the way is just as smooth

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.860 
hub which by the way is just as smooth
as<00:00:49.800> it's<00:00:50.039> been<00:00:50.340> since<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.120> day<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.449> bought<00:00:51.809> it

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
as it's been since the day I bought it

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.229 
as it's been since the day I bought it
and<00:00:52.230> I've<00:00:52.379> written<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:52.980> thing<00:00:53.239> extremely

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
and I've written this thing extremely

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.819 
and I've written this thing extremely
extremely<00:00:54.960> hard<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.620> my<00:00:55.770> daily<00:00:56.190> rider<00:00:57.829> so

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
extremely hard this is my daily rider so

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.380 
extremely hard this is my daily rider so
here<00:00:59.010> we<00:00:59.070> go<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.640> first<00:00:59.670> spoke<00:01:00.120> goes

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
here we go so the first spoke goes

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.060 
here we go so the first spoke goes
through<00:01:00.750> one<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:00.960> these<00:01:01.079> holes<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:03.860> this<00:01:04.860> is

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
through one of these holes and this is

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.120 
through one of these holes and this is
how<00:01:05.250> it<00:01:05.400> works

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
how it works

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.399 
how it works
cog<00:01:08.130> side<00:01:08.790> down<00:01:09.270> if<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:11.820> hole<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.810> spoke<00:01:13.140> hole

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
cog side down if the hole the spoke hole

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.859 
cog side down if the hole the spoke hole
to<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.770> right<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.430> valve<00:01:14.700> stem<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.509> lower

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
to the right of the valve stem is lower

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.850 
to the right of the valve stem is lower
than<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.650> one<00:01:16.860> on<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:18.450> left<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:19.350> my<00:01:19.530> case

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
than the one on the left and in my case

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.570 
than the one on the left and in my case
that's<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.670> way<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.600> spoke<00:01:22.020> is

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
that's the way it is so this spoke is

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.350 
that's the way it is so this spoke is
lower<00:01:23.580> than<00:01:24.320> that<00:01:25.320> one<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.100> valve<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:27.150> so

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
lower than that one so the valve that so

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.530 
lower than that one so the valve that so
the<00:01:27.450> COG<00:01:27.829> side<00:01:28.829> goes<00:01:29.189> down<00:01:30.380> and<00:01:31.820> so<00:01:32.820> attach

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
the COG side goes down and so attach

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.660 
the COG side goes down and so attach
that<00:01:33.810> through<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.229> left<00:01:34.470> hole

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:49.270 

and<00:01:42.159> their<00:01:43.159> nipple<00:01:47.590> so<00:01:48.590> then<00:01:48.770> you<00:01:48.890> proceed

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
and their nipple so then you proceed

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.200 
and their nipple so then you proceed
around<00:01:49.610> every<00:01:50.180> fourth<00:01:50.659> hole<00:01:51.070> so<00:01:52.070> one<00:01:52.909> two

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
around every fourth hole so one two

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.120 
around every fourth hole so one two
three<00:01:53.570> four<00:01:53.900> one<00:01:54.500> two<00:01:54.950> three<00:01:54.979> four<00:01:57.130> every

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
three four one two three four every

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:13.640 
three four one two three four every
other<00:01:59.350> so<00:02:00.350> one<00:02:00.680> two<00:02:00.920> three<00:02:00.950> four<00:02:03.729> put<00:02:04.729> a<00:02:04.759> nipple

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.930 

whoops<00:02:14.190> one<00:02:15.150> two<00:02:15.360> three<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:17.610> on

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
whoops one two three and so on

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:32.869 
whoops one two three and so on
one<00:02:18.180> two<00:02:18.480> three<00:02:18.810> four<00:02:26.030> okay<00:02:31.370> so<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.549> have<00:02:32.760> all

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
eight in and the next step keep the

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:45.490 
eight in and the next step keep the
valve<00:02:37.170> stem<00:02:37.470> here<00:02:37.860> is<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.129> flip<00:02:38.400> it<00:02:38.519> over<00:02:41.840> and

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.589 

I'm<00:02:46.500> going<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.709> take<00:02:50.150> you're<00:02:51.150> going<00:02:51.269> to<00:02:51.329> take

I'm going to take you're going to take
the<00:02:52.140> hole<00:02:52.410> next<00:02:53.129> to<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.519> here's<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.910> valve

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
the hole next to the here's the valve

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.619 
the hole next to the here's the valve
stem

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
stem

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:56.360 
stem
so<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.140> spoke<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.769> right<00:02:55.950> of<00:02:56.069> the<00:02:56.160> valve

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
so the spoke to the right of the valve

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.449 
so the spoke to the right of the valve
stem<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:59.359> if<00:03:00.359> you<00:03:00.540> look<00:03:00.810> on<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.170> hub<00:03:01.459> the

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
stem and if you look on the hub the

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.330 
stem and if you look on the hub the
spokes<00:03:03.000> are<00:03:03.209> offset<00:03:03.750> half<00:03:05.359> the<00:03:06.359> holes<00:03:06.659> are

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
spokes are offset half the holes are

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.500 
spokes are offset half the holes are
offset<00:03:08.340> halfway<00:03:08.849> you're<00:03:09.060> going<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.239> take<00:03:09.390> the

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
offset halfway you're going to take the

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.750 
offset halfway you're going to take the
next<00:03:09.930> hole<00:03:10.200> over<00:03:13.040> pull<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.099> through<00:03:14.159> and

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
next hole over pull it through and

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.569 
next hole over pull it through and
that's<00:03:15.450> going<00:03:15.659> to<00:03:15.750> go<00:03:15.959> through<00:03:18.859> the<00:03:19.859> hole<00:03:20.069> next

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
that's going to go through the hole next

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:32.020 
that's going to go through the hole next
to<00:03:21.980> first<00:03:22.980> one<00:03:23.250> right<00:03:23.700> there

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:38.170 

so<00:03:32.990> you're<00:03:33.410> going<00:03:33.530> to<00:03:33.560> have<00:03:35.560> the<00:03:36.560> valve<00:03:37.180> spoke

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
so you're going to have the valve spoke

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.200 
so you're going to have the valve spoke
from<00:03:38.360> the<00:03:38.480> first<00:03:39.070> from<00:03:40.070> the<00:03:40.190> first<00:03:40.700> set<00:03:41.000> of

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
from the first from the first set of

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.340 
from the first from the first set of
eight<00:03:41.390> and<00:03:41.630> then<00:03:43.570> just<00:03:44.570> to<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:44.840> right<00:03:45.110> of<00:03:45.260> the

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
eight and then just to the right of the

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.380 
eight and then just to the right of the
spoke<00:03:45.710> looking<00:03:46.100> down<00:03:46.310> you're<00:03:46.880> going<00:03:47.030> to<00:03:47.090> drop

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
spoke looking down you're going to drop

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.830 
spoke looking down you're going to drop
the<00:03:47.450> second<00:03:48.110> spoke<00:03:48.440> in<00:03:48.650> on<00:03:48.800> the<00:03:48.920> top<00:03:49.130> and<00:03:49.840> then

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
the second spoke in on the top and then

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.440 
the second spoke in on the top and then
you<00:03:50.870> just<00:03:51.020> go<00:03:51.320> around<00:03:51.620> and<00:03:51.800> do<00:03:51.950> all<00:03:52.180> eight<00:03:53.180> on

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
you just go around and do all eight on

00:03:53.450 --> 00:04:01.050 
you just go around and do all eight on
top<00:03:53.690> so<00:03:54.200> skip<00:03:55.190> a<00:03:55.220> whole<00:03:56.560> drop<00:03:57.560> a<00:03:57.590> spoke<00:03:59.560> and<00:04:00.560> now

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
top so skip a whole drop a spoke and now

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.360 
top so skip a whole drop a spoke and now
it's<00:04:02.060> easy<00:04:02.300> because<00:04:02.570> that'll<00:04:02.930> go<00:04:03.080> in<00:04:03.320> just<00:04:04.100> to

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
it's easy because that'll go in just to

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.350 
it's easy because that'll go in just to
the<00:04:04.489> right<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:07.220> one<00:04:07.430> that<00:04:07.640> was<00:04:07.820> there<00:04:08.090> from

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
the right the one that was there from

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.970 
the right the one that was there from
the<00:04:08.510> first<00:04:08.690> patch<00:04:09.820> pull<00:04:10.820> on<00:04:10.970> it<00:04:11.770> and<00:04:12.770> there<00:04:12.890> you

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
the first patch pull on it and there you

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.409 
the first patch pull on it and there you
go<00:04:13.130> all<00:04:13.459> the<00:04:13.580> way<00:04:13.610> around<00:04:15.910> okay<00:04:16.910> time<00:04:17.180> for<00:04:17.209> the

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
go all the way around okay time for the

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.240 
go all the way around okay time for the
third<00:04:17.720> set<00:04:18.049> and<00:04:18.079> I<00:04:18.260> think<00:04:18.470> the<00:04:18.530> third<00:04:18.709> set<00:04:19.040> is

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
third set and I think the third set is

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.870 
third set and I think the third set is
the<00:04:19.730> most<00:04:20.150> complicated<00:04:21.370> so<00:04:22.370> according<00:04:22.820> the

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
the most complicated so according the

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.360 
the most complicated so according the
book<00:04:23.090> you<00:04:23.240> drop<00:04:23.510> all<00:04:23.780> eight<00:04:24.100> spokes<00:04:25.100> down

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
book you drop all eight spokes down

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.030 
book you drop all eight spokes down
through<00:04:25.760> it<00:04:26.140> every<00:04:27.140> time<00:04:27.320> I've<00:04:27.530> tried<00:04:27.710> that

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:28.040 
through it every time I've tried that

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.710 
through it every time I've tried that
I've<00:04:28.250> just<00:04:28.460> made<00:04:28.610> a<00:04:28.669> huge<00:04:29.000> mess<00:04:29.240> so<00:04:29.480> I'm<00:04:29.570> going

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
I've just made a huge mess so I'm going

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.659 
I've just made a huge mess so I'm going
to<00:04:29.780> drop<00:04:29.960> one<00:04:30.130> spoke<00:04:31.130> down<00:04:33.310> and<00:04:34.310> what<00:04:34.430> you<00:04:34.550> do

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
to drop one spoke down and what you do

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:37.630 
to drop one spoke down and what you do
is<00:04:34.850> you<00:04:34.910> turn<00:04:35.090> the<00:04:35.210> whole<00:04:35.330> thing<00:04:35.360> over<00:04:36.520> flip<00:04:37.520> it

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
is you turn the whole thing over flip it

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:48.129 
is you turn the whole thing over flip it
over<00:04:37.760> and

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:52.579 

so<00:04:49.139> here's<00:04:49.379> the<00:04:49.529> spoke<00:04:49.800> coming<00:04:50.580> out<00:04:51.589> before

00:04:52.579 --> 00:04:52.589 
so here's the spoke coming out before

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:54.439 
so here's the spoke coming out before
you<00:04:52.709> can<00:04:52.830> attach<00:04:53.129> it<00:04:53.159> you<00:04:53.610> have<00:04:53.789> to<00:04:53.939> spin<00:04:54.239> this

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
you can attach it you have to spin this

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.540 
you can attach it you have to spin this
thing<00:04:54.509> so<00:04:55.080> it's<00:04:55.259> time<00:04:55.499> to<00:04:55.529> rotate<00:04:55.949> it<00:04:56.369> and

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
thing so it's time to rotate it and

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.749 
thing so it's time to rotate it and
you're<00:04:56.729> going<00:04:56.879> to<00:04:56.909> rotate<00:04:57.689> it<00:04:57.899> I<00:04:58.489> would<00:04:59.489> say

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 
you're going to rotate it I would say

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:06.339 
you're going to rotate it I would say
you're<00:04:59.909> going<00:05:00.029> to<00:05:00.059> rotate<00:05:00.239> it<00:05:00.509> to<00:05:00.629> the<00:05:00.659> right

00:05:06.339 --> 00:05:06.349 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:09.589 

so<00:05:07.349> you<00:05:07.439> should<00:05:07.739> be<00:05:07.830> seeking<00:05:08.610> at<00:05:08.819> the<00:05:09.209> spokes

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599 
so you should be seeking at the spokes

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:13.159 
so you should be seeking at the spokes
now<00:05:09.899> coming<00:05:10.259> off<00:05:10.469> at<00:05:10.919> an<00:05:11.219> angle<00:05:11.899> and<00:05:12.899> this

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
now coming off at an angle and this

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:20.209 
now coming off at an angle and this
spoke<00:05:13.619> is<00:05:14.389> going<00:05:15.389> to<00:05:15.479> go<00:05:16.459> in<00:05:17.459> the<00:05:17.939> same<00:05:18.360> line<00:05:19.319> :

00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:20.219 
spoke is going to go in the same line :

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:22.579 
spoke is going to go in the same line :
error<00:05:20.459> in<00:05:20.669> the<00:05:20.759> way<00:05:20.789> with<00:05:21.239> this<00:05:21.419> boat<00:05:21.719> it's<00:05:22.469> got

00:05:22.579 --> 00:05:22.589 
error in the way with this boat it's got

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:27.109 
error in the way with this boat it's got
to<00:05:22.679> go<00:05:22.769> under<00:05:22.979> this<00:05:23.249> one<00:05:23.659> so<00:05:25.729> it's<00:05:26.729> going<00:05:26.909> to<00:05:26.999> go

00:05:27.109 --> 00:05:27.119 
to go under this one so it's going to go

00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:32.659 
to go under this one so it's going to go
like<00:05:27.360> this<00:05:27.389> basically<00:05:29.179> here<00:05:31.399> how<00:05:32.399> can<00:05:32.579> I

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
like this basically here how can I

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:36.139 
like this basically here how can I
describe<00:05:32.999> that<00:05:33.119> to<00:05:33.509> you<00:05:34.489> is<00:05:35.489> that<00:05:35.639> correct

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:36.149 
describe that to you is that correct

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:42.589 
describe that to you is that correct
it's<00:05:37.079> a<00:05:37.169> correct<00:05:37.469> is<00:05:37.889> that<00:05:37.949> correct<00:05:38.759> that<00:05:41.599> is

correct so what it's going to do is it's
going<00:05:46.829> to<00:05:46.919> go<00:05:47.039> in<00:05:47.159> the<00:05:47.249> same<00:05:47.489> line<00:05:47.789> as<00:05:48.089> this

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:48.269 
going to go in the same line as this

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:49.999 
going to go in the same line as this
spoke<00:05:48.539> it's<00:05:48.749> right<00:05:48.959> next<00:05:49.229> to<00:05:49.319> that<00:05:49.349> spokes<00:05:49.829> at

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:50.009 
spoke it's right next to that spokes at

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:51.319 
spoke it's right next to that spokes at
least<00:05:50.159> two<00:05:50.309> spokes<00:05:50.639> right<00:05:50.909> next<00:05:51.119> to<00:05:51.209> each

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:51.329 
least two spokes right next to each

00:05:51.329 --> 00:05:53.869 
least two spokes right next to each
other<00:05:51.559> it's<00:05:52.559> come<00:05:52.769> down<00:05:52.800> and<00:05:53.099> detach<00:05:53.429> in<00:05:53.639> here

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.669 
but has to go under this boat so getting
it<00:05:56.789> under<00:05:56.969> that<00:05:57.059> spoke<00:05:57.449> twist<00:05:58.439> it<00:05:58.589> a<00:05:58.649> little

00:05:58.669 --> 00:05:58.679 
it under that spoke twist it a little

00:05:58.679 --> 00:06:05.989 
it under that spoke twist it a little
bit<00:05:58.979> and<00:05:59.189> then<00:06:01.550> into<00:06:02.550> that<00:06:02.579> hole<00:06:04.490> now<00:06:05.490> it's

00:06:05.989 --> 00:06:05.999 
bit and then into that hole now it's

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:08.239 
bit and then into that hole now it's
when<00:06:06.319> attaching<00:06:07.319> the<00:06:07.379> spokes<00:06:07.679> gets<00:06:07.949> a<00:06:08.039> little

00:06:08.239 --> 00:06:08.249 
when attaching the spokes gets a little

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:11.869 
when attaching the spokes gets a little
more<00:06:08.369> complicated<00:06:10.519> so<00:06:11.519> I<00:06:11.550> have<00:06:11.699> these<00:06:11.819> little

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:11.879 
more complicated so I have these little

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:19.619 
more complicated so I have these little
forceps<00:06:14.269> which<00:06:15.269> help<00:06:15.599> me<00:06:16.069> insert<00:06:17.069> the<00:06:17.309> spokes

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:19.629 
forceps which help me insert the spokes

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:40.310 
forceps which help me insert the spokes
whoops

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.320 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:48.920 

screwdriver

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:48.930 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:50.159 

okay

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:50.169 
okay

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:56.180 
okay
so<00:06:50.470> there<00:06:50.650> it<00:06:50.740> is<00:06:51.990> do<00:06:52.990> one<00:06:53.169> more<00:06:53.940> so<00:06:54.940> next<00:06:55.330> one

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:56.190 
so there it is do one more so next one

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.379 
so there it is do one more so next one
that<00:06:57.190> means<00:06:57.370> the<00:06:57.520> spoke<00:06:57.790> has<00:06:58.000> to<00:06:58.120> come<00:06:58.270> up

00:06:58.379 --> 00:06:58.389 
that means the spoke has to come up

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:03.330 
that means the spoke has to come up
through<00:06:58.600> the<00:06:58.660> other<00:06:58.840> side<00:07:00.990> so<00:07:02.070> through<00:07:03.070> the<00:07:03.160> up

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:03.340 
through the other side so through the up

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:10.370 
through the other side so through the up
side<00:07:03.700> and<00:07:04.600> down<00:07:05.820> around<00:07:07.080> under<00:07:08.080> this<00:07:08.320> spoke

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:10.380 
side and down around under this spoke

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:16.220 
side and down around under this spoke
over<00:07:11.380> that<00:07:11.830> spoke<00:07:12.430> in<00:07:12.850> that<00:07:12.910> hole<00:07:13.450> right<00:07:13.870> there

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:16.230 

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.540 

well<00:07:17.230> that<00:07:17.500> looks<00:07:17.650> good<00:07:17.860> you<00:07:18.070> can<00:07:18.190> start<00:07:18.370> to

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:18.550 
well that looks good you can start to

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:22.740 
well that looks good you can start to
see<00:07:18.730> that<00:07:18.910> these<00:07:19.290> spokes<00:07:20.340> are<00:07:21.340> in<00:07:22.330> the<00:07:22.419> same

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:22.750 
see that these spokes are in the same

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:35.670 
see that these spokes are in the same
plane<00:07:23.850> and<00:07:25.560> then<00:07:26.560> once<00:07:27.250> again<00:07:30.180> forceps<00:07:34.080> to<00:07:35.080> put

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 
plane and then once again forceps to put

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.980 
plane and then once again forceps to put
that<00:07:35.830> through<00:07:36.010> here<00:07:36.990> and<00:07:39.630> see<00:07:40.630> if<00:07:40.690> I<00:07:40.810> could

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:40.990 
that through here and see if I could

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:46.350 
that through here and see if I could
just<00:07:41.110> screw

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:46.360 

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:53.310 

okay<00:07:46.960> so<00:07:47.289> there<00:07:47.590> -<00:07:47.800> and<00:07:48.520> then<00:07:49.889> the<00:07:50.889> other<00:07:50.919> six
