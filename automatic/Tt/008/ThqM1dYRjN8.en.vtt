 let's make coconut milk and cream 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.320
 coconut because there are many people who do not 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.849
 get coconut milk normally like this 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.439
 we had planned to do it then let's go 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:23.990
 to make also the almond cream 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.300
 but good to start we have we are going to 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.910
 make almost a liter of coconut milk with 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.919
 coconut in delicious then we will do 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.649
 cream the cocuyo coarse and cucu turkish 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:36.430
 because we love the coconut 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:40.510
 this blog we are going to put 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:43.890
 almost 400 grams or I have 375 grams of 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:48.809
 grated coconut can use 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:56.070
 also a little 372 also very well 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:58.500
 yes no 370 170 not very well we have 375 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.820
 grams of grated coconut and we're going to 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.700
 throw 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.839
 34 liters of water or 3 cup of water 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.839
 boiling water has to be 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:13.240
 First 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.789
 if you can let it rest for a while and 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.530
 then he beats it but good depends on the 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:19.530
 blender you have to have 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.299
 well now let's go pouring cold water 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:33.939
 this does not move much down but not 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.939
 it matters to throw a cup of cold water 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.870
 well let's go throwing a cup more than 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.720
 cold water let's go live l please 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:47.760
 delicious 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.760
 when I put 345 you're 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.350
 good 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:16.140
 3 4 5 6 a cup is needed and little to 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.140
 little bit a little bit 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.030
 do not 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.390
 good even though we miss him then 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.160
 three cups of hot water first well 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.920
 boiling and then three cups of water 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.010
 Cold this is still warm so 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:43.430
 Be careful not to burn 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.430
 I have this bag springs to the air 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.090
 let's filter 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.040
 test because it burns but better to do it 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.019
 in hot so we get all the right 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.019
 coconut oil also 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.320
 before 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.140
 you can find your hands with cold water 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.580
 to be able to squeeze the well so does not 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.050
 they burn the same is not so hot 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.360
 we're 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.520
 very well then here we have our 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.680
 liter or liter and quarter coconut milk 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.140
 If I think I have coconut cream, we will 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.630
 cool the milk well for two days 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.390
 is where you have a film paper 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.520
 we cool it 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.310
 and then we remove the fat to make a 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.860
 cream yes and with this coconut that we have left 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.000
 one as I had said is to do a little bit 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:57.970
 more milk or also the other option 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.550
 would be to make coconut cookies for example 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.070
 or whatever you want with coconut I'm going to make you 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.390
 some cookies and I'm going to keep this 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:08.310
 can put between a bag and also 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.310
 Freeze it if you are not going to use it now 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:15.000
 well two days have passed and the milk of 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:17.280
 coconut was in the fridge then 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.070
 see how it has separated I do not know if it 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.970
 go from there the fat has been separated from 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.030
 liquid 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.680
 if the many to re-mix then 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.070
 with a spoon I can remove the 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.070
 grease 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.300
 I had better a skimmer 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.990
 I do want to separate the fat from the 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.750
 milk but then if I want to make sure 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.450
 other things better 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:54.660
 beat the milk to homogenize 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.480
 so that everything is mixed and used here 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.010
 now because I want to use the fat 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.990
 only to make a whipped cream one 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:06.560
 whipped cream or a chantilly cream 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:11.360
 and it's already there we have how to get milk 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:14.390
 and coconut fat this has been all for 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.630
 now friends, see you in the next 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.630
