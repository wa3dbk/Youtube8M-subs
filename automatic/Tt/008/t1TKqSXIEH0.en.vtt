that is it high like 38 hundreds oh but
at<00:01:57.390> my<00:01:57.479> level<00:01:57.509> will<00:01:57.810> still<00:01:58.079> find<00:01:58.320> like<00:01:58.560> 13<00:01:59.369> 15

end<00:02:28.030> with<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.510> wizard<00:02:28.810> power<00:02:28.989> are<00:02:29.469> the<00:02:29.859> reason

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
end with the wizard power are the reason

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.339 
end with the wizard power are the reason
why<00:02:30.250> this<00:02:30.280> strategy<00:02:30.849> is<00:02:30.879> so<00:02:31.030> powerful<00:02:31.349> is

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
why this strategy is so powerful is

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.170 
why this strategy is so powerful is
because<00:02:32.409> the<00:02:32.950> Hogs<00:02:33.129> have<00:02:33.370> perfect<00:02:33.819> amount<00:02:34.030> of

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
because the Hogs have perfect amount of

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.059 
because the Hogs have perfect amount of
health<00:02:34.389> where<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:35.079> hit<00:02:35.200> point<00:02:35.439> or<00:02:35.680> where<00:02:35.920> the

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
health where the hit point or where the

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.129 
health where the hit point or where the
heel<00:02:36.370> suppose<00:02:36.609> works<00:02:36.849> perfectly<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:38.079> the

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:38.139 
heel suppose works perfectly and the

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:39.750 
heel suppose works perfectly and the
healing<00:02:38.560> spells<00:02:38.829> i'm<00:02:39.069> not<00:02:39.250> sure<00:02:39.340> how<00:02:39.549> long

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
healing spells i'm not sure how long

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.979 
healing spells i'm not sure how long
they<00:02:39.879> last<00:02:39.909> but<00:02:40.239> they<00:02:40.299> last<00:02:40.510> a<00:02:40.629> pretty<00:02:40.840> long

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
they last but they last a pretty long

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.990 
they last but they last a pretty long
time<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.500> once<00:02:42.099> they<00:02:42.280> tear<00:02:42.489> out<00:02:42.609> all<00:02:42.639> the

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
time and once they tear out all the

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.759 
time and once they tear out all the
defense's<00:02:43.450> it's<00:02:43.629> game<00:02:43.870> over<00:02:43.900> so<00:02:44.439> that's<00:02:44.620> why

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
defense's it's game over so that's why

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.619 
defense's it's game over so that's why
the<00:02:44.829> strategy<00:02:45.340> is<00:02:45.459> much<00:02:46.030> better<00:02:46.269> than<00:02:46.329> any

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
the strategy is much better than any

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.270 
the strategy is much better than any
other<00:02:46.780> strategy<00:02:47.169> out<00:02:47.290> there<00:02:47.470> i'm<00:02:47.950> not<00:02:48.129> sure

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
other strategy out there i'm not sure

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.649 
other strategy out there i'm not sure
why<00:02:48.549> I<00:02:48.579> didn't<00:02:48.879> think<00:02:48.909> of<00:02:49.120> this<00:02:49.209> a<00:02:49.269> long<00:02:49.450> time

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:49.659 
why I didn't think of this a long time

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.270 
why I didn't think of this a long time
ago<00:02:49.720> because<00:02:50.169> i've<00:02:50.319> been<00:02:50.349> using<00:02:50.560> blue<00:02:50.889> minion
