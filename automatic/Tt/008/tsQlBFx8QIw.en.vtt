00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
a lot control center as you might have

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.120 
a lot control center as you might have
heard<00:00:09.630> from<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.110> water<00:00:10.320> camera<00:00:10.830> there's<00:00:10.980> been

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
heard from the water camera there's been

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.370 
heard from the water camera there's been
some<00:00:11.309> lion<00:00:11.519> activity<00:00:12.090> not<00:00:12.809> so<00:00:12.929> roaring<00:00:13.259> the

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
some lion activity not so roaring the

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.959 
some lion activity not so roaring the
last<00:00:13.620> just<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.009> few<00:00:14.160> minutes<00:00:14.429> ago<00:00:14.519> heard<00:00:14.790> them

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
last just a few minutes ago heard them

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.670 
last just a few minutes ago heard them
again<00:00:15.240> so<00:00:15.839> we<00:00:15.929> can<00:00:15.960> hit<00:00:16.170> up<00:00:16.320> in<00:00:16.440> that<00:00:16.560> direction

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
again so we can hit up in that direction

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.290 
again so we can hit up in that direction
I<00:00:17.010> think<00:00:17.279> there<00:00:17.400> might<00:00:17.520> be<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.730> little<00:00:17.880> bit<00:00:18.090> far

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
I think there might be a little bit far

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.700 
I think there might be a little bit far
north<00:00:18.570> for<00:00:18.750> us<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.960> find<00:00:19.170> there<00:00:19.320> might<00:00:19.439> be<00:00:19.470> in

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
north for us to find there might be in

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.099 
north for us to find there might be in
typical<00:00:20.130> sukar<00:00:20.430> neighboring<00:00:20.820> area<00:00:21.090> but<00:00:21.779> we're

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
typical sukar neighboring area but we're

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.269 
typical sukar neighboring area but we're
gonna<00:00:22.199> nonetheless<00:00:22.410> go<00:00:22.769> up<00:00:22.890> towards<00:00:23.189> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
gonna nonetheless go up towards the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.529 
gonna nonetheless go up towards the
boundary<00:00:23.580> area<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:23.880> see<00:00:24.029> maybe<00:00:24.210> we<00:00:24.359> get<00:00:24.480> lucky

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
activities up in the north like I said

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.180

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
but they're gonna promise yet but we

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.470 
but they're gonna promise yet but we
should<00:01:31.370> have<00:01:31.400> a<00:01:31.610> lot<00:01:31.790> more<00:01:31.970> information<00:01:32.120> on

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 
should have a lot more information on

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.370 
should have a lot more information on
those<00:01:32.600> during<00:01:32.900> the<00:01:32.960> course<00:01:33.200> of<00:01:33.290> the<00:01:33.380> drive<00:01:33.620> and

those during the course of the drive and

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.480 
those during the course of the drive and
unfortunately<00:01:36.380> it<00:01:36.560> might<00:01:36.740> be<00:01:37.040> the<00:01:37.130> happiest

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
unfortunately it might be the happiest

unfortunately it might be the happiest
profession<00:01:38.120> I<00:01:38.210> think<00:01:38.420> there's<00:01:39.400> lace<00:01:40.400> lines<00:01:40.670> in

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:52.890 
profession I think there's lace lines in
this<00:01:41.090> area<00:01:41.330> than<00:01:41.450> there<00:01:41.570> were<00:01:41.720> yesterday

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
this is what we were expecting for quite

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.950 
this is what we were expecting for quite
a<00:05:02.320> while<00:05:03.389> firstly<00:05:04.389> I<00:05:04.510> thought<00:05:04.690> it<00:05:04.780> would<00:05:04.870> have

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
a while firstly I thought it would have

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.330 
a while firstly I thought it would have
happened<00:05:05.080> earlier<00:05:05.530> but<00:05:05.710> it<00:05:05.800> seems<00:05:06.040> it's<00:05:06.220> now

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
happened earlier but it seems it's now

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.430 
happened earlier but it seems it's now
in<00:05:06.490> the<00:05:06.520> process<00:05:06.910> of<00:05:07.030> happening<00:05:07.150> this<00:05:07.440> for

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
in the process of happening this for

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.960 
in the process of happening this for
miles<00:05:08.740> the<00:05:08.889> five<00:05:09.070> big<00:05:09.280> males<00:05:09.490> have<00:05:09.639> come<00:05:09.820> up

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
miles the five big males have come up

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.120 
miles the five big males have come up
north<00:05:10.210> and<00:05:10.450> they're<00:05:11.229> now<00:05:11.350> fully<00:05:11.680> aware<00:05:11.889> of<00:05:12.070> a

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
north and they're now fully aware of a

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.100 
north and they're now fully aware of a
big<00:05:12.280> part<00:05:12.520> of<00:05:12.580> females<00:05:12.940> that<00:05:13.030> they<00:05:13.270> previously

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
big part of females that they previously

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.960 
big part of females that they previously
were<00:05:14.470> sort<00:05:14.800> of<00:05:14.830> marginally<00:05:15.460> aware<00:05:15.669> of<00:05:15.820> early

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
were sort of marginally aware of early

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.580 
were sort of marginally aware of early
and<00:05:18.120> it<00:05:19.120> could<00:05:19.330> be<00:05:19.479> a<00:05:19.510> very<00:05:19.720> volatile<00:05:20.169> few<00:05:20.440> days

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
and it could be a very volatile few days

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.860 
and it could be a very volatile few days
coming<00:05:20.979> along<00:05:21.210> it's<00:05:22.210> gonna<00:05:22.330> turn<00:05:22.570> a<00:05:22.630> little

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
coming along it's gonna turn a little

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.110 
coming along it's gonna turn a little
bit
