00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.030
 Yummy with nuts and 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.710
 settlements to others like that and now 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.880
 comes my personal highlight 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:52.110
 the purchase that no device from the bio 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.939
 snack i what a stupid name but that 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.880
 is not a device is so 3 level 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.740
 practical and 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.899
 So far I 've always only been like that 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.789
 had a glass and has always been 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.259
 on the plate balance graced with even 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:05.020
 the moisture does not stay that way 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.130
 in the glasshouse alfalfa bred and 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.960
 now I do not have it in any way 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.880
 device because I really have since 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.830
 months are no device that well 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.330
 I still lived at home and now 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.400
 I have finally realized 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.739
 me as a little of it hollow-leg person 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.590
 Wealth little I'll pack that out of her 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.060
 can you see what that looks like 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.989
 So that's no device now 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.489
 three levels 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.290
 that works well so that through 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.330
 these red parts are still water 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.739
 once passed down and so on 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.330
 the water end down that is you 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.660
 you have to pour a day like that 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.760
 and yes, you have three here 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.220
 There are no different varieties in there 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.720
 Now I have beans with me 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.709
 but still two built as 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.170
 I'll show you now 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.730
 that is not the tradition i once 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.500
 Love radish and thought that's me 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.870
 a very good thing so picard sharp 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.400
 I always like things very much and completely 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:56.010
 honestly come in this vast part 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:58.900
 forever I must and must love dear 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:02.650
 dressing unselfish and that's what I think 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.470
 totally cool and there I have this 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.959
 sprossen just needed and then have 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.489
 I look yet of the nature programs so 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.590
 yogurt brought occasionally finds 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.120
 to have a good home 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.620
 whether in the evening if I still have one 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.530
 have a little hunger in oatmeal 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.329
 and fruits or something or just around 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.579
 to do anyway anyway or something and so 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:23.290
 that's why even yogurt that was it 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.609
 already detail from the boom has come now 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.810
 We are practically the normal supermarket 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.430
 I would just share now 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.569
 Hurry up, because the camera is looking 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.989
 which we are loaded 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.910
 and now you can bananas 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.739
 I always buy good organic fairtrade 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.470
 bananas in the supermarket so I was now 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:41.290
 at net and look there that I am 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.580
 There is always bio buy bio and that is 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.550
 then 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.840
 took over here and even more bananas 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.170
 with men so I need many 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.940
 bananas because bananas are banana content 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.110
 very many dates minerals and such 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:59.080
 Further, especially in the morning in uci too 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.040
 or frozen and then as handy 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.010
 if that is very good 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:07.390
 then I brought that is now 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:10.000
 also bio in 323 kg it also back in 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.200
 delicious indulgence beetroot because then I 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.370
 I had the pleasure to do so 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.600
 I can also see there I can 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.019
 determines what to do with it 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.250
 wholegrain penner so i buy if i have 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.769

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.340
 wholegrain pasta and son I have you 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.990
 now brought an orange line 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.160
 and also as good of alpro me 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.900
 knows he is set 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.450
 but I thought I would like that 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.280
 support that business now 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.470
 lead more because I am totally surprised 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.880
 that was all now vacated 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.830
 has and now in the extra for 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.450
 lactose free and alpro 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.380
 leads and I wanted to support that 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.940
 I do not want her out of that 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.889
 I take that a good thing 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.390
 finds goes in the right direction and 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.530
 so I still brought 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:52.120
 then also very spectacular red cabbage 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.680
 smoker I 'm glad if I have time 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.570
 which one do we have the one else? 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.700
 rarely gets because in some dishes 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.660
 then you need flat and therefore have 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.610
 I also brought with me 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.750
 Unfortunately Sauerkraut I make in bio 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.160
 thought of it with increasing 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.300
 important about beamer brought because I 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:10.780
 knows it tastes better but good 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:12.580
 I still have organic tomatoes olive oil 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.260
 I always brought it with me 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.910
 I like it a lot and that's where I come from 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.860
 quick and it means now 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.440
 all been 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.150
 potatoes again organic and onions 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.979
 I use about a bag like that 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.419
 more on week so I have to 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:27.700
 also onions and above all 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:29.580
 just buy garlic and another one 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.110
 lettuce 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.370
 yes that's such a typical purchase 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.630
 I practically Kill every week 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.010
 However , I can do with such things 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.390
 like for example how I bought now 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.970
 synonymous to one and a half weeks or gone 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:43.240
 So shopping in the supermarket now has 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.289
 I have to cost 30 euros in the biomarkt 40 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.669
 because I 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:48.490
 that no war bought it was already 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:50.289
 so it's logical for the 20 euros so far 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.939
 you do not buy in the days but 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:54.039
 so are the things that I generally 

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:58.779
 usually buy more and more 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:06:00.309
 garlic while kurabi broccoli 

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:02.830
 Cauliflower but I have it now 

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:04.479
 something else in the refrigerator and yes 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.939
 These are just as much the basics I buy 

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:08.860
 I would say that is to 85 

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:10.360
 percent organic buys if you say so 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.189
 So I can buy his supermarket 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.689
 at the biomarket it's just me 

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:15.639
 Part I compared that I can 

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:18.459
 Honestly as a student and not 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:20.259
 now do everything in organic brand 

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:22.869
 but I buy his a bio 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:24.219
 when it comes fairtrade in the supermarket 

00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:25.899
 yes, these seals have them too 

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:27.399
 are really organic and so on 

00:06:25.899 --> 00:06:29.740
 So I definitely notice 

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:32.110
 for example when when onions garlic 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.509
 and because you realize it 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.009
 just that taste it 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:37.209
 biological farming is necessary to halt 

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:40.689
 Just say so because they say 

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:41.919
 me vegetable broth or something and yes me 

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:43.479
 I thought I'll show you this 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:46.479
 I am interested and so what I am 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:47.740
 like shopping and if you like mine 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:49.479
 did not want to have this review 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.099
 regulated then I make you who like 

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:52.870
 Just let me know 

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:55.269
 you do that and then maybe in 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.620
 my on my homepage or too 

00:06:55.269 --> 00:06:58.509
 here as a video 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.349
 because the homepage is almost ready and 

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:03.459
 if you then, of course, the link and so 

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:07.169
 and yes then I wish you one more 

00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:07.169
 wonderful day and see you soon
