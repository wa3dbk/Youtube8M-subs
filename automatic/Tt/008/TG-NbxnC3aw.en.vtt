shaken bakes one you can pick either one
but<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.700> prefer<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.090> top<00:00:42.270> one<00:00:42.480> because<00:00:42.780> only

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
but I prefer the top one because only

but I prefer the top one because only
gives<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:43.920> more<00:00:44.070> tasks<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.700> do<00:00:44.960> now<00:00:45.960> pick<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
before pick the thunder and then you

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.810 
before pick the thunder and then you
know<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.469> comes<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.280> screen<00:00:53.550> where

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
know it comes to that the screen where

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.750 
know it comes to that the screen where
the<00:00:54.059> only<00:00:54.300> access<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.750> bunch<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.170> questions

you<00:01:51.780> can<00:01:51.930> play<00:01:52.049> 4<00:01:52.259> or<00:01:52.320> 5<00:01:52.470> if<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.770> want<00:01:53.479> but<00:01:54.479> I

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
you can play 4 or 5 if you want but I

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.459 
you can play 4 or 5 if you want but I
prefer<00:01:54.689> 3<00:01:55.560> less<00:01:56.070> time<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:57.360> get<00:01:57.600> as<00:01:57.810> much<00:01:58.020> BC

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
prefer 3 less time you get as much BC

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.270 
prefer 3 less time you get as much BC
you<00:01:58.770> know

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
you know

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.150 
you know
but<00:01:59.460> when<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.730> win<00:01:59.940> a<00:01:59.970> two-minute<00:02:00.690> game<00:02:01.350> you

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
but when you win a two-minute game you

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.750 
but when you win a two-minute game you
get<00:02:02.370> 240<00:02:03.360> BC<00:02:03.650> and<00:02:04.650> what<00:02:05.190> you<00:02:05.310> got<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.550> do<00:02:05.670> is

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
get 240 BC and what you got to do is

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.710 
get 240 BC and what you got to do is
when<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.940> game<00:02:06.120> starts

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
when the game starts

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.600 
when the game starts
don't<00:02:07.170> make<00:02:07.530> any<00:02:07.830> shots<00:02:08.130> miss<00:02:08.460> on<00:02:08.580> purpose

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
don't make any shots miss on purpose

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.240 
don't make any shots miss on purpose
until<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.300> have<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.570> make<00:02:09.720> a<00:02:09.750> shot<00:02:10.070> then<00:02:11.070> once

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
until you have to make a shot then once

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.890 
until you have to make a shot then once
you<00:02:11.340> miss<00:02:11.490> on<00:02:11.640> purpose<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:12.150> clock<00:02:12.660> doesn't

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
you miss on purpose the clock doesn't

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.440 
you miss on purpose the clock doesn't
stop<00:02:13.260> only<00:02:14.040> gonna<00:02:14.160> quarter<00:02:14.490> ends<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:15.210> you<00:02:15.300> have

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
stop only gonna quarter ends so you have

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.120 
stop only gonna quarter ends so you have
to<00:02:15.510> worry<00:02:15.660> about<00:02:15.690> no<00:02:15.959> files<00:02:16.260> no<00:02:16.650> out<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.010> bounds

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
to worry about no files no out of bounds

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.370 
to worry about no files no out of bounds
now<00:02:17.640> that<00:02:17.880> just<00:02:18.030> missed<00:02:18.270> on<00:02:18.420> purpose<00:02:18.450> until

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
now that just missed on purpose until

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.130 
now that just missed on purpose until
you<00:02:19.500> gotta<00:02:19.680> make<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.920> shot<00:02:20.190> after<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.060> game<00:02:21.300> you

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
you gotta make a shot after the game you

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.500 
you gotta make a shot after the game you
look<00:02:22.350> into<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:23.160> question<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.820> as<00:02:24.270> you<00:02:24.390> can

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
look into the question and as you can

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.080 
look into the question and as you can
see<00:02:24.570> you<00:02:25.320> get<00:02:25.500> what<00:02:26.000> 240<00:02:27.000> BC<00:02:27.380> now<00:02:28.910> redoing<00:02:29.910> this

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
see you get what 240 BC now redoing this

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.020 
see you get what 240 BC now redoing this
I<00:02:30.270> forgot<00:02:30.630> to<00:02:30.840> record<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.320> second<00:02:31.709> half<00:02:32.000> so<00:02:33.000> I

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
I forgot to record the second half so I

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.280 
I forgot to record the second half so I
had<00:02:33.209> to<00:02:33.300> do<00:02:33.510> it<00:02:33.600> all<00:02:33.690> over<00:02:33.720> again

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
had to do it all over again

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.740 
had to do it all over again
and<00:02:35.130> but<00:02:35.700> this<00:02:35.850> time<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.090> did<00:02:36.239> it<00:02:36.270> with<00:02:36.420> shaking

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
and but this time I did it with shaking

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.620 
and but this time I did it with shaking
big<00:02:36.930> so<00:02:37.080> as<00:02:37.230> you<00:02:37.350> see<00:02:37.530> I<00:02:37.560> want<00:02:37.830> three<00:02:38.040> games<00:02:38.630> and

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
big so as you see I want three games and

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.600 
big so as you see I want three games and
then<00:02:39.930> I'm<00:02:40.050> gonna<00:02:40.170> simulate<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:41.190> rest<00:02:41.430> of<00:02:41.520> the

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
then I'm gonna simulate the rest of the

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.330 
then I'm gonna simulate the rest of the
season<00:02:41.760> now<00:02:42.360> I<00:02:42.720> have<00:02:43.410> more<00:02:43.620> VC<00:02:43.980> because<00:02:44.220> I<00:02:44.250> had

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
season now I have more VC because I had

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.250 
season now I have more VC because I had
to<00:02:44.400> do<00:02:44.520> it<00:02:44.640> twice<00:02:44.820> so<00:02:45.120> that's<00:02:45.780> why<00:02:45.959> we're<00:02:46.140> from

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
to do it twice so that's why we're from

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.620 
to do it twice so that's why we're from
eight<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.620> ten<00:02:46.890> K<00:02:47.190> because<00:02:47.940> I'd<00:02:48.090> actually<00:02:48.450> did

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
eight to ten K because I'd actually did

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.790 
eight to ten K because I'd actually did
it<00:02:48.750> so<00:02:49.050> answer<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:49.950> questions<00:02:50.750> simulate<00:02:51.800> blah

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
it so answer the questions simulate blah

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.410 
it so answer the questions simulate blah
blah<00:02:53.040> blah<00:02:53.310> you<00:02:53.640> know<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.940> rest<00:02:54.150> if<00:02:54.300> you've

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
blah blah you know the rest if you've

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.880 
blah blah you know the rest if you've
done<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.720> glitch<00:02:54.900> before<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.470> know<00:02:55.650> how<00:02:55.830> to

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
done the glitch before you know how to

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.630 
done the glitch before you know how to
do<00:02:56.100> this<00:02:56.480> simulate<00:02:57.480> through<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:58.440> as<00:02:58.950> you<00:02:59.520> can

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
do this simulate through and as you can

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.120 
do this simulate through and as you can
see<00:02:59.700> you'll<00:03:00.060> see<00:03:00.090> that<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:00.540> get<00:03:00.690> done<00:03:01.200> so<00:03:01.860> I<00:03:01.890> did

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
see you'll see that I get done so I did

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.509 
see you'll see that I get done so I did
200<00:03:02.550> BC<00:03:02.880> but<00:03:03.720> what<00:03:03.900> 2k<00:03:04.380> did<00:03:04.650> was<00:03:04.920> they<00:03:05.160> cut<00:03:05.400> it

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
200 BC but what 2k did was they cut it

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.759 
200 BC but what 2k did was they cut it
in<00:03:05.640> half<00:03:05.850> so<00:03:06.090> you<00:03:06.120> want<00:03:06.330> to<00:03:06.390> get<00:03:06.480> a<00:03:06.510> hundred<00:03:06.930> so

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
in half so you want to get a hundred so

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.920 
in half so you want to get a hundred so
that's<00:03:07.950> another<00:03:08.580> 200<00:03:09.120> but<00:03:09.299> so<00:03:09.480> now<00:03:09.600> that<00:03:09.750> makes

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
that's another 200 but so now that makes

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.470 
that's another 200 but so now that makes
it<00:03:10.019> 200<00:03:10.440> cuz<00:03:10.590> I'm<00:03:10.739> splitting<00:03:11.280> in<00:03:11.370> half<00:03:11.480> you

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
it 200 cuz I'm splitting in half you

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.000 
it 200 cuz I'm splitting in half you
know<00:03:12.570> how<00:03:12.630> to<00:03:12.690> do<00:03:12.810> math<00:03:12.989> come<00:03:13.380> on<00:03:13.500> guys<00:03:13.680> you<00:03:13.860> got

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
know how to do math come on guys you got

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.710 
know how to do math come on guys you got
the<00:03:14.100> math<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:15.000> then<00:03:15.150> I<00:03:15.209> should<00:03:15.390> be<00:03:15.420> getting

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
the math and then I should be getting

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.039 
the math and then I should be getting
one<00:03:15.900> more<00:03:16.080> to<00:03:16.980> another<00:03:17.220> 200<00:03:17.840> so<00:03:18.840> when<00:03:18.989> the

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
one more to another 200 so when the

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:19.970 
one more to another 200 so when the
season<00:03:19.410> ends

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
season ends

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.580 
season ends
I<00:03:20.010> should<00:03:20.940> be<00:03:21.000> getting<00:03:21.090> 300<00:03:21.810> BC<00:03:22.140> just<00:03:22.410> because

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
I should be getting 300 BC just because

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.470 
I should be getting 300 BC just because
they<00:03:22.680> split<00:03:22.890> it<00:03:22.980> in<00:03:23.070> half<00:03:23.100> I<00:03:23.519> wish<00:03:24.269> you<00:03:24.360> never

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
they split it in half I wish you never

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.020 
they split it in half I wish you never
did<00:03:24.750> this<00:03:24.780> but<00:03:25.200> hey<00:03:26.040> they<00:03:26.430> want<00:03:26.670> their<00:03:26.820> money

did this but hey they want their money

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.910 
did this but hey they want their money

just<00:04:14.950> like<00:04:15.100> cut<00:04:16.060> it<00:04:16.090> so<00:04:16.480> so<00:04:16.900> that's<00:04:16.990> 200<00:04:17.470> so<00:04:17.560> we

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
just like cut it so so that's 200 so we

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.949 
just like cut it so so that's 200 so we
be<00:04:17.739> getting<00:04:17.890> 100<00:04:18.220> of<00:04:18.310> that<00:04:18.430> one<00:04:18.610> and<00:04:18.910> I<00:04:19.690> think

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
be getting 100 of that one and I think

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.120 
be getting 100 of that one and I think
when<00:04:20.110> you<00:04:20.170> win<00:04:20.290> the<00:04:20.320> championship<00:04:20.860> you<00:04:20.890> get
