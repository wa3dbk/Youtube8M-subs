00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
where to start but I did decide that

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.330

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:06.110 
I was also nervous while watching the
assist<00:06:04.530> trophies<00:06:04.949> being<00:06:05.250> displayed<00:06:05.669> but

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
assist trophies being displayed but

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.930 
assist trophies being displayed but
guess<00:06:06.539> what<00:06:06.840> Isaac<00:06:07.500> wasn't<00:06:07.860> shown<00:06:08.310> to<00:06:08.580> return

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
guess what Isaac wasn't shown to return

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.540 
guess what Isaac wasn't shown to return
his<00:06:09.090> wife<00:06:09.330> sure<00:06:09.930> he's<00:06:10.229> still<00:06:10.470> good<00:06:10.830> but<00:06:11.430> you

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
his wife sure he's still good but you

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:12.920 
his wife sure he's still good but you
would<00:06:11.699> think<00:06:11.849> that<00:06:11.970> they<00:06:12.150> would<00:06:12.180> have<00:06:12.599> that

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
would think that they would have that

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.020 
would think that they would have that
figured<00:06:13.199> out<00:06:13.470> by<00:06:13.740> now<00:06:13.770> nothing<00:06:14.760> from<00:06:14.940> the

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:15.030 
figured out by now nothing from the

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:17.390 
figured out by now nothing from the
direct<00:06:15.330> ruined<00:06:15.810> his<00:06:15.960> chances<00:06:16.500> and<00:06:16.770> this<00:06:17.220> also

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
direct ruined his chances and this also

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.610 
direct ruined his chances and this also
applies<00:06:17.820> to<00:06:17.849> dixie<00:06:18.449> kong<00:06:18.659> as<00:06:18.930> she<00:06:19.229> wasn't

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
applies to dixie kong as she wasn't

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.740 
applies to dixie kong as she wasn't
displayed<00:06:19.979> anywhere<00:06:20.460> interesting<00:06:21.330> though

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
displayed anywhere interesting though

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.659 
displayed anywhere interesting though
did<00:06:22.229> you<00:06:22.349> notice<00:06:22.710> that<00:06:22.740> their<00:06:23.070> work<00:06:23.190> rumblings

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:23.669 
did you notice that their work rumblings

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:26.360 
did you notice that their work rumblings
in<00:06:23.909> the<00:06:24.030> smash<00:06:24.300> run<00:06:24.599> thing<00:06:25.039> does<00:06:26.039> that<00:06:26.159> mean

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
in the smash run thing does that mean

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.689 
in the smash run thing does that mean
that<00:06:26.400> Kim<00:06:26.639> K<00:06:26.820> rool<00:06:27.090> is<00:06:27.360> still<00:06:27.659> a<00:06:27.690> possibility<00:06:27.900> I

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:28.699 
that Kim K rool is still a possibility I

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:30.860 
that Kim K rool is still a possibility I
mean<00:06:29.699> it's<00:06:29.820> not<00:06:29.970> the<00:06:30.150> first<00:06:30.330> time<00:06:30.510> they've

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
mean it's not the first time they've

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.330 
mean it's not the first time they've
appeared<00:06:31.199> and<00:06:31.380> smash<00:06:31.620> I'm<00:06:31.860> pretty<00:06:32.130> sure<00:06:32.220> they

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.340 
appeared and smash I'm pretty sure they

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.670 
appeared and smash I'm pretty sure they
were<00:06:32.400> trophies<00:06:32.729> before<00:06:33.330> but<00:06:34.080> still<00:06:34.409> it's

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
were trophies before but still it's

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.500 
were trophies before but still it's
interesting<00:06:34.950> to<00:06:35.219> think<00:06:35.279> about<00:06:35.520> or<00:06:36.150> maybe<00:06:36.360> it

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510 
interesting to think about or maybe it

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.269 
interesting to think about or maybe it
promotes<00:06:36.810> Dixie<00:06:37.260> Kong<00:06:37.440> because<00:06:37.710> she's<00:06:38.250> a

00:06:38.269 --> 00:06:38.279 
promotes Dixie Kong because she's a

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:40.010 
promotes Dixie Kong because she's a
protagonist<00:06:38.789> and<00:06:39.150> it<00:06:39.300> would<00:06:39.419> be<00:06:39.450> weird<00:06:39.750> to

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 
protagonist and it would be weird to

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.140 
protagonist and it would be weird to
have<00:06:40.139> Kim<00:06:40.440> K<00:06:40.620> rool<00:06:40.889> killing<00:06:41.430> Kremlin's<00:06:41.909> I
