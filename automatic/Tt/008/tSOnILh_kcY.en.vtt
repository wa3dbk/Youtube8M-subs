00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:23.080
 very well that I use very often 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:30.490
 so they are available in 18 mm lo 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:35.280
 it's the biggest and and have decreased 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:37.960

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.489

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.960

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:53.530
 normal marker we can see that they 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:01:00.299

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:09.090

 and the differences between two brothers and 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:28.210
 so and are fine you can do 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:30.789
 coulure two like that so what 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:35.109
 is fine with these markers it's 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:36.909
 that already low they are are reusable 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:43.119

00:01:50.170 --> 00:02:04.700
 this one in god or 10 mm it costs 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:09.440
 of 0.60 and that in 18 mm it costs two 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:14.630
 80 euros in Spain so this is a very 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:17.390
 marker and among them tried not to 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:21.680

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:25.940
