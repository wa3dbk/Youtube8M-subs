00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 hello this third vocal lesson 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.970
 for beginners vocalists especially for 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.179
 those vocalists who play the guitar 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.670
 and so in this lesson we look at this 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.960
 the act is just petka what is it all 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:22.350
 What is the need for a breakdown of what to do 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:26.189
 so descant need to before 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:30.390
 warm up your ligaments by singing that is 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:33.600
 such a warm-up probably remember there on 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.030
 physical education classes at school we first 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.270
 knead there gym when you go 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.950
 and before any kind of loads you 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.399
 warm up there knead the muscles and 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.170
 tendons and everything else 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:50.370
 Wogan have the same warm-up and 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.219
 she is called chanting ie chanting 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.610
 need to warm our 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:59.309
 bundles check and our systems and only 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.899
 after that, start singing full 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.510
 power and so i will give a very simple chanting 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.720
 which everyone can probably do 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:13.560
 so let's go and if you watched the video by 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.770
 my 8 video school bugs Daria there we 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:21.390
 studied scales and we will need yours was 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:24.500
 homo. incomplete 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.500
 a 1 5 notes 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:31.820
 I repeat for those who do not know how to play 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:37.070
 major scale is acceptable when we play 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.950
 bob 5 frets 6 countries and limit 5 by 6 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:49.530
 then 7 form 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:54.039
 Then we play on 5 4 5 and 7 not back and 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.439
 so you should already be able to more or less 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:02:00.369
 get inside that is at least 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:02.469
 understand what it is and now we will 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.560
 get inside which we will play 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:09.060
 parallel to our singing that is, we 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:14.099
 let's play it inside 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.099
 50 and we will punch them 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:24.040
 how it is done just take man's syllable 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:31.140
 em a man and every note we drink 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:39.190
 with this word, that is, there up or down 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:41.320
 show first do it slower then 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:50.910
 there is every touch punch about 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:52.450
 look for sound slowly and clearly 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.870
 experiment as you will 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:03:00.450
 more convenient how better I will beat very 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:03.630
 loud as people sleep with me 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.160
 so I won't wake up the next room 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.340
 it was easy for you to hum 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:16.239
 understand it when you succeed 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:18.459
 We need to sing these five notes 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.320
 move on that is taller and so 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.900
 go and not just go to 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.900
 climb it its such a piece that is 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:35.260
 that is, they repeat just about that 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.260
 next to last 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:44.530
 and this also needs to be pierced, that is, if 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.909
 you play exactly as I will now 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.329
 showed that is all notes 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:51.999
 exactly played up and down but without 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:04:00.010
 any balls to we just remove 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:04:03.299
 flagship circular each note following 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.299
 that is, you get 7 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:16.940
 Further 8 here as I will explain why not 9 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:18.139
 They want to, but it seems to take 9 explain 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.520
 why day 9 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:24.590
 because we go exactly that is 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:29.980
 burnt scale that is, we will start if 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:32.960
 but just for home 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:36.070
 9 from 2 to its sharp 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.070
 she should not much 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.430
 next we need to take 10 here to win 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.660
 not very comfortable anymore so we'll take 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:57.270
 the same minute there which is on the fifth fret 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:05:01.130
 here to the other side just play and 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.130
 so let's go all over again at home 2 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.590
 mother mother 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:23.140
 right at home mom pro 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:27.580
 and so yes where you can find reach 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:32.320
 until about transient but you that is on 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:33.670
 some kind of gardens and your voice will start 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.970
 ends that is, there will already be 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:38.170
 transition to the patient that is, you like all 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.380
 will sing high 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:43.660
 here it is not necessary to find at all for this 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:49.210
 the moment when we break up that is 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:52.720
 a little limiting dynamo that completely 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.380
 sing high because you can hurt 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.600
 bundles 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.010
 that is, we bring a little bit about 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.010
 early here of our limit 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:02.820
 stop and go back and from where 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:07.170
 each have their own range different 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:10.180
 voice type is different so everyone is there 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:12.880
 limit note will be a different transition 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.410
 and lower but it will be different that is who 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.830
 then and so will not be able to take which we 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:19.750
 we start this one and this will be someone 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:26.190
 there may be some middle ground 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:30.600
 bass that is, you can start such an average 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.600
 everyone starts to watch he 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:37.920
 positional can still take on by 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:42.300
 let's say but many people are stupid 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:44.780
 network and still advise dosage vova 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:50.160
 more or less but a lower voice there 

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:53.300
 lower average let's say I have to go 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:56.190
 just wanted to punch and try 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:07:03.510
 there are many things let's say fame can still be 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:06.530
 there she is nature I will not leave any 

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:08.940
 no, you can do the same thing lost 

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:11.520
 note one octave higher 

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:15.419
 again but below the metal that is here at 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:20.370
 us on peat and a 5 country 

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:20.370
 8 Well, try singing and 

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.800
 further d 

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:34.389
 but it is also quite English 

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.590
 principle is to take if someone has a voice 

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:38.290
 see below 

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:40.780
