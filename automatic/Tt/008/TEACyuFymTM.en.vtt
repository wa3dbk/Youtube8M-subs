00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
with without have to worry about putting

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.879 
with without have to worry about putting
a<00:00:08.849> little<00:00:08.970> pieces<00:00:09.179> of<00:00:09.300> plastic<00:00:09.780> in<00:00:09.929> it<00:00:10.050> alright

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
a little pieces of plastic in it alright

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.950 
a little pieces of plastic in it alright
the<00:00:11.400> first<00:00:11.490> sensor<00:00:12.389> is<00:00:12.630> one<00:00:13.290> way<00:00:13.590> back<00:00:14.130> there

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
the first sensor is one way back there

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.200 
the first sensor is one way back there
don't<00:00:15.960> worry<00:00:16.139> about<00:00:16.379> this<00:00:16.529> one<00:00:16.740> right<00:00:16.920> now

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
don't worry about this one right now

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.460 
don't worry about this one right now
second<00:00:18.210> sensor<00:00:18.570> well<00:00:18.840> it's<00:00:18.990> not<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.140> really<00:00:19.380> a

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
second sensor well it's not a really a

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.439 
second sensor well it's not a really a
sensor<00:00:19.830> it's<00:00:19.949> more<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.250> stopping<00:00:20.699> device<00:00:20.789> so

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
sensor it's more of a stopping device so

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.509 
sensor it's more of a stopping device so
it<00:00:21.480> slows<00:00:21.720> down<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.140> game<00:00:22.170> cards<00:00:22.769> goes<00:00:23.340> down

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
it slows down the game cards goes down

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.790 
it slows down the game cards goes down
your<00:00:23.670> little<00:00:23.789> CDs<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.330> stuff<00:00:24.480> like<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:24.800> your

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
your little CDs and stuff like that your

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.240 
your little CDs and stuff like that your
third<00:00:26.160> one<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:27.090> right<00:00:27.359> up<00:00:27.390> here<00:00:27.689> up<00:00:27.900> front

right<00:00:47.190> here<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.640> covered<00:00:48.149> by<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.390> void

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
right here is covered by the void

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.819 
right here is covered by the void
sticker<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.559> completely<00:00:50.160> missed<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.809> so<00:00:51.809> once<00:00:52.739> I

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
sticker I completely missed it so once I

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.619 
sticker I completely missed it so once I
was<00:00:52.949> able<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.219> find<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.730> took<00:00:54.090> off<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.390> void

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
was able to find it I took off the void

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.010 
was able to find it I took off the void
sticker<00:00:54.899> took<00:00:55.410> up<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.590> little<00:00:55.860> piece<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.989> now<00:00:57.989> i

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
sticker took up a little piece and now i

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.229 
sticker took up a little piece and now i
have<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.410> little<00:00:58.620> screwed<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.640> what<00:00:59.820> you<00:00:59.910> do<00:01:00.030> is

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
that you then take off you should just

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.190 
that you then take off you should just
be<00:01:03.149> able<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.449> go<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:04.049> off<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.070> comes<00:01:06.200> another

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
be able to go and off it comes another

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.890 
be able to go and off it comes another
piece<00:01:07.500> okay<00:01:08.030> so<00:01:09.030> actually<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.630> may<00:01:09.750> have

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
piece okay so actually you may have

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.570 
piece okay so actually you may have
difficulties<00:01:10.500> on<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.890> right<00:01:11.070> side<00:01:11.340> just

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
difficulties on the right side just

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.280 
difficulties on the right side just
because<00:01:11.880> it's<00:01:12.150> a<00:01:12.240> little<00:01:12.479> trap<00:01:12.780> miss<00:01:12.990> just

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
because it's a little trap miss just

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.830 
because it's a little trap miss just
kind<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.159> should<00:01:14.310> pop<00:01:14.340> off<00:01:14.700> pop<00:01:14.970> right

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
kind of and it should pop off pop right

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.289 
kind of and it should pop off pop right
off<00:01:15.869> all<00:01:16.770> right<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.460> first<00:01:17.640> one<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.820> down<00:01:18.090> here

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
off all right the first one is down here

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.910 
off all right the first one is down here
I've<00:01:18.509> labeled<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:19.020> with<00:01:19.140> an<00:01:19.290> orange<00:01:19.470> piece<00:01:19.770> of

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
I've labeled it with an orange piece of

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.130 
I've labeled it with an orange piece of
duct<00:01:20.130> tape<00:01:20.189> use<00:01:20.759> duct<00:01:21.150> tape<00:01:21.210> for<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:21.930> back

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
duct tape use duct tape for this back

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.289 
duct tape use duct tape for this back
sensor<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.650> reason<00:01:22.920> why<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.369> because<00:01:23.880> there's

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
sensor the reason why is because there's

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.789 
sensor the reason why is because there's
a<00:01:24.360> lot<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.540> heat<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:24.960> likes<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.259> come<00:01:25.439> back<00:01:25.619> in

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
a lot of heat that likes to come back in

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.510 
a lot of heat that likes to come back in
that<00:01:25.860> area<00:01:26.150> and<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.560> like<00:01:28.560> if<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.799> use<00:01:28.920> really

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
that area and so like if you use really

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.230 
that area and so like if you use really
I'd<00:01:30.210> say<00:01:30.840> light<00:01:31.110> tape<00:01:31.530> such<00:01:31.829> as<00:01:31.970> masking<00:01:32.970> tape

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
I'd say light tape such as masking tape

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.780 
I'd say light tape such as masking tape
scotch<00:01:34.200> tape<00:01:34.590> stuff<00:01:34.829> like<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:34.979> it'll<00:01:35.490> come

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
scotch tape stuff like that it'll come

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.710 
scotch tape stuff like that it'll come
right<00:01:35.820> off<00:01:36.049> so<00:01:37.049> use<00:01:37.560> use<00:01:38.460> duct<00:01:38.729> tape<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:39.570> is

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
right off so use use duct tape that is

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.319 
right off so use use duct tape that is
the<00:01:39.840> best<00:01:39.990> for<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.320> little<00:01:40.530> back<00:01:40.680> sensor<00:01:41.329> okay

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
the best for the little back sensor okay

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.749 
the best for the little back sensor okay
the<00:01:42.509> sensor<00:01:42.960> up<00:01:43.110> here<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.890> right<00:01:44.280> behind<00:01:44.490> the

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
the sensor up here is right behind the

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.840 
the sensor up here is right behind the
power<00:01:44.909> power<00:01:45.600> little<00:01:45.930> power<00:01:46.140> button<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.850> i

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
power power little power button and i

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.450 
power power little power button and i
used<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.990> void<00:01:49.200> tape<00:01:49.530> because<00:01:49.770> i<00:01:49.920> figured<00:01:49.979> you

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
used the void tape because i figured you

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.240 
used the void tape because i figured you
know<00:01:50.579> i<00:01:50.939> mean<00:01:51.329> it's<00:01:51.630> already<00:01:51.810> void<00:01:52.170> why<00:01:52.409> not<00:01:52.590> so

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
know i mean it's already void why not so

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.920 
know i mean it's already void why not so
i<00:01:53.280> use<00:01:53.430> little<00:01:53.729> piece<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:54.030> tape<00:01:54.329> put<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.689> up<00:01:54.780> on

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
i use little piece of tape put it up on

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.480 
i use little piece of tape put it up on
there<00:01:55.110> oh<00:01:56.869> so<00:01:57.869> that's<00:01:58.170> that's<00:01:58.770> those<00:01:59.250> are<00:01:59.399> the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
there oh so that's that's those are the
