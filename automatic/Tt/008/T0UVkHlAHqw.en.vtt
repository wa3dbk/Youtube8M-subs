00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:57.460 
of the pulley the big thing about this
was<00:02:52.160> you<00:02:53.160> you<00:02:53.790> needed<00:02:54.110> wings<00:02:55.110> of<00:02:55.410> flat<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:56.970> you

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
was you you needed wings of flat and you

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.890 
was you you needed wings of flat and you
needed<00:02:58.470> gears<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:59.640> gear<00:02:59.910> so<00:03:00.239> what<00:03:00.420> I<00:03:00.450> decided

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
needed gears the gear so what I decided

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.430 
needed gears the gear so what I decided
to<00:03:01.440> do<00:03:01.709> i<00:03:02.269> decided<00:03:03.269> to<00:03:03.510> had<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:04.620> go<00:03:04.800> from<00:03:06.440> holes

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
to do i decided to had to go from holes

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.680 
to do i decided to had to go from holes
on<00:03:08.630> one<00:03:09.630> side<00:03:10.070> two<00:03:11.070> holes<00:03:11.400> at<00:03:11.850> a<00:03:11.910> 90-degree

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.490 
on one side two holes at a 90-degree
angle<00:03:14.209> if<00:03:15.209> you<00:03:15.480> look<00:03:15.690> closely<00:03:15.989> you'll<00:03:16.440> see

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
angle if you look closely you'll see

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.910 
angle if you look closely you'll see
what<00:03:16.980> i<00:03:17.010> did<00:03:17.340> i<00:03:18.050> mean<00:03:19.050> i'm<00:03:19.290> going<00:03:19.500> to<00:03:19.560> zoom<00:03:19.590> in

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
as it goes up and down well I added a

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.280 
as it goes up and down well I added a
rubber<00:04:08.450> band<00:04:09.220> from<00:04:10.660> by<00:04:11.660> the<00:04:11.720> way<00:04:11.870> you<00:04:11.930> do<00:04:12.140> not

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
rubber band from by the way you do not

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.100 
rubber band from by the way you do not
get<00:04:12.500> this<00:04:12.710> stacked<00:04:13.070> in<00:04:13.670> the<00:04:13.730> ducktail<00:04:14.270> kit<00:04:14.540> nor

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
get this stacked in the ducktail kit nor

get this stacked in the ducktail kit nor
the<00:04:15.550> the<00:04:16.550> rubber<00:04:16.820> bands<00:04:17.420> I<00:04:17.600> added<00:04:18.500> another

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:18.800 
the the rubber bands I added another

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.530 
the the rubber bands I added another
rubberband<00:04:19.400> right<00:04:19.670> there<00:04:19.910> just<00:04:20.180> to<00:04:20.330> give<00:04:20.510> it

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
rubberband right there just to give it

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:28.860 
rubberband right there just to give it
the<00:04:24.460> DISA<00:04:25.460> make<00:04:26.300> it<00:04:26.480> want<00:04:27.080> to<00:04:27.170> go<00:04:27.490> 90<00:04:28.490> degrees

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
the DISA make it want to go 90 degrees

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.920 
the DISA make it want to go 90 degrees
and<00:04:29.870> stay<00:04:30.440> there<00:04:31.240> otherwise<00:04:32.240> it<00:04:32.510> would<00:04:32.660> favor

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
and stay there otherwise it would favor

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.880 
and stay there otherwise it would favor
one<00:04:33.320> side<00:04:33.350> or<00:04:33.800> the<00:04:34.130> other<00:04:34.780> so<00:04:35.780> so<00:04:36.200> in<00:04:36.380> fact<00:04:36.590> that

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
one side or the other so so in fact that

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.500 
one side or the other so so in fact that
is<00:04:37.190> a<00:04:37.460> trip<00:04:39.490> the<00:04:40.490> third<00:04:40.730> thing<00:04:40.760> once<00:04:41.240> you<00:04:41.360> get

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
is a trip the third thing once you get

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.880 
is a trip the third thing once you get
the<00:04:41.690> beam<00:04:41.930> laid<00:04:42.800> out<00:04:43.390> let<00:04:44.390> me<00:04:44.510> just<00:04:44.690> lay<00:04:45.680> this

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
the beam laid out let me just lay this

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.190 
the beam laid out let me just lay this
down<00:04:46.190> a<00:04:46.250> little<00:04:46.400> bit<00:04:46.700> so<00:04:46.910> you<00:04:46.970> can<00:04:47.060> see<00:04:47.200> see

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
down a little bit so you can see see

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.510 
down a little bit so you can see see
there's<00:04:48.440> one<00:04:48.500> long<00:04:49.160> beam<00:04:49.990> see<00:04:50.990> and<00:04:51.490> then<00:04:52.490> I

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
there's one long beam see and then I

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.320 
there's one long beam see and then I
added<00:04:54.160> several<00:04:55.160> additional<00:04:55.820> beans<00:04:56.030> it's

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
added several additional beans it's

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.710 
added several additional beans it's
really<00:04:56.750> just<00:04:56.960> for<00:04:58.030> to<00:04:59.030> get<00:04:59.210> the<00:04:59.360> winged<00:04:59.570> effect

00:04:59.710 --> 00:04:59.720 
really just for to get the winged effect

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.760 
really just for to get the winged effect
i<00:05:00.110> decided<00:05:00.830> to<00:05:00.920> add<00:05:01.070> these<00:05:02.140> these<00:05:03.140> at<00:05:03.410> the<00:05:03.560> end

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
i decided to add these these at the end

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.440 
i decided to add these these at the end
just<00:05:04.010> because<00:05:04.250> i<00:05:04.460> had<00:05:04.760> them<00:05:04.970> and<00:05:05.150> they<00:05:05.240> look

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
just because i had them and they look

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.560 
just because i had them and they look
kind<00:05:05.690> of<00:05:05.780> cool<00:05:05.990> and<00:05:06.290> then<00:05:07.130> I<00:05:07.160> put<00:05:07.520> the<00:05:07.640> red<00:05:07.850> in

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
kind of cool and then I put the red in

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:12.180 
kind of cool and then I put the red in
his<00:05:08.630> filler<00:05:09.200> for<00:05:10.040> the<00:05:10.070> wing<00:05:10.450> and<00:05:11.450> I<00:05:12.020> I

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
his filler for the wing and I I

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.350 
his filler for the wing and I I
personally<00:05:13.190> thinks<00:05:13.490> the<00:05:13.640> result<00:05:14.090> is

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
personally thinks the result is

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.080 
personally thinks the result is
startling<00:05:14.870> it<00:05:15.020> looks<00:05:15.230> like<00:05:15.470> a<00:05:15.500> an<00:05:16.090> inventor
