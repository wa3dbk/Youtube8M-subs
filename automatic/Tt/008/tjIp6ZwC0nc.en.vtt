these<00:01:23.580> times<00:01:23.909> when<00:01:24.240> everybody<00:01:24.750> everything<00:01:25.380> is

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.719 
being cut back in the public service it
just<00:01:27.450> seems<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.750> bit<00:01:27.900> strange<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.829> police

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729
