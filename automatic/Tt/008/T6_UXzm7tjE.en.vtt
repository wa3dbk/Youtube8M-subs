00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 last question why we started she 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.600
 That coaching flare prompted 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.020
 I think all three of the team we decided 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.570
 what 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.530
 bye for now 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.789
 25 minutes can play well master and 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.660
 you are the guy here that he needs 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:21.300
 he needs to get ready in the morning to leave even 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.340
 much injury that year was gone 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.260
 load up on 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.650
 terrible to not play well fine 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:31.189
 Of course, well there we release it 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.239
 released found he did either word 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.730
 business card 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.970
 edgarom and the beginning she is Armenian forward 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.680
 here is his list of clubs yes where he played 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.379
 before it turned out in the Urals 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.879
 well, this is the first ball and edgar in season 1 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:49.460
 and such important enabling first 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.500
 home victory of the Urals this championship 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.059
 fixed footballer no doubt 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.769
 not by chance not only because he 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.629
 scored two goals and brought so 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.120
 needed three points to the Urals 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.400
 strongly possesses a set of positive 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.379
 footballers qualities that you should 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.150
 be in demand in the team and tarkhans with 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.799
 us just in touch with edgar was 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.460
 nice to hear edgar we are you 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.140
 welcome 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.180
 from Moscow you there we fix it already 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.909
 later time well, the first question 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.920
 axon tarkhany says that we released 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.750
 him to score you have what coach 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.170
 in this case speaks just pushes 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:25.509
 the back 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:29.509
 says go fuck in the second clip yes 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:39.860
 clear minutes paradise will come along the way 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:43.130
 robots and so on i was ready here not 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:47.590
 just go to the opera before when i 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.940
 went out and trainings when to play 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:57.920
 need to 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:02:00.440
 fair play and so I finished off what 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.640
 so enter the match which is hard 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.920
 fold and so reactive 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.170
 made a decision about two hits 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.060
 one blow of the rally another blow of the rally 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.450
 as far as it was all on the machine 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.450
 done 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:22.430
 packed and nothing to do except or 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.740
 process and score a goal because I 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.760
 there was one 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.600
 probably the defenders do not know tired or 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.410
 lost there contract 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:37.240
 I can not say exactly the second goal 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:41.950
 well played bobbin mark the legs I'm glad 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:44.260
 and not blow year rodeo please you 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.000
 was once the experience of playing especially in 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.980
 official match in the arena 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.110
 and how unusual it was for you 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.610
 difficult though considering you come out the covenant you 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.290
 it took here a removable you scored two 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.820
 Goals can be just coins that for 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.830
 you this is the fact or is it 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:01.930
 artificial field, it does not 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:06.100
 compare with the natural for me easy 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:13.920
 play honestly but last year well 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:18.210
 yes of course you need one chair not deer and 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:21.580
 so I am very glad that we won 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:26.710
 let's say before I think played well 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:29.110
 after deleted and of course defended by them 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.530
 the beginning is a little millers because 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.440
 they wanted to have a drink at home have turned 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:41.100
 in the second half 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:41.100
 again attack Kohl not lost Kondrat 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.930
 edgar tell me two wins right after 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.330
 restart championship it means that the Urals 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.120
 now very sure of myself and saved 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:55.210
 avoid even the play-offs 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:04:00.270
 well, it's too early when because there 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:05.800
 any game but only on reason to 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:10.450
 which is sometimes cool wins and give us 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:15.900
 sure we'll see how it will be but 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:18.370
 i'm sure don't look 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.080
 Thank you that we will not desire 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.310
 wish you the main thing to more with 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.640
 you did not have to face injuries 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.950
 it was edgar manucharyan striker ural 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.250
 scored in this round two goals we go 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.250
 farther
