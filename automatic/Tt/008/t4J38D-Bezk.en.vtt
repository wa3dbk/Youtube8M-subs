00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.420 

as<00:01:19.539> a<00:01:19.929> designer<00:01:20.560> as<00:01:20.770> a<00:01:20.829> creative

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
as a designer as a creative

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.140 
as a designer as a creative
it's<00:01:21.700> very<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:23.860> know<00:01:23.920> with<00:01:24.400> this<00:01:24.550> sense<00:01:25.060> of

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
it's very you know with this sense of

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.760 
it's very you know with this sense of
reverence<00:01:25.360> and<00:01:25.630> respect<00:01:25.720> for<00:01:26.200> fashion

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
reverence and respect for fashion

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.710 
reverence and respect for fashion
history<00:01:27.130> and<00:01:27.220> history<00:01:27.490> in<00:01:27.610> general<00:01:27.820> I<00:01:28.210> think

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
history and history in general I think

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.380 
history and history in general I think
every<00:01:28.990> style<00:01:29.350> has<00:01:29.590> its<00:01:29.860> own<00:01:30.130> place<00:01:30.580> so<00:01:31.240> it's

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
every style has its own place so it's

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.690 
every style has its own place so it's
really<00:01:31.570> tough<00:01:31.870> for<00:01:32.050> me<00:01:32.200> and<00:01:32.380> especially<00:01:33.100> now

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
really tough for me and especially now

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.610 
really tough for me and especially now
like<00:01:34.000> when<00:01:34.120> it's<00:01:34.270> revisited<00:01:34.900> I<00:01:35.080> think<00:01:35.410> there

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
like when it's revisited I think there

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.980 
like when it's revisited I think there
is<00:01:35.650> a<00:01:36.310> fresher<00:01:37.060> approach<00:01:37.450> to<00:01:37.690> it<00:01:37.750> and<00:01:37.840> this

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
is a fresher approach to it and this

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.470 
is a fresher approach to it and this
feels<00:01:38.350> new<00:01:38.770> so<00:01:39.520> it's<00:01:39.670> very<00:01:39.790> difficult<00:01:40.030> for<00:01:40.300> me

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.480 
feels new so it's very difficult for me

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.360 
feels new so it's very difficult for me
to<00:01:40.570> say<00:01:40.750> which<00:01:41.020> particular<00:01:41.290> style<00:01:41.890> but<00:01:42.100> if<00:01:42.220> I

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
to say which particular style but if I

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.900 
to say which particular style but if I
have<00:01:43.030> to<00:01:43.450> if<00:01:44.200> I<00:01:44.290> had<00:01:44.470> to<00:01:44.620> choose<00:01:44.890> I<00:01:45.610> would<00:01:45.790> say

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
have to if I had to choose I would say

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.440 
have to if I had to choose I would say
does<00:01:48.910> the<00:01:49.030> you<00:01:49.090> notice<00:01:49.360> visible<00:01:49.930> thongs<00:01:50.320> and
