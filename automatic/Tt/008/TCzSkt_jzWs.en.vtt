00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
so like hunger if it gets down to zero

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
that a true or false you can use bar API

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.560 
that a true or false you can use bar API
you<00:01:04.199> can<00:01:04.460> set<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.580> message<00:01:05.760> in<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.119> bar<00:01:06.299> API

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.950 
you can set the message in the bar API
can<00:01:07.380> use<00:01:07.530> scoreboard<00:01:08.100> stats<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.720> course

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
can use scoreboard stats and of course

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.990 
can use scoreboard stats and of course
you<00:01:10.080> can<00:01:10.200> set<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.439> world<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.920> works<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.340> and

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
you can set the world that works on and

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.149 
you can set the world that works on and
then<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.240> time<00:01:12.510> between<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.530> how<00:01:13.830> much<00:01:14.010> it

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
then the time between the how much it

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.859 
then the time between the how much it
checks<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.670> see<00:01:14.880> how<00:01:14.939> much<00:01:15.119> 30m

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
checks to see how much 30m

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.929 
checks to see how much 30m
I<00:01:15.900> just<00:01:16.200> live<00:01:16.350> as<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:17.040> checks<00:01:17.640> pretty

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
I just live as that it checks pretty

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.260 
I just live as that it checks pretty
frequently<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.780> pre<00:01:19.259> fast<00:01:19.580> and<00:01:20.580> here<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:21.060> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
frequently and pre fast and here is the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.719 
frequently and pre fast and here is the
mountain<00:01:21.750> percent<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.710> thirst<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.220> reduced

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
mountain percent that thirst is reduced

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.640 
mountain percent that thirst is reduced
so<00:01:24.090> if<00:01:24.150> they<00:01:24.240> go<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:24.900> is<00:01:25.020> normal<00:01:25.380> biome

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
so if they go in this is normal biome

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.850 
so if they go in this is normal biome
and<00:01:25.970> they<00:01:26.970> lose<00:01:27.270> about<00:01:27.299> two<00:01:27.869> percent<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.650> then

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
and they lose about two percent and then

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.190 
and they lose about two percent and then
savanna<00:01:29.430> biome<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.479> desert<00:01:30.840> bottom

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
savanna biome and the desert bottom

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.140 
savanna biome and the desert bottom
which<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.710> pretty<00:01:31.890> realistic<00:01:32.280> you'll<00:01:32.909> lose

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
which is pretty realistic you'll lose

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.899 
which is pretty realistic you'll lose
more<00:01:33.479> thirst<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.290> then<00:01:35.009> these<00:01:35.130> messages<00:01:35.640> up

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
more thirst and then these messages up

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.179 
more thirst and then these messages up
here<00:01:36.210> once<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.140> reach<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.380> certain<00:01:37.409> amount<00:01:37.979> of

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
here once you reach a certain amount of

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.950 
here once you reach a certain amount of
thirst<00:01:38.549> level<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.060> if<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.240> reach<00:01:39.390> forty<00:01:39.810> then

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
thirst level so if you reach forty then

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.539 
thirst level so if you reach forty then
they'll<00:01:40.650> send<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.920> message<00:01:41.220> saying<00:01:41.369> that

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
they'll send you a message saying that

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.399 
they'll send you a message saying that
you're<00:01:41.670> thirsty<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.210> then<00:01:42.750> parch<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.320> then

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
you're thirsty and then parch and then

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.289 
you're thirsty and then parch and then
dehydrated<00:01:43.950> aren't<00:01:44.579> living<00:01:44.820> here<00:01:45.149> are<00:01:45.210> the

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
dehydrated aren't living here are the

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.420 
dehydrated aren't living here are the
messages<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.750> appear<00:01:46.020> once<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.860> reach

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
messages that appear once you reach

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.760 
messages that appear once you reach
those<00:01:47.610> levels<00:01:47.939> they're<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.750> custom<00:01:49.079> items

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
those levels they're the custom items

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
have my bar API working which is pretty

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.380 
have my bar API working which is pretty
sick<00:02:26.800> so<00:02:27.010> now<00:02:27.130> I<00:02:27.160> can<00:02:27.400> actually<00:02:27.520> see<00:02:27.730> like

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.900 
sick so now I can actually see like
where<00:02:28.720> my<00:02:28.900> thirst<00:02:29.200> stands<00:02:29.560> in<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:29.950> game<00:02:30.130> so

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
where my thirst stands in the game so

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.210 
where my thirst stands in the game so
it's<00:02:31.180> basically<00:02:31.930> at<00:02:32.110> 32<00:02:32.440> percent<00:02:32.470> it<00:02:32.950> says

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
it's basically at 32 percent it says

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.410 
it's basically at 32 percent it says
your<00:02:33.580> thirst

your thirst

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.290

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
so if bar API actually doesn't work for

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.330 
so if bar API actually doesn't work for
you<00:02:37.450> it<00:02:37.900> just<00:02:38.110> depends<00:02:38.470> on<00:02:38.530> what<00:02:38.800> version<00:02:39.220> you

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340

wrong version so if you have 1.8 then

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.340 
wrong version so if you have 1.8 then
