00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:26.230
 super flashy lipstick and it lasted 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:28.869
 all afternoon to a drinking talking about 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.429
 everything lasted intact all the afternoon 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.080
 and of course he told me it had been a 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:34.030
 discovery that would sound fulfill me 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.640
 mine coins to try and I was 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.070
 hallucinated with him so I created the 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.460
 need and I went to bain to match and 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.000
 what pique with a few are these 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.380
 here 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.100
 These are the tones that I am going to show you 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:50.530
 me but there are more shades are lipsticks 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.800
 long-lasting fact they sell 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.800
 as 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.100
 long lasting plus in fact if you put long 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.250
 lasting beat close in the search engine 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.080
 vallín with their should leave cost 86 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.780
 cents each if I remember correctly 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.869
 every way you will see it puts it by 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.299
 here for the fixed little screen and it's 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.490
 amazing are amazing 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.289
 Look, it 's the video and you like some and 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.070
 running and buying it because it's worth 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:21.370
 totally worth it 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.350
 the format more than much grace because 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.970
 they are the same as the new ones that you have taken 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.880
 was also long-lasting 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:34.540
 have the same format is elongated with 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.540
 the plug in this way and it's kind close 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.140
 they are very easy to put pepper a 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.049
 mogollón or is still teaching the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.360
 colors one to one but let's pigment 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.690
 very much but it's a tad 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.899
 lip but the bar is not annoying 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.670
 I am my specialist for that and as 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.259
 mere that much and month in as he says no 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.659
 I put it on but this is to me so 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.970
 less annoying and I are not as well 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.399
 which is that it lasts very, very many 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.200
 recommended hours and music the first 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:08.619
 that six years the 0-3 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:13.379
 this is this powdered rose 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.379
 It is a pink bread very for daily 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.319
 it's a totally new tone it does not have 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.780
 no mystery of truth 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.659
 and I tell you for every day and I picked it up 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.090
 for that and I think it's pretty cool 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:29.909
 rather flattering does not throw to the brown 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.920
 pink strip which favors even more and 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:35.609
 we go next that I teach is of 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.650
 tone 207 this is already more than I 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:40.829
 like me as you already know this is a 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.290
 recited fuchsia is a fuchsia without more no 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:46.769
 has any kind of reflections is a tone 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.599
 smooth and they are all matte already 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.459
 May advance all Tuesday 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.669
 none that is satin or anything like that 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:56.250
 and this is a tone is a fuchsia tone 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:58.829
 raspberry such a thing very very beautiful and 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.750
 the next 195 this goes very much in line 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.629
 of the previous one is also a fuchsia tone 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.780
 but this one is more pulls much much more to 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.489
 purple indeed is that together here 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.560
 have you have the comparison are these 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.719
 two and this is merged before and this is the 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.909
 now and it is clear that this 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:17.400
 fuchsia and this is immoral and ximo and 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:19.049
 It is also very nice super pigmented 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.109
 pretty flashy the truth is not a 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.689
 tone for diary and you see that pigment 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.440
 the next one that is teaching 198 this already 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:28.310
 is a 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.310
 classic 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:35.980
 I wanted to catch a red tone 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.980
 a classic malawi process 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.170
 where are we going 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:48.000
 already went wood and since I wanted 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:51.000
 catch me a classic red tone your cop more 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.620
 dark what happens is that this red like 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.069
 you are going to see now in the swat 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.230
 is an orange strip in fact that looks 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.670
 pretty orange and I do not usually 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.430
 like that they like the reds that 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.590
 They throw a rose but it's a luxury 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.599
 classic of its that last a lot very much 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.340
 on the lip and it's fine it's very good 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:12.970
 have it for the price then next that 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:16.389
 I teach is pitch 32 this is a red 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.979
 dark brown the truth is that I thought that 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.430
 it was another tone I thought it was a red 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:23.530
 dark more burgundy but it's not a red 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.010
 brown maybe the one that I like the least 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.410
 everything is because of the tone because I do not see it very 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:32.410
 very wearable the truth for my taste for 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.789
 at least not but good investment 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.470
 it was not so big either so I did not 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.000
 it matters a lot to have it there you never know 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.490
 Maybe some newspaper ends up using 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.990
 she last I teach you in tone 36 that 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:46.750
 this I think is my favorite is a rose 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:49.419
 fuchsia but this one has its bluish tone 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:52.030
 You already know that I am much of this type 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.740
 of tones is super singing I do that but 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.500
 well this is not only what it does is that it 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:59.100
 see the much whiter teeth 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.560
 is this down here 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.900
 just as all super pigmented is 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.520
 precious the difference with fuchsia 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.190
 previous that I showed you I think it shows 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.710
 quite this one is more rosita and this one 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.900
 it's a tad 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.610
 more phosphorite to say it of some 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.310
 way for you to see a bit the 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.950
 difference this is much more striking and 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.450
 here you have the 6 that I have not discarded 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.060
 nothing to do with me 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.980
 they were left I think they are another 6 or 5 something 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.680
 so those that do not have much 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.960
 variety of shades ie the range that 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.050
 has mostly newt posts but 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.820
 especially pink so some red can 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.040
 but good anyway because it is 86 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.900
 cents and they cost me such a thing shoots 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.150
 price designs and even just for 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.850
 have the days say they are totally worth 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:48.000
 It's worth it this lasts a lot 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:49.950
 the lips is a last and is that it has already 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.140
 been always fully compensated 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:55.020
 of facts I teach it because it has been like 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.270
 an amazing discovery once 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.560
 it dries, no one moves them another 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.020
 taught with this because the others have 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:04.050
 been a tad wet from the swatch but 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:07.050
 this look at the strength that something that I move 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.750
 the meat and everything and the finger completely 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.730
 clean is that they are in who moves it and 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.840
 As everything is, what happens is that 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:15.030
 well we are a tad 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.030
 wet looks around here then it 's logical 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.830
 that move when they were wet 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.500
 once it dries is that I already tell you 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.510
 this does not move nobody nobody nobody is 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.940
 a good person this mantle a little 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.920
 because it was wet but it does not stain it 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.600
 in nothing nothing nothing equal not until here the 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.800
 video tried to be short and about 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.450
 all because I did not have much that 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.460
 teaching is a discovery that I wanted 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:37.370
 share with you and above all give 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:39.170
 thanks to díaz for discovering melo and 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.180
 nothing else I hope you liked the 

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:43.010
 video that has been useful to you on the blog 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.390
 that I will leave you I will try to leave them so 

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.520
 less swatch is so you learn from the 

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:48.320
 information box the link to the blog and 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.760
 I hope you liked the video and
