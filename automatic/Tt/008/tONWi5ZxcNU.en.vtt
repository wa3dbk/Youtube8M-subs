00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
be the first player from Indiana to do

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.020 
be the first player from Indiana to do
so<00:02:01.380> obviously<00:02:02.280> Indiana<00:02:02.579> has<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.789> lot<00:02:03.000> of

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
so obviously Indiana has a lot of

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.210 
so obviously Indiana has a lot of
history<00:02:03.479> with<00:02:03.509> basketball<00:02:04.289> but<00:02:04.829> you've<00:02:05.099> never

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
history with basketball but you've never

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.710 
history with basketball but you've never
had<00:02:05.429> someone<00:02:05.700> get<00:02:05.909> drafted<00:02:06.179> right<00:02:06.569> out<00:02:06.689> of

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
had someone get drafted right out of

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.180 
had someone get drafted right out of
high<00:02:06.929> school<00:02:06.959> in<00:02:07.349> here<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.770> have<00:02:07.890> somebody

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
high school in here you have somebody

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.160 
high school in here you have somebody
who's<00:02:08.489> projected<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.239> maybe<00:02:09.690> be<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.959> number

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
who's projected to maybe be the number

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.960 
who's projected to maybe be the number
one<00:02:10.319> taking<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.739> 2006<00:02:11.519> draft<00:02:11.670> the

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
one taking the 2006 draft the

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.300 
one taking the 2006 draft the
comparisons<00:02:12.630> of<00:02:12.750> Greg<00:02:13.049> to<00:02:13.319> other<00:02:13.500> big<00:02:13.829> men<00:02:14.069> are

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
comparisons of Greg to other big men are

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.059 
comparisons of Greg to other big men are
of<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.850> elite<00:02:15.329> status<00:02:15.750> people<00:02:16.440> think<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:16.769> Shaq

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
of the elite status people think of Shaq

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.190 
of the elite status people think of Shaq
right<00:02:17.370> now<00:02:17.639> and<00:02:17.940> think<00:02:18.150> well<00:02:18.329> Greg<00:02:18.660> Oden<00:02:18.840> isn't

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
right now and think well Greg Oden isn't

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.140 
right now and think well Greg Oden isn't
Shaq<00:02:19.410> right<00:02:19.650> now<00:02:19.859> but<00:02:20.519> that's<00:02:20.609> not<00:02:20.850> really<00:02:21.060> the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
Shaq right now but that's not really the

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.390 
Shaq right now but that's not really the
comparison<00:02:21.690> when<00:02:21.810> you<00:02:21.900> compare<00:02:22.500> Shaq<00:02:23.160> as<00:02:23.370> a

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
comparison when you compare Shaq as a

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.699 
comparison when you compare Shaq as a
junior<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:24.030> Greg<00:02:24.389> as<00:02:24.569> a<00:02:24.600> junior<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:25.590> know

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
junior to Greg as a junior you know

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.349 
junior to Greg as a junior you know
Greg's<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.100> little<00:02:26.280> bit<00:02:26.400> bigger<00:02:26.579> already<00:02:27.030> he's

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:27.359 
Greg's a little bit bigger already he's

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:29.360 
Greg's a little bit bigger already he's
even<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.660> little<00:02:27.810> more<00:02:27.930> athletic<00:02:28.280> you<00:02:29.280> know

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
even a little more athletic you know

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.729 
even a little more athletic you know
he's<00:02:29.519> easy<00:02:29.730> he's<00:02:30.120> dominant<00:02:30.930> defensively<00:02:31.470> he's

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
he's easy he's dominant defensively he's

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.069 
he's easy he's dominant defensively he's
obviously<00:02:31.889> still<00:02:32.220> working<00:02:32.760> on<00:02:33.180> an<00:02:33.660> offensive

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
obviously still working on an offensive

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:36.259 
obviously still working on an offensive
game<00:02:34.470> which<00:02:34.769> most<00:02:35.190> big<00:02:35.489> men<00:02:35.730> in<00:02:35.850> high<00:02:35.970> school

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
game which most big men in high school

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.030 
game which most big men in high school
are<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.569> takes<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.870> while<00:02:37.019> to<00:02:37.079> develop<00:02:37.410> an

are it takes a while to develop an
offensive<00:02:38.549> game<00:02:38.760> particularly<00:02:39.269> a<00:02:39.450> low<00:02:39.600> post

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
offensive game particularly a low post

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.460 
offensive game particularly a low post
game<00:02:40.109> probably<00:02:40.440> early<00:02:41.400> in<00:02:41.609> Hakeem<00:02:42.299> Olajuwon

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
game probably early in Hakeem Olajuwon

game probably early in Hakeem Olajuwon
career<00:02:43.470> I<00:02:43.650> would<00:02:44.160> compare<00:02:44.579> him<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.730> him<00:02:44.910> a

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
career I would compare him to him a

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.460 
career I would compare him to him a
little<00:02:45.209> bit<00:02:45.389> because<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.720> lodge<00:02:45.870> Awan<00:02:46.200> got

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
little bit because the lodge Awan got

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.410 
little bit because the lodge Awan got
better<00:02:46.799> offensively<00:02:47.519> and<00:02:47.790> C<00:02:47.970> got<00:02:48.180> went

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
better offensively and C got went

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.479 
better offensively and C got went
through<00:02:48.599> his<00:02:48.720> career<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.500> I<00:02:49.950> think<00:02:50.220> right<00:02:50.459> now

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
through his career and I think right now

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.400 
through his career and I think right now
in<00:02:51.030> high<00:02:51.299> school

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
in high school

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.069 
in high school
Odin<00:02:53.130> is<00:02:53.250> kind<00:02:53.549> of<00:02:53.609> like<00:02:53.760> Olajuwon<00:02:54.450> was<00:02:54.480> in<00:02:54.959> the

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
Odin is kind of like Olajuwon was in the

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.470 
Odin is kind of like Olajuwon was in the
pros<00:02:55.349> I<00:02:55.560> mean<00:02:55.739> you<00:02:56.310> know<00:02:56.400> he<00:02:56.549> had<00:02:56.760> Olajuwon

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
pros I mean you know he had Olajuwon

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.610 
pros I mean you know he had Olajuwon
what<00:02:57.599> happened<00:02:57.870> school<00:02:58.079> ignites<00:02:58.380> but<00:02:58.560> he

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
what happened school ignites but he

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.470 
what happened school ignites but he
wasn't<00:02:58.829> consistently<00:02:59.639> a<00:02:59.670> high<00:02:59.849> score<00:03:00.180> but<00:03:00.450> he

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
wasn't consistently a high score but he

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.870 
wasn't consistently a high score but he
got<00:03:00.750> better<00:03:01.019> as<00:03:01.290> he<00:03:01.349> went<00:03:01.799> on<00:03:01.889> and<00:03:02.639> I<00:03:02.819> think

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
got better as he went on and I think

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.460 
got better as he went on and I think

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:37.170 
look I'm not developed and I want to be
a<00:05:32.440> good<00:05:32.650> player<00:05:32.919> and<00:05:33.310> in<00:05:34.169> the<00:05:35.169> NBA<00:05:35.349> right<00:05:36.250> now

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
a good player and in the NBA right now

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.600 
a good player and in the NBA right now
there's<00:05:38.020> no<00:05:38.470> way<00:05:38.650> for<00:05:38.680> me<00:05:38.979> to<00:05:39.009> tell<00:05:39.280> because

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
there's no way for me to tell because

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.430 
there's no way for me to tell because
too<00:05:39.820> far<00:05:40.060> in<00:05:40.150> the<00:05:40.210> future<00:05:40.389> in<00:05:40.810> his<00:05:41.020> case<00:05:41.259> I

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
too far in the future in his case I

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.529 
too far in the future in his case I
think<00:05:41.889> he's<00:05:42.099> a<00:05:42.130> rare<00:05:42.460> exception<00:05:42.789> I<00:05:43.120> think<00:05:43.389> when

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539 
think he's a rare exception I think when

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:46.230 
think he's a rare exception I think when
that<00:05:43.659> time<00:05:43.960> comes<00:05:44.289> he<00:05:45.130> will<00:05:45.280> be<00:05:45.460> able<00:05:45.639> to<00:05:45.849> play

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
that time comes he will be able to play

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.719 
that time comes he will be able to play
and<00:05:46.570> compete<00:05:47.320> and<00:05:48.099> I'll<00:05:48.219> think<00:05:48.460> he's<00:05:48.580> gonna

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:48.729 
and compete and I'll think he's gonna

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:50.850 
and compete and I'll think he's gonna
step<00:05:49.000> in<00:05:49.150> and<00:05:49.300> dominate<00:05:49.719> but<00:05:49.900> he<00:05:50.080> will<00:05:50.259> you

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
step in and dominate but he will you

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.060 
step in and dominate but he will you
will<00:05:51.070> eventually<00:05:51.310> do<00:05:51.789> that
