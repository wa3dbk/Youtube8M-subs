00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.310
 we do not cut the oil of the 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.010
 motor 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.160
 first we have to do is 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.629
 find the top dead center that is the 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:18.119
 first cylinder at its maximum point 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:21.750
 let's balance the last one remember 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.519
 that for an explosion after doing this 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.039
 little install a clock a base 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.650
 the magnetic field here and leaving it 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.300
 6 mm and 10 before the 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.140
 body upper wall 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.690
 turning an engine in the anti-turning direction 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.760
 I'm not going to put him there and he's 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:54.950
 adjusted adjusted ebitda IPMS I will 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:57.230
 back six millimeters and 10 2 3 4 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:01.970
 5 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.970
 face to face well 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.630
 Let's check it out again if God 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.630
 you want to vote mp ms 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:21.060
 tms here we go there 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.750
 zero out and we will take into 6 mm and 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.750
 month 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.150
 Hmm 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.830
 in 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.850
 6 and 10 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:02:00.220
 in the 2010 course now we go beyond 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:04.360
 the pump is empty cut of cutting oil 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.500
 of the point of inversion in the mwm go pump 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.750
 explain the following 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.450
 first we put 16 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.000
 10 points so before the pole with 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.580
 superior tumor will see that it becomes a 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.290
 just below the block 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.060
 only it has to stay precisely in 6 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.290
 thousand of ten for that we use 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.530
 this magnetic base that it will measure 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.530
 with accuracy 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.670
 with this motto explosion but put my 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.349
 balances team know that the first one 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.370
 cylinder will be the one that will enter 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:37.900
 explosion case of diesel combustion 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.700
 blast way to say that everything goes 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.799
 I'm going to leave here. I'm here at the pump. 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:48.130
 Here in the injection pump 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:50.810
 removing these elements here 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.290
 he will see goes inside the generator park 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.290
 on here 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.910
 these three feet goes into that tube of 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:06.200
 pressurizing here from the beak he commands 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:10.130
 injection into the nozzle after removal 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.710
 we take a balloon with bypass install a 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.450
 hose, the most 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.360
 high for diesel 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:21.640
 I went down and played down. 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:29.930
 Yes, we installed an eyedropper 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:31.250
 The same as the iron tube is 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.100
 closed 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.880
 we cut it let him come back from 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.590
 job 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.970
 now that regulation of the story of 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:43.070
 pump management 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:46.280
 we have a company only takes these 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.000
 four screws that will happen her 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.720
 will have 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:53.860
 she's going to have a game she'll have if she 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.860
 will have this move here 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:05.410
 in this way we move is 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:10.270
 holding the accelerated element where it 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:12.250
 Accelerate here we can see that he 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.170
 will have an injection of diesel 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.950
 With your hand here you will try 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:21.130
 to hit your take there guys 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:25.510
 I bring them here they richa 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.840
 what is his ideal point from 4 to 5 pingo 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.220
 per minute 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.490
 So what are you going to do? 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:37.540
 he will start over here for that will 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:40.150
 leaving has brought forth and will 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:47.610
 dripping is only catching a lot 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:47.610
 entered a little more and now will get 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.700
 12 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.790
 I'll add another touch 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.730
 Are you trying to eat only drips? 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:18.210
 3 he drips claw aipim at 45 in a 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.590
 I 'm not going to name anything else either. 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.690
 will be complete 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.750
 but this is how we proceed around 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:29.810
 injection 2010 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:32.550
 the piston before the before combustion 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.440
 first pump element by pushing 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:38.790
 detour by removing those elements in here 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:41.430
 inside and loosening the four screws 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:44.610
 reality by making this move up to 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:47.360
 it starts dripping from 4 to 5 per minute 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.360
 that's it
