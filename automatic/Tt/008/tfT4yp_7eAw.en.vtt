00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
that's been kind of building up across

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.450 
that's been kind of building up across
the<00:00:25.019> course<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.470> summer<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.740> guess<00:00:25.920> it

the course of the summer I guess it

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.920 
the course of the summer I guess it
looks<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.760> little<00:00:26.910> bit<00:00:27.090> closer<00:00:27.480> towards<00:00:27.869> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
looks a little bit closer towards the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.330 
looks a little bit closer towards the
end<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.080> last<00:00:28.140> season<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:28.980> might<00:00:29.160> get

and<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:31.590> know<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.890> physical<00:01:32.400> outputs<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:33.000> get

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
and you know the physical outputs to get

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.810 
and you know the physical outputs to get
it<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.360> get<00:01:33.509> them<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.700> tactically<00:01:35.700> and

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
it to get them in and and tactically and

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.819 
it to get them in and and tactically and
technically<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.720> wanted<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.140> make<00:01:37.320> sure<00:01:37.380> I

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
technically I wanted to make sure I

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.230 
technically I wanted to make sure I
didn't<00:01:38.070> give<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.280> ball<00:01:38.460> away<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.759> wanted<00:01:39.119> to

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
try as many shots of a kind obviously

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.130 
try as many shots of a kind obviously
the<00:01:41.729> main<00:01:41.850> thing<00:01:42.060> for<00:01:42.090> me<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.360> score<00:01:42.720> goals<00:01:42.750> and

bit<00:03:55.239> of<00:03:55.359> a<00:03:55.480> contrast<00:03:56.349> really<00:03:56.680> between<00:03:56.889> this

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
bit of a contrast really between this

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:58.620 
bit of a contrast really between this
one<00:03:57.310> and<00:03:57.370> the<00:03:57.519> trip<00:03:57.760> to<00:03:57.880> Belgium<00:03:58.239> last<00:03:58.450> year
