00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
animation and through right out the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.330 
animation and through right out the
window<00:01:06.030> I'm<00:01:06.780> not<00:01:06.900> gonna<00:01:07.020> lie<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.380> was<00:01:07.530> rough<00:01:07.860> it

was<00:01:08.460> quite<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.760> challenge<00:01:08.850> but<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.840> learned<00:01:10.409> a

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
was quite a challenge but I learned a

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.560
