renegades<00:02:32.590> so<00:02:32.800> you<00:02:32.860> were<00:02:33.190> sort<00:02:33.460> of<00:02:33.490> the<00:02:33.670> one

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
renegades so you were sort of the one

renegades so you were sort of the one
trying<00:02:34.060> to<00:02:34.150> be<00:02:34.300> controlled<00:02:34.900> and<00:02:35.200> now<00:02:35.350> it's<00:02:35.500> a

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
trying to be controlled and now it's a

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.010 
trying to be controlled and now it's a
bit<00:02:35.680> of<00:02:35.770> a<00:02:35.830> reversal<00:02:36.430> of<00:02:36.550> that<00:02:36.600> did<00:02:37.600> you<00:02:37.780> sort

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
bit of a reversal of that did you sort

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.510 
bit of a reversal of that did you sort
of<00:02:38.110> I<00:02:38.440> mean<00:02:38.620> is<00:02:38.800> that<00:02:38.830> what<00:02:39.010> attracted<00:02:39.370> you<00:02:39.490> to

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
of I mean is that what attracted you to

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.510 
of I mean is that what attracted you to
the<00:02:39.700> role<00:02:40.020> I<00:02:41.020> think<00:02:41.590> so<00:02:41.740> I<00:02:41.770> also<00:02:42.040> think<00:02:42.220> that

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
the role I think so I also think that

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.700 
the role I think so I also think that
just<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:42.910> idea<00:02:43.420> that<00:02:43.510> I'm<00:02:44.050> the<00:02:44.500> head<00:02:44.680> of

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
just the idea that I'm the head of

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:50.790 
just the idea that I'm the head of
anything<00:02:45.400> really<00:02:46.740> because<00:02:48.450> I'm<00:02:49.450> quite<00:02:50.260> goofy

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
anything really because I'm quite goofy

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.820 
anything really because I'm quite goofy
and<00:02:51.070> I<00:02:51.700> can't<00:02:52.540> imagine<00:02:52.660> myself<00:02:53.170> being<00:02:53.650> the

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
and I can't imagine myself being the

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.720 
and I can't imagine myself being the
boss<00:02:54.010> of<00:02:54.250> anybody<00:02:54.990> so<00:02:55.990> just<00:02:56.800> that<00:02:56.980> concept<00:02:57.550> in

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
boss of anybody so just that concept in

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.080 
boss of anybody so just that concept in
and<00:02:57.850> of<00:02:57.940> itself<00:02:58.270> attracted<00:02:58.900> me<00:02:58.990> to<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.230> role

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
and of itself attracted me to the role

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.000 
and of itself attracted me to the role
well<00:03:01.090> then<00:03:01.240> it<00:03:01.330> wasn't<00:03:01.690> no<00:03:01.930> head<00:03:02.320> living<00:03:02.710> at

psychology of it of trying to do that as

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.610 
psychology of it of trying to do that as
an<00:03:33.940> actor<00:03:34.300> like<00:03:34.540> half<00:03:35.260> of<00:03:35.350> your<00:03:35.500> body

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
an actor like half of your body

an actor like half of your body
wrestling<00:03:36.250> with<00:03:36.430> the<00:03:36.520> other<00:03:36.640> you<00:03:37.090> know<00:03:37.180> I<00:03:37.510> mean

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
wrestling with the other you know I mean

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.510 
wrestling with the other you know I mean
just<00:03:37.750> figuring<00:03:38.320> all<00:03:38.440> that<00:03:38.500> out<00:03:38.650> but<00:03:39.280> there's

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
just figuring all that out but there's

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.240 
just figuring all that out but there's
there's<00:03:39.880> one<00:03:40.300> aspect<00:03:41.200> of<00:03:41.500> it<00:03:41.680> where<00:03:41.950> they

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
there's one aspect of it where they

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.550 
there's one aspect of it where they
tried<00:03:42.730> something<00:03:43.150> that<00:03:43.840> wasn't<00:03:44.110> planned

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
tried something that wasn't planned

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.060 
tried something that wasn't planned
whereby<00:03:45.690> some<00:03:46.690> music<00:03:47.170> comes<00:03:47.440> through<00:03:47.860> the

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
whereby some music comes through the

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.060 
whereby some music comes through the
speakers<00:03:48.520> and<00:03:48.820> so<00:03:49.750> his<00:03:50.050> out<00:03:50.290> of<00:03:50.530> control<00:03:50.890> body

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
speakers and so his out of control body

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.910 
speakers and so his out of control body
starts<00:03:51.459> dancing<00:03:51.940> to<00:03:52.260> this<00:03:53.260> particular<00:03:53.560> moment

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
starts dancing to this particular moment

00:03:53.920 --> 00:04:01.059 
starts dancing to this particular moment
he<00:03:54.160> also<00:03:54.310> has<00:03:54.550> lipstick<00:03:54.970> on

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.649 

is<00:04:01.340> absolutely<00:04:02.140> history<00:04:03.939> to<00:04:04.939> the<00:04:05.209> expose<00:04:05.510> you

00:04:05.649 --> 00:04:05.659 
is absolutely history to the expose you

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:09.309 
is absolutely history to the expose you
to<00:04:06.010> 1024<00:04:07.010> when<00:04:07.459> you<00:04:07.790> were<00:04:07.939> cast<00:04:08.150> it<00:04:08.540> slowly<00:04:08.930> and

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
to 1024 when you were cast it slowly and

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:11.530 
to 1024 when you were cast it slowly and
then<00:04:09.530> you<00:04:09.799> would<00:04:10.430> did<00:04:10.549> the<00:04:10.639> show<00:04:10.760> into<00:04:10.969> a<00:04:10.999> 34

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
then you would did the show into a 34

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.050 
then you would did the show into a 34
that's<00:04:11.629> a<00:04:11.780> huge<00:04:12.079> chunk<00:04:12.409> of<00:04:12.469> your<00:04:12.560> life<00:04:13.060> how

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
that's a huge chunk of your life how

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.180 
that's a huge chunk of your life how
much<00:04:14.239> of<00:04:14.389> the<00:04:14.510> show<00:04:14.749> affected<00:04:15.739> the<00:04:15.829> person

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
much of the show affected the person

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.710 
much of the show affected the person
that<00:04:16.310> you<00:04:16.459> are<00:04:18.489> I<00:04:19.489> don't<00:04:20.090> know<00:04:20.239> it's<00:04:20.479> weird

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
that you are I don't know it's weird

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.680 
that you are I don't know it's weird
because<00:04:20.959> I<00:04:21.940> essentially<00:04:22.940> as<00:04:23.060> you<00:04:23.090> pointed<00:04:23.570> out

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
because I essentially as you pointed out

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.810 
because I essentially as you pointed out
I<00:04:23.750> kind<00:04:24.020> of<00:04:24.139> grew<00:04:24.470> up<00:04:24.910> during<00:04:25.910> the<00:04:26.180> series<00:04:26.630> and

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
I kind of grew up during the series and

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.230 
I kind of grew up during the series and
so<00:04:28.820> it's<00:04:29.240> hard<00:04:29.509> to<00:04:29.660> know<00:04:29.840> how<00:04:30.110> much<00:04:30.470> of<00:04:31.240> me

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
so it's hard to know how much of me

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.740 
so it's hard to know how much of me
growing<00:04:32.780> up<00:04:33.099> influenced<00:04:34.419> Scully's<00:04:35.419> growing

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
growing up influenced Scully's growing

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.770 
growing up influenced Scully's growing
up<00:04:35.930> and<00:04:36.139> how<00:04:36.289> much<00:04:36.789> her<00:04:37.789> the<00:04:38.150> evolution<00:04:38.720> of

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
up and how much her the evolution of

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.350 
up and how much her the evolution of
that<00:04:38.840> character<00:04:39.500> dictated<00:04:40.370> who<00:04:40.520> I<00:04:40.550> became<00:04:41.030> as

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
that character dictated who I became as

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.900 
that character dictated who I became as
a<00:04:41.419> person<00:04:42.020> and<00:04:42.380> not<00:04:42.560> only<00:04:42.740> that<00:04:42.949> once<00:04:43.400> died<00:04:43.669> you

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
a person and not only that once died you
