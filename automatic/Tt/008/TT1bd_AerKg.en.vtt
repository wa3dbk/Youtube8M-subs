00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
winds were light and the weather looked

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.890 
winds were light and the weather looked
perfect<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.310> as<00:00:23.970> we<00:00:24.119> set<00:00:24.270> off<00:00:24.419> for<00:00:24.450> the<00:00:24.630> summit

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
perfect and as we set off for the summit

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.780 
perfect and as we set off for the summit
it<00:00:25.020> looked<00:00:25.200> great<00:00:25.439> but<00:00:26.250> within<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.550> few<00:00:26.730> hours

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:26.790 
it looked great but within a few hours

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.670 
it looked great but within a few hours
the<00:00:27.060> weather<00:00:27.300> came<00:00:27.540> in<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.169> storm<00:00:28.439> came

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
the weather came in and the storm came

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.859 
the weather came in and the storm came
in<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.279> there<00:00:29.460> was<00:00:29.579> no<00:00:29.759> chance<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.180> flying<00:00:30.360> I

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
in so there was no chance of flying I

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.139 
in so there was no chance of flying I
think<00:00:31.500> we<00:00:31.560> can<00:00:31.710> see<00:00:31.890> what<00:00:32.099> happened<00:00:32.489> when<00:00:33.030> he

think we can see what happened when he

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.250 
think we can see what happened when he
