electronic<00:00:11.910> drum<00:00:12.120> kit<00:00:12.330> and<00:00:12.650> I<00:00:13.650> bought<00:00:13.860> myself

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
electronic drum kit and I bought myself

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.450 
electronic drum kit and I bought myself
one<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.370> these<00:00:14.610> little<00:00:15.540> D<00:00:15.719> drum<00:00:16.460> triggers

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
one of these little D drum triggers

drummers<00:00:22.320> normal<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.890> I've<00:00:22.980> just<00:00:23.100> got<00:00:23.279> one<00:00:23.430> of

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
drummers normal and I've just got one of

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.380 
drummers normal and I've just got one of
these<00:00:23.640> Zed

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
these Zed

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.599

heads<00:00:24.810> on<00:00:25.109> my<00:00:25.320> snare<00:00:25.560> drum<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.980> test<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.490> out

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
heads on my snare drum to test it out

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.650 
heads on my snare drum to test it out
and<00:00:28.429> kind<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.550> my<00:00:29.609> initial<00:00:29.939> tests<00:00:30.240> weren't<00:00:30.420> all

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
and kind of my initial tests weren't all

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.470 
and kind of my initial tests weren't all
that<00:00:30.720> great<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.560> was<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.859> little<00:00:32.189> bit

alright<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.020> just<00:00:37.050> play<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.320> little<00:00:37.559> bit<00:00:41.840> like

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
alright so just play a little bit like

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.360 
alright so just play a little bit like
you<00:00:43.200> kind<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.530> got<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.739> lot<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:44.070> double

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
you kind of got a lot of double

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.830 
you kind of got a lot of double
triggering<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.239> wasn't<00:00:45.539> really<00:00:45.719> getting

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
triggering and I wasn't really getting

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.410 
triggering and I wasn't really getting
the<00:00:46.050> response<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.590> liked<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.430> because<00:00:48.300> it

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
the response that I liked and because it

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.090 
the response that I liked and because it
was<00:00:48.539> right<00:00:48.809> near<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.200> edge<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.649> wasn't<00:00:49.920> really

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
was right near the edge it wasn't really

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.770 
was right near the edge it wasn't really
picking<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.460> up<00:00:50.520> very<00:00:50.789> well<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.090> like<00:00:51.750> I

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
picking it up very well and like I

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.930 
picking it up very well and like I
noticed<00:00:52.170> if<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.469> put<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.800> further<00:00:53.460> 12<00:00:53.789> the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
noticed if you put it further 12 the

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.430 
noticed if you put it further 12 the
middle<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.329> was<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.840> would<00:00:54.960> be<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> bit<00:00:55.289> more

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
middle it was it would be a bit more

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.889 
middle it was it would be a bit more
responsive<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.219> add<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.059> bit<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.449> read<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:57.750> the

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
responsive so add a bit of a read on the

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.500 
responsive so add a bit of a read on the
internet<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.410> found<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.680> lot<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:58.949> people

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
internet and I found a lot of people

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.070 
internet and I found a lot of people
making<00:01:00.510> their<00:01:00.750> own<00:01:00.899> drum<00:01:01.620> triggers<00:01:02.010> out<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.430> I

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
making their own drum triggers out of I

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.299 
making their own drum triggers out of I
don't<00:01:04.080> know<00:01:04.140> if<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.290> can<00:01:04.439> see<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:05.129> is

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
don't know if you can see that it is

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.399 
don't know if you can see that it is
basically<00:01:06.650> piezo<00:01:08.630> transducers<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.840> they're

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
basically piezo transducers and they're

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.280 
basically piezo transducers and they're
just<00:01:10.590> like<00:01:10.770> these<00:01:10.950> tiny<00:01:11.220> little<00:01:12.290> speakers

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
just like these tiny little speakers

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.859 
just like these tiny little speakers
which<00:01:13.640> like<00:01:14.640> sound<00:01:14.909> really<00:01:15.150> teeny<00:01:15.420> but<00:01:15.689> they

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
which like sound really teeny but they

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.539 
which like sound really teeny but they
also<00:01:16.020> make<00:01:16.380> quite<00:01:16.619> good

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
also make quite good

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.870 
also make quite good
like<00:01:18.479> microphones<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.259> triggers<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.220> pick

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
like microphones and triggers I pick

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.609 
like microphones and triggers I pick
this<00:01:21.030> up<00:01:21.090> for<00:01:21.420> like<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.810> pound<00:01:22.500> from<00:01:23.310> aplans<00:01:23.909> and

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
as well just kind of sandwich the piezo

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.429 
as well just kind of sandwich the piezo
in<00:01:57.750> between<00:01:58.350> those<00:01:59.280> pads<00:02:00.140> stick<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.229> on<00:02:01.350> the

in between those pads stick it on the
drum<00:02:01.619> head

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
drum head

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.880 
drum head
straightaway<00:02:03.850> this<00:02:04.920> sounds<00:02:05.920> amazing<00:02:06.160> and<00:02:07.890> you

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
know even right at the edge it works

sensitive<00:02:15.310> a<00:02:15.610> little<00:02:16.150> bit<00:02:16.300> of<00:02:16.420> double

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
sensitive a little bit of double

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.270 
sensitive a little bit of double
triggering<00:02:17.170> but<00:02:17.380> you<00:02:17.680> know<00:02:17.800> I<00:02:17.830> think<00:02:17.920> with<00:02:18.250> a

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
triggering but you know I think with a

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.710 
triggering but you know I think with a
bit<00:02:18.430> tweaking<00:02:18.940> it<00:02:19.060> will<00:02:19.180> sound<00:02:19.390> pretty<00:02:19.450> good

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
bit tweaking it will sound pretty good

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.660 
bit tweaking it will sound pretty good
you<00:02:20.590> know<00:02:20.710> then<00:02:20.860> all<00:02:20.980> you<00:02:21.100> need<00:02:21.280> is<00:02:21.430> just<00:02:21.550> a

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
you know then all you need is just a

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.910 
you know then all you need is just a
little<00:02:21.880> mounting<00:02:22.270> system<00:02:23.080> you<00:02:23.590> can<00:02:23.740> either

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
little mounting system you can either

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.160 
little mounting system you can either
put<00:02:24.070> it<00:02:24.160> underneath<00:02:24.460> the<00:02:24.580> head<00:02:25.270> or<00:02:25.570> on<00:02:25.690> top<00:02:25.870> or

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
put it underneath the head or on top or

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.730 
put it underneath the head or on top or
in<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.350> middle

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
in the middle

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.090 
in the middle
wherever<00:02:27.550> you<00:02:27.640> want<00:02:27.880> and<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:29.230> know<00:02:29.590> in<00:02:29.890> total

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
wherever you want and you know in total

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.270 
wherever you want and you know in total
this<00:02:30.580> is<00:02:30.790> like<00:02:31.060> five<00:02:31.840> pounds<00:02:32.230> compared<00:02:33.040> to

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
this is like five pounds compared to

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.120 
this is like five pounds compared to
like<00:02:33.970> 17<00:02:34.540> pounds<00:02:34.780> for<00:02:35.260> you<00:02:35.830> know<00:02:35.950> what's

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
like 17 pounds for you know what's

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.350 
like 17 pounds for you know what's
supposed<00:02:36.310> to<00:02:36.490> be<00:02:36.550> a<00:02:36.580> professional<00:02:36.970> drum

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
supposed to be a professional drum

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.790 
supposed to be a professional drum
trigger<00:02:37.630> I'm<00:02:38.020> sure<00:02:38.200> with<00:02:38.350> a<00:02:38.380> bit<00:02:38.530> of<00:02:38.620> tweaking

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
trigger I'm sure with a bit of tweaking

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.350 
trigger I'm sure with a bit of tweaking
I<00:02:39.040> could<00:02:39.190> probably<00:02:39.370> get<00:02:39.580> this<00:02:39.760> to<00:02:39.910> work<00:02:40.030> better

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
I could probably get this to work better

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.230 
I could probably get this to work better
but<00:02:40.890> you<00:02:41.890> know<00:02:41.920> off<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.730> bat

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
but you know off the bat

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.890 
but you know off the bat
that<00:02:43.450> works<00:02:43.720> white<00:02:44.650> ten<00:02:44.950> times<00:02:45.220> better<00:02:45.459> so

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
that works white ten times better so

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.020 
that works white ten times better so
that<00:02:46.900> just<00:02:47.080> kind<00:02:47.140> of<00:02:47.350> shows<00:02:47.590> that<00:02:47.620> you<00:02:48.250> can

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
that just kind of shows that you can

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.000 
that just kind of shows that you can
make<00:02:49.209> your<00:02:49.420> own<00:02:49.450> stuff<00:02:49.990> working<00:02:50.500> better<00:02:50.860> for

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
make your own stuff working better for

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.650 
make your own stuff working better for
cheap<00:02:51.780> so<00:02:52.780> I<00:02:52.840> just<00:02:53.020> wanted<00:02:53.230> to<00:02:53.320> shout<00:02:53.470> out
