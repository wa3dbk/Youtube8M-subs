too<00:02:25.760> much<00:02:25.880> water<00:02:26.120> like<00:02:26.420> I<00:02:26.540> did<00:02:26.810> make<00:02:27.200> sure<00:02:27.350> just

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
too much water like I did make sure just

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.070

to take a towel and towel dry it out it

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.780 
to take a towel and towel dry it out it
should<00:02:30.350> be<00:02:30.380> nicely<00:02:30.710> saturated<00:02:31.550> but<00:02:31.700> it

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
should be nicely saturated but it

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.670 
should be nicely saturated but it
shouldn't<00:02:32.030> be<00:02:32.060> dripping<00:02:32.510> if<00:02:32.960> your<00:02:33.440> hair<00:02:33.650> is
