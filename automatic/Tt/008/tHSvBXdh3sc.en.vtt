00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.580 
running double A's right now I did a
review<00:00:24.779> on<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:26.119> but<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.150> haven't<00:00:27.480> uploaded<00:00:28.380> it

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
review on it but I haven't uploaded it

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.479 
review on it but I haven't uploaded it
it<00:00:29.369> came<00:00:29.609> out<00:00:29.760> longer<00:00:29.970> than<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.330> wanted<00:00:30.660> but

more<00:00:33.750> rugged<00:00:34.010> this<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.130> rugged<00:00:35.460> it's<00:00:35.550> falling

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
more rugged this is rugged it's falling

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.000 
more rugged this is rugged it's falling
off<00:00:35.910> my<00:00:35.940> bike<00:00:36.090> when<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.540> was<00:00:36.660> going<00:00:36.780> down<00:00:36.950> down<00:00:37.950> a

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
off my bike when I was going down down a

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.869 
off my bike when I was going down down a
hill<00:00:38.309> pretty<00:00:38.760> fast<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.750> fell<00:00:40.050> on<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.260> concrete

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
hill pretty fast it fell on the concrete

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.880 
hill pretty fast it fell on the concrete
I<00:00:41.879> went<00:00:42.270> back<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.870> power<00:00:43.140> right<00:00:43.350> back<00:00:43.530> up<00:00:43.770> I

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
I went back in it power right back up I

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.490 
I went back in it power right back up I
had<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.070> put<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.280> battery<00:00:44.579> back<00:00:44.610> on<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.500> but

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
had to put the battery back on it but

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
had to put the battery back on it but
let's<00:00:46.590> just<00:00:46.770> compare<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.129> couple<00:00:47.399> things

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
let's just compare a couple things

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.000 
let's just compare a couple things
between<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.940> vx7<00:00:48.629> are<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.020> su<00:00:49.320> submersible

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
between the vx7 are the a su submersible

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.170 
between the vx7 are the a su submersible
vx7<00:00:50.610> quad-band<00:00:51.180> versus<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.289> ACF<00:00:52.980> d50<00:00:53.550> or<00:00:53.760> you

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
vx7 quad-band versus the ACF d50 or you

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.790 
vx7 quad-band versus the ACF d50 or you
could<00:00:54.390> call<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.140> ft60<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.070> guess<00:00:57.800> which

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
could call this the ft60 I guess which

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.099 
could call this the ft60 I guess which
is<00:00:58.920> what<00:00:59.070> they're<00:00:59.190> producing<00:00:59.430> now<00:00:59.760> with<00:01:00.629> it's

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
is what they're producing now with it's

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.280 
is what they're producing now with it's
not<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.890> much<00:01:02.070> different<00:01:02.579> honestly<00:01:03.290> but

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
not that much different honestly but

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.539 
not that much different honestly but
there's<00:01:05.129> there<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.909> difference<00:01:07.460> there's<00:01:08.460> a

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
there's there is a difference there's a

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.520 
there's there is a difference there's a
definite<00:01:09.119> difference<00:01:09.150> that's<00:01:09.689> for<00:01:09.930> sure<00:01:10.110> oh

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.490 

I'll<00:01:13.530> try<00:01:14.040> not<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.340> drop<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.610> there<00:01:15.439> kind<00:01:16.439> of

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
I'll try not to drop it there kind of

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.600 
I'll try not to drop it there kind of
get<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:16.979> line<00:01:17.479> you<00:01:18.479> kind<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.780> see<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.619> how

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
get it in line you kind of see it how

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.080 
get it in line you kind of see it how
different<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.180> there<00:01:22.580> yeah<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.610> guess<00:01:23.909> the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
different it is there yeah I guess the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.810 
different it is there yeah I guess the
f-250<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.780> little<00:01:24.960> bit<00:01:25.080> thicker<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:25.820> this

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
f-250 is a little bit thicker so this

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.819 
f-250 is a little bit thicker so this
one<00:01:26.939> has<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.090> lithium<00:01:27.270> ion<00:01:27.600> battery<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:28.229> last<00:01:28.259> a

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
one has a lithium ion battery to last a

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.609 
one has a lithium ion battery to last a
pretty<00:01:29.520> good<00:01:29.670> while<00:01:30.049> allows<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.170> do<00:01:31.290> full

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
pretty good while allows you do full

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.980 
pretty good while allows you do full
output<00:01:31.829> 5<00:01:32.400> watts<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:33.450> get<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.659> right<00:01:33.810> battery

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
output 5 watts you get the right battery

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.899 
output 5 watts you get the right battery
for<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.650> can<00:01:34.710> do<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.950> same<00:01:35.130> thing<00:01:35.340> yeah

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
for this you can do the same thing yeah

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.870 
for this you can do the same thing yeah
and<00:01:36.090> this<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.329> just<00:01:36.450> doable

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
and this is just doable

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.170 
and this is just doable
this<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.000> just<00:01:39.150> dual<00:01:39.329> band<00:01:39.950> here<00:01:40.950> so<00:01:41.939> let's<00:01:42.060> see

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
this is just dual band here so let's see

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.969 
this is just dual band here so let's see
how<00:01:42.299> we're<00:01:42.600> receiving<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.259> 706<00:01:43.710> machine

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.679 

thank<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.100> yeah<00:01:50.220> like<00:01:50.369> 110<00:01:51.030> channels<00:01:51.540> and

that this is a VX radio at all and the

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.699 
that this is a VX radio at all and the
vx5<00:03:59.010> probably<00:03:59.699> had<00:03:59.939> the<00:04:00.629> same<00:04:00.709> configuration

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
vx5 probably had the same configuration

vx5 probably had the same configuration
as<00:04:01.859> the<00:04:01.919> 7<00:04:02.340> but<00:04:03.299> I'm<00:04:03.959> used<00:04:04.290> to<00:04:04.379> holding<00:04:04.739> this

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
as the 7 but I'm used to holding this

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.520

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
and things and this one is opposite so

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.999 
and things and this one is opposite so
the<00:04:15.780> antenna<00:04:16.079> is<00:04:16.259> where<00:04:16.440> I<00:04:16.470> want<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:16.799> be<00:04:16.889> you

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:17.009 
the antenna is where I want to be you

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:21.170 
the antenna is where I want to be you
know<00:04:17.130> switching<00:04:17.400> stuff<00:04:17.729> here<00:04:17.940> so<00:04:20.090> this<00:04:21.090> is

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
know switching stuff here so this is

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.110 
know switching stuff here so this is
kind<00:04:21.329> of<00:04:21.359> a<00:04:21.450> bad

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
kind of a bad

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.960 
kind of a bad
person<00:04:22.540> but<00:04:23.760> this<00:04:24.760> is<00:04:24.910> gonna<00:04:25.060> die<00:04:25.270> pretty<00:04:25.479> soon

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
person but this is gonna die pretty soon

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.460 
person but this is gonna die pretty soon
but<00:04:27.970> there<00:04:28.330> they<00:04:28.479> are<00:04:28.510> the<00:04:28.810> two<00:04:28.960> you<00:04:29.350> can

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
but there they are the two you can

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.159 
but there they are the two you can
balance<00:04:29.620> out<00:04:29.979> the<00:04:30.690> differences<00:04:31.690> and<00:04:31.990> things

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
balance out the differences and things

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.460 
balance out the differences and things
so<00:04:33.240> obviously<00:04:34.240> the<00:04:34.600> sevens<00:04:34.990> probably<00:04:35.440> a

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
so obviously the sevens probably a

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.990 
so obviously the sevens probably a
little<00:04:35.560> bit<00:04:35.740> better<00:04:35.919> this<00:04:36.520> is<00:04:36.580> a<00:04:36.669> little<00:04:36.850> more

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
little bit better this is a little more

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.700 
little bit better this is a little more
user<00:04:37.180> friendly<00:04:37.270> and<00:04:37.810> I'm<00:04:37.900> not<00:04:38.080> gonna<00:04:38.229> sell<00:04:38.500> it

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
user friendly and I'm not gonna sell it

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.159 
user friendly and I'm not gonna sell it
