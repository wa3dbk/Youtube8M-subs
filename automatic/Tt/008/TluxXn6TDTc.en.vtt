00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 hello you love yes I was two now 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.879
 weeks long away I had two weeks 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.360
 vacation 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.980
 Today the school starts again and in 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.200
 The two weeks I was on one 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.560
 farm and did an internship 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.890
 So on a bio-farm completely 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:25.640
 biological and I wanted to go now 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:27.390
 my experiences on the topic barefoot running 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.929
 share with you 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.430
 So I was completely barefoot for two weeks 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.890
 I also have barefoot on the farm 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.420
 worked 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.030
 and yes I have many new experiences 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.719
 collected 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:46.620
 and yes I'm starting on the 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:50.989
 farm on many paths with zero 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:54.180
 So those were so crushed 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.180
 pieces of wood bark I do not know 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.180
 is probably knows every so by 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.859
 and really that is the worst floor 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.580
 I have been running so far 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:09.150
 He hurt so much at the beginning while walking 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.369
 that is that every stone path is the one 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.830
 harmless I found that really extreme 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.270
 bad so at the beginning disadvantage so 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.460
 After a few days it went then 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.259
 you got used to it and it worked 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:24.000
 but then the beginning there on this floor 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.950
 was really extremely bad yes then by 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.020
 that I worked barefoot 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.180
 I have quite a few at the farm 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.700
 minor injuries but nothing 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.979
 bad things like that 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.200
 abrasions or just a little bit 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.100
 slashed on a stone or in 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.770
 a shard but nothing tragic 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.869
 What I noticed now is that mine 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.829
 cornea pretty pretty pretty 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.869
 is born firmer and now it does too 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.229
 not so much anymore so that was really it 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.110
 at the beginning and I always had a lot 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.060
 Dirty feet but not not so 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.729
 not to compare with those 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.409
 dirty feet in the city so here 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.380
 it's no idea what the franchise 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.700
 is right pitch black is mostly 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.600
 but in the yard, it was of course 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.360
 was in the evening 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.660
 the grass of I from the earth had stopped 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.070
 always nice dirty feet and 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.140
 Of course , I also washed them 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.640
 not so I'm in the evening with dirty 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.650
 feet in my sleeping bag hatched 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.580
 and again the next day 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.230
 got up 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.980
 sometimes I sock at night 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.110
 dressed because it was extremely cold at night 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.720
 because I slept a bauwagen 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.420
 with a sleeping bag and that was 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.590
 pretty cold and yes then I have 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.490
 dressed at night socks 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.130
 otherwise I am really 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:55.600
 Ten days we have to think 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:03:00.220
 program sunday thursday friday 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.860
 or even fifteen days continuously 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.650
 I ran barefoot last Saturday 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.630
 The first time I put on my shoes because 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.640
 there I was in I am in such a 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.830
 climbing gym have been climbing and there 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.390
 it was not allowed to be hygienic 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.980
 You were not allowed to start barefoot then 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.500
 to run 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.000
 and then I had it for the first time 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.260
 In short, that was not long, maybe 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.360
 Half an hour shoes on 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.460
 you have taken off immediately 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:29.290
 after I climbed up there 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.240
 and yes, today I had the first one 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.520
 right again and it was on 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.260
 pretty unpleasant right now so I have 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.410
 the feeling I have the same 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:49.360
 a bubble at the back of the heel that was 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:51.700
 quite uncomfortable and yes so on the 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.990
 I also drive in the stall at the tree 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.600
 animals without shoes 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:59.860
 Of course you had to be careful 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.390
 that the cow or the pig does not wake up 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.650
 the kick I think that has 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.750
 rather hurt because his 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.909
 and pigs or a cow like that weighs 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.400
 some and if you then with their 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.720
 Curves is called Nut cake in the pig 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.769
 So I do not know if the ones on the 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.359
 foot kicking , I think and hurt extremely 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.400
 Of course you had to be careful 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.049
 in the stall where you go because the 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.270
 Terrier, of course, as your business 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:27.389
 have done and to step in there 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.610
 I am determined for several times so 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:32.210
 what went through but I know 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.080
 bothering me is less now 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.949
 you had to stop a bit 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.979
 watch out 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:40.949
 otherwise everything went pretty well barefoot 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:43.590
 As always, you have to be careful where you are 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:48.510
 Goes consciously through the 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:52.410
 area yes then I had one more 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:05:01.229
 rash on the foot can show I have 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:05:02.449
 him a little bit so here I have 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:08.930
 a rash 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:15.180
 I have no idea where it came from 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:17.820
 So I am I'm to Luebeck 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.909
 Drove to my mother after the 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.949
 farm so after the internship and there 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:25.409
 I was once on the road 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:27.750
 barefoot and when she came back 

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:30.060
 has totally started my foot 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.830
 to itch and then I scratched and 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.000
 everything is really hot and 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.909
 then have these little post 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.349
 leaflets formed and that was that 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:38.430
 was really corrosive so I do not know 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:40.169
 maybe I'm somewhere purely 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.570
 kicked and then somehow there 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:45.060
 got on top of it I have none 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.490
 I know what it is then I have the same 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:49.229
 coconut oil is lubricated on it and now is 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.190
 it again so almost hold it back 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:56.870
 nothing tragic 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:06:02.050
 so not very pleasant 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:02.050
 there is something else to say here 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.800
 As always, I am often addressed 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.230
 many like it 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.930
 it always come so comments why have 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:18.920
 you dirty feet or or that's great 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:20.150
 is beautiful and yes many ask 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.280
 why I do that 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.320
 if I'm so extreme in the winter 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.750
 do and come again and again 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:30.790
 same questions about a lot of positives 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.790
 Negative is never really 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:36.020
 and yes I think it's beautiful in any case 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:39.910
 that he cares too much about it 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:42.530
 and that you have so many 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.390
 Asking there are impressed me 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.250
 pretty much because it's actually something 

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:51.290
 walk banal barefoot 

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:54.470
 make it easy and good if that 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.040
 someone has questions he can like you 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.170
 put 

00:06:55.040 --> 00:07:01.610
 i am happy about any question about 

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:04.880
 Any comment about anything just yes 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:07.960
 Then I would have a nice day and it 

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.960
 soon teams
