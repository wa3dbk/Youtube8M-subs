00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:10.980
 ingredients that we need mass of 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.719
 chocolate puff pastry to melt sugar 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.719
 honey and butter 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.580
 we started by extending the mass of 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.410
 puff pastry on the surface 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:28.259
 previously flour gives so that it does not 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.259
 stick the dough to butter 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.290
 and sprinkle well of sugar 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.970
 roll the dough from the ends 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.970
 longer to the center 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.430
 once we have it properly rolled 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.190
 we started to cut the palmeritas as 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.410
 a centimeter thick place them 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.220
 on the oven tray lined with 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.220
 baking paper 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.820
 Once ready we put them in the oven 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.399
 previously preheated to 180 degrees 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.120
 for about 15 minutes until they are 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.120
 well golden 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:13.760
 on the other hand we will prepare a syrup 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.230
 putting sugar in a saucepan 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.840
 honey and water 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.570
 Let boil over medium heat for 10 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:27.870
 minutes and after that time we retired and 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:29.970
 we let it temper on the other hand a 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.770
 Once the palmeritas are ready, the 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.970
 We take out of the oven and let them cool 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.820
 on a grid 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:43.360
 Once they are cool, we submerge them 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:45.340
 a few seconds in the syrup and we're going 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.080
 covering with chocolate 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.670
 previously melted in the microwave 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.670
 together with the butter 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.289
 once done this we put them in the 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:02.509
 refrigerator until the chocolate has 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.759
 hardened and we take out at temperature 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:08.170
 environment to consume and they would already be 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.170
 good profit lists
