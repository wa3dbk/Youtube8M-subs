00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.290
 the guest of 20:30 snorkeling at 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.879
 beyond 100 m is comparable to climbing 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.560
 the everest without oxygen how a man 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.480
 can hold from otherwise minutes without 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.800
 breathe what does it feel like diving 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.170
 in this big blue that quickly becomes 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.250
 the big cold he beat several times 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.260
 the world record 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.430
 we see an exploit in his book 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.869
 has just come out deep he's us 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.880
 instead reveals a goodnight philosophy 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.340
 guillaume nery good evening thank you for being with 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.320
 we will start with images that 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.920
 it's your best business card 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.900
 it was viewed on the internet 18 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.640
 million times we are where that day 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.120
 so here we are at 10 blue holts and 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.579
 bahamas 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.960
 it's the deepest place in the world 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.790
 and there I throw myself into the void 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.620
 it is a trouble that is 200 meters from 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.850
 bottom I tested the weight ja for 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.920
 go down like that I have a little bit of 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.940
 weight I'm leaving with not all of them seem to me 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.510
 in the lungs which allows me to 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.920
 flow more easily and very 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.360
 quickly we arrive in the dark 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.440
 almost total what is it 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.930
 what did she mark on your 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.640
 identity card profession adventurers 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.899
 diving a lot to say 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.620
 oppermann of the world 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.320
 these adventurers these explorers yeah 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.610
 it's adventurers of modern times 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.260
 adventurers of modern times before 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.450
 find you are going to watch some 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.520
 elements of wore precisely with his 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.020
 images his dives in abyss elements 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.159
 of portraits with ardor am here we are 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:20.159
 find right after look like in 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.909
 weightlessness at more than 100 meters from 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.009
 depth 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.409
 with guillaume nery apnea becomes a 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:29.590
 art always go down lower without 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:34.469
 breathe 17 years of practice and 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.429
 extreme sensations one is focused on 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:38.200
 all the reactions of the body of 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:39.700
 physiological reaction the pressure that 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.829
 increases and crushes lungs by 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.740
 example I went over there 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.899
 only on it 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:52.209
 this morning at last training 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:55.229
 breathing before diving or camera to 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:58.929
 the hand his companion records the session 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.090
 images that sublimate the performance and 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:08.560
 contributes to the renown of this Nice 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:11.739
 31 years old but his success and guillaume 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.629
 nery owes it above all to 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.040
 bodybuilding exercises on the terrace 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:22.750
 of his building 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:24.730
 there also without breathing there is no 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.829
 a lot of good sensations in this 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.810
 type of workout there but it's a 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:30.760
 obligatory passage 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.530
 last year this figure allows him 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.890
 to establish the apnea france record in 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.350
 constant weight 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:41.720
 that day in Greece guillaume nery of 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:42.770
 100 to 125 meters deep a grail 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.750
 for any analyst 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.750
 anguish for the common man 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.670
 in his universe guillaume néry continues 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:57.130
 to push your limits 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:59.209
 more than a sport a philosophy of life 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.890
 so the first time you will discover 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.790
 you are 14 years old is not keeping 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.470
 big blue you will try in 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.270
 the time it was a bet on a bus 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.070
 with a friend exactly that was a 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.420
 bet at age 14 we like to make 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.239
 challenges like that it's when we're a 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:15.800
 boy a teen and that day I lost 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:17.540
 and so I wanted to improve to make 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.890
 better and there I discovered that the body 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.480
 human was able to adapt to 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.040
 infinity and that fascinated me then you 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.720
 live nice is in front of you 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.190
 there is the sea ​​but also the center 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.930
 world finally apnea a lot 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.459
 of luck exactly rising again 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.200
 today president of this club who 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.060
 is called the cippa and when I 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.950
 started at 97 the planet is very little 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.140
 developed and finally had a center 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.489
 in the world and it was nice so the 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.709
 destiny was with me initially you 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.200
 wanted to find out what boundaries of 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.209
 your body it's a quest that doubles 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.769
 its both a quest for the unknown 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.019
 the exploration of the seabed that have 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.160
 finally was little known 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.079
 want to go see what's going on in 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.630
 this dance is another universe and it's up to 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:55.130
 both a quest for adapting the 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.260
 human body this is the unknown also in 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.299
 this quest there you absorb how much 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.250
 liter of air in the lungs 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.470
 on a maximum inspiration before 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.299
 dive if between 8 and 10 liters 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.100
 rappers 8 liters and you hold 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.350
 how much time in apnea then if I 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.560
 block my breathing without moving without 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.840
 to be 7 and 8 minutes 7 and 8 minutes without 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.519
 breathing breathing outside and 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.200
 in the water in the water in the water it's 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.510
 that's what we call the cne 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.340
 static is by cons sure a dive 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.390
 deep as on my record at 125 m 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.310
 is much shorter because I 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.510
 am in motion and so I consume I 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.680
 consumes energy but the goal is 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.360
 no time there it is really the 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.590
 depth there are still limits 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.920
 that is to say that every time you 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.780
 push the lines 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.670
 that's what's fascinating and it's this 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.230
 which makes that almost 20 years after having 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.710
 started I'm still fascinated by this 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:42.810
 sport is that finally every year 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.060
 we have the impression of opening a 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.100
 new door and a limit that one 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.550
 thought it ended up being played before being 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.900
 finally here I want that I can 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.370
 even more talk limit we can more 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.160
 talk numbers because I think that 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.000
 we are able to adapt to infinity 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.350
 what happens after thirty 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.520
 meters one is that the body there is more than 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.380
 archimedes thrust finally the body 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.910
 falls like a stone that's beyond 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.320
 30 meters the lungs are crushed by 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.940
 the pressure the pressure increases as 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.200
 and as a result of the diving etc the air 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.730
 even though there is in the lungs that 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.320
 makes us float and from 30 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.670
 meters we do not need it anymore we did not 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.630
 no more need of palm and we fall it is 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.050
 the best phase the fall phase 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.870
 free 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.310
 when it's all in flight send 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.780
 good I look at you and you observe where 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.040
 you are as you go 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.330
 diving it gives more and more make of 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.860
 more and more cold so it's true 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.350
 enter an environment that is hostile 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.480
 posted but still it's enough 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.770
 paradoxical but it's a universe and it's 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.300
 a place where we are good it is a wine 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.620
 red I do not want to breathe and 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.060
 finally i feel a little like neil 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.300
 Armstrong who plants flag on the moon 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.220
 and we are well we accept them also a 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.240
 physical feat and an inner journey 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.980
 when you at cic 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.660
 I always considered that the knesset 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.400
 a form of meditation because we are 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.620
 we are not focused on these cases in turn 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.150
 do not open your eyes we are we have the 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.340
 look inward on his 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.110
 own sensations and it's a trip 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.520
 inside really a quest for the 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.740
 knowledge of his body the danger 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.180
 obviously exists the danger exists it's 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.350
 for that we never dive alone 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.640
 for that it's a message to remember 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.440
 for those who want to try apnea 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.060
 it's never to dive alone 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.150
 always go to clubs towards 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.890
 structures there is drunkenness 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.210
 indeed from the depths it is 

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.980
 a legend that really exists 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.270
 graces of depth that's what we 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.730
 called narcosis it's also the 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.620
 subject comes and girls from my companion 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:20.520
 month life gauthier who realized writing 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:22.620
 the film and narcosis so tells in 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.360
 pictures all these visions and his 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.520
 hallucinations that I can have during 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.590
 during a dive because at one time 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.760
 given 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.500
 in the sense there is the area that 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.060
 actually consoles himself with the 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.830
 pressure we have small nitrogen bubbles 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.420
 that passes into the blood and this nitrogen a 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.320
 narcotic effect will disrupt a little 

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.270
 nerve connections 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.280
 you see what for example enough enough 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.170
 particular sending a picture of a scene 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.230
 wedding that will be from the movie narcosis 

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:46.670
 etc it's based on a vision 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.590
 real that I could have once 

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:50.960
 back from a very deep dive 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:54.050
 I am not married and yet I have 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:56.360
 saw us getting married underwater and that's 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.580
 quite violent during the dive is done 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.560
 as follows at the cinema in front of my screen of 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.450
 telly and then I look at my subconscious 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.250
