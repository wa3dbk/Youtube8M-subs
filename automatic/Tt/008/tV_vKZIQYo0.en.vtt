00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
 the diagram of apolo and dionisio 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.470
 if they are fixed 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:04.880
 in the axis of 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.800
 of the sickle of facts 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.199
 is a focused company alex and science 

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:14.559
 and in the shaft of the fig tree this is accompanied by your warm ovation 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:20.849
 If you're not efficient, it's irrelevant if you're not innovative but it's 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:22.060
 Irrelevant 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.650
 but if I went to your business 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.310
 You have to be efficient but if you pass the operator's hand 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.919
 ksm implosion 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:34.109
 if you miss your hand and innovative callÃ©n explosion 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.440
 Now I asked a very dear friend of mine, my designer, to make it a milestone 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.400
 idea that yes or no 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.890
 it really seems like he did it to the smart 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.380
 from in that 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.530
 and now see this 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.530
 the brand is sometimes the product 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.510
 but to which the tie 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.050
 better said sometimes is the product then 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.350
 they want to stifle the status quo to the establishment 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.050
 very focused on the operating energy 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.369
 the apollo mission 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:05.670
 the god apollo 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.670
 the god of precision the god of science 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.820
 here you have the face of the madman of Dionysus 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.740
 efe I missions l the expansive the irreverent 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.290
 the exuberant 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.840
 the Romans melo burned it 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.510
 at the beginning 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.830
 just look ninth 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.830
 they burned it to nobody, I do not know why they burned it 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.290
 they put him under 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.340
 and they put the god of rape 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.940
 true god of wine 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:38.650
 then they really annihilated all the benefits associated with God 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.540
 of division 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.860
 very related to the theme of creativity 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.500
 so if we go again the diagram 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.330
 most companies are operating 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.690
 but when they stop innovating they fall into implosion 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.640
 then right now 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.970
 the opportunities are moving like this here 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.890
 the one who has sfr 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.590
 the one that foresees that this young 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:03.980
 that if someone 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.760
 then a crisis 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.939
 excuse mind what I said there 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.229
 see how 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.419
 the one-way life cycle of companies 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:14.069
 systematically 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.599
 it is shrinking 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.859
 st shockingly shocking 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:20.809
 this digit 

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:24.379
 then when it's my turn to advise family businesses 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.589
 I tell him bad news 

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:28.109
 bad news 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:31.219
 that is, the probabilities for the second one to pass 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:32.179
 generation 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:34.179
 they are less than 50% 

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:38.399
 the solid for the third generation to pass nor do I want to tell you how low 

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:39.349
 what 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.409
 but not because you are unites as they are your 

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:45.099
 uu because your son is a punch in June 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.639
 that many times that is the case 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:52.249
 there is simply no inertia and uniter competitiveness that is being 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:56.619
 cycles in companies machi quitos what does that mean for young people 

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:59.779
 that Father 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:03.339
 because in this swirl in this sector with pt itself no 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:05.749
 the resources of the commune 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:08.849
 in an active and efficient way and small windows are opened 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:14.419
 then in the transition times the favored ones are the young and the 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:16.359
 innovative but not 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.359
 we are as young as you 

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:22.659
 can you point the camera since it was not please 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:25.799
 I said I'm not going to take you to the right but please 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.209
 nothing more 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.229
 of this one 

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:30.509
 this man is an innovator 

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:35.249
 is an innovator who will not be a starter in that race or truth if he does not 

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:38.249
 good goods hauled because otherwise no bars will not lower the example 

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:40.150
 Thank you 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.299
 but here is a lawyer 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.149
 that it will be time to come and talk to someone 

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:46.689
 and see if he learns 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:48.089
 that is 

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:50.219
 they are the owners of the change 

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:52.689
 the innovators 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:54.119
 old 

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:56.879
 they are the inflexible 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.709
 of sherry that rigidity 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.499
 old age has nothing to do with the years 

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:05.819
 I know very old men 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.239
 of 20 years that are static 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.430
 and I know 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.999
 percent a month 

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:14.369
 very happy very nice yes no
