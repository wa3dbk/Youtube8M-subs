really<00:00:54.109> start<00:00:54.409> to<00:00:56.649> you<00:00:57.649> know<00:00:57.679> acclimated<00:00:58.489> to

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
really start to you know acclimated to

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:01.809 
really start to you know acclimated to
to<00:00:59.059> to<00:00:59.809> hearing<00:01:00.140> it<00:01:00.319> in<00:01:01.190> these<00:01:01.370> different<00:01:01.609> ways

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:01.819 
to to hearing it in these different ways

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:03.610 
to to hearing it in these different ways
and<00:01:02.300> pretty<00:01:02.510> soon<00:01:02.719> that<00:01:03.229> that<00:01:03.469> really

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
and pretty soon that that really

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.969 
and pretty soon that that really
shouldn't<00:01:03.920> be<00:01:04.070> a<00:01:04.100> problem<00:01:04.810> and<00:01:05.810> and<00:01:06.470> of<00:01:06.740> course

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
shouldn't be a problem and and of course

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:08.410 
shouldn't be a problem and and of course
in<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:07.400> end<00:01:07.490> it<00:01:07.610> all<00:01:07.729> comes<00:01:07.909> down<00:01:08.030> to<00:01:08.180> personal

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
in the end it all comes down to personal

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.450 
in the end it all comes down to personal
taste<00:01:08.659> like<00:01:08.990> you<00:01:09.110> might<00:01:09.830> maybe<00:01:10.040> you<00:01:10.190> really

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
like the way you know it works for you

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.539

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
know minor 7 flat 5 chord but not the

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.330 
know minor 7 flat 5 chord but not the
way<00:01:16.670> it<00:01:16.790> works<00:01:17.030> as<00:01:17.299> that<00:01:17.950> Phrygian<00:01:18.950> quarter

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:23.719 
you know so really in the end it all

so<00:02:18.470> it<00:02:19.099> will<00:02:19.250> give<00:02:19.489> it<00:02:19.849> will<00:02:19.970> give<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.239> harmony

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
so it will give it will give the harmony

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.340 
so it will give it will give the harmony
a<00:02:20.599> very<00:02:20.930> sort<00:02:21.500> of<00:02:21.560> a

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
a very sort of a

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.170 
a very sort of a
definite<00:02:23.740> character<00:02:24.070> a<00:02:24.550> very<00:02:24.940> specific

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
definite character a very specific

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.140 
definite character a very specific
character<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:27.310> that's<00:02:27.610> that's<00:02:27.970> what<00:02:28.120> I

character and that's that's what I
really<00:02:28.480> like<00:02:28.660> about<00:02:28.950> using<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.220> course<00:02:30.430> like

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
really like about using the course like

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.460 
really like about using the course like
these<00:02:30.790> because<00:02:31.150> you<00:02:31.300> can<00:02:31.450> you<00:02:32.020> can<00:02:32.170> go<00:02:32.260> through

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
these because you can you can go through

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.610 
these because you can you can go through

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
you know the same the same set of

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.360 
you know the same the same set of
changes<00:02:36.840> but<00:02:37.840> for<00:02:38.320> each<00:02:38.440> course<00:02:38.710> you<00:02:38.800> can<00:02:39.100> you

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
changes but for each course you can you

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.050 
changes but for each course you can you
know<00:02:39.490> pick<00:02:39.730> out<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.150> use<00:02:40.330> these<00:02:40.510> different

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
know pick out you use these different

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.980 
know pick out you use these different
sounds<00:02:43.060> like<00:02:43.180> you<00:02:43.420> know<00:02:43.540> maybe<00:02:43.720> you<00:02:43.840> want

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
sounds like you know maybe you want

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.320 
sounds like you know maybe you want
course<00:02:44.200> you<00:02:44.380> really<00:02:44.650> usually<00:02:45.090> this<00:02:46.090> type<00:02:46.300> of

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
course you really usually this type of

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.270 
course you really usually this type of
sound<00:02:46.630> and<00:02:46.900> another<00:02:47.200> course<00:02:47.500> you're<00:02:47.800> using<00:02:48.010> it

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
sound and another course you're using it

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.180 
sound and another course you're using it
you<00:02:48.310> know<00:02:48.550> a<00:02:49.020> different<00:02:50.130> totally<00:02:51.130> different

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
you know a different totally different

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.370 
you know a different totally different
sound<00:02:51.610> and<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.360> way<00:02:52.510> that<00:02:52.720> impacts<00:02:53.290> the

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
sound and and the way that impacts the

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.460 
sound and and the way that impacts the
harmony<00:02:53.740> is<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:55.510> know<00:02:55.600> it's<00:02:55.750> subtle<00:02:56.050> but<00:02:56.170> it

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
harmony is you know it's subtle but it

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.640 
harmony is you know it's subtle but it
really<00:02:56.800> it<00:02:57.310> makes<00:02:57.520> it<00:02:57.700> feel<00:02:58.320> very<00:02:59.320> different

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
really it makes it feel very different

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.220 
really it makes it feel very different
and<00:02:59.800> and<00:02:59.980> so<00:03:00.220> so<00:03:00.970> your<00:03:01.360> choices<00:03:01.690> when<00:03:01.990> it<00:03:02.020> comes

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
and and so so your choices when it comes

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.410 
and and so so your choices when it comes
to<00:03:02.380> the<00:03:02.470> course<00:03:02.710> you<00:03:02.860> play<00:03:03.100> become<00:03:03.970> really

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
to the course you play become really

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.020 
to the course you play become really
specific<00:03:04.990> it's<00:03:05.170> not<00:03:05.350> just<00:03:05.620> you<00:03:05.980> know<00:03:06.100> oh<00:03:06.340> it's

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
specific it's not just you know oh it's

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.150 
specific it's not just you know oh it's
it's<00:03:07.360> an<00:03:07.510> a<00:03:07.630> minor<00:03:07.900> so<00:03:08.200> I<00:03:08.260> know<00:03:08.320> you<00:03:08.800> know<00:03:08.920> I

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
know this is an a minor chord so you
