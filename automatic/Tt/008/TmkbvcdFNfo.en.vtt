00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.939
 Oh, you shit something against here 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.470
 After this intro, I'll show you now 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.470
 first the new things of the snapshot 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.910
 12 b 38a are not so many and 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.060
 I'll start right away because there is 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.130
 two new monsters and once the 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.990
 bat then rumgammeln here so 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.239
 by means of building this can probably still 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.080
 not so and this does not matter 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.610
 does not attack 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.970
 you can kill him but you can 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.150
 does not get anything and as a second mode 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:47.070
 is the witch the right stylight with 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:48.650
 her funny hat and that is and also 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.320
 not yet when you swell 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:57.199
 throws it as you can see here the 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:01.049
 tara dieter vaas bfc with poisons 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:03.000
 and that is a nice to stupid 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:05.450
 To meet this role a few more 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.790
 witches on and this always sees the 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:11.430
 yards with give to be fooled - and 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.260
 are so stupid and most active is 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.909
 idiots yourself 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.500
 another innovation is that if you 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.450
 in a portal that goes directly 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.009
 What I generally do not import is imported 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.170
 so cool because I thought she was cool 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.530
 they are to get a fake screen 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.990
 Furthermore, there are new sounds 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.179
 which were added by mojang like 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.979
 you can already hear this race 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:38.780
 Sound and when you place the lawn 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:42.440
 a new sound the same in wood 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:46.370
 if you run over it 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.070
 as with stone and if you are 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.140
 over it runs 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.640
 and this is still quite acceptable 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.190
 Although is not even like the normal 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.200
 are now in it but then comes 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:02.450
 sand sound that is really ugly 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.760
 I that sounds so if you 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.380
 over it comes on why a done 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.979
 not so bad but i am somehow 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.380
 a shit tone then if necessary 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.470
 which was also changed 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.910
 I already had stone and now thinks 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:23.200
 you probably will not be kidding hear you 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:23.200
 the new sound from here lighter 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.870
 you think what you think 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.850
 These mojang children definitely 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.650
 not just want new sound the 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.120
 if that's how I 'll be added 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.500
 Definitely use sound packs around 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.230
 to maintain the old ones 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.940
 The mountain around the block has a new texture 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.440
 unfortunately got 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:51.260
 What is it called this horny rotating 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.780
 tinted dinging away and but that 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.480
 beam was also slightly changed me 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.150
 find the old spin stewed part of 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.550
 us better now times a change the 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.870
 I do not think so bad of course 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.230
 I think I find the mobs horny too 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.760
 but if you put wood here now 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.100
 this is no longer automatic 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.690
 at a pillar so oblique but with it 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.560
 If it is at an angle, you have to continue 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.360
 be distant 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.910
 This has always been very important in rope building 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.650
 annoyed and in general then became 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.150
 something else at the commando so blog 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.959
 changed a bit like that 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.209
 I'm not there yet 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.830
 I do not know why 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.550
 that you do not get any updates from 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.500
 snapshots 12 b 38a that's cool to me 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.500
 I find this snapshot honest 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.030
 Only the monsters said the sound 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.940
 are not really my thing and really 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.530
 that with the 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.810
 portals me not so nice but it 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.460
 is up to everyone and a lot 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.850
 fun anyway with this snapshot and 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.850
 ciao
