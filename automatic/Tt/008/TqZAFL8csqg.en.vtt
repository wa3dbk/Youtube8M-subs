guy's<00:04:25.040> abilities<00:04:25.550> or<00:04:25.730> more<00:04:26.240> like<00:04:26.570> like<00:04:26.750> he<00:04:26.810> can

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
guy's abilities or more like like he can

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.750 
guy's abilities or more like like he can
use<00:04:27.260> these<00:04:27.410> as<00:04:27.440> like<00:04:27.860> offensive<00:04:28.340> weapons

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
use these as like offensive weapons

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.330 
use these as like offensive weapons
rather<00:04:29.420> than<00:04:29.630> using<00:04:29.690> them<00:04:30.200> as<00:04:30.380> like<00:04:30.860> a<00:04:30.920> big

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
rather than using them as like a big

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.360 
rather than using them as like a big
tides<00:04:32.000> of<00:04:32.360> water<00:04:32.750> that<00:04:33.170> generally<00:04:34.040> a<00:04:34.070> lot<00:04:34.250> of

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
tides of water that generally a lot of

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.950 
tides of water that generally a lot of
the<00:04:34.520> the<00:04:34.790> waterbenders<00:04:35.270> use<00:04:35.450> although<00:04:35.630> that

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
the the waterbenders use although that

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.810 
the the waterbenders use although that
like<00:04:36.500> I<00:04:36.590> arrow<00:04:36.830> creative<00:04:37.310> yeah<00:04:37.460> they<00:04:37.700> got

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
like I arrow creative yeah they got

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.340 
like I arrow creative yeah they got
really<00:04:38.090> creative<00:04:38.330> yeah<00:04:38.630> like<00:04:38.810> Mara<00:04:39.050> the<00:04:39.260> way

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
really creative yeah like Mara the way

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.760 
really creative yeah like Mara the way
Mary<00:04:39.590> uses<00:04:39.980> her<00:04:40.130> abilities<00:04:40.850> at<00:04:41.000> this<00:04:41.120> point

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
Mary uses her abilities at this point

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.750 
Mary uses her abilities at this point
think<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:42.860> figure<00:04:43.070> does<00:04:43.370> look<00:04:43.640> really<00:04:44.120> nice<00:04:44.420> I

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
think the figure does look really nice I

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.190 
think the figure does look really nice I
this<00:04:46.760> one<00:04:46.940> has<00:04:47.120> much<00:04:47.270> more<00:04:47.300> articulation<00:04:47.900> than

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
this one has much more articulation than

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.260 
this one has much more articulation than
the<00:04:48.290> other<00:04:48.560> Aqualad<00:04:49.310> figure<00:04:49.670> which<00:04:49.820> I<00:04:49.880> wish<00:04:50.120> I

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
the other Aqualad figure which I wish I

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.090 
the other Aqualad figure which I wish I
had<00:04:50.510> as<00:04:50.780> a<00:04:50.810> comparison<00:04:51.260> to<00:04:51.560> show<00:04:51.740> the<00:04:51.950> two

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
had as a comparison to show the two

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.210 
had as a comparison to show the two
right<00:04:52.340> now<00:04:52.810> but<00:04:53.810> I<00:04:54.200> honestly<00:04:54.560> think<00:04:54.920> the<00:04:55.010> other

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
right now but I honestly think the other

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.710 
right now but I honestly think the other
Aqualad<00:04:55.670> figure<00:04:55.970> looks<00:04:56.120> much<00:04:56.270> better<00:04:56.480> than

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
Aqualad figure looks much better than

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.070 
Aqualad figure looks much better than
this<00:04:56.900> one<00:04:57.170> yeah<00:04:58.010> it<00:04:58.490> is<00:04:59.300> just<00:04:59.480> because<00:04:59.750> also

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
this one yeah it is just because also

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.510 
this one yeah it is just because also
it's<00:05:00.230> a<00:05:00.290> DC<00:05:00.560> direct<00:05:00.890> but<00:05:01.070> you're<00:05:01.190> too<00:05:01.340> so

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
it's a DC direct but you're too so

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.150 
it's a DC direct but you're too so
that's<00:05:01.700> probably<00:05:02.210> why<00:05:02.600> and<00:05:03.050> the<00:05:03.680> stand<00:05:03.950> this

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
that's probably why and the stand this

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.400 
that's probably why and the stand this
came<00:05:04.490> in<00:05:04.760> Kingland<00:05:05.330> still<00:05:05.810> it's<00:05:06.020> really<00:05:06.260> nice
