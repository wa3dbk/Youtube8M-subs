00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
let's go to the terminal again go

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.959 
let's go to the terminal again go
utilities<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.719> open<00:02:25.499> up<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.769> application

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:25.969 
utilities and open up the application

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:28.670 
utilities and open up the application
terminals<00:02:26.969> and<00:02:27.359> we're<00:02:28.139> just<00:02:28.290> going<00:02:28.409> to<00:02:28.499> paste

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
terminals and we're just going to paste

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.220 
terminals and we're just going to paste
that<00:02:29.069> in<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.639> you<00:02:29.879> can<00:02:30.090> take<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:30.780> from<00:02:31.170> the

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
that in and you can take that from the

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.780 
that in and you can take that from the
common<00:02:31.560> Siri<00:02:31.769> and<00:02:31.920> paste<00:02:32.129> it<00:02:32.310> in<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:32.519> then<00:02:32.579> hit

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
common Siri and paste it in and then hit

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.289 
common Siri and paste it in and then hit
return<00:02:32.939> and<00:02:33.450> here<00:02:34.319> it<00:02:34.560> gives<00:02:34.709> you<00:02:34.889> all<00:02:35.730> the

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
return and here it gives you all the

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.080 
return and here it gives you all the
items<00:02:36.480> in<00:02:36.989> history<00:02:37.530> on<00:02:37.799> that<00:02:38.400> particular<00:02:38.909> day

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
items in history on that particular day

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.119 
items in history on that particular day
so<00:02:39.120> these<00:02:40.019> are<00:02:40.169> the<00:02:40.260> famous<00:02:40.469> things<00:02:40.950> that

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
so these are the famous things that

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.319 
so these are the famous things that
happen<00:02:41.430> on<00:02:41.519> any<00:02:41.700> particular<00:02:41.909> day<00:02:42.329> and<00:02:43.189> I<00:02:44.329> think

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
happen on any particular day and I think

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:46.580 
happen on any particular day and I think
it's<00:02:45.480> pretty<00:02:45.599> cool<00:02:45.840> that<00:02:46.019> it's<00:02:46.200> in<00:02:46.379> there<00:02:46.560> and

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
it's pretty cool that it's in there and

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.559 
it's pretty cool that it's in there and
very<00:02:46.739> few<00:02:47.040> people<00:02:47.099> know<00:02:47.400> it's<00:02:47.700> in<00:02:47.849> there<00:02:48.030> so

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
very few people know it's in there so

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.530 
very few people know it's in there so
that<00:02:48.840> was<00:02:49.139> another<00:02:49.379> little<00:02:49.980> easter<00:02:50.939> egg<00:02:50.969> so

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
that was another little easter egg so

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.319 
that was another little easter egg so
we're<00:02:51.750> learning<00:02:51.989> something<00:02:52.799> new<00:02:53.030> here<00:02:54.030> is

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
we're learning something new here is

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.659 
we're learning something new here is
another<00:02:54.989> one<00:02:55.260> which<00:02:55.530> I<00:02:55.709> think<00:02:55.739> was<00:02:56.129> hilarious

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:56.669 
another one which I think was hilarious

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:59.770 
another one which I think was hilarious
that<00:02:56.879> a<00:02:57.090> programmer<00:02:57.870> actually<00:02:58.769> put<00:02:59.069> this<00:02:59.280> in

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
that a programmer actually put this in

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.110 
that a programmer actually put this in
to<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:01.590> Mac<00:03:01.769> operating<00:03:01.949> system<00:03:02.730> but<00:03:02.879> I<00:03:02.909> guess

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
to the Mac operating system but I guess

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.119 
to the Mac operating system but I guess
if<00:03:03.269> you're<00:03:03.389> hungry<00:03:03.540> this<00:03:03.959> is<00:03:04.079> not<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.260> bit<00:03:04.530> one

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
if you're hungry this is not a bit one

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.879 
if you're hungry this is not a bit one
to<00:03:05.310> have<00:03:05.489> on<00:03:05.519> file<00:03:06.199> again<00:03:07.199> open<00:03:07.560> up<00:03:07.650> terminal

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:07.889 
to have on file again open up terminal

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:10.459 
to have on file again open up terminal
but<00:03:08.310> this<00:03:08.430> time<00:03:08.669> type<00:03:09.000> in<00:03:09.180> this<00:03:09.359> command<00:03:09.569> which

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:10.469 
but this time type in this command which

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:13.640 
but this time type in this command which
again<00:03:10.739> I<00:03:10.949> will<00:03:11.219> put<00:03:11.459> in<00:03:12.109> the<00:03:13.109> comments<00:03:13.500> area

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
again I will put in the comments area

there<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:25.829> is<00:03:25.979> funny<00:03:26.669> thing<00:03:26.939> is<00:03:27.090> that<00:03:27.269> it's

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
there it is funny thing is that it's

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.300 
there it is funny thing is that it's
built<00:03:27.599> into<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.989> operating<00:03:28.259> system<00:03:28.889> so<00:03:29.099> I

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
built into the operating system so I

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.789 
built into the operating system so I
think<00:03:29.669> it's<00:03:29.970> a<00:03:30.090> real<00:03:30.359> hidden<00:03:30.599> gem<00:03:30.720> and<00:03:31.109> kind<00:03:31.709> of

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
think it's a real hidden gem and kind of

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.879 
think it's a real hidden gem and kind of
funny<00:03:32.419> this<00:03:33.419> is<00:03:33.599> probably<00:03:34.079> the<00:03:34.319> most<00:03:34.500> famous

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889
