 and now let's dance with a special screen 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.080
 about organized cheerleaders that's it 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.580
 marcel 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.710
 let's go to the independent headquarters 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.710
 from São Paulo on the screen 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.810
 we are here in the independent 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.030
 of the more organized cheerleaders 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.700
 brazilian football today we have the 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.620
 pleasure to be representing the greatest 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.809
 tricolor family of twisted brasil 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.930
 tricolor independent 41 years 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.879
 Our start was very difficult. 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.879
 it was a start because São Paulo had 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.160
 an official crowd who was kept tusk 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.520
 by the club itself and there a group of 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.430
 idealistic young people in the final 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.309
 60's early 70's can 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.309
 repression wanted to found a crowd 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.339
 different from the standards of the time then 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.010
 wanting according to the changes of the 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:12.150
 world to the countries that are 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.250
 releasing the wave of independence and was 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.740
 where the independent and 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.100
 today we are turning 41 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.920
 this year of 2013 and with a 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.119
 very strong social and the main 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.890
 aggregating the fans of são paulo there 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.790
 two independent nation with the neighborhood of 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.549
 Sao Paulo 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.380
 she started here in the central region is 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.810
 precisely in the paissandu 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.390
 avenue ipiranga that is our landmark 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.100
 zero and from there we were the first 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.939
 organized crowd that would have a 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.360
 own 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.060
 tell you in passing where a group of 12 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.189
 then bought the room 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.619
 I was one of the people who 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.659
 I helped and collaborated in the time we 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.850
 We bought this room and then 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.070
 we reverted to the group that the fans 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.440
 independent and not this idea of 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.410
 independent twist from side 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.950
 the carnival emerged for a few years 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:11.190
 here she is to ours we start as 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.220
 block in the 80's where we did not know 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.590
 champion as a carnival block and then 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.080
 we fight is migrated to school 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.060
 samba and only there it has a long way 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.280
 We stayed a few years out of the 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.200
 carnival parades and return to 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.420
 three years ago four years ago to 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.160
 be precise and in this period of four 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.570
 We've already got a runner-up 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:42.470
 in a championship that took us banned 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:46.380
 again organized and 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.510
 ideology is commitment is unity is 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.360
 very different from what many times 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.550
 the media shows why the media shows 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.230
 side of violence as is the proximity 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.000
 of you with the club 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.360
 Look, we have a good relationship. 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.490
 with the club with the direction of the 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.560
 people do not have much access 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.410
 paulo is a slightly different club 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.090
 in that he does not open the door to much 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.739
 the organized cheerleaders 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.140
 so we keep that good 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.580
 relationship but we do not have 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.910
 access within the club 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.650
 we need to think about adding add 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.690
 create a culture including pages 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.430
 stadiums is what we want 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.610
 but unfortunately we do not have 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.739
 police power to monitor all 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.480
 but we try to do 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.000
 a correct serious work 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.550
 At least we'll face it and never 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.870
 omitted from the authorities to make 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.430
 this prevention work 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.140
 I think that reducing violence in 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.840
 also has to do with the 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.660
 prevention of the authorities before 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.890
 games also happen to prevent it 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.489
 it is primordial 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:53.010
 I think if there were problems and 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.170
 still happen because of a lack of 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.870
 prevention that was not done long ago 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.300
 I think with work it is 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.540
 relationship between the fans 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:06.690
 prosecutors civilian police police 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.510
 a commitment work 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.610
 eye in the eye I think just like that we 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.360
 we will arrive at that ideal moment of 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.590
 peace of families to return 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.590
 late that I think this is the main 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.380
 I was always present and you 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.780
 Let's just say an old guard 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.930
 but we are there 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.750
 conquering we have conquered many things 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:36.560
 still using public also with 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:39.530
 sure the public today is like ours. 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.130
 reference in terms of cheer in the 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:45.860
 independent twist and order of magnitude 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:50.390
 It is a reference in terms of crowd 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:53.870
 then it is our own serious purpose. 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:57.020
 this is not aggravating more and more 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:01.340
 seeking to provide the passed-ado 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:04.040
 to supporters this accommodation each 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.840
 more affective, right? 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.260
 to associate independently as 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.919

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:16.100

 Independent of são paulo I am in favor 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.130
 organized business cheerleading 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.440

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.940

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.949

 To end up with a woman coming to

 white because it's the happiest day of my life 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.150
 It is understood from there that the night
