00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.749 

okay<00:00:01.230> so<00:00:01.730> I've<00:00:02.730> gone<00:00:02.939> ahead<00:00:03.000> and<00:00:04.549> replaced<00:00:05.549> all

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
okay so I've gone ahead and replaced all

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.820 
okay so I've gone ahead and replaced all
the<00:00:05.970> fuel<00:00:06.180> injectors<00:00:06.690> and<00:00:08.240> I've<00:00:09.830> reattached

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
the fuel injectors and I've reattached

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.589 
the fuel injectors and I've reattached
the<00:00:11.160> fuel<00:00:11.429> rails<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:11.969> tops<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.360> all<00:00:12.450> the

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
the fuel rails to the tops of all the

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.360 
the fuel rails to the tops of all the
fuel<00:00:12.809> injectors<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.290> then<00:00:13.679> connected<00:00:14.250> all

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
fuel injectors and then connected all

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.269 
fuel injectors and then connected all
the<00:00:14.400> electrical<00:00:15.800> connectors<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:17.039> all<00:00:17.160> the

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
the electrical connectors to all the

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.970 
the electrical connectors to all the
fuel<00:00:17.460> injectors<00:00:18.080> so<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.230> next<00:00:19.439> step<00:00:19.650> here<00:00:19.859> is

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
fuel injectors so the next step here is

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.650 
fuel injectors so the next step here is
to<00:00:20.720> risa<00:00:21.720> cure<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.470> fuel<00:00:23.150> manifold<00:00:24.150> which<00:00:24.480> are

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
to risa cure the fuel manifold which are

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.109 
to risa cure the fuel manifold which are
the<00:00:24.810> silver<00:00:25.590> fuel<00:00:25.859> lines<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.369> connect<00:00:26.699> to

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
the silver fuel lines that connect to

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.210 
the silver fuel lines that connect to
the<00:00:27.210> top<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.570> fuel<00:00:27.750> injectors<00:00:28.140> first<00:00:29.010> step

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
the top of the fuel injectors first step

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.540 
the top of the fuel injectors first step
in<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.519> there's<00:00:29.789> four<00:00:30.029> bolts<00:00:30.449> there<00:00:31.550> eight

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
in that there's four bolts there eight

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.680 
in that there's four bolts there eight
millimeter<00:00:33.120> bolts

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
millimeter bolts

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.620 
millimeter bolts
there's<00:00:33.989> two<00:00:34.230> on<00:00:34.380> each<00:00:34.530> side<00:00:35.300> what<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.450> want

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
there's two on each side what you want

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.850 
there's two on each side what you want
to<00:00:36.719> do<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:38.660> put<00:00:39.660> each<00:00:39.899> one<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.290> those<00:00:40.379> bolts<00:00:40.739> in

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
to do is put each one of those bolts in

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.860 
to do is put each one of those bolts in
first<00:00:41.190> by<00:00:41.430> hand<00:00:41.730> making<00:00:42.300> them<00:00:42.510> finger<00:00:42.840> tight

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
first by hand making them finger tight

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.020 
first by hand making them finger tight
the<00:00:43.680> reason<00:00:43.980> for<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.700> don't<00:00:44.789> want<00:00:44.879> to

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
the reason for that is you don't want to

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.119 
the reason for that is you don't want to
throw<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.210> ratchet<00:00:45.570> on<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.840> right<00:00:46.020> away<00:00:46.129> because

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
throw a ratchet on it right away because

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.529 
throw a ratchet on it right away because
if<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.430> get<00:00:47.579> them<00:00:47.670> started<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.329> they're

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
if you get them started and they're

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.330 
if you get them started and they're
little<00:00:48.840> snug<00:00:49.050> going<00:00:49.350> in<00:00:49.469> you'll<00:00:49.649> probably<00:00:49.860> you

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
little snug going in you'll probably you

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.889 
little snug going in you'll probably you
may<00:00:50.489> cross<00:00:50.730> thread<00:00:51.059> them<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.390> then<00:00:51.480> that's

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
may cross thread them and then that's

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.360 
may cross thread them and then that's
the<00:00:52.050> last<00:00:52.230> time<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.500> they're<00:00:52.829> going<00:00:53.129> in<00:00:53.280> or

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
the last time that they're going in or

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.470 
the last time that they're going in or
out<00:00:53.399> without<00:00:53.840> some<00:00:54.840> significant<00:00:55.649> effort<00:00:56.480> so

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
out without some significant effort so

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.360 
out without some significant effort so
I've<00:00:57.750> gone<00:00:57.960> ahead<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.260> put<00:00:58.829> all<00:00:58.980> four<00:00:59.190> bolts

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
I've gone ahead and put all four bolts

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.599 
I've gone ahead and put all four bolts
back<00:00:59.640> in<00:01:00.170> finger<00:01:01.170> tight<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:02.100> now<00:01:02.250> we're<00:01:02.460> ready

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
back in finger tight so now we're ready

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.789 
back in finger tight so now we're ready
to<00:01:02.730> go<00:01:02.820> ahead<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.059> torque<00:01:03.210> them<00:01:03.359> down<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:04.290> now

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
to go ahead and torque them down so now

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.230 
to go ahead and torque them down so now
this<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.189> tool<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.670> everybody<00:01:06.030> should

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
this is a tool that everybody should

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.780 
this is a tool that everybody should
have<00:01:06.360> one<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:07.200> their<00:01:07.890> tool<00:01:08.100> chest<00:01:08.369> at<00:01:08.610> least

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
have one of in their tool chest at least

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.080 
have one of in their tool chest at least
I<00:01:09.000> think<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.860> it's<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.920> torque<00:01:11.130> wrench<00:01:11.340> now

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
I think so it's a torque wrench now

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.880 
I think so it's a torque wrench now
torque<00:01:12.390> wrenches<00:01:12.689> come<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:13.080> different<00:01:13.350> styles

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
torque wrenches come in different styles

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.920 
torque wrenches come in different styles
and<00:01:14.070> lengths<00:01:14.310> this<00:01:15.000> one<00:01:15.210> here<00:01:15.420> happens<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.810> be

and lengths this one here happens to be

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.649 
and lengths this one here happens to be
a<00:01:15.960> half-inch<00:01:16.439> drive<00:01:16.770> it's<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.700> long<00:01:17.939> one<00:01:18.210> and

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
a half-inch drive it's a long one and

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.410 
a half-inch drive it's a long one and
two<00:01:19.380> click<00:01:19.590> torque<00:01:20.100> wrench<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.520> click<00:01:20.610> means

two click torque wrench and click means

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.420 
two click torque wrench and click means
that<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.720> can<00:01:21.900> twist<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.680> handle<00:01:22.950> here<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.220> set

scenario<00:01:52.290> here<00:01:52.590> I<00:01:52.770> have<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:54.229> quarter<00:01:55.229> inch

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
scenario here I have a quarter inch

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.929 
scenario here I have a quarter inch
drive<00:01:55.619> eight<00:01:55.950> millimeter<00:01:56.520> socket<00:01:58.280> my<00:01:59.280> torque

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
drive eight millimeter socket my torque

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.670 
drive eight millimeter socket my torque
ranch<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.390> half<00:02:00.659> inch<00:02:00.840> drive<00:02:01.020> so<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.350> need<00:02:01.560> to

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
ranch is a half inch drive so I need to

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.530 
ranch is a half inch drive so I need to
get<00:02:01.799> from<00:02:01.950> quarter<00:02:02.280> inch<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.610> half<00:02:02.790> inch<00:02:02.969> so<00:02:03.329> in

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
get from quarter inch to half inch so in

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.270 
get from quarter inch to half inch so in
between<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.350> eight<00:02:04.409> millimeter<00:02:04.770> socket<00:02:04.829> I'm

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
between the eight millimeter socket I'm

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.999 
between the eight millimeter socket I'm
going<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.490> have<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.670> 3/8<00:02:06.329> inch<00:02:06.509> drive<00:02:07.009> two

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
going to have a 3/8 inch drive two

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.690 
going to have a 3/8 inch drive two
quarter<00:02:08.489> inch<00:02:08.640> step-down

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
quarter inch step-down

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.330 
quarter inch step-down
and<00:02:09.910> then<00:02:10.720> I<00:02:10.750> will<00:02:10.899> have<00:02:11.170> connected<00:02:11.709> to<00:02:11.860> that<00:02:12.040> a

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
and then I will have connected to that a

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.870 
and then I will have connected to that a
half<00:02:13.270> inch<00:02:13.480> drive<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:13.959> 3/8<00:02:14.319> step-down<00:02:14.880> so

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
half inch drive to 3/8 step-down so

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.290 
half inch drive to 3/8 step-down so
we'll<00:02:16.120> connect<00:02:16.630> those<00:02:16.750> two<00:02:16.989> together<00:02:17.110> and

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
we'll connect those two together and

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.510 
we'll connect those two together and
then<00:02:19.300> we<00:02:19.450> will<00:02:19.569> put<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.840> socket<00:02:20.739> on<00:02:21.069> top<00:02:21.310> of

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
then we will put the socket on top of

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.240 
then we will put the socket on top of
that<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:22.349> then<00:02:23.349> put<00:02:23.590> that<00:02:23.620> on<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:23.980> end<00:02:24.069> of<00:02:24.160> the

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
that and then put that on the end of the

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.280 
that and then put that on the end of the
wrench<00:02:24.430> now<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:25.030> torque<00:02:25.360> specification<00:02:26.140> for

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
wrench now the torque specification for

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.740 
wrench now the torque specification for
these<00:02:26.410> four<00:02:26.650> bolts<00:02:27.209> according<00:02:28.209> to<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.390> manual

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
these four bolts according to the manual

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.520 
these four bolts according to the manual
is<00:02:28.989> somewhere<00:02:29.530> between<00:02:30.870> 15<00:02:31.870> and<00:02:31.900> 22

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
is somewhere between 15 and 22

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.770 
is somewhere between 15 and 22
foot-pounds<00:02:33.250> of<00:02:33.310> torque<00:02:33.370> so<00:02:33.790> I'm<00:02:34.450> going<00:02:34.600> to<00:02:34.660> go

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
foot-pounds of torque so I'm going to go

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.620 
foot-pounds of torque so I'm going to go
with<00:02:34.989> about<00:02:35.020> 20<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:36.700> 22<00:02:37.000> foot-pounds<00:02:37.540> of

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
with about 20 to 22 foot-pounds of

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.720 
with about 20 to 22 foot-pounds of
torque<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:38.110> we'll<00:02:38.860> talk<00:02:39.040> those<00:02:39.250> bolts<00:02:39.580> down

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
torque and we'll talk those bolts down

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:52.370 
torque and we'll talk those bolts down
in<00:02:40.060> just<00:02:40.450> a<00:02:40.630> second

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.900 

so<00:02:53.380> right<00:02:53.560> now<00:02:53.760> on<00:02:54.760> my<00:02:54.970> ranch<00:02:55.240> I'm<00:02:55.750> going<00:02:56.140> to

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
so right now on my ranch I'm going to

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.500 
so right now on my ranch I'm going to
probably<00:02:57.910> can't<00:02:58.239> see<00:02:58.450> it<00:02:58.480> too<00:02:58.959> well<00:02:58.989> there

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
probably can't see it too well there

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.880 
probably can't see it too well there
yeah<00:03:01.510> so<00:03:01.989> basically<00:03:02.260> I'm<00:03:02.380> going<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.590> set<00:03:02.739> my

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
yeah so basically I'm going to set my

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:09.540 
yeah so basically I'm going to set my
wrench<00:03:03.099> to<00:03:03.810> 22<00:03:04.810> foot<00:03:05.020> pounds<00:03:08.250> lowest<00:03:09.250> setting

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
wrench to 22 foot pounds lowest setting

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.729 
wrench to 22 foot pounds lowest setting
on<00:03:09.670> my<00:03:09.850> ranch<00:03:10.090> is<00:03:10.360> 20<00:03:10.810> foot<00:03:10.959> pounds<00:03:11.380> and<00:03:11.590> then

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
on my ranch is 20 foot pounds and then

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.470 
on my ranch is 20 foot pounds and then
there's<00:03:11.920> a<00:03:11.980> dial<00:03:12.220> on<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.489> handle<00:03:12.790> to<00:03:12.880> go<00:03:13.030> up<00:03:13.209> so

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
there's a dial on the handle to go up so

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.940 
there's a dial on the handle to go up so
I'm<00:03:13.540> going<00:03:13.660> to<00:03:13.750> set<00:03:13.870> it<00:03:13.959> to<00:03:13.989> 21<00:03:14.440> foot<00:03:14.620> pounds

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
I'm going to set it to 21 foot pounds

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.940 
I'm going to set it to 21 foot pounds
just<00:03:15.670> in<00:03:15.850> case<00:03:16.030> there's<00:03:16.300> any<00:03:16.950> calibration

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
just in case there's any calibration

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:18.840 
just in case there's any calibration
issues<00:03:18.190> on<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.400> wrench<00:03:18.550> I<00:03:18.700> don't

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
issues on the wrench I don't

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.680 
issues on the wrench I don't
over-tighten<00:03:20.220> so<00:03:21.239> we're<00:03:22.239> going<00:03:22.360> to<00:03:22.420> go<00:03:22.540> in

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
over-tighten so we're going to go in

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:23.880 
over-tighten so we're going to go in
here<00:03:22.720> and<00:03:22.900> we're<00:03:23.080> going<00:03:23.200> to<00:03:23.290> try<00:03:23.470> and<00:03:23.590> get<00:03:23.709> this

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
here and we're going to try and get this

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:33.650 
here and we're going to try and get this
on<00:03:24.069> the<00:03:24.250> first<00:03:24.760> bolt

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:54.130 

tightening<00:03:34.660> that<00:03:34.780> bolt<00:03:34.840> down<00:03:37.950> and

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.720 

then<00:03:55.140> click<00:03:55.410> yet<00:03:55.650> but<00:03:55.920> seems<00:03:56.400> like<00:03:56.490> it's

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
then click yet but seems like it's

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.340 
then click yet but seems like it's
getting<00:03:56.880> a<00:03:57.210> little<00:03:57.360> tight<00:03:57.630> to<00:03:57.870> me<00:03:58.020> so<00:03:58.260> I<00:03:58.290> don't

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
getting a little tight to me so I don't

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.140 
getting a little tight to me so I don't
overtighten<00:03:58.920> and<00:03:59.190> snap<00:03:59.430> that<00:03:59.640> bulb<00:03:59.880> I'll<00:04:00.060> be

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
overtighten and snap that bulb I'll be

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:20.780 
overtighten and snap that bulb I'll be
very<00:04:00.330> unhappy

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:27.520 

hey<00:04:21.330> we're<00:04:21.480> guilty<00:04:21.710> gotta<00:04:22.710> click<00:04:22.950> on<00:04:23.100> that<00:04:23.250> one

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.160 

and<00:04:28.530> click<00:04:28.740> on<00:04:28.980> that<00:04:29.130> one

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
and click on that one

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.410 
and click on that one
so<00:04:31.170> that<00:04:31.290> was<00:04:31.470> my<00:04:31.670> 20<00:04:32.670> foot<00:04:32.820> pounds<00:04:33.120> on<00:04:33.240> there

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
so that was my 20 foot pounds on there

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:34.910 
so that was my 20 foot pounds on there
I'm<00:04:33.900> gonna<00:04:34.020> do<00:04:34.140> the<00:04:34.290> other<00:04:34.320> side<00:04:34.620> real<00:04:34.890> quick

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
I'm gonna do the other side real quick

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.950 
I'm gonna do the other side real quick
and<00:04:35.370> hopefully<00:04:36.270> you'll<00:04:36.390> be<00:04:36.480> able<00:04:36.540> to<00:04:36.660> see<00:04:36.780> some

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
and hopefully you'll be able to see some

00:04:36.960 --> 00:05:05.710 
and hopefully you'll be able to see some
of<00:04:37.050> that<00:04:40.520> see<00:04:41.520> if<00:04:41.580> we<00:04:41.670> can<00:04:41.850> do<00:04:41.970> here

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.900 

that's<00:05:06.720> 20<00:05:07.260> foot<00:05:07.770> pounds<00:05:08.070> now<00:05:08.250> and<00:05:08.460> we'll<00:05:08.790> get

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
that's 20 foot pounds now and we'll get

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.730 
that's 20 foot pounds now and we'll get
the<00:05:09.030> last<00:05:09.150> one<00:05:09.390> over<00:05:09.510> here<00:05:09.720> I<00:05:09.900> want<00:05:10.560> to<00:05:10.620> shut
