and<00:00:46.860> that's<00:00:47.399> what<00:00:47.489> we've<00:00:47.579> structured<00:00:47.850> we've

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
and that's what we've structured we've

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.330 
and that's what we've structured we've
structured<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.450> game<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.379> unlike<00:00:49.950> an<00:00:50.039> MMO

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
structured a game that is unlike an MMO

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.060 
structured a game that is unlike an MMO
which<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.640> client-server<00:00:51.480> usually<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.949> is

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
which is client-server usually this is

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.470 
which is client-server usually this is
again<00:00:53.280> that's<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.489> full<00:00:53.730> standalone<00:00:54.210> game

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
again that's a full standalone game

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.029 
again that's a full standalone game
technically<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.110> can<00:00:55.230> play<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.379> not

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
technically you can play it not

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.979 
technically you can play it not
connecting<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.520> internet<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:57.030> play<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.809> like

people<00:01:26.520> because<00:01:26.880> of<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.210> system<00:01:27.509> you're

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
people because of the system you're

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.420 
people because of the system you're
using<00:01:27.810> how<00:01:28.049> many<00:01:28.200> people<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.710> get<00:01:28.890> into<00:01:29.250> one

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
using how many people can get into one

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.460 
using how many people can get into one
encounter<00:01:29.880> at<00:01:30.150> one<00:01:30.360> time<00:01:30.540> we<00:01:31.079> have<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.439> we

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
encounter at one time we have and we

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.310 
encounter at one time we have and we
think<00:01:31.920> we<00:01:32.070> can<00:01:32.100> handle<00:01:32.540> you<00:01:33.540> know<00:01:33.630> tens<00:01:34.020> of

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
think we can handle you know tens of

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.620 
think we can handle you know tens of
people<00:01:35.100> but<00:01:35.579> we<00:01:35.700> don't<00:01:35.850> think<00:01:35.909> we<00:01:36.210> have<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.360> need

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
people but we don't think we have a need

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.539 
people but we don't think we have a need
to<00:01:36.869> handle<00:01:37.259> hundreds<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.130> we<00:01:38.430> definitely

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
to handle hundreds and we definitely

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.580 
to handle hundreds and we definitely
couldn't<00:01:38.909> handle<00:01:39.270> thousands<00:01:39.659> with<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.470> way

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
couldn't handle thousands with the way

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.140 
couldn't handle thousands with the way
we're<00:01:40.770> approaching<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.280> but<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:41.850> think<00:01:41.909> that's

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
we're approaching it but I think that's

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.340 
we're approaching it but I think that's
enough<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.600> give<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.020> richness<00:01:43.200> of

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
enough to give you the richness of

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.569 
enough to give you the richness of
encounter<00:01:43.649> that<00:01:43.890> we're<00:01:44.130> trying<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.399> do<00:01:44.460> with

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
encounter that we're trying to do with

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.850 
encounter that we're trying to do with
the<00:01:44.909> story<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:45.899> sounds<00:01:46.140> like<00:01:46.200> some<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.680> that

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
the story so it sounds like some of that

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.090 
the story so it sounds like some of that
idea<00:01:47.579> is<00:01:47.909> is<00:01:48.360> driven<00:01:48.750> by<00:01:48.899> perhaps<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.770> desire

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
idea is is driven by perhaps a desire

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.190 
idea is is driven by perhaps a desire
for<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.670> have<00:01:50.820> more<00:01:51.119> storytelling<00:01:51.659> going

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
for you to have more storytelling going

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.840 
for you to have more storytelling going
on<00:01:52.320> from<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.710> player's<00:01:52.950> perspective<00:01:53.310> like<00:01:53.820> I

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
on from the player's perspective like I

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.039 
on from the player's perspective like I
know<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.390> game's<00:01:54.540> going<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:54.780> have<00:01:54.899> its

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
know you the game's going to have its

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.590 
know you the game's going to have its
own<00:01:55.140> story<00:01:55.409> right<00:01:55.890> but<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:57.000> would<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.299> be<00:01:57.420> fair

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
own story right but it would it be fair

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.850 
own story right but it would it be fair
to<00:01:57.780> say<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.930> you're<00:01:58.140> hoping<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.619> players

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
to say that you're hoping that players

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.440 
to say that you're hoping that players
through<00:01:59.399> this<00:01:59.520> system<00:01:59.729> will<00:01:59.969> then<00:02:00.030> be<00:02:00.240> able<00:02:00.270> to

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
through this system will then be able to

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.510 
through this system will then be able to
sort<00:02:00.689> of<00:02:00.750> create<00:02:01.020> their<00:02:01.290> own<00:02:01.320> story<00:02:01.710> exactly

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
sort of create their own story exactly

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.240 
sort of create their own story exactly
so<00:02:02.729> what<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.149> think<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:03.509> system<00:02:03.950> helps<00:02:04.950> solve

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
so what I think this system helps solve

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.459 
so what I think this system helps solve
is<00:02:05.700> if<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.299> go<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.509> solo<00:02:06.719> player<00:02:06.990> game<00:02:07.229> it's

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
is if you go to a solo player game it's

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.430 
is if you go to a solo player game it's
very<00:02:07.770> easy<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.220> have<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:09.179> linear<00:02:09.420> story<00:02:09.780> told

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
very easy to have a linear story told

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.320 
very easy to have a linear story told
that<00:02:10.619> designers<00:02:11.069> if<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:11.879> go<00:02:11.970> to<00:02:12.000> an<00:02:12.120> MMO

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
that designers if you go to an MMO

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.210 
that designers if you go to an MMO
you<00:02:13.360> have<00:02:13.510> exclusively<00:02:14.320> player<00:02:14.980> built

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
you have exclusively player built

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.610 
you have exclusively player built

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
minutes through a trial version it

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.230 
minutes through a trial version it
doesn't<00:04:10.630> force<00:04:10.840> them<00:04:10.989> to<00:04:11.019> make<00:04:11.260> permanent
