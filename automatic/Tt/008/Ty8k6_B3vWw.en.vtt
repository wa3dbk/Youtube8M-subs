making it impossible to board our steel
for<00:00:32.040> yourself<00:00:32.369> or<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:33.570> can<00:00:33.780> plant<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.230> grenade

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500

for yourself or you can plant a grenade
which<00:00:34.710> also<00:00:34.920> destroys<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.520> rate<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:37.040> the<00:00:38.040> only

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
which also destroys the rate so the only

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.530 
which also destroys the rate so the only
way<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.149> can<00:00:39.329> do<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:40.460> by<00:00:41.460> killing<00:00:41.540> the

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
way you can do it is by killing the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.180 
way you can do it is by killing the
driver<00:00:42.840> that's<00:00:43.230> in<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.410> driver's<00:00:43.739> seat<00:00:43.770> I

on the roof of the mammoth oh this is
very<00:01:23.970> early<00:01:24.390> on<00:01:24.420> level<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:24.960> this<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.229> like<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
very early on level and this is like the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.499 
very early on level and this is like the
only<00:01:25.830> like<00:01:26.490> there<00:01:27.090> are<00:01:27.180> other<00:01:27.299> opportunities

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
only like there are other opportunities

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.630 
only like there are other opportunities
to<00:01:27.930> hijack<00:01:28.259> rates<00:01:28.470> but<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.070> by<00:01:29.280> far<00:01:29.579> the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
to hijack rates but this is by far the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.890 
to hijack rates but this is by far the
easiest<00:01:29.850> one<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.600> do<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.110> on<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:32.270> stun<00:01:33.270> that

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
easiest one to do it on so stun that

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.810 
easiest one to do it on so stun that
Wraith<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:35.479> then<00:01:37.369> just<00:01:38.369> shooting<00:01:38.729> that

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
Wraith and then just shooting that

Wraith<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.150> couple<00:01:42.570> times<00:01:42.780> will<00:01:43.049> destroy<00:01:43.470> it

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
Wraith a couple times will destroy it

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
don't have to worry about it driving

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.730 
don't have to worry about it driving
away<00:01:52.200> anymore<00:01:52.380> um<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.659> don't<00:01:54.659> like<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.079> use<00:01:55.290> it
