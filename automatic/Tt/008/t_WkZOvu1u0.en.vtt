this<00:00:00.989> is<00:00:02.449> ultramarine<00:00:03.449> with<00:00:03.899> water<00:00:04.230> and<00:00:04.580> the

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
this is ultramarine with water and the

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.940 
this is ultramarine with water and the
number<00:00:05.790> eight<00:00:05.910> brush<00:00:06.259> and<00:00:07.259> we<00:00:07.350> just<00:00:07.560> start<00:00:07.799> by

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
number eight brush and we just start by

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.610 
number eight brush and we just start by
applying<00:00:08.189> that<00:00:08.580> in<00:00:09.050> strokes<00:00:10.050> from<00:00:10.200> left<00:00:10.500> to

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
applying that in strokes from left to

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.829 
applying that in strokes from left to
right<00:00:13.250> now<00:00:14.250> what<00:00:14.880> I'm<00:00:15.000> trying<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.360> do<00:00:15.509> here<00:00:15.809> is

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
right now what I'm trying to do here is

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.439 
right now what I'm trying to do here is
form<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.650> bubble<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.340> water<00:00:17.670> along<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.330> leading

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
form a bubble of water along the leading

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.939 
form a bubble of water along the leading
edge<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.109> wash<00:00:19.260> you<00:00:19.439> can<00:00:19.560> see<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.800> bubbles

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
edge of the wash you can see the bubbles

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.980 
edge of the wash you can see the bubbles
starting<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.580> form<00:00:20.850> there<00:00:21.119> but<00:00:21.630> it's<00:00:21.750> very

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
starting to form there but it's very

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.470 
starting to form there but it's very
important<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.650> we<00:00:23.189> work<00:00:23.310> quickly<00:00:23.730> because

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
important that we work quickly because

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.870 
important that we work quickly because
if<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.380> leading<00:00:25.650> edge<00:00:25.769> starts<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.400> dry<00:00:26.640> we're

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
if the leading edge starts to dry we're

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.160 
if the leading edge starts to dry we're
going<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.119> have<00:00:27.240> what's<00:00:27.480> known<00:00:27.570> as<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.900> hard

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
going to have what's known as a hard

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.950 
going to have what's known as a hard
line<00:00:28.609> and<00:00:29.609> I'm<00:00:29.730> going<00:00:30.000> back<00:00:30.210> into<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.570> palette

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
line and I'm going back into the palette

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.540 
line and I'm going back into the palette
each<00:00:31.109> time<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.830> lifting<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.279> fresh

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
each time and lifting a fresh

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.930 
each time and lifting a fresh
application<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:33.770> wash<00:00:34.770> I'm<00:00:35.070> fitting<00:00:35.790> that

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
application of wash I'm fitting that

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.500 
application of wash I'm fitting that
into<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.630> leading<00:00:36.870> edge<00:00:37.079> or<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.410> bubble<00:00:41.510> like

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
into the leading edge or the bubble like

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.660 
into the leading edge or the bubble like
we<00:00:42.989> don't<00:00:43.140> fit<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.469> in<00:00:43.559> below<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.010> bubble<00:00:44.280> or

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
we don't fit it in below the bubble or

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.459 
we don't fit it in below the bubble or
above<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.090> bubble<00:00:45.360> we<00:00:45.539> feed<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.780> into<00:00:46.110> the

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
above the bubble we feed it into the

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.650 
above the bubble we feed it into the
bubble<00:00:46.739> each<00:00:46.829> time<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:48.090> means<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.450> we

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
bubble each time and that means that we

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.000 
bubble each time and that means that we
get<00:00:49.010> an<00:00:50.010> area<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.520> paper<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.559> is<00:00:52.559> going<00:00:52.920> to

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
get an area of paper that is going to

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.000 
get an area of paper that is going to
have<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.600> wash<00:00:55.010> all<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.399> same<00:00:56.610> color<00:00:57.859> now<00:00:58.859> if

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
have a wash all of the same color now if

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.430 
have a wash all of the same color now if

subsequent<00:01:11.220> wash<00:01:12.590> when<00:01:13.590> we<00:01:13.979> have<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.400> bubble

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
subsequent wash when we have the bubble

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.999 
subsequent wash when we have the bubble
completely<00:01:15.240> loaded<00:01:16.020> with<00:01:16.290> water<00:01:16.500> or<00:01:16.740> this

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
completely loaded with water or this

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.340 
completely loaded with water or this
whale<00:01:17.939> at<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.390> prom<00:01:18.659> at<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.840> leading<00:01:19.020> edge<00:01:19.170> of

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
whale at the prom at the leading edge of

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.200 
whale at the prom at the leading edge of
the<00:01:19.470> wash<00:01:19.650> then<00:01:20.310> we<00:01:20.460> can<00:01:20.580> do<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> few<00:01:20.909> strokes

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
the wash then we can do a few strokes

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.630 
the wash then we can do a few strokes
just<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.689> get<00:01:22.590> rid<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.770> some<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.310> excess

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
just to get rid of some of that excess

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.140 
just to get rid of some of that excess
water<00:01:24.110> because<00:01:25.110> if<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.320> gets<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.799> fill<00:01:26.150> the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
water because if that gets to fill the

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.999 
water because if that gets to fill the
chances<00:01:27.600> are<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.170> water<00:01:28.350> will<00:01:28.470> run<00:01:28.740> down

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
chances are that the water will run down

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.569 
chances are that the water will run down
the<00:01:29.130> paper<00:01:30.829> and<00:01:31.829> that's<00:01:32.009> something<00:01:32.189> we<00:01:32.430> don't

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
the paper and that's something we don't

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.850 
the paper and that's something we don't
want

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.640 

might<00:01:38.490> finish<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.970> off<00:01:40.700> just<00:01:42.380> drag<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.410> out

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
might finish that off just drag it out

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.730 
might finish that off just drag it out
until<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.490> water<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.790> almost<00:01:45.150> gone<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.840> then

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
until the water is almost gone and then

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.410 
until the water is almost gone and then
by<00:01:46.890> squeezing<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.430> brush<00:01:47.970> between<00:01:48.180> your

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
by squeezing the brush between your

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.780 
by squeezing the brush between your
finger<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.810> them<00:01:49.050> and<00:01:49.920> taking<00:01:50.130> out<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.460> excess

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
finger of them and taking out the excess

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.469 
finger of them and taking out the excess
wash<00:01:51.330> and<00:01:51.800> we<00:01:52.800> can<00:01:52.920> use<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.280> dry<00:01:53.490> brush<00:01:56.479> to

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
wash and we can use the dry brush to

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.970 
wash and we can use the dry brush to
Hoover<00:01:58.290> up<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:59.490> excess<00:01:59.850> water
