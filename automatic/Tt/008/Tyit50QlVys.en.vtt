00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
needs to be newer so once you get those

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.550 
is still the same and that's pretty much
it<00:03:53.910> or<00:03:54.060> these<00:03:54.209> two<00:03:54.540> are<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:54.870> hazard<00:03:55.380> in<00:03:55.500> the

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
it or these two are the hazard in the

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.680 
it or these two are the hazard in the
parking<00:03:55.950> lights<00:03:56.160> and<00:03:56.459> that's<00:03:57.330> pretty<00:03:57.480> much

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
parking lights and that's pretty much

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.590 
parking lights and that's pretty much
the<00:03:57.840> only<00:03:57.870> thing<00:03:58.519> different

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.690 

and<00:04:02.600> then<00:04:03.320> yeah<00:04:03.620> so<00:04:03.860> let's<00:04:04.250> go<00:04:04.400> ahead<00:04:04.550> and<00:04:04.670> open

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
and then yeah so let's go ahead and open

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.830 
and then yeah so let's go ahead and open
this<00:04:04.910> up<00:04:05.060> real<00:04:05.240> quick<00:04:05.270> and<00:04:05.540> we'll<00:04:05.660> show<00:04:05.810> you

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
this up real quick and we'll show you

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.210 
this up real quick and we'll show you
one<00:04:06.050> more<00:04:06.080> thing<00:04:06.410> you<00:04:06.440> might<00:04:06.680> want<00:04:06.890> to<00:04:06.920> install

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220 
one more thing you might want to install

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:12.820 
one more thing you might want to install
which<00:04:08.000> will<00:04:08.240> probably<00:04:08.510> be<00:04:11.260> let's<00:04:12.260> see<00:04:12.560> where's

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
which will probably be let's see where's

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.000 
which will probably be let's see where's
that<00:04:13.190> go<00:04:13.490> on<00:04:13.640> into<00:04:13.970> it<00:04:14.590> you're<00:04:15.590> probably<00:04:15.740> going

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
that go on into it you're probably going

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.110 
that go on into it you're probably going

whatever file in here will not work it

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.110

will<00:05:15.320> just<00:05:15.440> crash<00:05:15.710> maybe<00:05:16.340> in<00:05:16.550> my<00:05:16.670> crash<00:05:16.910> I'm

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
will just crash maybe in my crash I'm

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.820 
will just crash maybe in my crash I'm
not<00:05:17.270> sure<00:05:17.420> I<00:05:17.450> know<00:05:17.660> it<00:05:17.900> won't<00:05:18.230> work<00:05:18.350> though<00:05:18.650> and

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
not sure I know it won't work though and

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.800 
not sure I know it won't work though and
that's<00:05:19.550> pretty<00:05:19.730> much<00:05:19.880> it<00:05:20.090> for<00:05:20.120> your<00:05:20.480> pattern

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
that's pretty much it for your pattern

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.080 
that's pretty much it for your pattern
so<00:05:21.020> if<00:05:21.110> you're<00:05:21.230> really<00:05:21.530> what<00:05:21.710> you<00:05:22.040> know<00:05:22.160> really

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
so if you're really what you know really

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:24.790 
so if you're really what you know really
strict<00:05:23.420> about<00:05:23.480> your<00:05:23.750> patterns<00:05:24.140> that's<00:05:24.590> pretty

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
strict about your patterns that's pretty

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.980 
strict about your patterns that's pretty
much<00:05:24.890> the<00:05:25.070> only<00:05:25.160> thing<00:05:25.280> I<00:05:25.430> would<00:05:25.490> recommend

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
much the only thing I would recommend

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.270 
much the only thing I would recommend
fixing<00:05:26.990> it<00:05:27.080> other<00:05:27.230> than<00:05:27.380> that<00:05:27.590> make<00:05:28.040> sure<00:05:28.100> get

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:28.280 
fixing it other than that make sure get

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.080 
fixing it other than that make sure get
