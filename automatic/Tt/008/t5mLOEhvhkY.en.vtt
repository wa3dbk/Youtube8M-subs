bottle<00:02:05.250> is<00:02:05.369> thirty-seven<00:02:05.909> dollars<00:02:06.030> which<00:02:06.719> I

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
bottle is thirty-seven dollars which I

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.809 
bottle is thirty-seven dollars which I
actually<00:02:07.590> think<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:08.039> sort<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.429> bit<00:02:08.610> much<00:02:08.789> for

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
actually think is sort of a bit much for

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.910 
actually think is sort of a bit much for
an<00:02:09.300> exfoliator<00:02:09.929> it's<00:02:10.289> not<00:02:10.500> something<00:02:10.890> that

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
an exfoliator it's not something that

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.979 
an exfoliator it's not something that
you<00:02:11.129> might<00:02:11.400> be<00:02:11.580> using<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:12.030> like<00:02:12.150> it's

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
you might be using it like it's

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.610 
you might be using it like it's
something

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
something

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.470 
something
you<00:02:13.739> will<00:02:13.890> use<00:02:14.099> every<00:02:14.310> day<00:02:14.519> which<00:02:14.970> so<00:02:15.269> it's

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
you will use every day which so it's

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.330 
you will use every day which so it's
going<00:02:15.569> to<00:02:15.629> go<00:02:16.080> down<00:02:16.110> fast<00:02:16.560> like<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.010> purity

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
going to go down fast like the purity

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.680 
going to go down fast like the purity
cleanser<00:02:17.610> is<00:02:17.670> only<00:02:17.790> twenty<00:02:18.120> dollars<00:02:18.390> which<00:02:18.569> i

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
cleanser is only twenty dollars which i

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.649

think<00:02:18.750> is<00:02:18.959> a<00:02:19.019> great<00:02:19.260> better<00:02:19.590> deal<00:02:19.799> than<00:02:19.950> this

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:20.659 
think is a great better deal than this

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.930 
think is a great better deal than this
so<00:02:21.659> i<00:02:21.690> give<00:02:21.900> this<00:02:21.989> a<00:02:22.140> 4<00:02:22.409> out<00:02:22.530> of<00:02:22.560> 5<00:02:22.860> but<00:02:23.580> if<00:02:23.790> you

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
so next is the micro delivery peel and

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.490 
so next is the micro delivery peel and
that's<00:02:31.829> kind<00:02:32.129> of<00:02:32.190> that's<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.519> two-step<00:02:33.060> system

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
that's kind of that's a two-step system

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.979 
that's kind of that's a two-step system
here's<00:02:34.500> um<00:02:34.950> these<00:02:35.519> little<00:02:35.700> bottle<00:02:36.209> this<00:02:36.810> is<00:02:36.959> a

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
here's um these little bottle this is a

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.559 
here's um these little bottle this is a
little<00:02:37.260> jar<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:38.430> for<00:02:38.640> this<00:02:38.730> is<00:02:38.879> the<00:02:39.000> step<00:02:39.209> one

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
little jar the for this is the step one

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.860 
little jar the for this is the step one
and<00:02:40.129> this<00:02:41.129> is<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.549> vitamin<00:02:42.090> C<00:02:42.299> peptide

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
and this is the vitamin C peptide

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.350 
and this is the vitamin C peptide
crystals<00:02:43.409> so<00:02:43.709> I<00:02:43.980> think<00:02:44.519> appeal<00:02:45.030> kind<00:02:45.269> of

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
crystals so I think appeal kind of

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.880 
crystals so I think appeal kind of
sounds<00:02:45.569> intimidating<00:02:45.780> like<00:02:46.319> and<00:02:46.620> these

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
sounds intimidating like and these

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.190 
sounds intimidating like and these
multiple<00:02:47.459> steps<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.239> don't<00:02:48.480> know<00:02:48.569> before<00:02:49.140> I

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200

a<00:03:23.400> little<00:03:23.669> bit<00:03:23.819> in<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:24.000> certain<00:03:24.269> areas<00:03:24.540> it

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
a little bit in the certain areas it

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.449 
a little bit in the certain areas it
really<00:03:24.959> what<00:03:25.079> I<00:03:25.109> pulley<00:03:25.440> but<00:03:25.799> you<00:03:26.190> don't<00:03:26.370> have

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
really what I pulley but you don't have

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.640 
really what I pulley but you don't have
to<00:03:26.549> do<00:03:26.700> it<00:03:26.819> for<00:03:26.940> as<00:03:27.030> long<00:03:27.150> as<00:03:27.209> 60<00:03:27.540> seconds<00:03:28.019> I'm

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
to do it for as long as 60 seconds I'm

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.409 
to do it for as long as 60 seconds I'm
really<00:03:28.919> into<00:03:29.190> exfoliating<00:03:29.819> and<00:03:29.879> my<00:03:30.030> skin<00:03:30.269> can

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
really into exfoliating and my skin can

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.330 
really into exfoliating and my skin can
pretty<00:03:30.660> much<00:03:30.930> take<00:03:31.410> it<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:31.769> I<00:03:31.859> really<00:03:32.129> like<00:03:32.250> to

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
pretty much take it and I really like to

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.159 
pretty much take it and I really like to
get<00:03:32.430> around<00:03:32.549> my<00:03:32.760> nose<00:03:32.819> and<00:03:33.239> that<00:03:33.419> area<00:03:33.629> is<00:03:33.750> oily

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:34.169 
get around my nose and that area is oily

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:36.680 
get around my nose and that area is oily
anyway<00:03:34.530> so<00:03:35.099> it<00:03:35.340> always<00:03:35.489> holds<00:03:36.120> up<00:03:36.389> pretty<00:03:36.419> well

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
anyway so it always holds up pretty well

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.059 
anyway so it always holds up pretty well
to<00:03:37.019> exfoliating<00:03:39.019> so<00:03:40.019> after<00:03:40.530> you<00:03:40.650> do<00:03:40.799> this<00:03:40.859> you

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
to exfoliating so after you do this you

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.030 
to exfoliating so after you do this you
keep<00:03:41.280> this<00:03:41.489> on<00:03:41.730> and<00:03:42.090> then<00:03:42.870> you<00:03:43.019> add<00:03:43.199> this<00:03:43.709> stuff

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
keep this on and then you add this stuff

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.759 
keep this on and then you add this stuff
which<00:03:44.310> is<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.639> lactic<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.329> salicylic<00:03:46.169> acid

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
which is the lactic and salicylic acid

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.770 
which is the lactic and salicylic acid
activating<00:03:47.489> gel<00:03:47.639> I<00:03:47.790> don't<00:03:48.209> think<00:03:48.389> I<00:03:48.419> said<00:03:48.629> that

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
activating gel I don't think I said that

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.909 
activating gel I don't think I said that
right<00:03:48.900> but<00:03:50.449> this<00:03:51.449> you<00:03:51.870> put<00:03:52.079> on<00:03:52.230> top<00:03:52.470> and<00:03:52.739> when

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
right but this you put on top and when

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:54.439 
right but this you put on top and when
you<00:03:53.040> do<00:03:53.190> this<00:03:53.370> you<00:03:53.430> get<00:03:53.790> like<00:03:53.970> a<00:03:54.000> heated

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:54.449 
you do this you get like a heated

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:56.619 
you do this you get like a heated
sensation<00:03:55.139> which<00:03:55.620> is<00:03:55.739> actually<00:03:55.949> kind<00:03:56.250> of<00:03:56.310> cool

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
sensation which is actually kind of cool

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.520 
sensation which is actually kind of cool
it's<00:03:57.629> a<00:03:57.690> little<00:03:57.810> weird<00:03:58.079> if<00:03:58.319> you're<00:03:58.440> not

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
it's a little weird if you're not

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.189 
it's a little weird if you're not
expecting<00:03:59.069> it<00:03:59.160> but<00:03:59.220> if<00:03:59.669> you<00:03:59.699> read<00:03:59.970> on<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:00.959> back

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:01.199 
expecting it but if you read on the back

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:02.900 
expecting it but if you read on the back
of<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.410> bottle<00:04:01.709> it'll<00:04:01.980> tell<00:04:02.519> you<00:04:02.669> about<00:04:02.849> that

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
of the bottle it'll tell you about that

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.909 
of the bottle it'll tell you about that
you<00:04:03.569> just<00:04:03.750> kind<00:04:03.900> of<00:04:03.959> massage<00:04:04.290> it<00:04:04.470> on<00:04:04.560> top<00:04:04.769> of

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
you just kind of massage it on top of

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:06.229 
you just kind of massage it on top of
the<00:04:05.010> crystals<00:04:05.459> and<00:04:05.669> there'll<00:04:05.879> be<00:04:05.910> a<00:04:06.030> little

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
the crystals and there'll be a little

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.240 
the crystals and there'll be a little
bit<00:04:06.389> of<00:04:06.480> a<00:04:06.569> foaming<00:04:06.989> I<00:04:07.079> it<00:04:07.500> says<00:04:07.889> Attila

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
bit of a foaming I it says Attila

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.129 
bit of a foaming I it says Attila
foaming<00:04:08.730> but<00:04:09.000> I<00:04:09.150> didn't<00:04:09.510> get<00:04:09.629> that<00:04:09.690> much<00:04:09.900> phone

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:10.139 
foaming but I didn't get that much phone

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:14.059 
foaming but I didn't get that much phone
but<00:04:10.669> um<00:04:11.669> and<00:04:11.910> then<00:04:12.359> you<00:04:12.480> leave<00:04:12.780> this<00:04:13.319> on<00:04:13.590> top<00:04:13.859> of

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
but um and then you leave this on top of

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.289 
but um and then you leave this on top of
these<00:04:14.160> crystals<00:04:14.609> for<00:04:14.819> like<00:04:14.970> two<00:04:15.120> or<00:04:15.150> three

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
these crystals for like two or three

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.360 
these crystals for like two or three
minutes<00:04:15.540> you<00:04:16.380> just<00:04:16.560> can<00:04:16.829> do<00:04:16.949> something<00:04:17.220> else

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
minutes you just can do something else

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.589 
minutes you just can do something else
because<00:04:17.489> it's<00:04:17.729> not<00:04:17.880> like<00:04:18.090> dripping<00:04:18.449> off<00:04:18.570> of

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
because it's not like dripping off of

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:19.939 
because it's not like dripping off of
your<00:04:18.840> skin<00:04:19.109> it's<00:04:19.320> sort<00:04:19.440> of<00:04:19.530> like<00:04:19.590> a<00:04:19.709> mask

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:19.949 
your skin it's sort of like a mask

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:23.690 
your skin it's sort of like a mask
almost<00:04:20.489> and<00:04:20.789> then<00:04:21.570> you<00:04:21.750> just<00:04:22.159> rinse<00:04:23.159> it<00:04:23.250> off<00:04:23.400> if

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
almost and then you just rinse it off if

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.080 
almost and then you just rinse it off if
you<00:04:23.760> have<00:04:24.120> sensitive<00:04:24.360> skin

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
you have sensitive skin

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.150 
you have sensitive skin
would<00:04:25.210> let<00:04:25.389> it<00:04:25.419> sit<00:04:25.780> but<00:04:26.410> if<00:04:26.530> you<00:04:26.650> really<00:04:26.980> want

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
would let it sit but if you really want

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.670 
would let it sit but if you really want
to<00:04:27.220> get<00:04:27.310> exfoliating<00:04:27.970> you<00:04:28.090> can<00:04:28.270> um<00:04:28.630> you<00:04:29.500> can

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.120 
to get exfoliating you can um you can
massage<00:04:29.949> it<00:04:30.190> some<00:04:30.370> more<00:04:31.080> and<00:04:32.080> then<00:04:32.290> you<00:04:32.740> it

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
massage it some more and then you it

says you wash cloth I just splash water
in<00:04:35.350> my<00:04:35.440> face<00:04:35.470> it<00:04:35.800> takes<00:04:35.979> a<00:04:36.070> little<00:04:36.220> bit<00:04:36.430> it

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
in my face it takes a little bit it

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.890 
in my face it takes a little bit it
takes<00:04:36.790> longer<00:04:37.090> than<00:04:37.120> just<00:04:37.419> rinsing<00:04:37.720> off<00:04:37.870> a

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
takes longer than just rinsing off a

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.360 
takes longer than just rinsing off a
cleanser<00:04:38.380> but<00:04:39.540> um<00:04:40.540> it<00:04:41.320> I<00:04:41.650> don't<00:04:42.010> know<00:04:42.070> it<00:04:42.190> works

cleanser but um it I don't know it works

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.219 
cleanser but um it I don't know it works
so<00:04:42.580> it<00:04:43.210> worked<00:04:43.389> out<00:04:43.540> pretty<00:04:43.690> well<00:04:43.840> for<00:04:44.020> me

soft<00:05:02.050> and<00:05:02.169> smooth<00:05:02.440> but<00:05:02.830> it<00:05:03.520> also<00:05:03.700> left<00:05:04.030> my<00:05:04.120> skin

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
soft and smooth but it also left my skin

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:05.730 
soft and smooth but it also left my skin
kind<00:05:04.630> of<00:05:04.750> dry<00:05:04.930> and<00:05:05.110> tight<00:05:05.260> because<00:05:05.470> it<00:05:05.620> is<00:05:05.710> a

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
kind of dry and tight because it is a

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.129 
kind of dry and tight because it is a
harsh<00:05:06.100> thing<00:05:06.460> so<00:05:07.150> I<00:05:07.180> would<00:05:07.630> definitely<00:05:07.660> have

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
harsh thing so I would definitely have

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:10.140 
harsh thing so I would definitely have

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.650 
really like that i like the whole
philosophy<00:05:13.690> system<00:05:14.380> so<00:05:15.160> i<00:05:15.639> wouldn't<00:05:16.210> it's<00:05:16.419> i

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
philosophy system so i wouldn't it's i

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.150 
philosophy system so i wouldn't it's i
would<00:05:16.990> definitely<00:05:17.289> not<00:05:17.530> use<00:05:17.740> this<00:05:17.889> more<00:05:18.130> than

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
would definitely not use this more than

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.070 
would definitely not use this more than
once<00:05:18.310> a<00:05:18.520> week<00:05:18.550> because<00:05:19.000> it<00:05:19.450> is<00:05:19.600> kind<00:05:19.810> of<00:05:19.870> harsh

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
once a week because it is kind of harsh

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.440 
once a week because it is kind of harsh
on<00:05:20.229> your<00:05:20.350> skin<00:05:20.410> and<00:05:20.770> too<00:05:21.430> much<00:05:21.550> exfoliating<00:05:22.330> is

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
on your skin and too much exfoliating is

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.450 
on your skin and too much exfoliating is
never<00:05:22.690> good<00:05:22.960> so<00:05:23.470> I<00:05:23.500> mean<00:05:23.889> you<00:05:24.039> could<00:05:24.220> use<00:05:24.430> you

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
could definitely use the daily

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.409 
could definitely use the daily
exfoliating<00:05:27.010> wash<00:05:27.130> every<00:05:27.430> day<00:05:27.580> and<00:05:27.850> be

exfoliating wash every day and be
totally<00:05:28.600> fine<00:05:28.960> and<00:05:29.350> then<00:05:29.500> use<00:05:30.370> the<00:05:30.610> system

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:30.850
