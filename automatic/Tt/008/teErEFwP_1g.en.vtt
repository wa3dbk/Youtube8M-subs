00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.350
 about you nice to see you again 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:10.389
 Why do you ask me for a review 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.790
 I'm outside today and I like it 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:16.330
 otherwise I have an action cam for you 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.009
 in the offer and that the sony hdr es 15 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.410
 and what is more appropriate than 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.250
 an action cam under real conditions 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:23.200
 to test 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.840
 I'm curious what comes out at the end 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.270
 and you can win that part as well 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.869
 and from july live I could do that too 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.869
 to use again 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.750
 the action cam comes solo or with 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.210
 different accessories therefore under 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.190
 also in accessory packages and me 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.070
 have for the today's review once the 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.160
 getipaket and once the snow and surf 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.420
 package in luggage and what is in there 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.730
 let's have a look 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.100
 well then in bike package there is the 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.320
 Camera with underwater case adhesive pad 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.699
 and adapters headband with brackets 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.219
 for the housing and one 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.719
 Bike mount in the new surf package 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:03.850
 Of course there is also the camera 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:05.560
 Underwater case and adhesive patch too 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.140
 the headband one in the tilt 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.600
 adjustable helmet mount and one 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.159
 anti fog foil the shape of the 60 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.020
 gram action cam reminds one 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.880
 classic camcorder without being in short supply 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.220
 display really cute act 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.810
 a bit fragile in front then the optics 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.869
 including two microphones for 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.490
 stereo recordings above nothing and below one 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:28.299
 fold the additional connections 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:30.490
 harbors like micro hdmi micro usb and 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.799
 a classic phone entry for 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.570
 an external microphone left side the 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.700
 display to menu navigation and 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.070
 remaining recording time served with only 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.930
 two buttons on the right side nothing and the 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.640
 back throws us a big one 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.140
 thick red button opposite 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.049
 logical to start and stop 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.270
 recordings including bringing over all 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:52.030
 Disable buttons and above that 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.310
 small status led behind the subject for 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.259
 the battery and the micro sd memory cards 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.090
 Overall, all buttons have a good one 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.920
 palpable 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.509
 pressure point not too firm but not too 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.880
 too spongy the supplied accessories 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.259
 looks and feels good 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.299
 although unfortunately everything is out of here 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.530
 plastic is only for one circuit 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.670
 underwater housing makes me feel 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.769
 bit worried 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.510
 he should protect up to 60 meters of water depth 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:15.209
 offer but works for me personally 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.519
 not completely trustworthy but has 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.799
 so far with all actions without problems 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.810
 held as well as the adhesive pads the things 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.730
 sticking so hard around a helmet 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.069
 To be afraid had to be just as positive 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.629
 It should be noted that from home 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.790
 screw thread in the underwater housing 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:32.090
 that's what saves you time 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.079
 extra time and opens up some 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.299
 mounting options because next to the 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:38.579
 underwater case or adhesive patch there 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:41.220
 it still has surfboard bracket and straps 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.540
 or even frame with preview display the 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.610
 the action cam then like a little one 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.959
 let camcorder look like you can 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.060
 thus capture the images with 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.190
 classic d slrs or camcorders or 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.829
 smartphones will not be implemented 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.349
 I mean right on the ground at the car in 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:58.590
 small corners or where it's really wet 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:00.650
 and dirty is yes at first 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.970
 Looked at, the operation seems completely 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.380
 uncomplicated three buttons to one 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.069
 small display what can one already there 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.769
 do wrong 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.720
 I would say it is clear 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.579
 Press the thick red button and go 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.530
 the recording works fine so far 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.599
 even if the camera is turned off so 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.950
 is in the standby and the few keys 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.579
 basically allow fast 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.530
 navigate 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.540
 but that's quite right from the start 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.730
 thinned menu is in my opinion 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.099
 still by unfortunate abbreviations 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.090
 advised something pummelig and then stuck 

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.010
 the action cam still in the 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.230
 underwater housing can then only per 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.250
 wifi or constantly getting out 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.630
 Camera at the settings 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.120
 be tinkered with 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:39.299
 a bit awkward or just with 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.190
 the app for ios and android play 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.260
 memories means this compatible too 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.000
 all wlan capable camcorders from sony 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.069
 By the way, it works so far 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.660
 copy without hesitation is the fix 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.340
 live broadcast has about a second 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.169
 Delay but ensures the battery 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.590
 within three quarters of an hour 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:53.940
 empty 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.980
 Otherwise , the akkupack holds 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.870
 continuous recording really good three 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.639
 hours by with classical use 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.640
 Survived battery even a complete 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.960
 Day 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.540
 but fortunately the battery is 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.490
 interchangeable after centuries 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.440
 code for the wifi connection for the app 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.300
 by the way is somewhere in the manual 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.010
 the action cam is with a 16 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.970
 megapixel exmor rc mos sensor 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.850
 fitted 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.070
 behind a carl zeiss optik at 15 3 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.130
 mm focal length converted to small picture 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.169
 and a viewing angle of 170 degrees 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.360
 the optics is supported by a 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.910
 bildstabilisator but just more 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.290
 videos land in full-hd times thirty 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.050
 or even sixty frames per second 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.460
 or small hd at 30 or 60 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.180
 full pictures per second on the 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.280
 memory card 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.260
 who still needs it for that 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.790
 also a vga resolution ready 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.250
 on top of that there are the others 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.380
 possibility with proud 120 images per 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.300
 take a second that 's fun 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.010
 to watch his action in slow motion 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.710
 but unfortunately not in many 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.360
 small hd and reduced entered the 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.830
 joke is there but you can tell that 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.990
 actually not much reduction 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.700
 only if you are still in color or color 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.820
 correcting exposure then means 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.230
 It's keyword branding &amp; co photos 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.270
 or interval recordings 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.979
 shoots the camera with about 2 megapixels 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.840
 so typical for bad ones 

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:09.520
 North German lighting conditions 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.680
 the s15 looks solid 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.330
 the exmor r sensor also manages 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.470
 dull light still the most important 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.210
 capture details 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.340
 also extreme contrast resp 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.290
 lighting conditions are balanced 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.390
 the memory card spellbound with her 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.800
 has about one and a half inch big chip 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.229
 the action cam is still over 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.410
 generous dynamic range thick thumb 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:30.400
 upwards receives from me del 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.740
 bildstabilisator because at 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.600
 Shooting on the hand can be the typical 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.270
 tremors tremendously 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.190
 but no trace of it but also 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.320
 car or bike shots benefit 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.570
 of it are thus much softer and softer 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.180
 This saves a lot of time and energy 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.190
 effort in post-processing and what 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.340
 means that he summarized 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.050
 So in the end the s15 offers 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.020
 her really rich offer 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.550
 Accessories through their endurance mobility 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.650
 and in the end by their 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.470
 reliability against the many 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.700
 another action cam manufacturer at the 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.680
 image quality would be a bit more 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.790
 but you can prevent them from screwing 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.680
 because of it really good 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:11.710
 functioning image stabilizer not 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.450
 At the next bmx or ski slopes 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.430
 tour with really good pictures 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.690
 to be able to catch and so we too 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.460
 already at the topic because you can namely 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:21.160
 win one of these two packages 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.290
 either the beipaket or the snow and 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.060
 surf package comes to me is completely 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.040
 Just write here under the video in 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.380
 the comments which package you probably 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.040
 like to have and what they do with it 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.450
 would want 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.700
 because not even for me 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:35.410
 Well and then in the interesting 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.270
 The next two weeks will be the whole 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.490
 triggered and the one or the other 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.720
 then with a new action cam with 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.190
 to appeal 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.560
 I'm curious press your thumb 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:47.470
 and I do a bit of action now 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:51.120
 cam unfamiliar view explore yes 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.120
 that's my mission does come 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.810
 just doing the action core to the 

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:56.009
 to grab the raffle 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.539
 I wanted to go enjoy it 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:06:59.849
 leave each accessory part individually 

00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:01.770
 lick for you and my question 

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:04.440
 Finally, you can find such 

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:06.270
 play as a stall for products 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.030
 reviews over the previous ones 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:11.160
 classic with table and the red 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.569
 ceiling underneath and the camera above 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:14.759
 we would write an interest 

00:07:12.569 --> 00:07:16.470
