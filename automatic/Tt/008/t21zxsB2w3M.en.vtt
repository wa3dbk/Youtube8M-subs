00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.790
 we are in the grandchildren district 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.029
 the province of san miguel 'del 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:12.170
 Department of Cajamarca 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:14.900
 we are looking for groundwater we 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:18.169
 We meet with Mr. Oscar Riojas 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.140
 Chapoñán who is a specialist in 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:23.960
 underground water search for who we 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.559
 can explain the work that is coming 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.559
 doing 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.330
 and the truth that 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.239
 encounter in this area of ​​the city of 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.370
 grandchildren looking for currents 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:40.090
 underground 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.309
 since due to my work many years 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.980
 I've been doing this job and thanks 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.650
 to god that until now everything is going 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.560
 coming out well 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.829
 with this the wood that I get it 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.920
 underground streams 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.589
 for and we also have a scope that 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.629
 gives us an average in depth 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:02.359
 I'm hitting several wells in question 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.839
 deep but in currents is at 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.839
 White 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.510
 according to this way that the 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.920
 wild 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:17.340
 we catch those currents 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.050
 let's go to detect at this time 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.770
 a post we are going to 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.340
 in this current 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.340
 in this well 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.940
 first I do the tour of the 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.030
 underground river stream the 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.320
 dimension that has in this case has 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.060
 a dimension of 8 meters 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.800
 4 both sides but the well that is going 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.410
 be located in the center because in the 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.390
 center the center we had everything 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.750
 current when detected in the center 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.360
 we have an option to achieve it more more 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.090
 over because it is the force of gravity 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.280
 of the currents that bounce towards the 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.130
 land in this case we are deriving it 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.730
 in the center and we have the strength the 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.319
 same energy 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.500
 staff down to earth and what 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:32.270
 we're 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.270
 receiving that day the center 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.590
 it is a current that is average 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.709
 with a depth of approximately 16 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.709
 meters 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:54.209
 once the work is done 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:57.690
 an application is for farmers 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.069
 person of grandchildren is a zone height 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.290
 refrigerators 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:07.540
 we have currents to be able to 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.389
 facilitate agriculture by helping us 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.610
 these groundwater for the 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:16.410
 crops 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:18.030
 and grazing area to request their 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.470
 services could you give us a number of 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:27.170
 mobile 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:27.170
 the cell phone number is 94 on 79 10 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:38.930
 563 I repeat the burgos is the 94 number 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:41.329
 cellular is 94 79 10 563 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.129
 well I have to say that I 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:45.709
 I find very grateful and here in this 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:49.370
 new area we have found in two 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:53.349
 good places of water currents and very 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.349
 grateful for your service Mr. Oscar 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.920
 thank you very much to each one of us
