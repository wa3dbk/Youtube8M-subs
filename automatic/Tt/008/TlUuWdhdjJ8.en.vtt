gap

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.010 
gap
if<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.670> run<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:08.910> good<00:02:09.179> enough<00:02:09.420> line<00:02:09.720> at<00:02:09.989> his

the<00:02:16.960> outside<00:02:17.260> shoulder<00:02:17.530> you're<00:02:18.040> unlikely<00:02:18.550> to

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
the outside shoulder you're unlikely to

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.130 
the outside shoulder you're unlikely to
get<00:02:18.940> through<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.300> you<00:02:19.330> might<00:02:19.630> just<00:02:19.660> block

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
get through and you might just block

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
who've played in the midfield have been

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.260 
who've played in the midfield have been
running<00:03:09.010> across<00:03:09.250> taking<00:03:09.760> a<00:03:09.850> loop<00:03:10.030> really

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
running across taking a loop really

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.390 
running across taking a loop really
quickly<00:03:10.810> and<00:03:11.290> find<00:03:11.530> their<00:03:11.770> body<00:03:11.980> go<00:03:12.250> in

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
quickly and find their body go in

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.130 
quickly and find their body go in
sideways<00:03:12.670> across<00:03:13.270> the<00:03:13.420> pitch<00:03:13.600> but<00:03:13.780> really

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
sideways across the pitch but really

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.960 
sideways across the pitch but really
struggle<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.890> job<00:03:15.070> at<00:03:15.190> mindset<00:03:15.730> will<00:03:15.880> you

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
struggle the job at mindset will you

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.670 
struggle the job at mindset will you
take<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.270> ball<00:03:16.420> back<00:03:16.660> do<00:03:17.050> you<00:03:17.110> turn<00:03:17.290> your<00:03:17.470> hips

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
take the ball back do you turn your hips

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.350 
take the ball back do you turn your hips
before<00:03:17.950> you<00:03:18.250> turn<00:03:18.430> your<00:03:18.580> body<00:03:18.700> how'd<00:03:19.090> you<00:03:19.239> do

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
before you turn your body how'd you do

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.880 
before you turn your body how'd you do
it<00:03:19.739> dancing

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
it dancing

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.830 
it dancing
yeah<00:03:21.160> but<00:03:21.310> hopefully<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:21.880> center<00:03:22.270> he's<00:03:22.510> he's

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
yeah but hopefully the center he's he's

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.750 
yeah but hopefully the center he's he's
gone<00:03:23.050> in<00:03:23.170> front<00:03:23.350> of<00:03:23.470> you<00:03:23.560> so<00:03:23.770> you<00:03:24.040> know<00:03:24.520> he's

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
gone in front of you so you know he's

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.580 
gone in front of you so you know he's
looking<00:03:25.450> to<00:03:25.540> carry<00:03:25.780> and<00:03:26.050> then<00:03:26.140> last<00:03:26.410> minute

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
looking to carry and then last minute

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.960 
looking to carry and then last minute
then<00:03:26.860> he's<00:03:27.010> hopefully<00:03:27.489> just<00:03:27.610> going<00:03:27.730> to<00:03:27.790> flick

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
then he's hopefully just going to flick

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.120 
then he's hopefully just going to flick
it<00:03:28.000> back<00:03:28.209> to<00:03:28.360> you<00:03:28.450> so<00:03:29.140> he's<00:03:29.500> essentially<00:03:30.010> I

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
it back to you so he's essentially I

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.860 
it back to you so he's essentially I
opened<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.700> hole<00:03:30.880> for<00:03:31.150> you<00:03:31.239> by<00:03:31.420> really

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
opened the hole for you by really

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.320 
opened the hole for you by really
running<00:03:32.080> Heretic<00:03:32.709> that's<00:03:32.920> not<00:03:33.040> right<00:03:33.190> so<00:03:33.880> if<00:03:34.150> I

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
running Heretic that's not right so if I

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.170 
running Heretic that's not right so if I
take<00:03:34.540> it<00:03:34.720> you<00:03:35.410> know<00:03:35.670> lackadaisically<00:03:36.700> going

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
take it you know lackadaisically going

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.790 
take it you know lackadaisically going
slowly<00:03:37.480> it's<00:03:37.870> harder<00:03:38.170> for<00:03:38.200> him<00:03:38.410> to<00:03:38.560> get<00:03:38.650> into

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
slowly it's harder for him to get into

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.920 
slowly it's harder for him to get into
that<00:03:38.980> space<00:03:39.160> whereas<00:03:39.910> if<00:03:40.030> I<00:03:40.120> really<00:03:40.510> go<00:03:40.660> hard

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
that space whereas if I really go hard

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.900 
that space whereas if I really go hard
of<00:03:41.050> that<00:03:41.170> inside<00:03:41.500> shoulder<00:03:41.770> but<00:03:42.430> we've<00:03:42.700> can

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
of that inside shoulder but we've can

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.180 
of that inside shoulder but we've can
with<00:03:43.390> it<00:03:43.540> with<00:03:43.690> them<00:03:43.959> the<00:03:44.470> tour<00:03:44.680> process<00:03:45.070> of

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
with it with them the tour process of

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.890 
with it with them the tour process of
going<00:03:45.370> through<00:03:45.489> that<00:03:46.060> opens<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:46.510> hole<00:03:46.660> for

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
going through that opens the hole for

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.080 
going through that opens the hole for
him
