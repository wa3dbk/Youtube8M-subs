00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.670 
raccoon suit instead of into newquay
suit<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.689> Nintendo<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.409> going<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.619> be

providing<00:01:26.130> this<00:01:26.250> type<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.520> assist<00:01:27.030> block

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
providing this type of assist block

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.760 
providing this type of assist block
thing<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.689> was<00:01:27.810> featured<00:01:28.140> in<00:01:28.259> super<00:01:28.590> mario

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
thing that was featured in super mario

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.609 
thing that was featured in super mario
3d<00:01:29.159> land<00:01:29.250> in<00:01:29.549> New<00:01:30.000> Super<00:01:30.180> Mario<00:01:30.329> Bros<00:01:30.630> 2<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.500> the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
3d land in New Super Mario Bros 2 so the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.410 
3d land in New Super Mario Bros 2 so the
next<00:01:31.770> piece<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.009> artwork<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.579> golden<00:01:33.240> mushroom

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
next piece of artwork is golden mushroom

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.240 
next piece of artwork is golden mushroom
right<00:01:33.780> here<00:01:34.020> I'm<00:01:34.350> guessing<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.040> just

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
right here I'm guessing this is just

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.310 
right here I'm guessing this is just
like<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.400> golden<00:01:35.880> 1-up<00:01:36.299> mushroom<00:01:36.329> so<00:01:37.020> probably

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
like a golden 1-up mushroom so probably

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.170 
like a golden 1-up mushroom so probably
instead<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.650> just<00:01:37.829> like<00:01:37.979> 11<00:01:38.579> up<00:01:38.729> maybe<00:01:39.000> you'll

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
instead of just like 11 up maybe you'll

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.270 
instead of just like 11 up maybe you'll
get<00:01:39.299> like<00:01:39.509> 10<00:01:39.780> one-ups<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.799> it's<00:01:41.070> just<00:01:41.189> like

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
get like 10 one-ups so it's just like

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.819 
get like 10 one-ups so it's just like
another<00:01:41.579> way<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.540> get<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.899> ton<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.229> lives<00:01:43.619> in

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
another way to get a ton of lives in

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.649 
another way to get a ton of lives in
this<00:01:43.950> game<00:01:44.159> because<00:01:44.340> there's<00:01:45.240> also<00:01:45.390> going<00:01:45.600> to

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
this game because there's also going to

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.420 
this game because there's also going to
be<00:01:45.750> an<00:01:45.840> abundance<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.590> golden<00:01:46.950> coins<00:01:47.159> for<00:01:47.369> you

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
be an abundance of golden coins for you

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.950 
be an abundance of golden coins for you
to<00:01:47.549> collect<00:01:47.820> which<00:01:48.030> will<00:01:48.270> increase<00:01:48.659> the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
to collect which will increase the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.660 
to collect which will increase the
amount<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.259> lives<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.619> will<00:01:49.649> get<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.520> last

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
amount of lives you will get so the last

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.100 
amount of lives you will get so the last
piece<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:50.970> our<00:01:51.090> effort<00:01:51.299> i'm<00:01:51.479> going<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.840> show

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
piece of our effort i'm going to show

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.660 
piece of our effort i'm going to show
you<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:52.500> one<00:01:52.680> right<00:01:52.799> here<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:53.070> confirms

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
return to New Super Mario Bros 2 we

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.609 
return to New Super Mario Bros 2 we
already<00:01:57.299> had<00:01:57.570> like<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.780> screenshot<00:01:58.170> that<00:01:58.500> was

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
already had like a screenshot that was

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.380 
already had like a screenshot that was
shown<00:01:58.770> off<00:01:59.009> before<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.880> confirmed<00:02:00.240> that

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
shown off before that confirmed that

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.240 
shown off before that confirmed that
really<00:02:00.689> was<00:02:00.840> going<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.020> be<00:02:01.110> making<00:02:01.320> return<00:02:01.770> but

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
really was going to be making return but

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.920 
really was going to be making return but
now<00:02:02.369> we<00:02:02.430> have<00:02:02.520> all<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:03.000> Koopalings<00:02:03.479> shown<00:02:03.719> in

jr.<00:02:06.149> though<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.719> might<00:02:06.930> mean<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.350> he

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
jr. though so that might mean that he

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.809 
jr. though so that might mean that he
might<00:02:07.860> be<00:02:07.979> in<00:02:08.099> the<00:02:08.220> game<00:02:08.399> where<00:02:08.640> he<00:02:08.700> just

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
might be in the game where he just

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.669 
might be in the game where he just
hasn't<00:02:09.030> been<00:02:09.179> announced<00:02:09.420> yet<00:02:09.599> so<00:02:10.379> if<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:10.530> want
