bet you didn't think they sold those on
ebay<00:04:35.400> so<00:04:36.400> I<00:04:36.460> was<00:04:36.580> like<00:04:36.640> another<00:04:36.820> 40<00:04:37.240> bucks<00:04:37.450> but

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
ebay so I was like another 40 bucks but

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.780 
ebay so I was like another 40 bucks but
it's<00:04:38.740> worth<00:04:38.920> it<00:04:39.130> it<00:04:39.820> goes<00:04:40.000> around<00:04:40.120> 70<00:04:40.750> 78<00:04:41.730> on<00:04:42.730> a

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
it's worth it it goes around 70 78 on a

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:48.320 
it's worth it it goes around 70 78 on a
good<00:04:43.000> nails<00:04:43.860> miles<00:04:44.860> per<00:04:45.370> hour<00:04:46.620> back<00:04:47.620> here

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
good nails miles per hour back here

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.300 
good nails miles per hour back here
actually<00:04:49.330> tune<00:04:49.750> this<00:04:50.050> exhaust<00:04:50.620> see<00:04:50.890> I<00:04:50.920> tapered

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
actually tune this exhaust see I tapered

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.940 
actually tune this exhaust see I tapered
it<00:04:51.460> in<00:04:51.730> so<00:04:52.660> it<00:04:52.810> kind<00:04:53.020> of<00:04:53.110> holds<00:04:53.290> the<00:04:53.530> air<00:04:53.710> and<00:04:53.860> it

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
it in so it kind of holds the air and it

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.940 
it in so it kind of holds the air and it
creates<00:04:54.250> a<00:04:54.340> pressure<00:04:54.630> right<00:04:55.630> in<00:04:55.780> there<00:04:56.050> and<00:04:56.320> it

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
creates a pressure right in there and it

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.310 
creates a pressure right in there and it
gives<00:04:57.130> it<00:04:57.250> more<00:04:57.430> boost<00:04:57.730> and<00:04:58.090> then<00:04:59.160> over<00:05:00.160> here

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
gives it more boost and then over here

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.080 
gives it more boost and then over here
see<00:05:02.320> some<00:05:02.560> people<00:05:02.830> prefer<00:05:03.040> the<00:05:03.370> metal<00:05:03.910> pull

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090 
see some people prefer the metal pull

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.510 
see some people prefer the metal pull
starts<00:05:04.560> but<00:05:05.560> the<00:05:05.590> plastic<00:05:06.100> ones<00:05:06.250> are<00:05:06.430> actually

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
starts but the plastic ones are actually

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.850 
starts but the plastic ones are actually
nice<00:05:06.850> because<00:05:06.910> they're<00:05:07.240> disposable<00:05:07.740> so<00:05:08.740> if

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
nice because they're disposable so if

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.170 
nice because they're disposable so if
you<00:05:08.950> break<00:05:09.190> one<00:05:09.370> you<00:05:09.520> just<00:05:09.550> put<00:05:09.790> a<00:05:09.820> new<00:05:09.880> one<00:05:10.030> on

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
you break one you just put a new one on

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.520 
you break one you just put a new one on
to<00:05:10.390> the<00:05:10.480> side<00:05:10.630> of<00:05:10.660> the<00:05:10.840> road<00:05:10.990> the<00:05:11.140> metal<00:05:11.380> ones

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
to the side of the road the metal ones

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.020 
to the side of the road the metal ones
if<00:05:11.680> they<00:05:11.800> break<00:05:12.010> then<00:05:12.280> there's<00:05:12.460> broken<00:05:12.730> for

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
if they break then there's broken for

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:17.220 
if they break then there's broken for
good<00:05:13.060> right<00:05:13.990> so<00:05:14.880> in<00:05:15.880> the<00:05:16.030> throttle<00:05:16.450> upgrade<00:05:17.110> of

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 
good right so in the throttle upgrade of

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.000 
good right so in the throttle upgrade of
the<00:05:17.260> throttle<00:05:17.440> cables<00:05:19.230> the<00:05:20.230> carburetor<00:05:20.740> don't

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
the throttle cables the carburetor don't

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.680 
the throttle cables the carburetor don't
