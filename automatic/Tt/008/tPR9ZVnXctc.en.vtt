00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 that would mean $ 100 and plus 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.490
 that's all relatively I defend anyway 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.530
 on the other hand, people want me 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.240
 all media representatives also want that 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.750
 I always like the 100 dollars in 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.109
 the room 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.160
 he offers yes, but I do too 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:19.380
 which is much more interesting for me 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.670
 is yes the question to ask in 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.170
 which world do I love then how 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.939
 I get a lot for 100 dollars 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.949
 or $ 200 300 then either 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.170
 extreme phases occur so much 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.550
 it is more interesting to the people 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.980
 For example, to show histories 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.320
 dax index from 165 to today like 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.719
 many of us ourselves need that 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.879
 To acquire dax-index then to say 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.280
 people as we enter phase 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.320
 comparable to 1974 the big silver 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.170
 Hosse environment of the first 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.700
 oil price shock or even the second 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.680
 big silver home then us too 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.100
 over 50 us dollars led how much 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.110
 needs at that time to derive from it 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.670
 when it is interesting too 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.320
 say I trade silver, for example 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.780
 in shares so i am for example 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.750
 not a big fan of saying that we 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.760
 two three four five years out of 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.010
 go silver and pure in real estate because 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.020
 So I have a whole row in real estate 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.340
 of arguments then for me there 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.719
 make careful 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.640
 it can now last one last 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:15.990
 Older ago to me that said the whole 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.520
 money system i do not trust 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.679
 really more so on it 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.149
 I want it 80 percent in strategic 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:22.109
 metals gold but also silver 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.200
 invest 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:27.299
 can you stand it all right for a good idea 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.060
 so important to the people now 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.659
 just in germany to say that one 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.329
 Do not put everything in precious metals 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.570
 and even I have certain precautions 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.340
 met 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.659
 as an example at the place so 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.060
 I will never change it 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.229
 to have club risks I have as 18 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.640
 one year old young man 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.560
 life insurance with the alliance 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.729
 completed and have the but with 30 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.080
 years after that, then so 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.030
 Steuerfahnder twelve years was being 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.500
 profit did not come out but I have ten 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.250
 After twelve years, I told myself 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.900
 30-year-old who was on the 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.400
 So now I do not have to expect that 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:05.620
 I say something wrong 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:07.390
 that was 2003 I was yes that fits 18 30 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.800
 so it comes from the net whole 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.900
 so I expect 2003 then this 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.670
 dissolved and then have 60 percent 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.930
 silver and 40 percent then in gold 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.270
 So I know very well 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.710
 and then have the alliance 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.180
 I tell lebensversicherungs representatives 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.330
 I 'll tell you exactly the name 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.290
 Today he prefers to hold me 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.670
 already mad because I 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.780
 dissolve life insurance and after 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.040
 Twelve years, you already want me 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.840
 Pronounce if I tell them now what 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.709
 I will still be with the money 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.390
 for even before italy and then i asked 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.890
 At that time, they have themselves 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.440
 then he said yes so I said 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.750
 We have shares in the dust on the 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.190
 Companies 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.350
 So a sales event 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.630
 Alliance said he has an alliance 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.990
 life insurance whole tuesday 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.790
 representative 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.620
 and then I said but they live 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.360
 to rent so have property 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.860
 she is not yes yes yes but I still have 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.660
 a deposit account at the savings bank there 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.760
 are still 10,000 euros on it so have him 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.260
 then said backman so fix 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.280
 the alliance works with the alliance 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.850
 life insurance 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.160
 they own alliance shares they have 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.820
 still 10,000 euros on an account and you 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.110
 living for rent 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.000
 do you ever have the word customer 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.970
 Risk belongs when he is silver boy now 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.240
 so 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.010
 the young subscriber has 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.540
 has written two precious metal books 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.980
 and lectures about it now if he is 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.720
 also his entire fortune in silver 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.190
 I would then have to invest 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.780
 a club risk built and that is 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.980
 not good 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.120
 what I always advertise that I want 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.980
 also make it very clear here tomorrow 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.730
 with charts the silver offers the best 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.240
 inflation protection 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.680
 I always say that, but demonstrably 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.020
 Of course, silver would be under the wheels 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.320
 advised if we would play again 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.980
 deflation big big slump of 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.770
 global economy 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.330
 I hold a collapse like in 2008 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.860
 not yet possible 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.420
 I totally want to exclude that 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.120
 not currently against the background 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.270
 the statements that already made today 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.890
 I mean to the initiators of chemistry 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.350
 Although today I have today as well 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:03.470
 tomorrow the cs announced in taiwan in 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.910
 South Korea are now at 740 something 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.320
 but we know they are lying 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.260
 so still under 50 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.760
 and we we certainly hope that it 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.470
 japanese do more but they are currently 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.820
 faced with a recession we 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.190
 hope that after the 18th 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.380
 party day of communists in china the 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.590
 which then ultimately just the casket 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.329
 open 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.220
 There is also some improvement tendency 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.010
 in the monetary policy of the people's bank 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:27.900
 of china but there is still hope in the game 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.300
 and I have to look so I look 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.800
 many factors in that really 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.000
 turn and you can see that at the moment 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.650
 not again with the oecd 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.810
 I still have some early indicators 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.860
 just got cracked and 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.000
 That's why I still want to 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.250
 be careful 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.870
 but to say it again 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.040
 large increases in the precious metal in the 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.530
 next one to three years 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.510
 they will not come like 2008 until 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.610
 ten then great recovery and then 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.980
 the new highs award in silver on the 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.300
 in the end, this boom phase 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.520
 the world economy then the 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.770
 burgeoning inflation tasks 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.980
 but fear of inflation would be here 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.420
 it's about keeping my mind that 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.990
 the real economies in the end 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:10.270
 stagnation at best 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.490
 and the central banks are doing everything to us 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.510
 the whole non deflation he collapsed 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.610
 So you always more money in the system 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.040
 give it but then increasingly 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.750
 a movement of flight that we trigger 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.520
 here in Germany in the last two 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.520
 years already can watch
