00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
great features of the OM 35 is the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.819 
great features of the OM 35 is the
sensor<00:01:02.089> uses<00:01:02.629> a<00:01:02.659> high<00:01:02.899> quality<00:01:03.170> optical

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829

sensor uses a high quality optical
sensor<00:01:04.190> from<00:01:04.309> a<00:01:04.489> vago<00:01:04.879> Cupid<00:01:05.540> claim<00:01:05.870> this<00:01:06.230> is

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
sensor from a vago Cupid claim this is

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.780 
sensor from a vago Cupid claim this is
this<00:01:06.650> produces<00:01:07.100> the<00:01:07.310> most<00:01:07.520> accurate

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
this produces the most accurate
