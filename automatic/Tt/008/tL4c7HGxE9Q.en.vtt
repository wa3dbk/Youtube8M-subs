00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.779
 no, your video player is not broken 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.059
 and your computer still has enough 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.709
 performance of the reason why the picture so 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.019
 looks like it looks like 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:15.329
 next we want to show you what 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.830
 our test drivers are just seeing who they are 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:18.830
 that is all hailstones 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.690
 official order of the car picture 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.279
 Fraction is today food 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.560
 alcoholic drinks with 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.480
 subsequent driving tests that 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.400
 alcohol affects the driving ability to drive 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.780
 we know that how strong and how 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.090
 different that can be 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.100
 that is what we have to say today 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.940
 three of our test editors have the 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:46.220
 Drinking free ticket issued 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:51.710
 bendix krohn 43 years 1 meter 80 98 kilo 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:56.070
 claudia white 39 years 1 meter 75 62 kg 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.269
 and lars busemann 35 years one meter 83 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.670
 80 kilos 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.559
 but before anyone here im 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.510
 science services the lamps 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.460
 shoots two driving tests on the 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.920
 After all, we need participants for 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.630
 later accompanied by a comparative value 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.970
 and guided the rides of 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.369
 Jürgen Obst and Bernd have both 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.030
 instructors of the adac 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.310
 driving safety center lüneburg 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.390
 on the one hand it is a skill 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.820
 to master the course 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.590
 wrap slalom curves and pinpoint 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:28.070
 Brakes combined with the solving one 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.070
 math task 9 x 18 03 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.830
 08 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.710
 on the other a reaction course here 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.090
 it is an obstacle in the form of a 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.130
 Dodge the water wall 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.869
 in the sober state an ease 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.659
 hence your own assessment 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.219
 relatively high yes so far I am 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.829
 I'm not so sure if that's what 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.140
 will be because I ask myself 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.610
 pretty confident and I do not know 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.380
 the short time I can not do so 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.330
 drink a lot that that much worse 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.950
 one tends to that it that one 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.120
 it overestimates me now 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.319
 now I would say I get the 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.230
 everything is easy that it is relatively easy 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.640
 what we do yes and overwhelmed 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.780
 my driver students by no means 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.340
 and I believe that I 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.140
 but I think drunk 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.250
 I think that will be the wash 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.090
 purpose I never count on 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.590
 that it is not like that 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.360
 i am good things i think i am 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.450
 get the driving training individual 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.579
 driving workout exactly autobild alps lures 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.650
 no alcohol at the tax of course that 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:36.750
 Of course, not punctual for today 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.799
 At noon, the drink goes for the 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.799
 good purpose going on 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.280
 after an hour back on the track 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:57.879
 i am at work i believe i am 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:03:00.190
 must blow quite pale comes too 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.049
 claudia not around and did not read 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.120
 So I'm very first behavior 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.349
 Being fluid will be relaxed 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.190
 because I'm there through the pylons 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.580
 go through 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.269
 I will accompany you but I can 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.040
 no longer articulate me correctly 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.420
 So that's why I would say that 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.799
 with the second not quite as good 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.299
 works as in the beginning 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.209
 so i could imagine that now 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:22.209
 will be a bit high-spirited 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.319
 and possibly faster 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.640
 to drive around the course but 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.290
 maybe a few more 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.480
 obstacles will run over 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.280
 unfortunately I have to say by now 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.790
 the beautiful weather amid roaring 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.799
 sun I have nice mica 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.329
 meanwhile and I think that will happen 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.579
 little worse than wool 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.440
 and that's exactly how it is 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.329
 Let's leave math task out 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.760
 that was not so good from the beginning 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:47.650
 otherwise they are all close to their own 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.480
 in the morning but leave it time 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.099
 one or two pylons fly 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.470
 that could be in normal road traffic 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:55.690
 passers- by and is due to that 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.560
 the alcoholic more aggressive 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.510
 driving behavior 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.130
 especially scary that 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.860
 Reactivity is stronger 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.420
 restricted as thought 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.270
 the water wall impressive under 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.400
 So it's clear when I'm in the proof 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.190
 i had to drive in the car 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.710
 It was suddenly clear to me that I am yes 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.060
 Already drunk and driving soundlessly 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:17.489
 baseless vehicle control that went 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.120
 still switching so coupling steer everything 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.910
 no problem 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:24.840
 but then the problem was to react 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:28.410
 no chance so there the reaction time 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.890
 was much longer and I am always 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.330
 Fully mowed in this water man 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.160
 Failed completely failed there I am 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.090
 just sailed straight through the 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.800
 car has turned 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.150
 i have seen the gap too late i 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.740
 have reacted too late with the 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.230
 Reaction speed is not 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.810
 more so so very clearly so 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.090
 really the dangerous situation because 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.890
 you just can not react anymore 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.270
 The moment you really notice 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.370
 a few seconds longer and it is 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.169
 simply squandered security structure 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.430
 Jürgen Obst brings it up again 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:01.890
 the point increased risk-taking 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:04.050
 later recognize critical 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.640
 situations and then of course changed 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.430
 reaction and we certainly could 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:11.280
 very nice to see in our exercise 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.320
 especially when exercising with the cashier 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.840
 that the reaction came very very late and 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.190
 that sober ones are much more likely 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.080
 and we are about 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.240
 driven at 50 km / h 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.140
 if it's only half a second what 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.729
 we need longer 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.050
 then we are seven meters 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:26.640
 time delay and then have one 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.080
 seven meters away time problem 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.270
 that was the reason why it was still 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.580
 did not work 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.470
 and those are probably the many as 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.630
 lower eighth partially only just 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.760
 over the allowed 0 5 promille 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.950
 even our car image editors have 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.780
 At the beginning of the test you thought of this 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.610
 But opinion has now fundamentally 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.140
 changed for me no surprise 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.370
 Result should mean mine 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.370
 ability to concentrate is now 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:53.090
 Just go on easy going and leek 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:54.500
 and do not respond and the car 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.670
 correct by the danger situation 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.950
 designed so i am now 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:59.420
 rather casual but a car 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.630
 drive that is now not at all 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:04.720
 case 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.720
 I think I had 14 blown 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:14.590
 that's pretty neat and me 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:17.130
 can only say alcohol is on the tax is 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.990
 very difficult really terrible 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.550
 And that's what our car is, by the way 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.070
 picture editors after another two 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.810
 Drink for hours so see finger 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.410
 away from the tax if at the previous 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.020
 bottle was 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:31.620
 car picture is for 0,0 promille at 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.620
 drive
