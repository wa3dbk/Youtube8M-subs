a 50 thousand which is a perpetual
calendar<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.719> is<00:02:06.780> fantastic<00:02:07.710> it's<00:02:07.890> a

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
calendar this is fantastic it's a

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.300 
calendar this is fantastic it's a
movement

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
movement

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.340 
movement
we<00:02:09.520> have<00:02:09.670> developed<00:02:10.060> with<00:02:10.240> nothing<00:02:10.660> Varna<00:02:11.110> and

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
we have developed with nothing Varna and

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.730 
we have developed with nothing Varna and
this<00:02:12.250> is<00:02:12.430> really<00:02:12.760> tells<00:02:13.240> you<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:14.020> time<00:02:14.320> and
