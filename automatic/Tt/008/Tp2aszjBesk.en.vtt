00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
domestic water that line goes over to

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.840 
domestic water that line goes over to
here<00:01:16.700> which<00:01:17.150> I've<00:01:17.360> installed<00:01:17.750> a<00:01:18.850> shutoff

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
here which I've installed a shutoff

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.490 
here which I've installed a shutoff
valve<00:01:20.180> so<00:01:20.450> I<00:01:20.479> can<00:01:20.690> go<00:01:20.780> ahead<00:01:20.870> and<00:01:21.110> shut<00:01:21.320> the

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
valve so I can go ahead and shut the

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.899 
valve so I can go ahead and shut the
shut<00:01:21.680> off<00:01:21.740> valve<00:01:21.890> if<00:01:22.310> I<00:01:22.400> need<00:01:22.610> to<00:01:22.729> change

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
shut off valve if I need to change

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.149 
shut off valve if I need to change
anything<00:01:23.270> out<00:01:23.659> all<00:01:24.560> you<00:01:24.680> do<00:01:24.830> is<00:01:24.979> just

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
anything out all you do is just

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.570 
anything out all you do is just
soldering<00:01:25.610> or<00:01:26.119> you<00:01:26.240> can<00:01:26.450> just<00:01:26.659> use<00:01:26.869> a<00:01:27.580> CPVC

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
soldering or you can just use a CPVC

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.210 
soldering or you can just use a CPVC
which<00:01:29.119> I've<00:01:29.330> done<00:01:29.510> I<00:01:29.810> went<00:01:30.530> in<00:01:30.619> and<00:01:30.680> put<00:01:30.830> copper

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
which I've done I went in and put copper

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.950 
which I've done I went in and put copper
out<00:01:31.250> to<00:01:31.520> a<00:01:31.580> certain<00:01:31.760> point<00:01:32.090> and<00:01:32.360> then<00:01:32.479> went<00:01:32.869> on

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
out to a certain point and then went on

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.910 
out to a certain point and then went on
with<00:01:32.990> CPVC

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
with CPVC

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.510 
with CPVC
so<00:01:34.190> it<00:01:34.310> comes<00:01:34.460> all<00:01:34.640> way<00:01:34.670> back<00:01:34.909> down<00:01:35.119> there<00:01:36.520> it

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
so it comes all way back down there it

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.730 
so it comes all way back down there it
files<00:01:37.820> around<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.390> discharge<00:01:38.930> line<00:01:39.260> to<00:01:39.619> the

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
files around the discharge line to the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.140 
files around the discharge line to the
pump<00:01:40.689> down<00:01:41.689> to<00:01:41.900> here<00:01:42.290> and<00:01:42.439> then<00:01:42.760> I've<00:01:43.760> got<00:01:44.119> a

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
pump down to here and then I've got a

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.560 
pump down to here and then I've got a
union<00:01:44.810> that's<00:01:44.930> hand<00:01:45.200> tighten<00:01:45.560> right<00:01:45.680> there

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
union that's hand tighten right there

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.289 
union that's hand tighten right there
now<00:01:47.570> you'll<00:01:47.990> see<00:01:48.200> a<00:01:48.229> strainer<00:01:48.939> try<00:01:49.939> to<00:01:50.000> see<00:01:50.210> if

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
now you'll see a strainer try to see if

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:51.609 
now you'll see a strainer try to see if
you<00:01:50.390> can<00:01:50.509> see<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.720> strainer<00:01:51.020> there<00:01:51.259> right

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
you can see the strainer there right

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.760 
you can see the strainer there right
there<00:01:51.860> in<00:01:52.100> between<00:01:52.189> and<00:01:52.790> that<00:01:53.290> strainer<00:01:54.290> once

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
there in between and that strainer once

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.800 
there in between and that strainer once
the<00:01:54.890> water<00:01:55.100> level<00:01:55.159> gets<00:01:55.549> up<00:01:55.700> there<00:01:55.909> will

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
the water level gets up there will

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.420 
the water level gets up there will
discharge<00:01:57.439> out<00:01:57.770> this<00:01:58.670> far<00:01:59.000> line<00:02:00.250> comes<00:02:01.250> out

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
discharge out this far line comes out

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.350 
discharge out this far line comes out
that<00:02:01.670> way<00:02:01.909> and<00:02:02.210> then<00:02:02.270> it<00:02:02.930> discharges<00:02:04.780> out

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
that way and then it discharges out

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.030 
that way and then it discharges out
side<00:02:08.290> there<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:10.390> a<00:02:10.420> 4-inch<00:02:11.080> line<00:02:11.620> I<00:02:11.650> have

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
side there to a 4-inch line I have

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.860 
side there to a 4-inch line I have
buried<00:02:12.670> out<00:02:12.790> in<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:12.970> backyard<00:02:13.150> it<00:02:13.570> goes<00:02:13.660> all

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
buried out in the backyard it goes all

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.780 
buried out in the backyard it goes all
the<00:02:13.900> way<00:02:14.020> out<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.350> a<00:02:14.380> ditch<00:02:14.680> for<00:02:15.070> water

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
the way out to a ditch for water

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.910 
the way out to a ditch for water
management<00:02:17.760> now<00:02:18.760> I<00:02:18.820> put<00:02:19.330> on<00:02:19.510> rubber<00:02:20.470> furnco

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
management now I put on rubber furnco

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.670 
management now I put on rubber furnco
fittings<00:02:21.630> with<00:02:22.630> mechanical<00:02:23.170> bands<00:02:25.440> so<00:02:26.440> it's

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
fittings with mechanical bands so it's

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.990 
fittings with mechanical bands so it's
easy<00:02:26.830> to<00:02:26.980> take<00:02:27.100> apart<00:02:27.250> if<00:02:27.580> there's<00:02:27.760> anything

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
easy to take apart if there's anything

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.460 
easy to take apart if there's anything
any<00:02:28.390> kind<00:02:28.600> of<00:02:28.660> debris<00:02:28.900> or<00:02:29.050> anything<00:02:29.200> that<00:02:29.380> gets

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
any kind of debris or anything that gets

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.970 
any kind of debris or anything that gets
in<00:02:29.620> here<00:02:29.920> which<00:02:30.220> hasn't<00:02:30.910> happened<00:02:31.150> in<00:02:31.600> years

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
in here which hasn't happened in years

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.340 
in here which hasn't happened in years
and<00:02:33.360> this<00:02:34.360> has<00:02:34.540> been<00:02:34.690> working<00:02:34.870> pretty<00:02:35.080> good

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
and this has been working pretty good

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.660 
and this has been working pretty good
now<00:02:35.620> what<00:02:35.770> I'll<00:02:35.860> do<00:02:36.010> is<00:02:36.190> I'll<00:02:36.310> go<00:02:36.400> ahead<00:02:36.430> and

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
now what I'll do is I'll go ahead and

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.630 
now what I'll do is I'll go ahead and
I'll<00:02:36.730> fill<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.060> crock<00:02:37.300> up<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:38.430> then<00:02:39.430> maybe

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
I'll fill the crock up and then maybe

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.540 
I'll fill the crock up and then maybe
you<00:02:39.820> can<00:02:39.970> see<00:02:40.150> how<00:02:40.300> it<00:02:40.420> works<00:02:41.340> okay<00:02:42.340> so<00:02:42.370> I

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
you can see how it works okay so I

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.230 
you can see how it works okay so I
filled<00:02:42.910> it<00:02:43.060> up<00:02:43.680> as<00:02:44.680> far<00:02:45.010> as<00:02:45.040> I<00:02:45.220> can<00:02:45.460> you<00:02:45.700> see

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
filled it up as far as I can you see

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.300 
filled it up as far as I can you see
this<00:02:46.360> line<00:02:46.600> right<00:02:46.630> here<00:02:46.840> this<00:02:47.230> is<00:02:47.290> my<00:02:47.650> Inlet

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
this line right here this is my Inlet

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.060 
this line right here this is my Inlet
line<00:02:48.580> it<00:02:48.880> comes<00:02:49.060> in<00:02:49.240> for<00:02:49.540> stormwater<00:02:50.070> right

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
line it comes in for stormwater right

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.760 
line it comes in for stormwater right
now<00:02:51.220> we're<00:02:51.550> actually<00:02:52.150> kind<00:02:52.570> of<00:02:52.660> dry<00:02:52.900> so<00:02:53.710> it

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
now we're actually kind of dry so it

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.380 
now we're actually kind of dry so it
would<00:02:53.920> take<00:02:54.100> me<00:02:54.250> forever<00:02:54.460> to<00:02:54.730> go<00:02:54.940> ahead<00:02:55.150> and

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
would take me forever to go ahead and

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.670 
would take me forever to go ahead and
fill<00:02:55.630> that<00:02:55.660> whole<00:02:55.990> line<00:02:56.230> out<00:02:56.440> that<00:02:56.590> goes

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
fill that whole line out that goes

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.030 
fill that whole line out that goes
outside<00:02:56.860> of<00:02:57.100> the<00:02:57.250> house<00:02:57.460> and<00:02:58.860> get<00:02:59.860> all<00:03:00.010> that

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
outside of the house and get all that

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.650 
outside of the house and get all that
you<00:03:00.340> know<00:03:00.550> that<00:03:00.700> amount<00:03:00.940> of<00:03:01.060> volume<00:03:01.240> and<00:03:01.450> water

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
you know that amount of volume and water

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.820 
you know that amount of volume and water
to<00:03:01.810> come<00:03:01.930> into<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.200> crop<00:03:02.380> so<00:03:02.500> what<00:03:02.650> I've<00:03:02.740> done

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
to come into the crop so what I've done

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.590 
to come into the crop so what I've done
is<00:03:02.890> I<00:03:03.130> just<00:03:03.190> filled<00:03:03.520> up<00:03:03.640> as<00:03:03.790> much<00:03:03.940> as<00:03:04.090> I<00:03:04.180> can<00:03:04.420> and

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
is I just filled up as much as I can and

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.360 
is I just filled up as much as I can and
as<00:03:05.140> you<00:03:05.260> can<00:03:05.380> see<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.650> water<00:03:05.830> levels<00:03:06.190> right

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
as you can see the water levels right

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.540 
as you can see the water levels right
here<00:03:06.610> now<00:03:07.240> the<00:03:07.840> way<00:03:07.990> it<00:03:08.200> a<00:03:08.350> backup<00:03:09.010> pump<00:03:09.280> works

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
here now the way it a backup pump works

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.950 
here now the way it a backup pump works
is<00:03:09.790> like<00:03:10.000> I<00:03:10.090> said<00:03:10.270> you<00:03:10.420> want<00:03:10.630> to<00:03:10.690> make<00:03:10.810> sure

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
is like I said you want to make sure

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.479 
is like I said you want to make sure
that<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.260> water<00:03:11.440> doesn't<00:03:11.680> go<00:03:11.890> over<00:03:12.160> and<00:03:12.280> flood

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
that the water doesn't go over and flood

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.380 
that the water doesn't go over and flood
your<00:03:12.640> basement<00:03:13.060> of<00:03:13.150> course<00:03:13.739> so<00:03:15.330> being<00:03:16.330> that

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
your basement of course so being that

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.330 
your basement of course so being that
the<00:03:16.570> water<00:03:16.750> levels<00:03:17.080> right<00:03:17.290> here<00:03:17.650> this<00:03:18.010> is<00:03:18.160> just

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
the water levels right here this is just

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.800 
the water levels right here this is just
going<00:03:18.459> to<00:03:18.520> show<00:03:18.700> you<00:03:18.730> how<00:03:19.030> much<00:03:19.239> it<00:03:19.600> can

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
going to show you how much it can

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.830 
going to show you how much it can
discharge<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:20.709> how<00:03:20.770> fast<00:03:21.010> it<00:03:21.280> can<00:03:21.690> keep<00:03:22.690> in

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
discharge and how fast it can keep in

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.150 
discharge and how fast it can keep in
mind<00:03:23.050> like<00:03:23.230> I<00:03:23.320> said<00:03:23.500> I<00:03:23.530> don't<00:03:23.739> have<00:03:23.830> any<00:03:23.980> water

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
mind like I said I don't have any water

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.640 
mind like I said I don't have any water
really<00:03:24.670> rushing<00:03:25.030> in<00:03:25.180> right<00:03:25.390> now<00:03:25.600> but<00:03:26.320> this<00:03:26.470> is

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
really rushing in right now but this is

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.870 
really rushing in right now but this is
a<00:03:26.680> lot<00:03:26.950> more<00:03:27.060> economical<00:03:28.060> and<00:03:29.280> feasible<00:03:30.280> than

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
a lot more economical and feasible than

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.729 
a lot more economical and feasible than
having<00:03:31.239> a<00:03:31.360> battery<00:03:31.720> backup<00:03:32.050> system<00:03:32.500> I<00:03:32.560> had<00:03:32.709> a

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
having a battery backup system I had a

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.070 
having a battery backup system I had a
battery<00:03:33.070> backup<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.550> system<00:03:34.000> before<00:03:34.360> I<00:03:34.660> had

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
battery backup the system before I had

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.840 
battery backup the system before I had
an<00:03:35.230> energy<00:03:35.500> home<00:03:35.800> audit<00:03:36.250> and<00:03:36.370> they<00:03:36.459> came<00:03:36.640> in

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
an energy home audit and they came in

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.970 
an energy home audit and they came in
and<00:03:36.880> they<00:03:37.120> said<00:03:37.330> that<00:03:37.510> that<00:03:37.660> wasn't<00:03:37.980> energy

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
and they said that that wasn't energy

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.190 
and they said that that wasn't energy
efficient<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:39.610> we<00:03:40.390> had<00:03:40.540> a<00:03:40.570> big<00:03:40.750> storm<00:03:40.870> one

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
efficient and we had a big storm one

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.360 
efficient and we had a big storm one
time<00:03:41.440> and<00:03:41.770> the<00:03:42.640> battery<00:03:43.000> system<00:03:44.370> completely

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
time and the battery system completely

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.710 
time and the battery system completely
drained<00:03:45.730> down<00:03:45.880> within<00:03:46.239> a<00:03:46.330> matter<00:03:46.510> of<00:03:46.600> a<00:03:46.690> couple

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
drained down within a matter of a couple

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.479 
drained down within a matter of a couple
hours<00:03:47.230> and<00:03:47.440> then<00:03:47.530> with<00:03:47.650> battery<00:03:48.010> was<00:03:48.190> only

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
hours and then with battery was only

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.000 
hours and then with battery was only
like<00:03:48.640> six<00:03:48.850> months<00:03:49.000> old<00:03:49.209> so<00:03:50.050> you<00:03:50.709> got<00:03:50.860> to

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
like six months old so you got to

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.800 
like six months old so you got to
understand<00:03:51.700> that<00:03:51.820> what<00:03:52.000> a<00:03:52.030> battery<00:03:52.390> system

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
understand that what a battery system

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.680 
understand that what a battery system
does<00:03:52.989> is<00:03:53.200> it<00:03:53.320> constantly<00:03:53.950> replenishes<00:03:54.550> itself

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
does is it constantly replenishes itself

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.710 
does is it constantly replenishes itself
so<00:03:55.690> that<00:03:56.020> it<00:03:56.709> keeps<00:03:56.890> a<00:03:57.070> battery<00:03:57.400> at<00:03:57.730> you<00:03:58.600> know

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
so that it keeps a battery at you know

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.330 
so that it keeps a battery at you know

it has a venturi system in there and I
don't<00:04:27.320> know<00:04:27.410> if<00:04:27.500> you<00:04:27.560> can<00:04:27.680> tell<00:04:27.860> but<00:04:27.919> that<00:04:28.160> the

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
don't know if you can tell but that the

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.460 
don't know if you can tell but that the
water<00:04:29.000> levels<00:04:29.330> going<00:04:29.480> down<00:04:29.570> really<00:04:29.900> quick<00:04:30.200> and

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
water levels going down really quick and

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.560 
water levels going down really quick and
pretty<00:04:31.250> soon<00:04:31.430> you'll<00:04:31.639> probably<00:04:31.850> hear<00:04:32.180> air

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
pretty soon you'll probably hear air

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
starting to rush in because it will be

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:39.250 
starting to rush in because it will be
below<00:04:34.340> that<00:04:34.520> frame<00:04:37.780> so<00:04:38.780> there's<00:04:38.900> been<00:04:39.110> a<00:04:39.139> lot

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
below that frame so there's been a lot

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.080 
below that frame so there's been a lot
of<00:04:39.410> naysayers<00:04:39.560> out<00:04:40.070> there<00:04:40.130> says<00:04:40.520> this<00:04:40.700> system

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
of naysayers out there says this system

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.740 
of naysayers out there says this system
doesn't<00:04:41.960> work<00:04:42.139> and<00:04:42.500> isn't<00:04:42.770> feasible<00:04:43.280> I<00:04:43.790> can

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
doesn't work and isn't feasible I can

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.780 
doesn't work and isn't feasible I can
vouch<00:04:44.900> that<00:04:44.960> it's<00:04:45.440> a<00:04:45.560> it's<00:04:45.919> a<00:04:46.010> great<00:04:46.130> system

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
vouch that it's a it's a great system

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.300 
vouch that it's a it's a great system
plus<00:04:47.300> it's<00:04:47.480> american-made<00:04:48.110> you<00:04:48.889> can't<00:04:49.100> beat

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
plus it's american-made you can't beat

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.990 
plus it's american-made you can't beat
it<00:04:49.340> so<00:04:50.330> that's<00:04:50.570> the<00:04:50.720> update<00:04:50.840> on<00:04:51.260> the<00:04:51.380> system<00:04:51.770> I

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
it so that's the update on the system I

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.180 
it so that's the update on the system I
hope<00:04:53.000> you<00:04:53.120> like<00:04:53.300> it<00:04:53.540> let<00:04:54.200> me<00:04:54.229> know<00:04:54.320> give<00:04:55.100> me
