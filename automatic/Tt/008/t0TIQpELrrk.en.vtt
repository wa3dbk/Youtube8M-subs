you might be familiar with their weather
the<00:02:20.569> styles<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:21.020> shoes<00:02:21.230> not<00:02:21.410> just<00:02:21.470> golf<00:02:21.860> or

the styles of shoes not just golf or

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.800 
the styles of shoes not just golf or
this<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:22.850> that<00:02:22.940> just<00:02:23.090> means<00:02:23.330> it's<00:02:23.630> got<00:02:23.750> an

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
this and that just means it's got an

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.290 
this and that just means it's got an
extremely<00:02:24.200> good<00:02:24.470> grip<00:02:24.800> but<00:02:25.640> it's<00:02:25.760> very<00:02:26.000> very

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
extremely good grip but it's very very

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.600 
extremely good grip but it's very very
flexible<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:27.110> it's<00:02:27.620> still<00:02:27.830> very<00:02:27.860> light<00:02:28.280> so<00:02:28.489> it

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
flexible and it's still very light so it

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.250 
flexible and it's still very light so it
has<00:02:28.760> that<00:02:28.910> versatility<00:02:29.420> being<00:02:29.930> able<00:02:30.020> to<00:02:30.110> do

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
has that versatility being able to do

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.500 
has that versatility being able to do
other<00:02:30.410> things<00:02:30.470> and<00:02:31.130> that's<00:02:31.910> the<00:02:32.120> high-tech

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
other things and that's the high-tech

Sierra

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.820 

so<00:02:38.680> as<00:02:38.800> you've<00:02:38.950> seen<00:02:39.160> three<00:02:40.150> stars<00:02:40.450> of

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
so as you've seen three stars of

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.520 
so as you've seen three stars of
spikeless<00:02:41.830> golf<00:02:41.920> shoe<00:02:42.450> now<00:02:43.450> obviously<00:02:44.140> it

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
spikeless golf shoe now obviously it

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.890 
spikeless golf shoe now obviously it
doesn't<00:02:45.160> have<00:02:45.250> spikes<00:02:45.550> so<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.360> chances<00:02:46.750> are

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
doesn't have spikes so the chances are

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.119 
doesn't have spikes so the chances are
in<00:02:47.050> certain<00:02:47.260> weather<00:02:47.440> conditions<00:02:47.590> they're

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
in certain weather conditions they're

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:49.259 
in certain weather conditions they're
not<00:02:48.250> going<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:48.400> grip<00:02:48.580> quite<00:02:48.790> as<00:02:48.910> well

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
not going to grip quite as well

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.420 
not going to grip quite as well
but<00:02:49.870> on<00:02:50.050> the<00:02:50.290> dry<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.530> hot<00:02:50.769> days<00:02:50.980> they're

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
but on the dry the hot days they're

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.610 
but on the dry the hot days they're
going<00:02:51.610> to<00:02:51.670> be<00:02:51.730> just<00:02:51.910> as<00:02:52.060> good<00:02:52.300> as<00:02:52.959> despite<00:02:53.379> shoe

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
going to be just as good as despite shoe

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.170 
going to be just as good as despite shoe
but<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.280> main<00:02:54.430> difference<00:02:54.459> with<00:02:55.030> the

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
but the main difference with the

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.240 
but the main difference with the
spyglass<00:02:55.480> is<00:02:55.930> it<00:02:56.650> doesn't<00:02:56.830> have<00:02:56.950> the

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
spyglass is it doesn't have the

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.830 
spyglass is it doesn't have the
rigidness<00:02:57.700> going<00:02:58.090> through<00:02:58.239> the<00:02:58.360> shore<00:02:58.599> and

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
rigidness going through the shore and

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.900 
rigidness going through the shore and
they<00:02:59.440> are<00:02:59.590> a<00:02:59.620> little<00:02:59.799> bit<00:03:00.040> lighter<00:03:00.250> so<00:03:00.640> from<00:03:00.819> a

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
they are a little bit lighter so from a

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.729 
they are a little bit lighter so from a
comfort<00:03:01.299> side<00:03:01.540> they<00:03:02.200> are<00:03:02.349> definitely<00:03:02.650> going

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
comfort side they are definitely going

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.740 
comfort side they are definitely going
to<00:03:02.860> be<00:03:02.920> more<00:03:03.069> comfortable<00:03:03.310> in<00:03:03.670> a<00:03:03.730> spy<00:03:03.940> qu<00:03:04.239> but

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
to be more comfortable in a spy qu but

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.910 
to be more comfortable in a spy qu but
why<00:03:04.870> don't<00:03:04.930> you<00:03:05.080> come<00:03:05.230> in<00:03:05.379> and<00:03:05.530> try<00:03:05.650> them<00:03:05.830> on

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
why don't you come in and try them on

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.199 
why don't you come in and try them on
and<00:03:06.069> you<00:03:06.129> can<00:03:06.280> make<00:03:06.310> your<00:03:06.459> own<00:03:06.610> mind<00:03:06.760> up<00:03:06.970> a
