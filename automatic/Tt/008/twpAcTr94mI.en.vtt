00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:10.519
 scenarios that enchant 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.519
 of a people who cultivate their traditions 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:22.699
 with the rich biodiversity where man my mind needs to live in 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.699
 harmony 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.220
 here the hours go much slower 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.780
 This place is called the Alto Camaquã and is located in the southeastern 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.150
 Rio Grande do Sul 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.820
 a region that preserved the characteristics of the landscape in its 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.820
 form of production the livestock family 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.850
 to improve this activity that the economic base of the region 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.250
 the empirical knowledge of the producer that has been acquired over time must 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.630
 be taken into account by my grandfather in the 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.680
 not that I was 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.979
 is what the cannabis top development project 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:17.670
 of embrapa partners 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.290
 is doing when implanting experimental units of participatory research 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.900
 What are the voice calls? 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.240
 the experimental unit closely 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.620
 consecutive search the space 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.780
 that we are developing 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.650
 together with the producers 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.470
 through producer associations 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.220
 of the seven municipalities involved in the project as high as the color we 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.440
 opportunity beyond the reality of the producer 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.229
 ramp up 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.520
 and strategies 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.870
 with him 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.190
 making research build strategies that are appropriate to reality 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.190
 local reality 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.930
 one of these research units was implanted in the family property 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:01.830
 pear tree 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.050
 in the municipality of caçapava do sul 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.840
 It's starting this way for the time being that extravagant starting phase of research 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.870
 result for search 

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:15.520
 to improve an overrun in the case of cattle and sheep and goats try to 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.510
 improve our performance as a rural producer with the association indicated them 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.189
 the ownership of its silva at the nodes of São Paulo as an ecpa representative of 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.609
 association of villagers 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:34.159
 in this space we this is from the age that definition we begin to 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.879
 hospitalization with the producers 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:41.230
 using or not using a good method that we have used to 

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:44.629
 approaching the main subject 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.689
 that defines chima that characterizes cattle ranching if lived 

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.889
 the embrapa 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:57.499
 uses an area of ​​property and to conduct various research 

00:02:57.499 --> 00:03:00.499
 taking into account the local vegetation 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:07.569
 air is the landscape characteristic of the high bed, the marten integrated to the field until 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:08.209
 fourth 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.399
 and to contribute to the development of this activity here in the region 

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:15.949
 researchers are working to conserve native field species 

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:21.339
 one of the main activities carried out is the collection of species that will 

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:24.659
 compose the germplasm bank of embrapa south cattle raising 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.900
 the conservation of these plant species is fundamental for future research 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:37.599
 with that to any research we have we have idea 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.539
 in our case it is almost half of this year the plants we can do 

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:44.949
 too many more payments 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.389
 with work effect 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.389
 first we have 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:54.100
 but how is it? 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.390
 in the region and also in expenses that we already had a bank 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.390
 germplasm to recover 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.239
 and we also choose 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:09.040
 it is an enormous facility for us to find species like these 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.919
 orchards 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:12.999
 conservation is done in two ways: 

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:17.289
 the species monitored in the natural habitat 'and is also conserved in 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:19.309
 Terms of Use 

00:04:19.309 --> 00:04:20.150
 exist 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.780
 to some ways of doing conservation but in this work we are proposing 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.000
 proposing conservation the farm if conservation is the translation would be 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.689
 farm conservation 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:35.499
 to the conservation of these species in their internal environment on the properties 

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:36.860
 farmers 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.800
 with the form of handling used 100 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.939
 is to interfere in our moments 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:45.499
 going afterwards to do conservation 

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:50.409
 the attitude if material then in addition to already being preserved as farmville 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:57.199
 we collect this material the seeds two living plants it will stop the embrapa 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:03.680
 to conserve live plants or in the greenhouse or seed net in the 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.919
 germplasm bank 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:09.410
 working with the local vegetation conditions the crisis is a 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:11.139
 challenge for the producer 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:15.840
 he must be aware of the management techniques and act in an integrated way with the 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:16.889
 environment 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.389
 the pereira family 'is an example of harmony with ecosystem 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.669
 activities are carried out trying to bring the minimum impact 

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:27.760
 that and we made it very clearly 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.870
 mcqueen where the man lucília part 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.629
 fundamental in conservation 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:37.379
 It's a pity that I think maybe conservation is the 

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:40.409
 conservation of the current resources of the 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.539
 nobody worked side by side the producer and research 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:47.789
 It's a way to bring development up as now. 

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:58.889
 improvements that respect the environment 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:01.889
 1 your people 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.930
 - We're making adjustments for this. 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.099
 Since then it was only in January 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:13.110
 learn from them in a table setting 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.100
 customers will also learn as much as they have so much that they will 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:18.270
 learn 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.990
 according to the agent here has an hour for us to repeat 

00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:31.300
 So young
