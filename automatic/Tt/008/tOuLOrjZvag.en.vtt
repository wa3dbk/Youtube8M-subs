then we're trying to catch them on the
counter<00:01:36.630> attack<00:01:36.689> again<00:01:37.170> he<00:01:37.350> was<00:01:37.500> very<00:01:37.770> very

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
counter attack again he was very very

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.469 
counter attack again he was very very
good<00:01:38.310> at<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.490> game<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.880> go<00:01:39.000> along<00:01:39.240> with<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
good at the game to go along with the

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.240 
good at the game to go along with the
fact<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.750> his<00:01:39.930> team<00:01:40.170> was<00:01:40.350> ridiculously<00:01:41.040> good

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
fact that his team was ridiculously good

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.060 
fact that his team was ridiculously good
it<00:01:41.790> was<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.600> hard<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:42.990> break<00:01:43.290> down<00:01:43.500> defensively

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
it was so hard to break down defensively

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.530 
it was so hard to break down defensively
and<00:01:44.189> when<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.340> did<00:01:44.549> get<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.759> chance<00:01:45.030> like<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.270> I

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
and when I did get a chance like that I

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.090 
and when I did get a chance like that I
had<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.840> kind<00:01:45.990> of<00:01:46.170> soul<00:01:46.380> I<00:01:46.500> run<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.770> because<00:01:46.979> he

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
had to kind of soul I run it because he

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.950 
had to kind of soul I run it because he
was<00:01:47.220> blocking<00:01:47.399> off<00:01:47.729> every<00:01:48.479> single

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
was blocking off every single

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.859 
was blocking off every single
opportunity<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.590> had<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.130> pass<00:01:50.369> because<00:01:51.090> he<00:01:51.540> was

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
opportunity I had to pass because he was

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.359 
opportunity I had to pass because he was
just<00:01:51.990> really<00:01:52.259> really<00:01:52.409> organized<00:01:52.950> at<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.220> back

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
just really really organized at the back

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.980 
just really really organized at the back
I<00:01:53.399> don't<00:01:53.640> know<00:01:53.729> whether<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:54.000> was<00:01:54.030> some<00:01:54.600> custom

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
I don't know whether it was some custom

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.350 
I don't know whether it was some custom
tactics<00:01:55.439> but<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.829> just<00:01:56.280> never<00:01:56.460> had<00:01:56.729> any<00:01:56.909> options

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
bought CF to cam card so he might

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.800 
bought CF to cam card so he might
feature<00:04:05.430> in<00:04:05.670> that<00:04:05.790> role<00:04:06.030> for<00:04:06.480> the<00:04:06.540> next

so<00:04:48.539> once<00:04:48.840> I<00:04:49.050> managed<00:04:49.289> to<00:04:49.349> figure<00:04:49.590> that<00:04:49.800> out<00:04:49.860> I

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
so once I managed to figure that out I

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.760 
so once I managed to figure that out I
actually<00:04:50.669> tried<00:04:51.120> all<00:04:51.509> was<00:04:51.780> able<00:04:52.110> to<00:04:52.259> work<00:04:52.560> to

actually tried all was able to work to
nullify<00:04:52.949> his<00:04:53.280> threats<00:04:53.610> but<00:04:53.759> that<00:04:53.879> wasn't

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
nullify his threats but that wasn't

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.580 
nullify his threats but that wasn't
before<00:04:54.240> he'd<00:04:54.509> already<00:04:54.629> gone<00:04:54.870> one<00:04:55.080> ill<00:04:55.229> up<00:04:55.379> and

before he'd already gone one ill up and

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.159 
before he'd already gone one ill up and
we<00:04:55.800> were<00:04:56.039> so<00:04:56.490> close<00:04:56.789> to<00:04:57.090> coming<00:04:57.360> back<00:04:57.389> to<00:04:57.539> 11<00:04:57.870> in

too far passwords and I couldn't get

too far passwords and I couldn't get
there<00:05:11.580> to<00:05:12.060> cut<00:05:12.240> it<00:05:12.330> back<00:05:12.449> into<00:05:12.719> the<00:05:12.870> the<00:05:13.259> the

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:14.909 
back of the net and Marchetti was going

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:16.339 
back of the net and Marchetti was going
to<00:05:14.969> have<00:05:15.090> another<00:05:15.449> great<00:05:15.780> save<00:05:16.050> from<00:05:16.080> the

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:16.349 
to have another great save from the

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:17.869 
to have another great save from the
following<00:05:16.500> corner<00:05:17.009> as<00:05:17.099> well<00:05:17.129> down<00:05:17.490> low<00:05:17.699> as<00:05:17.849> it

00:05:17.869 --> 00:05:17.879 
following corner as well down low as it

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:19.309 
following corner as well down low as it
was<00:05:18.060> heading<00:05:18.330> into<00:05:18.479> the<00:05:18.690> the<00:05:18.960> bottom<00:05:19.199> corner

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:19.319 
was heading into the the bottom corner

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.140 
was heading into the the bottom corner
of<00:05:19.529> the<00:05:19.590> goal<00:05:19.740> and<00:05:20.219> then<00:05:20.340> he<00:05:20.460> just<00:05:20.490> hoofed<00:05:20.969> it

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
of the goal and then he just hoofed it

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.300 
of the goal and then he just hoofed it
clear<00:05:21.419> out<00:05:21.659> of<00:05:21.719> the<00:05:21.990> out<00:05:22.500> of<00:05:22.590> the<00:05:22.710> defense<00:05:23.069> just

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
clear out of the out of the defense just

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.980 
clear out of the out of the defense just
to<00:05:23.430> make<00:05:23.580> sure<00:05:23.610> that<00:05:24.180> his<00:05:24.300> defense<00:05:24.719> just

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
to make sure that his defense just

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.839 
to make sure that his defense just
regained<00:05:25.409> their<00:05:25.620> positions<00:05:26.129> and<00:05:26.250> there

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:26.849 
regained their positions and there

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:28.459 
regained their positions and there
weren't<00:05:26.969> any<00:05:27.180> gaps<00:05:27.479> in<00:05:27.689> behind<00:05:27.990> his<00:05:28.110> line<00:05:28.289> and

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:28.469 
weren't any gaps in behind his line and

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:29.480 
weren't any gaps in behind his line and
actually<00:05:28.740> that<00:05:28.979> was<00:05:29.159> going<00:05:29.279> to<00:05:29.310> be<00:05:29.400> a

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
actually that was going to be a

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.519 
actually that was going to be a
recurring<00:05:30.000> theme<00:05:30.419> for<00:05:30.689> him<00:05:30.779> whenever<00:05:30.960> he<00:05:31.379> had

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:31.529 
recurring theme for him whenever he had

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:33.320 
recurring theme for him whenever he had
the<00:05:31.650> ball<00:05:31.830> drop<00:05:32.099> free<00:05:32.370> he<00:05:32.789> was<00:05:32.940> going<00:05:33.090> to<00:05:33.150> just

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
the ball drop free he was going to just

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.610 
the ball drop free he was going to just
hoof<00:05:33.599> it<00:05:33.779> like<00:05:33.990> that<00:05:34.139> when<00:05:34.349> there<00:05:34.500> was<00:05:34.590> a

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
hoof it like that when there was a

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.290 
hoof it like that when there was a
little<00:05:34.889> bit<00:05:35.009> of<00:05:35.099> pressure<00:05:35.279> on<00:05:35.430> his<00:05:35.610> goal<00:05:35.819> not

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
little bit of pressure on his goal not

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.619 
little bit of pressure on his goal not
necessarily<00:05:36.779> the<00:05:38.090> cleanest<00:05:39.090> of<00:05:39.270> tactics

00:05:39.619 --> 00:05:39.629 
necessarily the cleanest of tactics

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:40.850 
necessarily the cleanest of tactics
perhaps<00:05:39.840> is<00:05:39.960> a<00:05:40.050> little<00:05:40.259> bit<00:05:40.379> dirty<00:05:40.590> a<00:05:40.770> little

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
perhaps is a little bit dirty a little

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.189 
perhaps is a little bit dirty a little
bit<00:05:41.069> cheap<00:05:41.340> but<00:05:41.969> it<00:05:42.180> was<00:05:42.599> working<00:05:43.110> and

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
bit cheap but it was working and

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:45.079 
bit cheap but it was working and
Marchetti<00:05:43.770> was<00:05:44.039> working<00:05:44.400> as<00:05:44.520> well<00:05:44.639> even<00:05:45.000> after

00:05:45.079 --> 00:05:45.089 
Marchetti was working as well even after

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:47.480 
Marchetti was working as well even after
watching<00:05:45.360> that<00:05:45.569> chance<00:05:46.229> back<00:05:46.560> three<00:05:47.159> four

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
watching that chance back three four

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.300 
watching that chance back three four
five<00:05:47.759> times<00:05:47.819> whilst<00:05:48.479> editing<00:05:48.930> I<00:05:49.050> have<00:05:49.409> no<00:05:49.830> idea
