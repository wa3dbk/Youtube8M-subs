00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.920 
Armenian exotic wave I have four bundles
in<00:00:55.980> my<00:00:56.070> hair<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.430> normally<00:00:56.850> do<00:00:56.969> 24<00:00:57.539> but<00:00:57.809> they're

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
in my hair I normally do 24 but they're

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.099 
in my hair I normally do 24 but they're
out<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:58.859> did<00:00:59.070> one<00:00:59.370> 26<00:00:59.879> to<00:01:00.180> 22s<00:01:00.780> and

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
out of that so I did one 26 to 22s and

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.770 
out of that so I did one 26 to 22s and
120<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.460> was<00:01:02.550> pretty<00:01:02.730> much<00:01:02.850> layered<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.510> did

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
120 so it was pretty much layered I did

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.469 
120 so it was pretty much layered I did
cut<00:01:04.080> like<00:01:04.379> about<00:01:04.680> 3-4<00:01:05.549> inches<00:01:05.700> off<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.119> back

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
cut like about 3-4 inches off the back

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.940 
cut like about 3-4 inches off the back
so<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:06.960> can<00:01:06.990> blend<00:01:07.350> really<00:01:07.590> well

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
so it can blend really well

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.770 
so it can blend really well
plus<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.610> kind<00:01:08.820> of<00:01:08.880> like<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.240> little<00:01:09.390> shorter

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
plus I kind of like it a little shorter

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.690 
plus I kind of like it a little shorter
now<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:09.930> was<00:01:10.409> thinking<00:01:10.650> about<00:01:10.740> even<00:01:11.130> going<00:01:11.280> this

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
now I was thinking about even going this

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.890 
now I was thinking about even going this
length<00:01:12.000> next<00:01:12.360> time<00:01:12.479> what<00:01:12.659> do<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.780> guys<00:01:12.840> think

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
let me know and the lustre it was really

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.300 
let me know and the lustre it was really
really<00:01:15.930> really<00:01:16.140> shiny<00:01:16.470> when<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.680> first<00:01:16.950> got<00:01:17.130> it

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
really really shiny when I first got it

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.399 
really really shiny when I first got it
which<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.580> like<00:01:17.880> because<00:01:18.360> as<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.960> wear<00:01:19.200> your

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
which I like because as you wear your

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.140 
which I like because as you wear your
hair<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.860> starts<00:01:20.159> doling<00:01:20.490> out<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:20.850> it's<00:01:21.000> good

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
hair it starts doling out so it's good

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.390 
hair it starts doling out so it's good
to<00:01:21.270> start<00:01:21.479> shiny<00:01:21.840> after<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.619> colored<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.220> did

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
to start shiny after I colored it it did

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.649 
to start shiny after I colored it it did
lose<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.640> little<00:01:23.880> bit<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.210> luster<00:01:24.509> but

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
lose a little bit of the luster but

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.120 
lose a little bit of the luster but
that's<00:01:24.840> natural<00:01:25.049> because<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.680> bleached<00:01:25.950> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
that's natural because I bleached the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.830 
that's natural because I bleached the

kilt<00:05:04.840> on<00:05:04.960> my<00:05:05.080> wand<00:05:05.320> so<00:05:05.710> it<00:05:05.830> kind<00:05:06.010> of<00:05:06.070> still<00:05:06.340> has

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
kilt on my wand so it kind of still has

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.880 
kilt on my wand so it kind of still has
that<00:05:06.670> you<00:05:07.060> know<00:05:07.150> natural<00:05:07.750> puff<00:05:08.050> to<00:05:08.410> it<00:05:08.590> then

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
the one actually put some heat to it and

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.380

it<00:05:11.050> tames<00:05:11.260> it<00:05:11.440> down<00:05:11.650> so<00:05:12.310> I<00:05:12.610> can<00:05:12.970> probably<00:05:13.120> rock

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
it tames it down so I can probably rock

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.360
