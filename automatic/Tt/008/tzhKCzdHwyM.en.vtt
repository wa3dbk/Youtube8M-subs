00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.549
 but let's continue with your study of the 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:15.230
 first-degree equations with a 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.550
 incognito but in this case we are going to 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.110
 have an equation with terms that are 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:25.520
 fractions we have the following equation 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:28.550
 x over 6 + 5 must be equal to one third 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.439
 minus x as we have terms in 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.910
 fractional representation we must of 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.290
 eliminate or suppress those denominators 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.350
 applying a property that tells us that 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.720
 if both members of an equation are 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.670
 multiply by the same amount the 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:48.109
 equality persists 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.420
 then let's bring the lcm of 6 and 3 and 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:53.210
 the msm we will multiply it by each 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.489
 one of the terms of the equation of the 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.090
 next way then we deliver the 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.090
 mcm 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.800
 d 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.719
 6 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:11.740
 we decompose both numbers 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.950
 63 look for numbers we ask that they be 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.280
 dividers 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.659
 of these numbers we have with him two 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:23.979
 halves 6 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:29.930
 since then it would be the same and then 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:34.280
 third of 3 13 13 the mcm 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:37.490
 in this case it will be 3 by 2 6 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.830
 we have already obtained the msm of those 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.670
 denominators now let's multiply all 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:47.650
 all members of the equation for 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.650
 six as follows 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.770
 6 what multiply 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.820
 x 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.820
 only 16 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.260
 plus 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.370
 what multiply 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:09.910
 to 5 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.910
 must be equal to 6 that multiplies 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:17.780
 one third less 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.780
 is that multiply the X 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:25.340
 simplify in this way the 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:27.920
 named as this is 6 I can 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:35.000
 simplify with this 6 and here I can 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:37.550
 take third third and 31 and 62 with 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.170
 this is removed the denominators 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:45.530
 then the first term that I stay 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:49.700
 only the X 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:54.980
 + 6 x 5 30 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:58.830
 it's the same that I stay here 2 for 1 2 the 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:03.720
 denominator was 1 then we eliminated 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:05.610
 minus six times x is equal to 6 x 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.670
 this way we have turned our 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.500
 fractional equation in an equation 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.900
 whole 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.970
 let's pass all the terms that contain 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.380
 the unknown to the first member of the 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.880
 equation and numbers 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.890
 to the second member of the equation 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.500
 applying the transposition of terms 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.380
 which says the following what adds up to a 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.170
 side of the equation happens to subtract what 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.750
 subtraction goes to the other side to add what 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.990
 multiply happens to live and what divides 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.180
 happens to multiply from first in the 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.080
 first member let's put all the 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.140
 unknowns 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.500
 then the x also blocks 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.330
 completely equal and minus 6 x at 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.880
 second member we're going to move on to the other 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.210
 side 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.980
 how is subtracting happens to add three 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.530
 more days 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.260
 we have no more mystery now let's go 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.629
 the terms 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.390
 new numerical quantities to the second 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:06.090
 member of the equation the dow is in the 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.430
 corresponding side and remains the same but 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.640
 in more 30 you must pass it to the second 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.390
 member and how is adding passes to 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.390
 subtract less 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.810
 we perform these operations x + 6 x is 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.560
 same 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.380
 7 x 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.310
 and 2 minus 30 equals minus 28 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.830
 let's clear like and we have the 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.750
 completely alone the 7 is 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.720
 multiplying the X and what 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.240
 multiply passes to the other side and goes to 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.560
 stay 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:46.990
 - 28 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:51.550
 / / 7 to effect this simplification 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.550
 let's get the value 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:59.139
 and by simplifying this expression 28 and 37 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:59.800
 it will be equal to minus 4 what you want 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:04.569
 tell 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:07.259
 that for this equation the value of x 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:07.259
 4
