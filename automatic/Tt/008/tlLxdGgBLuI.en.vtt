00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.960 
SI unit now this will come in a matching
color<00:01:34.680> but<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.070> one<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.220> thought<00:01:35.460> today<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.820> a

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
color but the one I thought today is a

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.660 
color but the one I thought today is a
different<00:01:36.420> color<00:01:36.710> just<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:38.369> can<00:01:38.520> see

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
different color just so that you can see

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.730 
different color just so that you can see
how<00:01:38.820> it<00:01:38.880> works<00:01:39.060> this<00:01:39.299> Egan<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.720> reversible<00:01:40.229> I'm

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
how it works this Egan is reversible I'm

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.859 
how it works this Egan is reversible I'm
gonna<00:01:40.920> pop<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:41.520> way<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.509> can<00:01:42.570> see

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
gonna pop it on this way so you can see

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:43.999 
gonna pop it on this way so you can see
