 It seems to be a medium that this key corresponds to that + lock key 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.530
 Losing and you are equipped with four casters 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.750

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.050

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.000
 You have 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.000
 And this way there is a hammer 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:37.460
 There was a dreammaster's pace 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.660
 To and 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.660
 Then it will be the key 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:53.400
 Show me not to lose the head one and the key two say yes name should not 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.890
 It is and 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.600
 It is not this 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.980
 It's a band 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.920
 It is with the outer stop band 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.830
 When the airport is something 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.830
 The reason there is a possibility also we'd go more but the band is okay 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:18.670
 There are many greenery at the hotel or when you go home 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.670
 It's time to get out 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:24.070
 Would not it good to go occupy the band 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:27.100
 Movement is also smooth 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.350
 High at worst not caster Pearl 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.719

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.900
 Yes, it is pre-naturally today 

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:39.729
 of 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:42.400
 It is around 6000 yen at this outlet that introduced the suitcase 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:48.759
 We bought super cheap cheaply 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:51.050
 I think that there is a rental service for those who do not use too much, but it is also cheap 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:53.710
 Because it costs money 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:58.600
 Each cheap these things bought 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:00.910
 It's what stage or is is not it have to or reason to say that defeat use 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.370
 I think I will not look for it again 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:07.870
 Zero Hari 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:12.350
 I think there is a way to use something like buying a high-class thing and using it for a long time 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:15.260
 Yes Well the fact that if the sides come into contact with how much people 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:20.120
 And There status ones 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:23.770
 Well , I think it depends on how long and often you go often 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:27.389
 Will 1 is not it a good 10 minutes but cheap to say 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.389
