00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.480 
course and you can see this will SD card
and<00:02:00.120> this<00:02:00.900> is<00:02:01.020> what's<00:02:01.230> a<00:02:01.260> sim<00:02:01.440> card<00:02:01.470> I'm<00:02:02.310> going

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
and this is what's a sim card I'm going

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.980 
and this is what's a sim card I'm going
to<00:02:02.550> show<00:02:02.730> you<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.940> little<00:02:03.180> bit<00:02:03.270> it's<00:02:03.750> kind<00:02:03.960> of

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
to show you a little bit it's kind of

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
doesn't come with any sim card and it

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.240 
doesn't come with any sim card and it
already<00:02:09.360> has<00:02:09.510> SD<00:02:09.840> card<00:02:10.230> which<00:02:10.440> i<00:02:10.560> believe<00:02:10.619> is<00:02:10.890> 2

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
already has SD card which i believe is 2

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.990 
already has SD card which i believe is 2
Giga<00:02:11.490> by<00:02:11.990> so<00:02:12.990> here<00:02:13.260> we<00:02:13.290> go<00:02:13.670> let's<00:02:14.670> put<00:02:14.820> it<00:02:14.880> back

bar<00:04:47.140> flip<00:04:47.740> it<00:04:47.770> guess<00:04:48.490> this<00:04:48.820> this<00:04:49.180> way<00:04:50.160> so<00:04:51.160> here

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
bar flip it guess this this way so here

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.240 
bar flip it guess this this way so here
we<00:04:51.430> go<00:04:51.510> turning<00:04:52.510> the<00:04:52.630> page<00:04:52.920> the<00:04:53.920> screen<00:04:54.220> is
