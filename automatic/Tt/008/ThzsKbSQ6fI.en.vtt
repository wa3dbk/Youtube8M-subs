blonde we could put a honey blonde on my

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.930 
blonde we could put a honey blonde on my
current<00:00:43.020> wand<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:44.309> would<00:00:44.460> give<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.670> that

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
current wand and it would give it that

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.700 
current wand and it would give it that
because<00:00:45.300> that's<00:00:45.450> what<00:00:45.510> toner<00:00:45.930> has<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.289> changes

because that's what toner has it changes

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.940 
because that's what toner has it changes
the<00:00:46.890> tone<00:00:47.160> of<00:00:47.430> hair<00:00:48.050> if<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.320> was<00:00:49.469> too<00:00:49.710> dark

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
the tone of hair if that was too dark

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.459 
the tone of hair if that was too dark
I've<00:00:50.520> always<00:00:51.180> told<00:00:51.390> people<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.809> use<00:00:51.960> dawn

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
I've always told people to use dawn

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.540 
I've always told people to use dawn
because<00:00:53.250> it's<00:00:53.489> gentle<00:00:53.760> enough<00:00:54.000> for<00:00:54.210> penguin

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
because it's gentle enough for penguin

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.299 
because it's gentle enough for penguin
so<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:57.210> was<00:00:57.629> taught<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:58.109> in<00:00:58.309> cosmetology

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
so I was taught this in cosmetology

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.340 
so I was taught this in cosmetology
school<00:00:59.550> but<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.760> never<00:01:00.120> actually<00:01:00.480> tried<00:01:00.989> it

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
school but I never actually tried it

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.700 
school but I never actually tried it
this<00:01:01.829> does<00:01:02.100> not<00:01:02.309> list<00:01:02.699> out<00:01:02.940> what<00:01:03.359> all<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.500> it

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
this does not list out what all is in it

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.030 
this does not list out what all is in it
I<00:01:04.949> know<00:01:05.339> there<00:01:05.700> are<00:01:05.750> surfactants<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:06.869> it

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
I know there are surfactants in it

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.330 
I know there are surfactants in it
because<00:01:08.040> that's<00:01:08.790> what<00:01:09.210> dish<00:01:10.140> soap<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:11.010> all

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
because that's what dish soap is all

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.149 
because that's what dish soap is all
about<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:12.540> probably<00:01:12.960> full<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.830> bunch<00:01:14.040> of

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
about it's probably full of a bunch of

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.920 
about it's probably full of a bunch of
things<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.970> personally<00:01:15.030> would<00:01:15.780> not

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
things that I personally would not

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.749 
things that I personally would not
approve<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.560> washing<00:01:16.950> my<00:01:17.070> hair<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.520> all<00:01:17.640> the

approve of washing my hair and all the

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.300 
approve of washing my hair and all the
time<00:01:17.970> because<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.420> know<00:01:18.570> I'm<00:01:18.810> not<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:19.439> sulfate

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
time because you know I'm not a sulfate

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.060 
time because you know I'm not a sulfate
girl<00:01:20.600> but<00:01:21.600> when<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:22.110> comes<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.590> trying<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.920> get

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
girl but when it comes to trying to get

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.060 
girl but when it comes to trying to get
color<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:24.030> fade<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:25.290> got<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.680> do<00:01:25.799> something

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
color to fade you got to do something

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.140 
color to fade you got to do something
rough<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.840> tested<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:28.829> out<00:01:29.070> just<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.850> see

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
rough so I tested this out just to see

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.069 
rough so I tested this out just to see
if<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.630> myth<00:01:30.840> was<00:01:31.140> true<00:01:31.530> on<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:33.060> bag<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.659> says

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
if the myth was true on the bag it says

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.010 
if the myth was true on the bag it says
it<00:01:34.259> contains<00:01:34.380> no<00:01:34.860> phosphate<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.810> has

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
it contains no phosphate that that has

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.499 
it contains no phosphate that that has
nothing<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.409> do<00:01:37.590> with<00:01:37.619> sulfates<00:01:38.189> I'm<00:01:39.000> pretty

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
nothing to do with sulfates I'm pretty

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.840 
nothing to do with sulfates I'm pretty
sure<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.960> probably<00:01:40.439> has<00:01:40.619> sulfates<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.369> but

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
sure it probably has sulfates in it but

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.929 
sure it probably has sulfates in it but
the<00:01:41.970> point<00:01:42.210> being<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.840> took<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.799> with<00:01:44.490> me<00:01:44.700> in

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
the point being I took this with me in

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.030 
the point being I took this with me in
the<00:01:45.060> shower<00:01:45.299> last<00:01:45.810> night<00:01:46.110> when<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.380> wash<00:01:46.799> my

washing<00:02:05.810> it<00:02:06.140> two<00:02:06.350> times<00:02:06.649> with<00:02:06.950> this<00:02:07.159> in<00:02:07.369> the

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
washing it two times with this in the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.029 
washing it two times with this in the
shower<00:02:07.750> but<00:02:08.750> it<00:02:08.869> has<00:02:09.019> helped<00:02:09.349> it<00:02:09.440> a<00:02:09.500> little<00:02:09.769> bit

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
shower but it has helped it a little bit

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.160 
shower but it has helped it a little bit
so<00:02:10.670> I'm<00:02:10.849> thinking<00:02:11.269> that<00:02:11.300> this<00:02:11.480> stuff<00:02:11.840> probably

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
so I'm thinking that this stuff probably

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.259 
so I'm thinking that this stuff probably
once<00:02:12.680> you<00:02:12.800> do<00:02:12.950> it<00:02:13.069> several<00:02:13.340> times<00:02:13.730> it'll

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
once you do it several times it'll

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:15.820 
once you do it several times it'll
definitely<00:02:14.450> help<00:02:14.900> if<00:02:15.140> you're<00:02:15.290> trying<00:02:15.530> to<00:02:15.590> get

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
definitely help if you're trying to get

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.460 
definitely help if you're trying to get
out<00:02:15.980> an<00:02:16.129> unnatural<00:02:16.849> color<00:02:17.090> because<00:02:17.870> unnatural

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
out an unnatural color because unnatural

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.770 
out an unnatural color because unnatural
colors<00:02:18.860> are<00:02:19.220> not<00:02:19.610> permanent<00:02:20.330> because<00:02:20.629> they

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
colors are not permanent because they

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.360 
colors are not permanent because they
can't<00:02:20.989> make<00:02:21.290> them<00:02:21.560> permanent<00:02:21.769> that's<00:02:22.129> why<00:02:22.310> you

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
can't make them permanent that's why you

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.460 
can't make them permanent that's why you
have<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:22.700> lift<00:02:22.879> your<00:02:23.000> hair<00:02:23.299> that<00:02:24.140> can<00:02:24.349> be<00:02:24.440> a

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
have to lift your hair that can be a

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.740 
have to lift your hair that can be a
whole<00:02:24.650> nother<00:02:24.890> video<00:02:25.280> I'm<00:02:25.790> trying<00:02:26.269> to<00:02:26.510> avoid

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
whole nother video I'm trying to avoid

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.020 
whole nother video I'm trying to avoid
using<00:02:27.470> more<00:02:27.739> bleach<00:02:28.010> on<00:02:28.220> my<00:02:28.549> ends<00:02:28.879> because

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
using more bleach on my ends because

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.589 
using more bleach on my ends because
they're<00:02:29.360> just<00:02:29.540> already<00:02:29.900> so<00:02:30.110> sad<00:02:30.379> as<00:02:30.739> it<00:02:31.040> is<00:02:31.599> but

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:32.599 
they're just already so sad as it is but

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.759 
they're just already so sad as it is but
this<00:02:32.989> is<00:02:33.260> definitely<00:02:34.360> helping<00:02:35.360> some<00:02:35.900> so

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
this is definitely helping some so

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.520 
this is definitely helping some so
between<00:02:37.069> now<00:02:37.849> and<00:02:37.910> when<00:02:38.780> I<00:02:38.840> get<00:02:39.049> my<00:02:39.170> hair<00:02:39.349> down

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
between now and when I get my hair down

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.920 
between now and when I get my hair down
at<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:39.829> end<00:02:39.950> of<00:02:40.069> this<00:02:40.160> week<00:02:40.430> I'm<00:02:41.030> going<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:41.630> be

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
at the end of this week I'm going to be

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.380 
at the end of this week I'm going to be
washing<00:02:42.200> it<00:02:42.590> with<00:02:42.739> this<00:02:43.040> just<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:43.849> try<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:44.120> get

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
washing it with this just to try and get

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.180 
washing it with this just to try and get
it<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:44.660> fade<00:02:44.840> a<00:02:44.870> little<00:02:45.260> bit<00:02:45.379> more<00:02:45.680> I<00:02:45.950> don't

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
it to fade a little bit more I don't

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.600 
it to fade a little bit more I don't
think<00:02:46.790> that<00:02:46.940> this<00:02:47.090> should<00:02:47.299> be<00:02:47.329> a<00:02:47.420> go-to<00:02:47.660> for

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
think that this should be a go-to for

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.309 
think that this should be a go-to for
unnatural<00:02:49.610> hair<00:02:50.000> colors<00:02:50.360> to<00:02:50.540> get<00:02:50.660> their<00:02:50.870> color

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
unnatural hair colors to get their color

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.680 
unnatural hair colors to get their color
out<00:02:51.620> I<00:02:52.099> definitely<00:02:53.000> think<00:02:53.180> that<00:02:53.269> this<00:02:53.480> would

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
out I definitely think that this would

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.759 
out I definitely think that this would
probably<00:02:53.900> help<00:02:54.560> make<00:02:55.099> the<00:02:55.959> toner<00:02:56.959> fade<00:02:57.440> back

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
probably help make the toner fade back

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.880 
probably help make the toner fade back
but<00:02:58.610> then<00:02:58.790> again<00:02:58.970> you<00:02:59.690> can<00:02:59.840> also<00:03:00.019> probably<00:03:00.470> do

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
but then again you can also probably do

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.440 
but then again you can also probably do
that<00:03:01.069> with<00:03:01.129> just<00:03:01.579> some<00:03:01.760> cheap<00:03:02.120> drugstore

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
that with just some cheap drugstore

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.050 
that with just some cheap drugstore
shampoo<00:03:03.079> has<00:03:03.349> sulfates<00:03:03.829> in<00:03:03.950> it<00:03:04.099> I'm<00:03:04.370> learning

but<00:03:51.379> I<00:03:51.830> am<00:03:52.640> trying<00:03:53.060> to<00:03:53.510> figure<00:03:53.750> out<00:03:54.140> if<00:03:54.439> I

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
but I am trying to figure out if I

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.860 
but I am trying to figure out if I
should<00:03:54.650> do<00:03:55.069> the<00:03:55.250> routed<00:03:55.700> look<00:03:55.939> or<00:03:56.480> if<00:03:56.750> I<00:03:56.840> should

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
should do the routed look or if I should
