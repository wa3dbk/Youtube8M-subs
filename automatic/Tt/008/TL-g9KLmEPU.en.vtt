go back to the text document sorry then

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.420 
go back to the text document sorry then
you<00:02:16.870> should<00:02:17.019> see<00:02:17.200> a<00:02:17.409> jar<00:02:17.680> CraftBukkit

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
you should see a jar CraftBukkit

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.250 
you should see a jar CraftBukkit
highlight<00:02:19.030> where<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.239> says<00:02:19.390> craft<00:02:19.810> book<00:02:20.049> it

highlight where it says craft book it

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.059 
highlight where it says craft book it
and<00:02:20.610> then<00:02:21.610> just<00:02:21.819> paste<00:02:22.390> over<00:02:23.040> make<00:02:24.040> sure

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.300 
and then just paste over make sure
there's<00:02:24.430> no<00:02:24.549> space<00:02:24.909> there<00:02:25.480> I'll<00:02:26.290> make<00:02:27.159> sure

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
there's no space there I'll make sure

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.820 
there's no space there I'll make sure
there's<00:02:27.489> a<00:02:27.580> space<00:02:27.819> there<00:02:28.299> so<00:02:29.019> then<00:02:29.500> you<00:02:29.620> lose

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
there's a space there so then you lose

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.839 
there's a space there so then you lose
just<00:02:30.160> file<00:02:31.379> save<00:02:32.379> as<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:32.590> then<00:02:32.890> you<00:02:33.670> want<00:02:33.819> to

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.580 
world so I'm just going to get ready to
join<00:03:12.609> my<00:03:12.819> own<00:03:12.940> server<00:03:14.190> if<00:03:15.190> you're<00:03:15.879> on<00:03:16.060> a<00:03:16.590> 64-bit

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
join my own server if you're on a 64-bit

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.789 
join my own server if you're on a 64-bit
machine<00:03:18.239> then<00:03:19.239> do<00:03:19.599> what<00:03:19.720> it<00:03:19.810> says<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:20.230> note<00:03:20.590> if

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
machine then do what it says the note if

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.920 
machine then do what it says the note if
you<00:03:20.829> are<00:03:21.010> running<00:03:21.099> on<00:03:21.370> Java<00:03:21.609> 32-bit<00:03:22.389> mold<00:03:22.630> on<00:03:22.870> a

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
you are running on Java 32-bit mold on a

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.990 
you are running on Java 32-bit mold on a
64-bit<00:03:23.380> machine<00:03:23.709> you've<00:03:23.950> got<00:03:24.069> to<00:03:24.160> change<00:03:24.400> that

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
64-bit machine you've got to change that

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.930 
64-bit machine you've got to change that
to<00:03:25.269> that<00:03:25.540> so<00:03:25.810> if<00:03:25.900> you're<00:03:26.019> on<00:03:26.109> 64-bit<00:03:26.919> make<00:03:27.819> sure

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
to that so if you're on 64-bit make sure

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.210 
to that so if you're on 64-bit make sure
you<00:03:28.090> have<00:03:28.299> percent<00:03:28.989> program<00:03:29.440> files<00:03:29.739> if<00:03:30.069> you're

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
you have percent program files if you're

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.460 
you have percent program files if you're
on<00:03:30.340> 64<00:03:31.000> if<00:03:31.299> you<00:03:31.389> want<00:03:31.540> talk<00:03:31.660> to<00:03:31.870> bit<00:03:32.819> x86<00:03:34.139> so<00:03:35.139> it

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
on 64 if you want talk to bit x86 so it

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.180 
on 64 if you want talk to bit x86 so it
should<00:03:35.769> that<00:03:36.459> bit<00:03:36.849> there<00:03:37.060> should<00:03:37.480> change<00:03:38.190> well

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
should that bit there should change well

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.750 
should that bit there should change well
that<00:03:39.489> will<00:03:39.579> go<00:03:39.730> in<00:03:39.819> the<00:03:39.970> end<00:03:40.090> or<00:03:41.519> so<00:03:42.519> now<00:03:42.609> I'll

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
that will go in the end or so now I'll

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.580 
that will go in the end or so now I'll
