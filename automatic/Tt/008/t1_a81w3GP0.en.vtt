00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.360 
haven't seen him before I guess I could
show<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.390> little<00:02:09.479> gameplay<00:02:09.840> after<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.739> just<00:02:11.280> a

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
show a little gameplay after of just a

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.900 
show a little gameplay after of just a
little<00:02:11.459> bit<00:02:11.610> of<00:02:11.760> crushing<00:02:12.180> action

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
little bit of crushing action

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.080 
little bit of crushing action
I<00:02:13.080> got<00:02:14.080> up<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.350> like<00:02:14.500> 4000<00:02:15.280> damage<00:02:15.460> on<00:02:15.940> some

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
I got up to like 4000 damage on some

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.110 
I got up to like 4000 damage on some
corpus<00:02:16.600> with<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.990> focus<00:02:17.790> I've<00:02:18.790> gotten<00:02:19.060> a

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
corpus with the focus I've gotten a

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.360 
corpus with the focus I've gotten a
little<00:02:19.240> bit<00:02:19.390> higher<00:02:19.570> before<00:02:19.810> but<00:02:20.350> other<00:02:21.040> than

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
little bit higher before but other than

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.280 
little bit higher before but other than
Nyx's<00:02:21.790> absorbed<00:02:22.300> I<00:02:22.390> mean<00:02:22.570> she<00:02:22.810> has<00:02:22.930> one<00:02:23.140> of<00:02:23.170> the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
Nyx's absorbed I mean she has one of the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.110 
Nyx's absorbed I mean she has one of the
higher<00:02:23.470> all<00:02:23.740> Tia's<00:02:24.900> like<00:02:25.900> her<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:26.470> Moab

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
higher all Tia's like her and Moab

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.530 
higher all Tia's like her and Moab
miasma<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:28.270> sarin<00:02:28.710> really<00:02:29.710> nice<00:02:29.860> all<00:02:30.100> these

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
miasma and sarin really nice all these

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.740 
miasma and sarin really nice all these
so<00:02:31.540> you<00:02:32.230> know<00:02:32.350> fast<00:02:32.650> deflection<00:02:33.330> put<00:02:34.330> that<00:02:34.540> in

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
so you know fast deflection put that in

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.110 
so you know fast deflection put that in
there<00:02:35.220> once<00:02:36.220> you<00:02:36.340> get<00:02:36.490> good<00:02:36.640> enough<00:02:36.820> you<00:02:37.030> know

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
there once you get good enough you know

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.640 
there once you get good enough you know
you<00:02:37.150> won't<00:02:37.360> need<00:02:37.540> a<00:02:37.600> fast<00:02:37.900> deflection<00:02:38.470> either

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
you won't need a fast deflection either

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.710 
you won't need a fast deflection either
and<00:02:41.460> that's<00:02:42.460> pretty<00:02:42.790> much<00:02:42.970> it<00:02:43.210> for<00:02:43.360> her<00:02:43.480> that's

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
and that's pretty much it for her that's

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.810 
and that's pretty much it for her that's
pretty<00:02:43.960> much<00:02:44.050> all<00:02:44.230> around<00:02:44.530> her<00:02:45.100> defense<00:02:45.550> bill

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
pretty much all around her defense bill

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.060 
pretty much all around her defense bill
plenty<00:02:46.690> energy<00:02:47.140> got<00:02:47.380> streamlined<00:02:47.830> flow

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
plenty energy got streamlined flow

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.070 
plenty energy got streamlined flow
you'll<00:02:48.370> be<00:02:48.520> able<00:02:48.580> to<00:02:48.760> just<00:02:49.630> be<00:02:49.780> you'll

you'll be able to just be you'll

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.440 
you'll be able to just be you'll
basically<00:02:50.530> just<00:02:50.740> be<00:02:50.950> smashing<00:02:51.880> like<00:02:52.470> huge

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
basically just be smashing like huge

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.480 
basically just be smashing like huge
