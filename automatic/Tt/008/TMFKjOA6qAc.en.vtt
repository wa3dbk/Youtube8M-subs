00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
either way the cables would just be

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.859 
either way the cables would just be
plugged<00:02:01.829> in<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.070> same<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.820> microphone<00:02:03.659> is

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
working is actually a little more

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.690 
working is actually a little more
complicated<00:02:14.260> than<00:02:14.500> you'd<00:02:14.769> think<00:02:14.799> to<00:02:15.159> get<00:02:15.640> the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
complicated than you'd think to get the

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.580 
complicated than you'd think to get the
correct<00:02:16.120> audio<00:02:16.390> you<00:02:17.080> should<00:02:17.230> actually<00:02:17.349> get

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
correct audio you should actually get

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:18.869 
correct audio you should actually get
one<00:02:17.709> of<00:02:17.799> these<00:02:17.890> things<00:02:18.220> here<00:02:18.519> which<00:02:18.640> is<00:02:18.790> an

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
one of these things here which is an

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.670 
one of these things here which is an
audio<00:02:19.090> splitter<00:02:19.569> a<00:02:19.900> lot<00:02:20.140> of<00:02:20.200> people<00:02:20.379> use<00:02:20.530> these

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
audio splitter a lot of people use these

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.460 
audio splitter a lot of people use these
for<00:02:20.739> music<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:21.400> stuff<00:02:21.580> like<00:02:21.670> that<00:02:21.849> so

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
for music and stuff like that so

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.960 
for music and stuff like that so
basically<00:02:23.470> you're<00:02:24.459> gonna<00:02:24.519> plug<00:02:24.730> this<00:02:24.909> thing

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
basically you're gonna plug this thing

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.850 
basically you're gonna plug this thing
into<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.989> audio<00:02:26.260> jack<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.470> all<00:02:26.709> it<00:02:26.769> really

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
into the audio jack and all it really

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.979 
into the audio jack and all it really
does<00:02:27.040> is<00:02:27.099> gives<00:02:27.400> you<00:02:27.489> two<00:02:27.819> outputs<00:02:28.360> one<00:02:28.840> of<00:02:28.930> the

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
does is gives you two outputs one of the

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.289 
does is gives you two outputs one of the
outputs<00:02:29.349> you're<00:02:29.620> gonna<00:02:29.709> get<00:02:29.860> an<00:02:30.099> audio<00:02:30.849> cable

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
outputs you're gonna get an audio cable

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.470 
outputs you're gonna get an audio cable
that<00:02:31.329> has<00:02:31.769> two<00:02:32.769> plus<00:02:33.340> positive<00:02:33.940> ends<00:02:34.299> or

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
that has two plus positive ends or

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.910 
that has two plus positive ends or
whatever<00:02:34.690> heck<00:02:34.810> you<00:02:34.900> call<00:02:35.110> them<00:02:35.260> goes<00:02:35.890> down

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
whatever heck you call them goes down

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.949 
whatever heck you call them goes down
through<00:02:36.489> all<00:02:36.610> this<00:02:36.730> cable<00:02:37.090> you<00:02:37.120> stuff<00:02:37.329> and<00:02:37.690> it

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
through all this cable you stuff and it

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.750 
through all this cable you stuff and it
goes<00:02:38.140> into<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:40.480> camera<00:02:41.230> okay<00:02:41.620> now<00:02:42.519> only

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
goes into the camera okay now only

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.400 
goes into the camera okay now only
certain<00:02:43.150> cameras<00:02:43.480> will<00:02:43.629> give<00:02:43.780> you<00:02:43.930> really

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
certain cameras will give you really

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
certain cameras will give you really
good<00:02:44.560> quality<00:02:44.769> you're<00:02:45.040> just<00:02:45.160> gonna<00:02:45.250> have<00:02:45.370> to

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
good quality you're just gonna have to

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:46.740 
good quality you're just gonna have to
test<00:02:45.700> and<00:02:45.910> see<00:02:46.060> if<00:02:46.150> it<00:02:46.239> works

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
test and see if it works

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.020 
test and see if it works
my<00:02:47.319> last<00:02:47.620> one<00:02:47.859> didn't<00:02:48.190> for<00:02:48.459> some<00:02:48.489> reason<00:02:48.940> this

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
my last one didn't for some reason this

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.610 
my last one didn't for some reason this
one<00:02:49.090> does<00:02:49.390> I'm<00:02:49.629> not<00:02:49.900> questioning<00:02:50.079> it<00:02:50.379> so

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
one does I'm not questioning it so

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.470 
one does I'm not questioning it so
whatever<00:02:51.160> it<00:02:51.640> works<00:02:51.910> and<00:02:52.060> it's<00:02:52.150> so<00:02:52.359> much

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
whatever it works and it's so much

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.229 
whatever it works and it's so much
easier<00:02:52.840> than<00:02:52.959> doing<00:02:53.260> live<00:02:53.680> video<00:02:54.160> output<00:02:54.640> from

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
easier than doing live video output from

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.759 
easier than doing live video output from
the<00:02:55.359> camera<00:02:55.690> it's<00:02:55.870> really<00:02:55.959> difficult<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.650> do

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
the camera it's really difficult to do

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:57.899 
the camera it's really difficult to do
that<00:02:56.890> I've<00:02:57.010> tried<00:02:57.220> doing<00:02:57.370> it<00:02:57.519> with<00:02:57.609> several

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:57.909 
that I've tried doing it with several

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:59.759 
that I've tried doing it with several
different<00:02:58.329> cameras<00:02:59.109> and<00:02:59.140> it<00:02:59.349> just<00:02:59.530> doesn't

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
different cameras and it just doesn't

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.460 
different cameras and it just doesn't
work<00:03:00.750> some<00:03:01.750> of<00:03:01.780> them<00:03:01.930> will<00:03:02.019> do<00:03:02.140> it<00:03:02.260> if<00:03:02.349> they

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
work some of them will do it if they

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.899 
work some of them will do it if they
have<00:03:02.650> a<00:03:02.680> believe<00:03:03.129> it's<00:03:03.250> called<00:03:03.370> a<00:03:03.400> firewire

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
have a believe it's called a firewire

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.599 
have a believe it's called a firewire

this<00:03:06.730> is<00:03:06.790> I'm<00:03:07.090> using<00:03:07.269> right<00:03:07.540> here<00:03:07.690> and<00:03:07.870> I<00:03:07.930> was

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
this is I'm using right here and I was

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.930 
this is I'm using right here and I was
using<00:03:08.200> an<00:03:08.349> older<00:03:08.560> version<00:03:08.709> in<00:03:09.280> my<00:03:09.400> last<00:03:09.579> videos

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940

using an older version in my last videos
those<00:03:10.720> do<00:03:11.379> not<00:03:11.620> have<00:03:11.829> a<00:03:11.859> firewire<00:03:12.340> but<00:03:12.579> you<00:03:12.670> can

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:12.909 
those do not have a firewire but you can

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.030 
those do not have a firewire but you can
do<00:03:13.120> it<00:03:13.269> with<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:13.930> new<00:03:14.079> one<00:03:14.230> by<00:03:14.379> the<00:03:14.440> way<00:03:14.590> if<00:03:14.859> you

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
do it with the new one by the way if you

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.460 
do it with the new one by the way if you

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:56.199 
is because one is for recording the

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:58.409 
is because one is for recording the
other<00:03:56.349> is<00:03:56.530> so<00:03:56.680> that<00:03:56.799> you<00:03:56.889> can<00:03:57.040> hear<00:03:57.280> it<00:03:57.419> with

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
down on here so it's a little less
