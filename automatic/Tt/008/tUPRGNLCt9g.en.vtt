be really exciting all those games

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.100 
be really exciting all those games
probably<00:01:06.150> back-to-back<00:01:06.689> will<00:01:06.810> take<00:01:06.960> us

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
probably back-to-back will take us

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.620 
probably back-to-back will take us
nearly<00:01:07.650> 20<00:01:08.040> hours<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.580> estimate<00:01:08.909> then

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
nearly 20 hours is the estimate then

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.480 
nearly 20 hours is the estimate then
likely<00:01:10.049> on<00:01:10.200> another<00:01:10.530> TV<00:01:10.799> we're<00:01:11.100> going<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.369> have

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
likely on another TV we're going to have

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.010 
likely on another TV we're going to have
Super<00:01:11.820> Mario<00:01:12.000> Sunshine<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.720> after<00:01:12.900> that's

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
Super Mario Sunshine and after that's

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.690 
Super Mario Sunshine and after that's
done<00:01:13.260> we're<00:01:13.439> gonna<00:01:13.530> play<00:01:13.799> Super<00:01:14.250> Mario<00:01:14.280> Galaxy

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
done we're gonna play Super Mario Galaxy

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.120 
done we're gonna play Super Mario Galaxy
on<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.720> separate<00:01:16.170> TV<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.530> third<00:01:16.740> TV<00:01:17.040> we're

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
on a separate TV the third TV we're

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.230 
on a separate TV the third TV we're
gonna<00:01:17.220> be<00:01:17.340> playing<00:01:17.549> Super<00:01:17.759> Mario<00:01:17.880> Galaxy<00:01:18.210> 2

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
gonna be playing Super Mario Galaxy 2

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.149 
gonna be playing Super Mario Galaxy 2
that's<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.689> really<00:01:18.960> long<00:01:19.170> game<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.680> then<00:01:20.070> I

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
that's a really long game and then I

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.620 
that's a really long game and then I
think<00:01:20.460> maybe<00:01:20.640> on<00:01:20.850> another<00:01:21.119> TV<00:01:21.330> we're<00:01:21.540> gonna

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
think maybe on another TV we're gonna

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.060 
think maybe on another TV we're gonna
have<00:01:21.810> new<00:01:21.900> Super<00:01:22.140> Mario<00:01:22.320> Bros<00:01:22.470> Wii<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.979> then

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
have new Super Mario Bros Wii and then

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.649 
have new Super Mario Bros Wii and then
when<00:01:23.220> that's<00:01:23.310> done<00:01:23.549> new<00:01:23.700> super<00:01:23.970> mario<00:01:24.210> bros<00:01:24.420> at

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
when that's done new super mario bros at

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.960 
when that's done new super mario bros at
you<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.080> then<00:01:25.560> perhaps<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.340> fifth<00:01:26.580> TV

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
you and then perhaps on the fifth TV

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.969 
you and then perhaps on the fifth TV
maybe<00:01:27.330> six<00:01:27.689> TVs<00:01:27.840> we'll<00:01:28.080> see<00:01:28.200> what<00:01:28.320> we<00:01:28.409> do<00:01:28.590> we

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979
