 selected a lot a lot of books 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.689

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.720
 will introduce you

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.079
 first two weeks of May 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.730
 but they are still your meals 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.440
 so I do not know too much at worst I'm 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.760
 not pay too much pressure and I'm going 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.870
 start right now I do not take myself 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.219
 not in the ain in which I 'm going him 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.200
 to say I really do not put pressure 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.239
 I take them in the ballot box in order 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.739
 in which intel so a book that I 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.780
 really want to read this month this is the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.730
 infinite sea is the second volume of the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.510
 fifth wave rick the published in 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.699
 robert laffont 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.320
 in their air collection and it costs to 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.530
 18 euros I had found used to 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.579
 gibert joseph I was delighted then at that 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.739
 was a moment that I was waiting and 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.329
 yet I still have not read but I 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.430
 do not know why this novel I was 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.170
 convinced that I had to read it 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.180
 in the month of May then go to know 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.619
 why but this is the kind of book I 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.880
 do not know you know in a wood where 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.320
 you are obliged to read this book 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.760
 and yet there is nothing special 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.799
 named but I told myself I must 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.090
 read in May but I'm not too much 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.170
 that he does in the fifth wave of which 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.860
 I will not read it again because it was 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.720
 a huge pavement 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.320
 I will watch them on the internet 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.939
 think tea summary well it's not him 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.920
 launches you know on a site that 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.570
 is called their cape times free cape 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.070
 town it's a bit hard to pronounce and 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.930
 big you have someone who does all 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.970
 the summaries of plenty of books actually 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.170
 that awesome I put you in barda times 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.430
 if you're interested because it's 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.140
 really very very friendly 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.189
 in fact here it tells you exactly what 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.960
 is happening this chapter by chapter 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.640
 how does it end it boosts not had 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.610
 all my seven goals because you 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.960
 looking for a summary well spoil ans 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.590
 so I heard a lot of opinions 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.909
 negative 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.100
 we will see what it will give but 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.280
 I'm a little worried he's 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.590
 long enough and more than 400 pages 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.210
 is it going and it created these corals 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.710
 so that will go 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.240
 really ask what is it going to give it 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.220
 must then that I continue the second 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.200
 tome so awakeners elsewhere from 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.880
 pauline alphen published in hatchet in 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.800
 their collection the paperback 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.940
 youth is really I can not wait to 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.440
 read them because I was going first 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.690
 tome in january I had adored her 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.700
 it put a crush I saw 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.959
 friends a little less positive about this second 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.300
 tome I hope it'll go 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.160
 it is not very long it is 350 pages 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.730
 and I think that since it's the only 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.739
 little book of makila read among the 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.000
 early mid May I think it's him that 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.220
 I would take everywhere with me in the 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.570
 public transport that I will say 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.760
 when I 'm in transport because 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.560
 that he will be the most transportable 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.110
 and yes I also read the first 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.850
 Volume 2 to gender diana gabaldon published 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.860
 here at home I read so this is the first 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.660
 volume that joins the first integral 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.310
 not that of tom inside on the 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.769
 thirteen as there are two she costs 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.630
 16 euros so I hear so much 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.890
 so much talked about I confess that 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.050
 I had read the first 100 pages on 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.190
 my reader I had not specially 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:04.050
 hung I do not know too much but I 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.180
 am only he is the beginning of the summary 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.280
 of volume 2 and I must say that it has me 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.140
 comforted in the idea of ​​reading it past 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.769
 something that bothered me but suddenly 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.540
 it's better 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.610
 here I am really looking forward to 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.840
 rediscover the first 100 pages 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.920
 and then to immerse myself in this 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.630
 history because apparently it's a 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.640
 favorite for everyone so we 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.510
 will see well and I have never really read of 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.950
 historical books 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.140
 so it can be really very very 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.120
 nice I realize that I was doing 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.060
 not even presented the summary it's 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.670
 the story of clear here's that goes into 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.680
 vacation with her husband that she does not have 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.880
 seen from since the beginning of the second 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.900
 world war because it's happening in 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.730
 1945 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.620
 I am not at all clear I hope 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.510
 it will go well in short they 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.340
 go on vacation to Scotland and there 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.420
 she is going to be dolmen stones I 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.620
 believe that's called or menhirs of 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:52.230
 area of ​​minors I do not know anymore and 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:54.390
 it is a bleeding megalith of germany 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.130
 and improves its megaliths and basically 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.320
 she will touch the stones and the 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:02.820
 transport in 1743 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:06.140
 in the fight between the highlanders 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.640
 and English from English the English and 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.260
 it's really very nice this universe the 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.270
 series came out and it looks like the 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.440
 series makes a cardboard so should when 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.760
 even as I catch up on it he has 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.680
 already a dozen episodes of release 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.070
 but here I am really looking forward to 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.510
 discover 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.850
 I want to read also in reading 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.710
 common with divine treki chain 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.480
 there is a stop at borwell reindeer park 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.430
 publishes at pocket youth and I 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.840
 wanted already presented in my in my 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.490
 reading pile of the month of April but I do not 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.200
 do not think we'll start in April 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.320
 because we are already so I'm talking to you 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.670
 the 26th and I still have books to read 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.220
 so I do not think I would have the 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.780
 time but here I really count 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.670
 read this one the beginning after another 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.070
 pavement that I must read is volume 3 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.480
 lunar chronicles created and created by 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.900
 marissa meyer is published in not one 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:51.030
 pocket youth by good I find the 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.230
 very very beautiful cover even if I 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.090
 am pretty disappointed that they have changed by 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.290
 compared to salt to that anglophone that 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.090
 I find really very nice by their 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:00.120
 symbolic but there is really a 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:03.780
 very nice work here we will follow the 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:06.030
 answer account and season with the blues 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.980
 blur of the lady is the same 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.560
 really the best of the three he is 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:13.830
 really long it is 6,160 pages 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.380
 there is really huge i hope mam 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.090
 polar I think it's still the 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.830
 better but even suggesting fear of 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.000
 read I confess you but here we will see 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.010
 well I saw full full of opinion 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.330
 positive lunar chronicles you 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.230
 must know it now it's a 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.860
 account rewriting 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:32.250
 in science fiction reaction that's the 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.960
 first concerned cinderella with cinder 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.320
 second scarlett with the little chaperone 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.240
 red 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.770
 and here we have an answer and I can not wait to 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.510
 discover this volume here I am so I think 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.130
 that it will be all for this beginning of the month 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.419
 of may knowing that partial ja on the 13th 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:45.600
 so I would not necessarily have a lot 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:47.280
 for the time to read but that's when 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.290
 even a lot because casually 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.930
 it's still big cobblestone 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:55.710
 made six years 110 pages outlander he in 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.910
 is over 850 so that's when 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.620
 even big groups had not handed 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.850
 this and I will link the seven volumes 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.140
 from Harry Potter or there I show you 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.530
 this one I do not have to show the 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.450
 seven 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:06.510
 because I have them I do not know if 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:09.030
 you see it but there in large format and 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.200
 I have almost all in small finally I 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.070
 find them because here's me this after 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.419
 a complete collection 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.720
 I tell you I show you how much 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:18.300
 she was old because we are in 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.070
 a state they are from 2006 this is it 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:23.910
 a friend who gave it to me 2006 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:26.130
 I was 10 years old in 2006 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:27.360
 age where we start reading harry potter 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:30.510
 because he has it cause 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.729
 I really loved it and it's the 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:34.740
 good time I think to reread the whole 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:36.720
 saga here it really helps me a pleasure 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:38.789
