00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:07.630
 [Music] 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.490
 delicate personal speech that is bruno 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.860
 Holland and today I'll talk a little bit about 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.019
 chrome kers is an adapter 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.570
 developed by google that created the 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.640
 streaming digital media allowing 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.919
 images in high definition through 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.869
 hdmi connection 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:25.630
 Come with me and let's explore what 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.269
 either here on the packaging we have the car 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.089
 micro usb for usb and serves 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:33.190
 device power a small 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:36.820
 manual with explanations of your connection 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.740
 and use a small hdmi sensor and a source 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.600
 in the case of TV did not build the 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.520
 USB port 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.680
 the chrome grows have comparable size 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.210
 than a conventional pendrive or 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.390
 only one unit is grade 10 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.700
 [Music] 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.200
 his connection to tv has no mystery and 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.420
 to configure, just download the 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.329
 application for a casting and follow the 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.350
 step by step application provides 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.760
 after setting 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.530
 I think you choose some other 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.140
 I share with tv 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.840
 youtube is one of them and by the smartphone 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.759
 have TV's volume control can 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.280
 cause or advance a video that we are 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:14.280
 watching and placing other videos in a row 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.739
 [Music] 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.789
 the same goes for the application of 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:51.590
 Netflix 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:55.210
 today we can change the audio track of the 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.210
 movie or the agendas 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.750
 you can park in front 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.550
 another interesting application is the defendant 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.110
 which is what makes it possible to perform 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.800
 any video saved in the memory of the 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.800
 smartphone 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.479
 [Applause] 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.840
 It should be remembered that none of these 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.700
 affects the use of mobile devices 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.290
 I mean that while a video 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.760
 transmitted you have total freedom 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.090
 to move your device 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.090
 [Music] 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.930
 the congress also serves as a mirror of the 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:00.250
 google chrome ie we can broadcast 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.500
 the browser images to the tv 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.360
 an interesting tip is the case you want 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.530
 playing a video saved on your leaves 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.690
 computer 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:14.920
 just use the control shortcut keys 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.920
 but only choose the video to run 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.299
 the device is affordable and is 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.379
 a great solution for those who do not have a 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.810
 smart tv 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:32.319
 quality of the audio image are 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.980
 optimum and ease of use is 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.720
 indisputable 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.610
 until today we have a little amount 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.049
 limited number of applications that are 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.599
 compatible 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.290
 however, it is to imagine that it is only a 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.290
 a matter of time 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.920
 [Music] 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.680
 the video ends here let your 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.420
 suggestion or doubt there in the comments 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.640
 and if you want to encourage this channel to 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.550
 grow up if you write there you will be 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:05.709
 giving a fucking help all the best to 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.709
 You and the next video 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.779
