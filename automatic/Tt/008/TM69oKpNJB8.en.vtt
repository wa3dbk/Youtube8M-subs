this because it is pretty cool so we
have<00:00:24.679> to<00:00:24.740> use<00:00:24.890> our<00:00:24.949> imaginations<00:00:25.400> a<00:00:25.460> little

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
have to use our imaginations a little

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.050 
have to use our imaginations a little
bit

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
bit

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.269 
bit
this<00:00:26.599> right<00:00:26.839> here<00:00:27.109> is<00:00:27.289> flood<00:00:27.739> so<00:00:27.949> let's<00:00:28.130> pop

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
this right here is flood so let's pop

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:29.290 
this right here is flood so let's pop
that<00:00:28.339> on<00:00:28.609> okay

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
that on okay

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.870 
that on okay
now<00:00:30.079> you<00:00:30.949> can<00:00:31.069> see<00:00:31.249> that<00:00:31.369> there<00:00:31.519> is<00:00:31.550> mud

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
now you can see that there is mud

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.869 
now you can see that there is mud
everywhere<00:00:32.410> so<00:00:33.410> I<00:00:33.739> want<00:00:34.280> to<00:00:34.340> clean<00:00:34.609> this<00:00:34.699> up

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
everywhere so I want to clean this up

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:36.760 
everywhere so I want to clean this up
because<00:00:35.059> it's<00:00:35.420> dirty<00:00:35.629> and<00:00:36.020> I<00:00:36.230> have<00:00:36.410> this<00:00:36.530> water

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
because it's dirty and I have this water

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.950 
because it's dirty and I have this water
pump<00:00:37.039> that<00:00:37.070> it's<00:00:37.280> going<00:00:37.430> to<00:00:37.520> clean<00:00:37.730> up<00:00:37.910> so<00:00:38.180> let

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
pump that it's going to clean up so let

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.509 
pump that it's going to clean up so let
us<00:00:39.199> give<00:00:39.920> this<00:00:40.160> a<00:00:40.219> whirl

00:00:40.509 --> 00:00:40.519 
us give this a whirl

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:43.420 
us give this a whirl
so<00:00:40.969> if<00:00:41.210> I<00:00:41.329> just<00:00:41.539> scroll<00:00:42.199> on<00:00:42.500> to<00:00:42.769> the<00:00:43.129> first

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
so if I just scroll on to the first

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.569 
so if I just scroll on to the first
space<00:00:43.850> of<00:00:44.030> hot<00:00:44.570> bar<00:00:44.769> you'll<00:00:45.769> see<00:00:45.980> it<00:00:46.100> starts<00:00:46.429> up

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
space of hot bar you'll see it starts up

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.910 
space of hot bar you'll see it starts up
and<00:00:46.760> we<00:00:47.239> start<00:00:48.079> to<00:00:48.170> get<00:00:48.289> a<00:00:48.320> bit<00:00:48.530> of<00:00:48.649> a<00:00:48.679> stream

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
and we start to get a bit of a stream

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.490 
and we start to get a bit of a stream
water<00:00:49.149> so<00:00:50.149> to<00:00:50.660> control<00:00:50.899> it<00:00:51.050> you<00:00:51.140> just<00:00:51.320> move

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
water so to control it you just move

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.209 
water so to control it you just move
around<00:00:51.620> and<00:00:52.449> as<00:00:53.449> you<00:00:53.570> can<00:00:53.660> see<00:00:53.960> as<00:00:54.289> I<00:00:55.070> move

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
around and as you can see as I move

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.569 
around and as you can see as I move
around<00:00:55.339> I<00:00:55.730> can<00:00:55.879> actually<00:00:55.969> clean<00:00:56.329> up<00:00:56.539> the<00:00:57.579> mud

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
around I can actually clean up the mud

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.400 
around I can actually clean up the mud
on<00:00:58.699> the<00:00:58.760> floor<00:00:58.989> now<00:00:59.989> I<00:01:00.019> can<00:01:00.109> actually<00:01:00.230> change

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
on the floor now I can actually change

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.009 
on the floor now I can actually change
the<00:01:00.710> direction<00:01:01.010> so<00:01:01.609> if<00:01:01.699> I<00:01:01.820> go<00:01:01.969> like<00:01:02.120> that<00:01:02.420> move

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
the direction so if I go like that move

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:04.780 
the direction so if I go like that move
to<00:01:03.199> the<00:01:03.350> second<00:01:03.949> stuff<00:01:04.129> that<00:01:04.370> I<00:01:04.400> thought<00:01:04.610> it

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
to the second stuff that I thought it

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.670 
to the second stuff that I thought it
changes<00:01:05.239> direction<00:01:05.689> I<00:01:05.869> can<00:01:06.350> face<00:01:06.650> this

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
changes direction I can face this

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.429 
changes direction I can face this
direction<00:01:07.220> and<00:01:07.369> I<00:01:07.490> can<00:01:07.700> go<00:01:07.850> to<00:01:08.689> this<00:01:09.170> way<00:01:09.350> as

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
direction and I can go to this way as

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:09.840 
direction and I can go to this way as
well

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
well

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.050 
well
we<00:01:10.850> got<00:01:10.970> moving<00:01:11.150> here<00:01:11.420> and<00:01:12.670> finally<00:01:13.670> I<00:01:13.850> can

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
we got moving here and finally I can

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.569 
we got moving here and finally I can
also<00:01:14.270> change<00:01:15.140> to<00:01:15.350> this<00:01:15.920> orientation<00:01:16.340> as<00:01:16.549> well

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
also change to this orientation as well

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:18.670 
also change to this orientation as well
so<00:01:17.479> it's<00:01:17.600> very<00:01:17.720> very<00:01:17.869> cool<00:01:18.110> and<00:01:18.290> as<00:01:18.530> you<00:01:18.590> can

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
so it's very very cool and as you can

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.260 
so it's very very cool and as you can
see<00:01:18.799> it<00:01:19.009> is<00:01:19.130> cleaning<00:01:19.460> up<00:01:19.579> all<00:01:19.700> that<00:01:19.790> mud<00:01:20.000> and

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
see it is cleaning up all that mud and

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.539 
see it is cleaning up all that mud and
we<00:01:20.600> are<00:01:20.780> cleaning<00:01:21.170> things<00:01:21.530> like<00:01:21.799> mad<00:01:22.040> here<00:01:22.250> so

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:22.549 
we are cleaning things like mad here so

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.050 
we are cleaning things like mad here so
that<00:01:22.850> is<00:01:22.970> very<00:01:23.210> very<00:01:23.450> cool<00:01:24.490> and<00:01:25.490> this<00:01:25.820> is<00:01:25.970> the

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
that is very very cool and this is the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.660 
that is very very cool and this is the
system<00:01:26.240> mind<00:01:26.600> it<00:01:26.750> not<00:01:26.899> really<00:01:27.290> much<00:01:27.500> -<00:01:27.740> so<00:01:28.579> what

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
system mind it not really much - so what

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.100 
system mind it not really much - so what
we're<00:01:28.790> doing<00:01:28.820> is<00:01:29.240> we're<00:01:29.479> continuously

we're doing is we're continuously

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.069 
we're doing is we're continuously
testing<00:01:30.680> for<00:01:31.009> a<00:01:31.340> player<00:01:31.939> with<00:01:32.270> a<00:01:32.450> golden<00:01:32.869> chest

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
testing for a player with a golden chest

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.620 
testing for a player with a golden chest
plate<00:01:33.320> equipped<00:01:33.649> now<00:01:34.490> if<00:01:34.759> that's<00:01:34.880> true<00:01:35.210> then

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
plate equipped now if that's true then

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.209 
plate equipped now if that's true then
this<00:01:35.750> clock<00:01:36.049> will<00:01:36.229> be<00:01:36.320> triggered<00:01:36.530> so<00:01:36.890> I'll

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:37.219 
this clock will be triggered so I'll

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:39.249 
this clock will be triggered so I'll
show<00:01:37.430> you<00:01:37.460> that<00:01:37.549> I<00:01:37.939> just<00:01:38.180> equip<00:01:38.420> that<00:01:38.600> you'll

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
show you that I just equip that you'll

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.709 
show you that I just equip that you'll
see<00:01:39.409> this<00:01:39.560> clock<00:01:39.770> is<00:01:39.950> now<00:01:40.130> triggered<00:01:40.600> and<00:01:41.600> what

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:41.719 
see this clock is now triggered and what

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:43.270 
see this clock is now triggered and what
the<00:01:41.780> clock<00:01:41.930> is<00:01:42.079> doing<00:01:42.350> is<00:01:42.530> it's<00:01:42.770> trying<00:01:43.070> to

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
the clock is doing is it's trying to

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.429 
the clock is doing is it's trying to
test<00:01:43.520> for<00:01:43.700> which<00:01:43.850> items<00:01:44.659> not<00:01:44.869> the<00:01:45.170> player<00:01:45.350> is

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
test for which items not the player is

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.499 
test for which items not the player is
currently<00:01:45.619> hovering<00:01:45.920> over<00:01:46.310> so<00:01:47.000> this<00:01:47.180> one<00:01:47.360> is

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
currently hovering over so this one is

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:50.080 
currently hovering over so this one is
the<00:01:47.539> first<00:01:47.840> item<00:01:48.380> slot<00:01:48.619> and<00:01:48.950> this<00:01:49.189> one<00:01:49.430> is<00:01:49.610> the

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
the first item slot and this one is the

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.270 
the first item slot and this one is the
fourth<00:01:50.810> item<00:01:51.020> slot<00:01:51.409> as<00:01:51.710> you<00:01:51.799> can<00:01:51.920> see<00:01:52.070> I'm

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
fourth item slot as you can see I'm

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.770 
fourth item slot as you can see I'm
currently<00:01:52.460> hovering<00:01:52.700> over<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:53.149> fifth<00:01:53.390> item

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
currently hovering over the fifth item

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.319 
currently hovering over the fifth item
slot<00:01:54.200> now<00:01:54.740> depending<00:01:55.670> on<00:01:55.820> when<00:01:56.090> you<00:01:56.210> actually

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
slot now depending on when you actually

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.709 
slot now depending on when you actually
are<00:01:56.719> over<00:01:56.990> one<00:01:57.170> it<00:01:57.380> will<00:01:58.210> run<00:01:59.210> some<00:01:59.509> of<00:01:59.570> these

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
are over one it will run some of these

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.800 
are over one it will run some of these
commands<00:02:00.079> so<00:02:00.439> for<00:02:00.829> instance<00:02:01.130> if<00:02:01.310> I'm<00:02:01.810> hovering

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
commands so for instance if I'm hovering

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.789 
commands so for instance if I'm hovering
over<00:02:03.170> one<00:02:03.850> first<00:02:04.850> one<00:02:05.030> going<00:02:05.240> off<00:02:05.619> second<00:02:06.619> one

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
over one first one going off second one

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.980 
over one first one going off second one
third<00:02:07.579> one<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:08.030> then<00:02:08.180> the<00:02:08.270> fourth<00:02:08.479> one<00:02:08.570> and

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
third one and then the fourth one and

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.729 
third one and then the fourth one and
fifth<00:02:09.979> one<00:02:10.099> turns<00:02:10.310> off<00:02:10.840> so<00:02:11.840> what<00:02:12.620> these

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
fifth one turns off so what these

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.530 
fifth one turns off so what these
commands<00:02:13.040> are<00:02:13.129> doing<00:02:13.370> is<00:02:13.580> few<00:02:14.120> things<00:02:14.330> so

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
commands are doing is few things so

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.840 
commands are doing is few things so
first

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
first

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.210 
first
we<00:02:15.150> are<00:02:15.360> summoning<00:02:16.320> some<00:02:16.530> particles<00:02:17.040> the

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
we are summoning some particles the

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.950 
we are summoning some particles the
splash<00:02:17.460> particle<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.960> basically<00:02:20.810> give<00:02:21.810> the

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
splash particle to basically give the

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.870 
splash particle to basically give the
effect<00:02:22.200> of<00:02:22.350> like<00:02:22.530> a<00:02:22.830> stream<00:02:23.250> of<00:02:23.370> water<00:02:23.400> running

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
effect of like a stream of water running

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.030 
effect of like a stream of water running
so<00:02:24.120> I'll<00:02:24.240> show<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:24.480> those<00:02:24.630> is<00:02:25.020> it<00:02:25.320> seeing<00:02:25.530> f5

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
so I'll show you those is it seeing f5

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.510 
so I'll show you those is it seeing f5
so<00:02:26.340> if<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.520> go<00:02:26.640> into<00:02:26.730> one<00:02:28.190> you'll<00:02:29.190> see<00:02:29.340> that's

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
so if I go into one you'll see that's

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.560 
so if I go into one you'll see that's
the<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.150> stream<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.480> water<00:02:30.630> there<00:02:32.090> now<00:02:33.090> what

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
the the stream of water there now what

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.510 
the the stream of water there now what
the<00:02:34.440> other<00:02:35.130> ones<00:02:35.370> do<00:02:35.610> is<00:02:35.850> this<00:02:36.810> one<00:02:36.990> over<00:02:37.140> here

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
the other ones do is this one over here

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.630 
the other ones do is this one over here
this<00:02:38.520> one<00:02:38.700> will<00:02:39.000> summon<00:02:39.420> falling<00:02:40.380> sand<00:02:40.650> while

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
this one will summon falling sand while

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.760 
this one will summon falling sand while
falling<00:02:41.940> water<00:02:42.980> with<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.310> certain<00:02:44.760> motion<00:02:45.000> okay

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
falling water with a certain motion okay

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.220 
falling water with a certain motion okay
so<00:02:46.770> this<00:02:46.890> one<00:02:47.070> has<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.280> motion<00:02:47.610> of<00:02:48.000> 10<00:02:48.630> on<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:48.960> Z

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
so this one has a motion of 10 on the Z

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.780 
so this one has a motion of 10 on the Z
and<00:02:50.570> this<00:02:51.570> one<00:02:51.750> up<00:02:51.870> here<00:02:52.010> will<00:02:53.010> teleport<00:02:53.460> that

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
and this one up here will teleport that

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.600 
and this one up here will teleport that
entity<00:02:54.240> the<00:02:54.960> falling<00:02:55.260> sand<00:02:55.410> and<00:02:55.620> sea<00:02:55.830> to<00:02:56.250> me

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
entity the falling sand and sea to me

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.510 
entity the falling sand and sea to me
okay<00:02:57.470> now<00:02:58.470> this<00:02:58.650> command<00:02:59.010> block<00:02:59.100> will

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
okay now this command block will

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.250 
okay now this command block will
actually<00:03:00.950> teleport<00:03:01.950> that<00:03:02.610> falling<00:03:03.000> sand<00:03:03.270> ten

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
actually teleport that falling sand ten

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.840 
actually teleport that falling sand ten
blocks<00:03:04.620> away<00:03:04.980> from<00:03:05.190> me

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
blocks away from me

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.810 
blocks away from me
so<00:03:06.120> if<00:03:06.330> that<00:03:06.780> makes<00:03:06.900> sense<00:03:07.020> so<00:03:07.320> for<00:03:08.280> example<00:03:08.670> if

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
so if that makes sense so for example if

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.990 
so if that makes sense so for example if
I'm<00:03:09.000> stood<00:03:09.540> here<00:03:09.680> okay<00:03:10.680> then<00:03:11.550> it<00:03:11.880> will

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
I'm stood here okay then it will

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.540 
I'm stood here okay then it will
actually<00:03:12.150> spawn<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:13.500> falling<00:03:13.830> sand<00:03:14.010> at<00:03:14.310> me

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
actually spawn the falling sand at me

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.280 
actually spawn the falling sand at me
will<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.820> falling<00:03:15.090> water<00:03:15.240> at<00:03:15.510> me<00:03:15.660> but<00:03:16.110> then<00:03:16.260> it

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
will the falling water at me but then it

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.280 
will the falling water at me but then it
will<00:03:16.620> then<00:03:17.010> teleport<00:03:17.520> that<00:03:17.670> falling<00:03:18.030> sand<00:03:18.290> 10

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
will then teleport that falling sand 10

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.350 
will then teleport that falling sand 10
looks<00:03:19.560> further<00:03:19.860> away<00:03:20.190> so<00:03:20.400> that<00:03:20.940> it's<00:03:21.120> not

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
looks further away so that it's not

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.910 
looks further away so that it's not
spawning<00:03:21.990> on<00:03:22.200> me<00:03:22.380> so<00:03:22.530> I<00:03:22.560> can<00:03:22.770> give<00:03:22.890> a

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
spawning on me so I can give a

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.980 
spawning on me so I can give a
demonstration<00:03:23.100> of<00:03:23.520> that<00:03:23.550> if<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.060> go<00:03:24.210> on<00:03:24.240> white

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
demonstration of that if I go on white

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.400 
demonstration of that if I go on white
go<00:03:25.830> on<00:03:26.040> one<00:03:26.360> you'll<00:03:27.360> see<00:03:27.570> that<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:27.900> water<00:03:28.080> the

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
go on one you'll see that the water the

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.620 
go on one you'll see that the water the
falling<00:03:28.650> sand<00:03:28.770> is<00:03:28.950> actually<00:03:29.070> spawning<00:03:29.630> 10

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
falling sand is actually spawning 10

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.890 
falling sand is actually spawning 10
blocks<00:03:30.930> that<00:03:31.440> way<00:03:31.680> instead<00:03:31.920> upon<00:03:32.370> me<00:03:32.900> finally

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
blocks that way instead upon me finally

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.570 
blocks that way instead upon me finally
if<00:03:34.200> you're<00:03:34.320> wondering<00:03:34.620> why<00:03:34.740> the<00:03:34.800> water<00:03:35.160> is

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
if you're wondering why the water is

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.970 
if you're wondering why the water is
disappearing<00:03:36.300> that<00:03:36.720> is<00:03:36.840> because<00:03:37.140> I'm<00:03:37.350> using<00:03:37.380> a

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
disappearing that is because I'm using a

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.250 
disappearing that is because I'm using a
data<00:03:38.160> value<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:38.730> three<00:03:39.000> so<00:03:39.360> this<00:03:39.690> these<00:03:40.080> are

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
data value of three so this these are

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.750 
data value of three so this these are
not<00:03:40.380> for<00:03:40.650> water<00:03:40.830> blocks<00:03:41.130> they<00:03:41.400> are<00:03:41.580> just

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
not for water blocks they are just

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.860 
not for water blocks they are just
flowing<00:03:41.940> water<00:03:42.210> blocks<00:03:42.480> which<00:03:42.720> will

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
flowing water blocks which will

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:57.000 
flowing water blocks which will
disappear<00:03:43.350> after<00:03:43.740> a<00:03:43.980> few<00:03:44.160> seconds

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.069 

you
