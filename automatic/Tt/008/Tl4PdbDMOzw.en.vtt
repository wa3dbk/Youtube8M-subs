okay<00:00:02.760> so<00:00:02.820> here's<00:00:03.179> my<00:00:03.240> nixie<00:00:03.750> tube<00:00:03.899> wristwatch

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
okay so here's my nixie tube wristwatch

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.930 
okay so here's my nixie tube wristwatch
and<00:00:05.120> as<00:00:06.120> you<00:00:06.210> can<00:00:06.359> see<00:00:06.390> uses<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:07.230> I<00:00:07.610> n17<00:00:08.610> Nixie

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
and as you can see uses to I n17 Nixie

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.379 
and as you can see uses to I n17 Nixie
tubes<00:00:08.970> and<00:00:09.540> it<00:00:10.260> has<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.940> one<00:00:11.940> button<00:00:12.090> for

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
tubes and it has a one button for

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.539 
tubes and it has a one button for
setting<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.719> time<00:00:12.929> it's<00:00:13.230> one<00:00:13.380> of<00:00:13.410> my<00:00:13.620> design

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
setting the time it's one of my design

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.300 
setting the time it's one of my design
oversights<00:00:15.360> because<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:16.710> makes<00:00:16.859> kind<00:00:17.070> hearts

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
oversights because it makes kind hearts

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.400 
oversights because it makes kind hearts
at<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.550> time<00:00:17.730> just<00:00:17.970> think<00:00:18.260> increases<00:00:19.260> the

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
at the time just think increases the

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.450 
at the time just think increases the
minutes<00:00:20.240> but<00:00:21.350> so<00:00:22.350> I<00:00:22.380> want<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.619> show<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:23.220> power

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
minutes but so I want to show the power

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.580 
minutes but so I want to show the power
consumption<00:00:23.850> in<00:00:24.630> standby<00:00:24.689> on<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:25.470> I'll<00:00:25.560> just

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
consumption in standby on so I'll just

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.150 
consumption in standby on so I'll just
connect<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:26.010> up<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.480> multimeter<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:28.160> as

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
connect it up to the multimeter and as

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.709 
connect it up to the multimeter and as
you<00:00:29.340> can<00:00:29.460> see<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.789> has<00:00:29.880> about<00:00:30.119> 1.5<00:00:30.720> milli<00:00:30.960> amp

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
you can see it has about 1.5 milli amp

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:36.620 
you can see it has about 1.5 milli amp
standby<00:00:33.719> current<00:00:35.120> I'll<00:00:36.120> switch<00:00:36.390> the

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
standby current I'll switch the

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.560 
standby current I'll switch the
multimeter<00:00:37.050> two<00:00:37.260> min<00:00:37.410> max<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:38.070> we<00:00:38.160> can<00:00:38.309> tell

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
multimeter two min max so we can tell

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.889 
multimeter two min max so we can tell
how<00:00:39.570> much<00:00:39.719> current<00:00:40.430> draws<00:00:41.430> notes<00:00:41.700> on<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.239> it

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
how much current draws notes on and it

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.720 
how much current draws notes on and it
has<00:00:43.020> an<00:00:43.170> accelerometer<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.309> just<00:00:44.460> need<00:00:44.550> to

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
has an accelerometer so you just need to

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.860 
has an accelerometer so you just need to
twist<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:46.039> box<00:00:47.039> here<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.760> will<00:00:47.870> display

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
twist the box here and it will display

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.389 
twist the box here and it will display
the<00:00:48.989> time<00:00:49.230> first<00:00:49.590> hours<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.219> then<00:00:50.309> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
the time first hours and then the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.119 
the time first hours and then the
minutes<00:00:50.960> so<00:00:51.960> like<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:54.170> and<00:00:55.170> multimeter<00:00:55.890> says

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
minutes so like that and multimeter says

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:06.330 
minutes so like that and multimeter says
about<00:00:56.550> 150<00:00:57.149> 1<00:00:57.300> milli<00:00:57.570> amps<00:01:00.020> current<00:01:01.020> maximum

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:14.510 

disconnect<00:01:07.340> that

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.510 

see<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.299> has<00:01:15.479> three<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.590> those<00:01:16.740> lithium-ion

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
see it has three of those lithium-ion

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.440 
see it has three of those lithium-ion
batteries<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.689> parallel<00:01:19.280> 240<00:01:20.280> millions<00:01:20.670> each

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
batteries in parallel 240 millions each

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.270 
batteries in parallel 240 millions each
or<00:01:22.229> milliamp<00:01:22.679> hours<00:01:22.890> each<00:01:23.240> so<00:01:24.530> 720<00:01:25.530> milliamp

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
or milliamp hours each so 720 milliamp

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.440 
or milliamp hours each so 720 milliamp
hours<00:01:26.549> total<00:01:26.789> and<00:01:27.710> has<00:01:28.710> little<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.969> board<00:01:30.299> in

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
hours total and has little this board in

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.380 
hours total and has little this board in
here<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:31.369> one<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.670> made<00:01:33.270> at<00:01:33.420> home<00:01:33.770> using<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
here is one I made at home using the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.969 
here is one I made at home using the
toner<00:01:36.390> transfer<00:01:36.899> method<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.409> that's<00:01:37.920> just

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
toner transfer method and that's just

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.380 
toner transfer method and that's just
the<00:01:38.219> power<00:01:38.340> supply<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.850> high<00:01:39.060> voltage<00:01:39.090> power

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
the power supply the high voltage power

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.600 
the power supply the high voltage power
supplied<00:01:39.899> for<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.110> tubes<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.649> then<00:01:41.429> there's

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
supplied for the tubes and then there's

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.459 
supplied for the tubes and then there's
one<00:01:41.880> board<00:01:42.979> underneath<00:01:43.979> that<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:45.289> the<00:01:46.289> main

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.469 
one board underneath that is the main

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:48.819 
one board underneath that is the main
board<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.250> has<00:01:47.429> the<00:01:47.640> microcontroller<00:01:48.299> and

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
board that has the microcontroller and

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:55.969 
board that has the microcontroller and
all<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.069> other<00:01:50.159> electronics<00:01:53.780> and<00:01:54.920> yeah<00:01:55.920> I

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
all the other electronics and yeah I

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.339 
all the other electronics and yeah I
think<00:01:56.069> that's<00:01:56.310> basically<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.729> has<00:01:56.970> the<00:01:57.349> strap

00:01:58.339 --> 00:01:58.349 
think that's basically it has the strap

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:01.520 
think that's basically it has the strap
for<00:01:58.709> connecting<00:01:59.459> to<00:01:59.610> wrist<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.179> the<00:02:00.539> case

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
for connecting to wrist and the case

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.959 
for connecting to wrist and the case
itself<00:02:02.069> I<00:02:02.459> got<00:02:03.030> 3d<00:02:03.360> printed<00:02:03.689> at<00:02:03.869> pinocho<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.969> I

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
itself I got 3d printed at pinocho I I

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.259 
itself I got 3d printed at pinocho I I
designed<00:02:06.569> the<00:02:06.689> case<00:02:06.899> in<00:02:07.700> google<00:02:08.700> sketchup<00:02:08.910> and

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
designed the case in google sketchup and

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:15.289 
designed the case in google sketchup and
then<00:02:09.630> add<00:02:10.349> them<00:02:10.530> 3d<00:02:10.950> printed<00:02:11.280> out<00:02:11.400> oh<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.910> the

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
then add them 3d printed out oh the the

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:16.699 
then add them 3d printed out oh the the
mainboard<00:02:15.690> back<00:02:15.959> there<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.260> had

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
mainboard back there I had

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.190 
mainboard back there I had
professionally<00:02:17.280> made<00:02:17.489> I<00:02:17.840> didn't<00:02:18.840> make<00:02:18.930> out<00:02:19.079> at

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
professionally made I didn't make out at

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.990 
professionally made I didn't make out at
home<00:02:19.319> with<00:02:19.769> the<00:02:19.950> toner<00:02:20.310> transfer<00:02:20.730> method

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
home with the toner transfer method

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.819 
home with the toner transfer method
because<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.660> tolerances<00:02:22.350> are<00:02:22.530> just<00:02:22.709> too

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
because the tolerances are just too

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.509 
because the tolerances are just too
close<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:24.269> couldn't<00:02:24.480> have<00:02:24.630> made<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:24.840> um<00:02:25.519> at

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
close and I couldn't have made it um at

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.740 
close and I couldn't have made it um at
home<00:02:27.170> say<00:02:28.170> that's<00:02:28.350> basically<00:02:28.680> it<00:02:28.799> um<00:02:29.630> if<00:02:30.630> you

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
home say that's basically it um if you

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.960 
home say that's basically it um if you
want<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.079> i'm<00:02:31.319> entering<00:02:31.970> instructables

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
want to i'm entering instructables

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.240 
want to i'm entering instructables
contest<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:33.959> if<00:02:34.049> you<00:02:34.170> could<00:02:34.350> vote<00:02:34.950> for<00:02:35.160> me
