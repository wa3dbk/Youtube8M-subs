00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
and the other guys in the in that class

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.540 
and the other guys in the in that class
here<00:02:09.539> they<00:02:09.660> they<00:02:10.619> were<00:02:10.770> very<00:02:10.979> good

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
here they they were very good

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.370 
here they they were very good
some<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.450> other<00:02:12.570> standouts<00:02:13.080> through<00:02:13.260> the

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
some of the other standouts through the

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.260 
some of the other standouts through the
year<00:02:13.560> of<00:02:13.650> course<00:02:13.860> Blake<00:02:14.100> all<00:02:14.340> coming<00:02:14.700> up<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:15.000> I

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
year of course Blake all coming up and I

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.850 
year of course Blake all coming up and I
think<00:02:15.480> he<00:02:15.630> was<00:02:15.780> really<00:02:16.020> shooting<00:02:16.470> for<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.710> much

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
think he was really shooting for a much

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.530 
think he was really shooting for a much
higher<00:02:17.070> position<00:02:17.580> last<00:02:17.760> year<00:02:18.000> finishing<00:02:18.330> I

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
higher position last year finishing I

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.660 
higher position last year finishing I
think<00:02:18.750> seventh<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.320> it<00:02:19.470> in<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.220> Australian

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
think seventh of it in the Australian

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.980 
think seventh of it in the Australian
off<00:02:20.730> road<00:02:20.940> championships<00:02:21.570> and<00:02:21.690> I<00:02:21.750> think<00:02:21.930> he

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
off road championships and I think he

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.600 
off road championships and I think he
had<00:02:22.140> his<00:02:22.260> sights<00:02:22.470> set<00:02:22.620> on<00:02:22.800> a<00:02:22.920> lot<00:02:23.130> higher<00:02:23.310> this

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
had his sights set on a lot higher this

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.250 
had his sights set on a lot higher this
year<00:02:23.670> what<00:02:24.570> were<00:02:24.690> some<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:24.990> things<00:02:25.230> that

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260
