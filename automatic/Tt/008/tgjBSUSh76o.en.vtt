00:01:45.630 --> 00:02:02.920 
stick I'm going to grab another sick I'm
going<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.810> be<00:01:45.869> playing<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.110> simple<00:01:46.439> for<00:01:46.649> 4p

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.020 

now<00:02:03.930> this<00:02:04.230> is<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.410> lot<00:02:04.680> easy<00:02:04.890> but<00:02:05.550> easier<00:02:05.880> than

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
now this is a lot easy but easier than

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.340 
now this is a lot easy but easier than
it<00:02:06.150> could<00:02:06.390> have<00:02:06.420> been<00:02:06.630> because<00:02:06.870> it's<00:02:07.230> a<00:02:07.290> very

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
it could have been because it's a very

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.440 
it could have been because it's a very
simple<00:02:07.980> beat<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.430> if<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.150> hide<00:02:09.330> your

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
simple beat and if you hide your

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.940 
simple beat and if you hide your
coordination<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:10.110> up<00:02:10.290> to<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.470> certain<00:02:10.740> level

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
coordination is up to a certain level

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.910 
coordination is up to a certain level
where<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.460> can<00:02:11.610> easily<00:02:11.850> play<00:02:12.270> this<00:02:12.740> with<00:02:13.740> one

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
where you can easily play this with one

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.980 
where you can easily play this with one
hand<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.520> not<00:02:14.790> going<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.030> have<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.180> problem<00:02:15.360> the

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
hand and not going to have a problem the

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.210 
hand and not going to have a problem the
only<00:02:16.170> thing<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:16.380> was<00:02:16.470> missing<00:02:16.500> there<00:02:16.950> was

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
only thing that was missing there was

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.120 
only thing that was missing there was
the<00:02:17.460> one<00:02:17.760> hit<00:02:18.420> on<00:02:18.570> my<00:02:18.840> right<00:02:19.050> hand<00:02:19.320> that<00:02:19.800> was

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
the one hit on my right hand that was

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.400 
the one hit on my right hand that was
being<00:02:20.340> compensated<00:02:20.760> four<00:02:21.270> on<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.900> snare<00:02:21.930> drum

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
being compensated four on the snare drum

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.290 
being compensated four on the snare drum
so<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.580> sounds<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.910> little<00:02:24.090> bit<00:02:24.150> less

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
so it sounds a little bit less

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.810 
so it sounds a little bit less
comprehensive<00:02:24.660> but<00:02:25.230> ultimately<00:02:25.680> for<00:02:26.490> for<00:02:26.790> a

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
comprehensive but ultimately for for a

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.220 
comprehensive but ultimately for for a
measure<00:02:27.060> or<00:02:27.300> two<00:02:27.830> it<00:02:28.830> does<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.190> trick
