 very good to all and welcome to this 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.700
 new video in which to teach a new 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.460
 fx tutorial and good after so much 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.289
 time I'm back to the channel and good today 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.000
 I come to bring the rex 4 which is 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.650
 basically a program that we edit to 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.400
 all the textures of our simulator 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:31.060
 to some of hd and before starting alone 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.160
 tell you that this serves for the fx and for 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.510
 prepare 3d good as always we 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.610
 we will go to the description and I will leave you a 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.710
 link of a torrent that we will have it 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.239
 download and when we have it we are 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.920
 will be gÃ¼inera we will give right click 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.500
 and extract in files we will give 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.590
 accept and they will extract us once here 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.620
 we open it and I recommend installing 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.350
 these two install this and this depends 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.469
 what system to have if you have x 32 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.780
 stacey knott 64 this I install these 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.460
 two previously that I would teach you 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.350
 but I had a problem and I could not 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.809
 record and good once we have 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.909
 installed these two programs 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.640
 we will enter here we accept and 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.020
 run as an illustrator we hope that 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.149
 do not leave we give you yes 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.420
 and we'll wait until we're not 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:16.420
 out 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.410
 once here we can minimize the other 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.220
 window and it's not here we'll have to go to 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.630
 next accept next and here we will have to 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.530
 choose where we want to keep it 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:35.470
 I leave there we will give next and we give install 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:39.100
 and here you can pass two things or partner 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.200
 installed one or before installing 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.450
 will ask for some programs and then we will 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.240
 will cut and I will teach what is the 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.740
 solution when the cut is inserted 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.740
 we wait for it to come to us 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.860
 half 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.340
 well when we got here we will give you the 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.750
 retro and if it comes out again we will have 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.729
 what to do next and if it comes out 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.640
 Well that will be installed correctly 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.490
 good as in my case if I go back to 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.830
 out we'll have to go to good team at 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.289
 button start forgiveness and then we'll have 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.030
 go to here about ourselves 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.160

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.330
 of the system that we will have to give and 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.330
 wait for us to come out 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.870
 once it does not come out we will give 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.870
 manage another account 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:33.240
 then we will give you create a new account 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.920
 and we'll have to do it while I'm 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.920
 administrator example 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.319
 and we must administrator and create account 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.200
 once created we can close it 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.640
 and we give it back to retreat and follow 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.500
 install wait for us to be our 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.510
 minister 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.390
 well once this appears 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.770
 we will finish and on the desk 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.210
 they will have created this and we will click 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.210
 right and execute with ministered 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.800
 good 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.650
 well once we appear this 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.270
 we will give ok the error that came to me 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.360
 before you do not pay much attention to it is a 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:28.300
 problem of my computer and good once 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:30.980
 here I recommend you believe your 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.660
 let's say a restoration point itself 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.630
 you are annoying you are very slow when you 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.580
 you put and well here we choose our 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.220
 fx folder or prepare three of the 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.830
 version 1 version 2 and here already 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.990
 We will have to choose a depends on 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.410
 our operating system the 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:49.220
 resolutions and I recommend one thing myself 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.130
 what I do 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.830
 well here you can go 11 installing a 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:58.010
 your to your taste but what I 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:01.430
 I always go to temps once 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.770
 we open temps I'm going to smell and here 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.470
 example today I will fly for example in 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:09.710
 madrid then me all the Cape of madrid c 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.750
 lm I give to submit 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.400
 this appears to me and when I appear 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.850
 I give to general people 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:20.330
 and it depends on how the temperature if ay 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:23.150
 if it's cloudy it does not depend on all that 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:25.820
 we are created a 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.500
 one customized for that place because I 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.169
 we will give if we put a name that 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.759
 we want ok and it will appear if we want 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.229
 install it directly inside the 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:36.350
 simulator I give to case because I'm not going 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:39.470
 to do now but I install it and now 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.419
 game according to where you are going to fly 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.690
 good anyway in the description 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:46.160
 I will leave you a video that is explained is 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.050
 from a friend of mine 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.389
 you can go there because if I 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.639
 I try to explain step by step how 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.470
 use each part is a lie because I 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:56.600
 the only thing I use is how I finish it 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.580
 teach and well this is the video 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:02.770
 Full network starting 4 and hope 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.770
