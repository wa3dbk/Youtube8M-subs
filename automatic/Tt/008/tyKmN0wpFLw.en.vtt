ops 1 and i think it may be in World War
just<00:00:31.890> correct<00:00:32.099> me<00:00:32.130> if<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.340> isn't<00:00:32.610> well

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
basically what it does is it makes it

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.220 
basically what it does is it makes it
auto<00:00:34.710> aim<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.250> zombies<00:00:35.579> chest<00:00:35.910> or<00:00:36.210> head<00:00:36.239> so

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
auto aim to the zombies chest or head so

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.569 
auto aim to the zombies chest or head so
it's<00:00:37.380> very<00:00:37.500> good<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.829> have<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.160> aiming<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.550> a

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
it's very good to have you aiming it a

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.760 
it's very good to have you aiming it a
zombies<00:00:38.910> feet<00:00:39.180> meat<00:00:40.140> will<00:00:40.320> aim<00:00:40.500> at<00:00:40.680> the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
zombies feet meat will aim at the

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.900 
zombies feet meat will aim at the
headers<00:00:41.070> will<00:00:41.219> show<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.399> later<00:00:41.489> on<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:41.820> the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
headers will show you later on in the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.389 
headers will show you later on in the
video<00:00:42.200> so<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.350> is<00:00:43.500> very<00:00:43.620> useful<00:00:43.770> for<00:00:44.160> doing

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
video so this is very useful for doing

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.799 
video so this is very useful for doing
your<00:00:44.430> friends<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:44.940> gain<00:00:45.059> high<00:00:45.300> rounds<00:00:45.719> and

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
your friends and gain high rounds and

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.190 
your friends and gain high rounds and
transit<00:00:47.360> as<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:48.450> can<00:00:48.570> see<00:00:48.690> i'm<00:00:48.840> zooming<00:00:49.020> its

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
transit as you can see i'm zooming its

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.229 
transit as you can see i'm zooming its
feet<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.680> then<00:00:49.829> when<00:00:49.950> i<00:00:49.980> zoom<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.550> seems<00:00:51.090> to

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
feet and then when i zoom in it seems to

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.420 
feet and then when i zoom in it seems to
his<00:00:51.360> chest<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.960> as<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.530> see<00:00:52.770> i<00:00:52.920> think<00:00:53.250> when<00:00:53.399> i

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
his chest and as you see i think when i

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.290 
his chest and as you see i think when i
shoot<00:00:53.730> him<00:00:53.879> his<00:00:54.059> head<00:00:54.270> goes<00:00:54.510> straight<00:00:54.780> off<00:00:54.960> i

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
shoot him his head goes straight off i

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.580 
shoot him his head goes straight off i
said<00:00:57.300> i<00:00:57.329> think<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.750> also<00:00:57.870> makes<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.230> gun<00:00:58.410> power

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
said i think it also makes the gun power

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.319 
said i think it also makes the gun power
for<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.890> while<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.340> may<00:00:59.550> definitely<00:00:59.850> makes<00:01:00.210> it

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
for a while it may definitely makes it

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.029 
for a while it may definitely makes it
so<00:01:00.480> it's<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.989> zombies<00:01:01.320> weekend<00:01:01.710> because<00:01:01.800> it

to the next one so for the next one I
don't<00:01:48.210> show<00:01:48.390> how<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.750> do<00:01:49.049> but<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.320> will<00:01:49.530> tell<00:01:49.890> you

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
don't show how to do but I will tell you

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.370 
don't show how to do but I will tell you
how<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.159> do<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.729> what<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.689> basically<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:52.200> is

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
how to do it and what it basically is is

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.590 
how to do it and what it basically is is
it's<00:01:52.560> metal<00:01:52.979> barriers<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:54.000> as<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.210> can<00:01:54.420> see

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
it's metal barriers so as you can see

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.910 
it's metal barriers so as you can see
here<00:01:54.840> it's<00:01:55.020> metal<00:01:55.290> barriers<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.680> what<00:01:55.829> this

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
here it's metal barriers and what this

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.100 
here it's metal barriers and what this
does<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.340> slows<00:01:56.700> dombey's<00:01:57.090> down<00:01:57.360> twice<00:01:57.840> as

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
does is it slows dombey's down twice as

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.499 
does is it slows dombey's down twice as
fast<00:01:58.290> as<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.680> wooden<00:01:59.130> barriers<00:01:59.520> do<00:01:59.700> to<00:02:00.360> do

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
fast as the wooden barriers do to do

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.929 
fast as the wooden barriers do to do
this<00:02:00.689> all<00:02:00.899> you<00:02:01.020> will<00:02:01.110> need<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.409> do<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:02.640> heard

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
this all you will need to do is I heard

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.149 
this all you will need to do is I heard
on<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.119> internet<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.930> was<00:02:04.170> 50<00:02:04.829> barriers

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
on the internet that it was 50 barriers

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:05.959 
on the internet that it was 50 barriers
that<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.340> have<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.549> do<00:02:05.670> believe<00:02:05.880> is

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
that you have to do believe is

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.490 
that you have to do believe is
definitely<00:02:06.329> more<00:02:06.450> than<00:02:06.630> 50<00:02:06.960> barriers<00:02:07.259> when<00:02:07.409> I

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
definitely more than 50 barriers when I

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.580 
definitely more than 50 barriers when I
did<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.520> was<00:02:08.580> around<00:02:08.789> about<00:02:09.000> 250<00:02:09.989> so<00:02:10.470> if

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
did it and it was around about 250 so if

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.630 
did it and it was around about 250 so if
you<00:02:10.709> get<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:10.979> you'll<00:02:11.160> get<00:02:11.280> into<00:02:11.430> metal

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
you get that you'll get into metal

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.460 
you get that you'll get into metal
barriers<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.120> I'll<00:02:12.209> show

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
barriers and I'll show

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.250 
barriers and I'll show
effective<00:02:12.980> it<00:02:13.100> is<00:02:13.130> twice<00:02:13.880> as<00:02:13.910> fast<00:02:14.300> and<00:02:14.660> yes

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
effective it is twice as fast and yes

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.040 
effective it is twice as fast and yes
all<00:02:15.530> these<00:02:15.740> will<00:02:16.010> stay<00:02:16.190> here<00:02:16.520> in<00:02:16.730> forever<00:02:17.660> now

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
all these will stay here in forever now

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.320 
all these will stay here in forever now
