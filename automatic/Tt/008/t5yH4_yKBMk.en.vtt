okay<00:00:02.340> in<00:00:02.520> this<00:00:02.669> video<00:00:03.030> we're<00:00:03.360> going<00:00:03.449> to

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
okay in this video we're going to

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.760 
okay in this video we're going to
explore<00:00:04.080> what<00:00:04.410> division<00:00:05.190> by<00:00:05.580> zero<00:00:06.120> means<00:00:06.770> okay

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
explore what division by zero means okay

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.310 
explore what division by zero means okay
take<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.069> look<00:00:08.220> at<00:00:08.370> these<00:00:08.580> two<00:00:09.570> expressions

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
take a look at these two expressions

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.990 
take a look at these two expressions
here<00:00:12.830> and<00:00:13.830> do<00:00:14.009> you<00:00:14.099> know<00:00:14.219> which<00:00:14.429> one<00:00:14.700> of<00:00:14.730> these

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
here and do you know which one of these

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.250 
here and do you know which one of these
has<00:00:15.660> an<00:00:15.929> answer<00:00:16.289> in<00:00:16.440> which<00:00:16.560> one<00:00:16.800> doesn't<00:00:18.260> okay

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
has an answer in which one doesn't okay

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.609 
has an answer in which one doesn't okay
the<00:00:19.590> first<00:00:19.800> question<00:00:20.670> means<00:00:21.300> zero<00:00:21.900> divided<00:00:22.439> by

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
the first question means zero divided by

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.720 
the first question means zero divided by
eight<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:24.000> answer<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.480> zero<00:00:25.310> the<00:00:26.310> second

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
eight and the answer is zero the second

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.050 
eight and the answer is zero the second
one<00:00:26.849> means<00:00:27.119> 8<00:00:27.330> divided<00:00:28.109> by<00:00:28.140> 0<00:00:28.820> which<00:00:29.820> is

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
one means 8 divided by 0 which is

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.650 
one means 8 divided by 0 which is
undefined<00:00:31.489> and<00:00:32.489> what<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:32.969> means<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.390> there's

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
undefined and what that means is there's

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.430 
undefined and what that means is there's
no<00:00:33.719> answer<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.860> cannot<00:00:35.160> divide<00:00:35.640> 8<00:00:36.000> by<00:00:36.059> 0<00:00:36.870> in

fact you cannot divide any number by 0

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.170 
fact you cannot divide any number by 0
you're<00:00:40.469> often<00:00:40.649> told<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.610> an<00:00:41.700> algebra

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
you're often told that in an algebra

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.880 
you're often told that in an algebra
course<00:00:42.410> that<00:00:43.410> division<00:00:44.040> by<00:00:44.160> 0<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.850> undefined

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
course that division by 0 is undefined

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.830 
course that division by 0 is undefined
ok<00:00:46.890> we're<00:00:47.190> going<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.460> explore<00:00:47.910> why<00:00:48.329> that's

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
ok we're going to explore why that's

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.950 
ok we're going to explore why that's
true<00:00:49.430> okay<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.360> way<00:00:51.570> we're<00:00:51.780> going<00:00:51.899> to

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
true okay and the way we're going to

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.819 
true okay and the way we're going to
look<00:00:52.110> at<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.750> understand<00:00:54.750> division<00:00:55.590> as

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
look at it is to understand division as

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.299 
look at it is to understand division as
the<00:00:56.370> inverse<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.360> multiplication<00:00:58.129> so<00:00:59.129> let's

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
the inverse of multiplication so let's

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.310 
the inverse of multiplication so let's
look<00:00:59.430> at<00:00:59.550> some<00:00:59.789> division<00:01:00.359> problems<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.170> we

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
look at some division problems that we

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.490 
look at some division problems that we
can<00:01:01.649> do<00:01:01.980> such<00:01:02.910> as<00:01:03.239> 12<00:01:04.250> divided<00:01:05.250> by<00:01:05.280> 2<00:01:06.170> okay<00:01:07.170> the

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
can do such as 12 divided by 2 okay the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.460 
can do such as 12 divided by 2 okay the
reason<00:01:07.710> why<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.130> answer<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.970> 6<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:10.010> because<00:01:12.470> 2

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
reason why the answer is 6 is because 2

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.780 
reason why the answer is 6 is because 2
times<00:01:14.280> 6<00:01:15.619> equals<00:01:16.619> 12<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.340> when<00:01:17.640> you're

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
times 6 equals 12 so when you're

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.999 
times 6 equals 12 so when you're
dividing<00:01:18.030> 12<00:01:18.479> by<00:01:18.720> 2<00:01:18.780> you're<00:01:19.380> looking<00:01:19.740> for<00:01:19.979> a

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
dividing 12 by 2 you're looking for a

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.510 
dividing 12 by 2 you're looking for a
number<00:01:20.630> that<00:01:21.630> when<00:01:21.930> multiplied<00:01:22.560> by<00:01:22.770> 2<00:01:22.830> gives

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
number that when multiplied by 2 gives

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.410 
number that when multiplied by 2 gives
you<00:01:23.700> 12<00:01:24.119> okay<00:01:25.140> or<00:01:25.580> another<00:01:26.580> way<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:26.820> saying<00:01:27.270> it

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
you 12 okay or another way of saying it

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:37.010 
you 12 okay or another way of saying it
is<00:01:27.650> because<00:01:29.810> 6<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:32.180> the<00:01:33.180> solution<00:01:35.570> of<00:01:36.570> this

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
is because 6 is the solution of this

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.819 
is because 6 is the solution of this
equation<00:01:37.880> 2x<00:01:39.079> equals<00:01:40.079> 12<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:42.829> solution

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
equation 2x equals 12 and the solution

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.660 
equation 2x equals 12 and the solution
for<00:01:43.979> X<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.430> 6<00:01:44.759> because<00:01:45.180> 2<00:01:45.450> times<00:01:45.780> 6<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.380> 12<00:01:46.670> so

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
for X is 6 because 2 times 6 is 12 so

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.389 
for X is 6 because 2 times 6 is 12 so
when<00:01:47.970> faced<00:01:48.270> with<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:49.110> division<00:01:49.500> problem<00:01:49.740> like

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
when faced with a division problem like

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.880 
when faced with a division problem like
this<00:01:50.759> think<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.780> this<00:01:51.930> corresponding

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
this think of this corresponding

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.270 
this think of this corresponding
equation<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:54.509> denominator<00:01:55.200> multiplied<00:01:55.829> by<00:01:56.040> X

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
equation the denominator multiplied by X

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.179 
equation the denominator multiplied by X
should<00:01:56.850> equal<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.390> numerator<00:01:57.840> where<00:01:58.469> X<00:01:58.770> is

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
should equal the numerator where X is

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.359 
should equal the numerator where X is
your<00:01:59.670> answer<00:02:00.320> ok<00:02:01.320> let's<00:02:01.560> look<00:02:01.710> at<00:02:01.890> another

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
your answer ok let's look at another

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.490 
your answer ok let's look at another
example<00:02:03.619> they<00:02:04.619> take<00:02:05.040> for<00:02:05.880> example<00:02:05.909> 20<00:02:06.540> divided

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
example they take for example 20 divided

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.760 
example they take for example 20 divided
by<00:02:07.530> 5<00:02:08.390> hey<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.629> reason<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.140> answer<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.649> this

30<00:02:44.909> divided<00:02:45.420> by<00:02:45.450> 3<00:02:45.900> is<00:02:46.019> 10<00:02:48.230> okay<00:02:49.230> so<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:50.010> reason

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
30 divided by 3 is 10 okay so the reason

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.000 
30 divided by 3 is 10 okay so the reason
I<00:02:50.519> bring<00:02:50.819> up<00:02:50.970> those<00:02:51.209> easy<00:02:51.659> examples<00:02:52.560> is

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.990 
because now I want you to consider
something<00:02:55.109> like<00:02:55.340> 8<00:02:56.510> divided<00:02:57.510> by<00:02:57.540> 0<00:02:59.000> according

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
something like 8 divided by 0 according

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.990 
something like 8 divided by 0 according
to<00:03:00.090> what<00:03:00.239> we<00:03:00.359> were<00:03:00.510> just<00:03:00.750> doing<00:03:01.459> if<00:03:02.459> this<00:03:02.730> has

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
to what we were just doing if this has

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.720 
to what we were just doing if this has
an<00:03:03.209> answer<00:03:03.569> it's<00:03:04.200> going<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.709> be<00:03:04.799> the<00:03:04.950> solution

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
an answer it's going to be the solution

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.800 
an answer it's going to be the solution
of<00:03:06.109> this<00:03:07.109> equation<00:03:07.489> the<00:03:08.489> denominator<00:03:09.180> times<00:03:09.540> x

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
of this equation the denominator times x

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.990 
of this equation the denominator times x
equals<00:03:10.019> the<00:03:10.470> numerator<00:03:10.889> it's<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.489> same<00:03:11.760> thing

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
equals the numerator it's the same thing

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.899 
equals the numerator it's the same thing
we<00:03:12.180> did<00:03:12.420> up<00:03:12.659> here<00:03:13.109> with<00:03:13.319> 30<00:03:13.650> divided<00:03:14.250> by<00:03:14.280> 3<00:03:14.430> the

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
we did up here with 30 divided by 3 the

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.369 
we did up here with 30 divided by 3 the
denominator<00:03:15.629> times<00:03:16.019> x<00:03:16.379> equals<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.400> numerator

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379 
denominator times x equals the numerator

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.530 
denominator times x equals the numerator
well<00:03:19.379> look<00:03:19.650> at<00:03:19.769> that<00:03:19.919> equation<00:03:20.069> 0<00:03:20.819> times<00:03:21.239> x

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
well look at that equation 0 times x

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.789 
well look at that equation 0 times x
equals<00:03:21.930> 8<00:03:22.590> does<00:03:23.459> it<00:03:23.579> have<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:23.760> solution<00:03:24.650> no<00:03:25.650> of

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
equals 8 does it have a solution no of

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.550 
equals 8 does it have a solution no of
course<00:03:26.129> not<00:03:26.340> there's<00:03:26.699> no<00:03:27.060> number<00:03:27.540> that<00:03:27.810> when

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
course not there's no number that when

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.490 
course not there's no number that when
multiplied<00:03:29.069> by<00:03:29.099> 0<00:03:29.549> gives<00:03:30.150> you<00:03:30.359> 8<00:03:30.599> and<00:03:30.900> that's

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
multiplied by 0 gives you 8 and that's

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.339 
multiplied by 0 gives you 8 and that's
because<00:03:31.949> 0<00:03:32.310> times<00:03:32.400> any<00:03:33.030> number<00:03:33.449> is<00:03:33.569> always<00:03:34.049> 0

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
because 0 times any number is always 0

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:39.740 
because 0 times any number is always 0
so<00:03:35.340> it<00:03:35.459> has<00:03:35.699> no<00:03:36.329> solution<00:03:36.870> and<00:03:37.849> that<00:03:38.849> is<00:03:39.060> why<00:03:39.269> 8

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
so it has no solution and that is why 8

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:48.020 
so it has no solution and that is why 8
divided<00:03:40.590> by<00:03:40.620> 0<00:03:41.069> is<00:03:41.540> undefined<00:03:45.440> okay<00:03:47.030> what

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
find out what B divided by 0 is again

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.939 
find out what B divided by 0 is again
you<00:03:58.859> would<00:03:58.980> be<00:03:59.129> solving<00:03:59.699> this<00:04:00.409> equation<00:04:01.409> the

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:01.949 
you would be solving this equation the

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:05.559 
you would be solving this equation the

denominator times x equals the numerator

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.240 
denominator times x equals the numerator
well<00:04:06.569> whether<00:04:07.139> this<00:04:07.379> equation<00:04:08.129> has<00:04:08.220> a

solution or not depends on B if B itself

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.399 
solution or not depends on B if B itself
is<00:04:13.169> not<00:04:13.530> 0<00:04:14.220> if<00:04:14.489> it's<00:04:14.669> any<00:04:14.940> nonzero<00:04:15.359> number<00:04:15.810> such

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:16.409 
is not 0 if it's any nonzero number such

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:20.089 
is not 0 if it's any nonzero number such
as<00:04:16.590> 15<00:04:16.829> or<00:04:17.239> 23<00:04:18.239> then<00:04:19.199> this<00:04:19.380> equation<00:04:19.709> will<00:04:19.949> have

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.099 
as 15 or 23 then this equation will have

no<00:04:20.519> solution

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.330 

and<00:04:24.830> that's<00:04:25.040> because<00:04:26.500> 0<00:04:27.500> times<00:04:27.530> anything<00:04:28.130> will

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
and that's because 0 times anything will

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.880 
and that's because 0 times anything will
give<00:04:28.700> you<00:04:28.850> 0<00:04:29.120> will<00:04:29.570> not<00:04:29.600> give<00:04:30.110> you<00:04:30.230> a<00:04:30.290> nonzero

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
give you 0 will not give you a nonzero

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.750 
give you 0 will not give you a nonzero
number<00:04:31.810> okay<00:04:32.810> but<00:04:33.110> what<00:04:33.260> if<00:04:33.380> B<00:04:33.710> is<00:04:33.980> 0<00:04:34.250> let's

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
number okay but what if B is 0 let's

so<00:05:13.430> we<00:05:14.060> still<00:05:14.390> say<00:05:14.660> zero<00:05:14.990> divided<00:05:15.410> by<00:05:15.560> zero<00:05:15.680> is

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
so we still say zero divided by zero is

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.930 
so we still say zero divided by zero is
undefined<00:05:17.950> so<00:05:18.950> the<00:05:19.040> bottom<00:05:19.340> line<00:05:19.370> is<00:05:19.580> whenever

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
undefined so the bottom line is whenever

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.659 
undefined so the bottom line is whenever
there's<00:05:20.300> a<00:05:20.360> zero<00:05:20.750> in<00:05:21.020> the<00:05:21.290> denominator<00:05:21.340> of<00:05:22.340> any

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
there's a zero in the denominator of any

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:25.960 
there's a zero in the denominator of any
fraction<00:05:23.360> any<00:05:23.540> division<00:05:24.380> problem<00:05:24.980> the

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
fraction any division problem the

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.420 
fraction any division problem the
division<00:05:26.510> is<00:05:26.600> undefined<00:05:27.290> there's<00:05:27.650> no<00:05:27.860> answer

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
division is undefined there's no answer

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.490 
division is undefined there's no answer
to<00:05:28.460> it<00:05:29.080> ok<00:05:30.080> let's<00:05:30.290> end<00:05:30.530> this<00:05:30.860> discussion<00:05:31.280> with

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
to it ok let's end this discussion with

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.380 
to it ok let's end this discussion with
concrete<00:05:33.700> interpretation<00:05:34.700> of<00:05:34.820> what<00:05:35.000> division

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
concrete interpretation of what division

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.600 
concrete interpretation of what division
is<00:05:35.780> so<00:05:36.440> we<00:05:36.560> can<00:05:36.680> understand<00:05:37.160> this<00:05:37.340> from

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
is so we can understand this from

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.210 
is so we can understand this from
another<00:05:37.850> angle

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
another angle

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:45.159 
another angle
suppose<00:05:40.220> you<00:05:40.430> had<00:05:40.700> 8<00:05:41.800> cookies<00:05:42.800> and<00:05:43.930> you<00:05:44.930> want

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
suppose you had 8 cookies and you want

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:49.180 
suppose you had 8 cookies and you want
it<00:05:45.290> to<00:05:45.410> give<00:05:46.000> equal<00:05:47.000> shares<00:05:47.479> to<00:05:48.440> two<00:05:48.650> friends

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
it to give equal shares to two friends

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.770 
it to give equal shares to two friends
so<00:05:49.760> you<00:05:49.850> want<00:05:50.000> to<00:05:50.060> split<00:05:50.240> up<00:05:50.419> your<00:05:50.450> eight

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
so you want to split up your eight

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.960 
so you want to split up your eight
cookies<00:05:51.290> and<00:05:51.590> give<00:05:52.520> them<00:05:52.700> to<00:05:52.820> your<00:05:52.910> friends

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
cookies and give them to your friends

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.880 
cookies and give them to your friends
and<00:05:53.600> make<00:05:53.780> sure<00:05:53.930> they<00:05:54.050> get<00:05:54.169> the<00:05:54.350> same<00:05:54.590> amount

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890 
and make sure they get the same amount

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.120 
and make sure they get the same amount
so<00:05:55.370> let<00:05:55.460> me<00:05:55.550> drop<00:05:55.760> diagram<00:05:56.479> say<00:05:57.320> these<00:05:57.470> 8<00:05:57.680> dots

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
so let me drop diagram say these 8 dots

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.990 
so let me drop diagram say these 8 dots
represent<00:05:58.880> the<00:05:58.940> cookies<00:06:00.460> ok<00:06:01.460> if<00:06:01.729> you're<00:06:01.880> going

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
represent the cookies ok if you're going

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.350 
represent the cookies ok if you're going
to<00:06:02.090> divide<00:06:02.360> them<00:06:02.660> into<00:06:03.620> equal<00:06:04.520> piles<00:06:04.820> to<00:06:05.210> give

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
to divide them into equal piles to give

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.850 
to divide them into equal piles to give
to<00:06:05.479> your<00:06:05.600> two<00:06:05.780> friends<00:06:06.050> you<00:06:06.350> would<00:06:06.470> do<00:06:06.620> it<00:06:06.710> like

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:06.860 
to your two friends you would do it like

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.730 
to your two friends you would do it like
this<00:06:07.190> and<00:06:07.550> each<00:06:08.060> friend<00:06:08.419> would<00:06:08.630> get<00:06:08.810> 4<00:06:09.200> cookies

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
this and each friend would get 4 cookies

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.680 
this and each friend would get 4 cookies
that<00:06:10.040> means<00:06:10.310> 8<00:06:10.550> divided<00:06:11.330> by<00:06:11.360> 2<00:06:11.510> is<00:06:11.840> equal<00:06:12.169> to<00:06:12.440> 4

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
that means 8 divided by 2 is equal to 4

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:22.020 
that means 8 divided by 2 is equal to 4
okay<00:06:14.690> well<00:06:14.930> what<00:06:15.229> if<00:06:15.350> you<00:06:15.530> had<00:06:16.570> 8<00:06:17.979> cookies<00:06:19.330> and

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:22.030 
okay well what if you had 8 cookies and

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.230 
okay well what if you had 8 cookies and
4<00:06:23.030> friends<00:06:24.460> and<00:06:25.460> you<00:06:25.550> wanted<00:06:25.820> to<00:06:25.880> know<00:06:26.000> how

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 
4 friends and you wanted to know how

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.750 
4 friends and you wanted to know how
many<00:06:26.300> cookies<00:06:26.780> each<00:06:26.960> friend<00:06:27.320> got<00:06:27.620> well<00:06:28.490> you'd

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:28.760 
many cookies each friend got well you'd

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.730 
many cookies each friend got well you'd
have<00:06:28.910> 8<00:06:29.210> cookies<00:06:29.540> and<00:06:29.990> you<00:06:30.200> want<00:06:30.380> to<00:06:30.470> divide

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:30.740 
have 8 cookies and you want to divide

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.550 
have 8 cookies and you want to divide
them<00:06:31.070> into<00:06:31.340> 4<00:06:32.030> equal

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 
them into 4 equal

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.460 
them into 4 equal
so<00:06:33.919> you<00:06:34.009> could<00:06:34.190> do<00:06:34.280> it<00:06:34.310> like<00:06:34.490> this<00:06:34.850> and<00:06:35.470> each

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:36.470 
so you could do it like this and each

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.730 
so you could do it like this and each
friend<00:06:36.830> would<00:06:37.009> get<00:06:37.190> 2<00:06:37.520> so<00:06:37.940> 8<00:06:38.210> divided<00:06:38.900> by<00:06:38.930> 4<00:06:39.080> is

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740 
friend would get 2 so 8 divided by 4 is

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.570 
friend would get 2 so 8 divided by 4 is
2<00:06:40.699> is<00:06:40.880> what<00:06:41.060> we're<00:06:41.210> saying<00:06:41.419> here<00:06:42.250> well<00:06:43.250> what<00:06:43.490> if

2 is what we're saying here well what if

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:50.379 
2 is what we're saying here well what if
you<00:06:43.729> had<00:06:43.970> 8<00:06:44.870> cookies<00:06:45.849> and<00:06:48.069> 0<00:06:49.069> friends<00:06:49.699> you<00:06:50.270> have
