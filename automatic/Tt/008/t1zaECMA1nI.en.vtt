paints if you remember those back in the
day<00:00:37.399> I<00:00:38.399> don't<00:00:38.730> think<00:00:38.940> they<00:00:39.059> make<00:00:39.329> those

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.649 
have one you definitely don't need the
other<00:01:55.399> the<00:01:56.399> next<00:01:56.700> one<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.969> have<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.240> tart

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
other the next one I have is tart

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.300 
other the next one I have is tart
emphasize<00:01:58.549> clay<00:01:59.549> shadow<00:02:00.060> stick<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:01.130> this<00:02:02.130> one

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
emphasize clay shadow stick and this one

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.969 
emphasize clay shadow stick and this one
is<00:02:02.460> definitely<00:02:03.030> way<00:02:03.600> more<00:02:03.630> bronze<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.770> one

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
is definitely way more bronze this one

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.609 
is definitely way more bronze this one
does<00:02:05.250> not<00:02:05.579> go<00:02:05.850> with<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:07.079> just<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.439> give<00:02:07.469> you

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
does not go with it so just to give you

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:08.779 
does not go with it so just to give you
and<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.979> just<00:02:08.250> want<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.429> give<00:02:08.550> you<00:02:08.580> some

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
and I I just want to give you some

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.160 
and I I just want to give you some
things<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.270> could<00:02:09.450> compare<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.140> that

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
things that you could compare it to that

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.540 
things that you could compare it to that
you<00:02:10.349> might<00:02:10.500> already<00:02:10.679> own<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.190> see<00:02:11.370> if<00:02:11.430> you

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
you might already own to see if you

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.300 
you might already own to see if you
actually<00:02:11.700> want<00:02:12.660> that

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
actually want that

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.280 
actually want that
so<00:02:14.310> this<00:02:14.790> is<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:15.120> chart<00:02:15.360> one<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:15.780> as<00:02:15.959> you<00:02:16.170> can

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
so this is the chart one and as you can

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.900 
so this is the chart one and as you can
see<00:02:16.319> it's<00:02:16.560> definitely<00:02:17.069> more<00:02:17.280> of<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.459> bronze

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
see it's definitely more of a bronze

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.520 
see it's definitely more of a bronze
brown<00:02:18.800> it<00:02:19.800> does<00:02:20.099> not<00:02:20.280> have<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:21.530> reddish

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
brown it does not have that reddish

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.800 
brown it does not have that reddish
undertone<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.370> either<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:23.970> then<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.540> have<00:02:24.750> a

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
undertone to it either and then I have a

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.660 
undertone to it either and then I have a
steel<00:02:25.050> a<00:02:25.080> smudge<00:02:25.530> pot<00:02:25.830> in<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.040> color<00:02:26.250> bronze

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
steel a smudge pot in the color bronze

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.280 
steel a smudge pot in the color bronze
that<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:27.120> thought<00:02:27.450> might<00:02:27.510> be<00:02:27.900> similar<00:02:28.080> but

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
that I thought might be similar but

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.120 
that I thought might be similar but
again<00:02:28.800> it's<00:02:29.069> very<00:02:29.190> similar<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:31.260> chart<00:02:31.920> one

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
again it's very similar to the chart one

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.330 
again it's very similar to the chart one
where<00:02:32.430> I<00:02:32.760> have<00:02:33.269> an<00:02:33.690> NYX<00:02:34.470> jumbo<00:02:34.590> stick<00:02:35.130> and

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
where I have an NYX jumbo stick and

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.009 
where I have an NYX jumbo stick and
french<00:02:35.580> fry<00:02:35.790> but<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.000> can't<00:02:36.269> find<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.630> but<00:02:36.690> I

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
french fry but I can't find it but I

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.339 
french fry but I can't find it but I
think<00:02:37.319> that<00:02:37.380> is<00:02:37.830> pretty<00:02:38.069> similar<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.550> these<00:02:39.349> so

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
think that is pretty similar to these so

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.400 
think that is pretty similar to these so
down<00:02:41.069> here<00:02:41.130> is<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.819> bronze<00:02:42.060> so<00:02:42.629> that<00:02:42.930> is<00:02:43.080> much

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
down here is the bronze so that is much

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.570 
down here is the bronze so that is much
darker<00:02:43.799> and<00:02:44.220> much<00:02:44.370> more<00:02:44.610> Brown<00:02:45.060> Undertown<00:02:46.580> so

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
darker and much more Brown Undertown so

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.559 
darker and much more Brown Undertown so
it<00:02:47.910> definitely<00:02:48.150> is<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.510> color<00:02:48.840> all<00:02:49.080> on<00:02:49.440> its<00:02:49.620> own

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
it definitely is a color all on its own

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.120 
it definitely is a color all on its own
now<00:02:51.569> a<00:02:51.599> little<00:02:51.810> bit<00:02:51.989> about<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.290> punch<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:52.769> is

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
now a little bit about the punch it is

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.240 
now a little bit about the punch it is
very<00:02:54.000> easy<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.480> apply<00:02:54.870> what<00:02:55.290> i<00:02:55.709> did<00:02:56.040> was

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
very easy to apply what i did was

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.059 
very easy to apply what i did was
actually<00:02:56.910> i<00:02:56.940> took<00:02:57.329> a<00:02:57.360> little<00:02:57.660> bit<00:02:58.010> more<00:02:59.010> than

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
actually i took a little bit more than

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.830 
actually i took a little bit more than
what<00:02:59.340> you<00:02:59.370> saw<00:02:59.579> here<00:02:59.790> put<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.150> on<00:03:00.239> my<00:03:00.360> hand<00:03:00.630> and

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
what you saw here put it on my hand and

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.229 
what you saw here put it on my hand and
then<00:03:01.319> I<00:03:01.440> just<00:03:01.500> took<00:03:01.799> a<00:03:01.860> brush<00:03:02.190> I<00:03:02.400> took<00:03:02.489> a<00:03:02.849> really

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
then I just took a brush I took a really

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.620 
then I just took a brush I took a really
old<00:03:03.480> beat-up<00:03:04.230> mac<00:03:05.220> 217<00:03:05.610> I<00:03:06.209> don't<00:03:06.420> even<00:03:06.510> think

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
old beat-up mac 217 I don't even think

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.960 
old beat-up mac 217 I don't even think
the<00:03:06.870> numbers<00:03:07.200> on<00:03:07.470> there<00:03:07.650> anymore<00:03:07.860> it's<00:03:08.160> worn

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
the numbers on there anymore it's worn

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.270 
the numbers on there anymore it's worn
out<00:03:09.150> so<00:03:09.450> much<00:03:09.599> but<00:03:10.230> look<00:03:10.410> how<00:03:10.530> beat<00:03:10.769> up<00:03:10.799> this<00:03:11.069> is

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
out so much but look how beat up this is

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.250 
out so much but look how beat up this is
like<00:03:11.519> it's<00:03:12.180> just<00:03:12.450> one<00:03:12.630> that<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:12.870> didn't<00:03:13.140> take

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
like it's just one that I didn't take

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.479 
like it's just one that I didn't take
very<00:03:13.319> good<00:03:13.650> care<00:03:13.709> of<00:03:13.890> that<00:03:14.099> was<00:03:14.220> one<00:03:14.340> of<00:03:14.430> the

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
very good care of that was one of the

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.970 
very good care of that was one of the
first<00:03:14.700> ones<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:15.030> got<00:03:15.209> so<00:03:15.780> I<00:03:15.810> tend<00:03:16.260> to<00:03:16.410> then<00:03:16.650> just

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
first ones I got so I tend to then just

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.069 
first ones I got so I tend to then just
I<00:03:17.130> put<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:17.459> on<00:03:17.489> my<00:03:17.579> hand<00:03:17.880> I<00:03:18.120> swirl<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:18.690> into<00:03:18.959> the

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
I put it on my hand I swirl it into the

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
product gets on the edge and then I

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.300 
product gets on the edge and then I
apply<00:03:22.079> it<00:03:22.109> right<00:03:22.920> on<00:03:23.190> my<00:03:23.250> lid<00:03:24.950> it's<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:26.040> very
