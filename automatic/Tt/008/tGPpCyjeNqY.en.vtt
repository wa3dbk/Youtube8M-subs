00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:17.160
 well well a bit I had a twist yesterday 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.619
 and we are recovering little by little not nothing 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.030
 serious and I think for tomorrow in 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:26.000
 principle if everything goes well we will try 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.160
 go back to training or it's going to be a job 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.530
 for her to be there as soon as possible 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.530
 another one that is bad luck I think 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:36.080
 the team is doing strong jobs 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.220
 but normal in a preseason I think 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.330
 that before a year of many matches 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.360
 we have to be prepared well 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:46.700
 physically and I think it 's more bad 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.960
 lucky that for another thing I do not think that 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:53.330
 we all go little by little I think the most 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.970
 important is not to get good results 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:58.910
 obviously we always want to try 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.250
 win but the main thing is to go grabbing 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.580
 rhythm and 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.580
 returning to feel those sensations of 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:10.250
 party and I think that as they go 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.890
 passing the matches we will go to better and what 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.950
 important to get to the beginning of league 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.220
 the best possible not to be today 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.450
 today well yes I think it 's the 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.630
 beginning of that season is going to be 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.980
 what makes our season a bit 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.010
 and you have to get there 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:33.560
 the best possible physically and mentally 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.840
 I think it's a major challenge and the 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.540
 team is aware of what we 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.090
 we play so let's prepare well 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.950
 and to work as well as possible also the 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.000
 I think that league should not be subtracted 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.670
 importance because this tournament that more 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.250
 it gives us where it marks next year what 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.750
 that what competes is I think there's no 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.660
 to neglect her in no time but 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.820
 obviously after so long the 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.460
 entering Europe I think it's also a 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:06.410
 illusion not only to play but for the 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:08.540
 club and the fans and hopefully and we can give 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.630
 a very result and to be able to pass it that is 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:14.630
 the dream and the objective that we have not 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.150
 because I also want you to go help 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.390
 and in my house and I hope we both have 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.700
 luck and we can be in the champions 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:27.200
 I believe that by name, the Milan is 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.960
 the one that more history and field and all that 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.000
 what do you have but I think that since I touch you 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.000
 it's going to be a beautiful eliminator and 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.790
 complicated I think you have to be 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.090
 prepared for two tough matches and 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.090
 if we want to pass, we have to fight 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:48.440
 a lot and I work obviously happy 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.600
 of power to my 24 years have that 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.300
 Player experience champions 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.970
 World Cup in the best leagues in Europe 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.190
 I believe that 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.440
 it's an important achievement in my career 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.080
 but I want more I do not settle for what 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.380
 that I have achieved and that from now on 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:09.080
 I hope I can have more success and go every 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.500
 better day I think that if I have to 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.300
 work hard and work hard and 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.610
 as well 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.580
 be very committed to the team 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.000
 but if there is no injury program 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.400
 and God wants us to be healthy I can 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.310
 I can look for it because I have not 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.250
 thought I still think you have to go step 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.980
 I think that 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.390
 if it came from the case that I want to go 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.570
 I have to work well on my team to 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.030
 do relevant things here to call 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.460
 the attention of the selection I think 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.400
 first you have to focus well on the 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:48.190
 I work day after day in your club and then 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.700
 you will see if there is the opportunity if not and if 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:54.790
 they were enough I think that this moment is not 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:58.000
 the time to think if I want if I go to 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.790
 be or not first I will work here and 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.070
 in the future you will see what happens there is no 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.340
 or always said that it will never close the 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:08.730
 door nothing obviously circumstances 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.770
 between one thing and another was not there 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:15.040
 but I have never flatly refused to 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:18.010
 nothing and I do not know if it came to that case 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.829
 Well, I would think it would be spoken and we would see what 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.290
 happens I think a lot of change is not going to 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:26.020
 have we are almost the same we are going to 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.720
 keep the same style the same 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.850
 formation I think that more or less 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.380
 there has to be a lot of change 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:36.300
 obviously the decline of 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.180
 of yarra is important 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.460
 but there is also a player who 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.680
 principle looks good there will be 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.620
 see it as the 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.020
 matches but hopefully I'm lucky that 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.500
 can bring us many things 38 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.830
 million anyone is walking yesterday 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:58.740
 Well, it's not like I'm wearing it 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:01.710
 I think it was a unique opportunity to 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.500
 the one that does not understand it is a 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.759
 nonsense I think you have to put in that 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.139
 place and support at all times because 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:13.020
 that has a club like madrid that 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:15.629
 pay that amount I think it's good to 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.470
 I think it was the best he could 

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:20.990
 move to jarrai 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:24.380
 and I'm glad I hope and triumph and demonstrate 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.570
 the great player that yes I think it was 

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:30.370
 a very good debut also obviously the 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.370
 rival was also not 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.120
 of many of a lot of level they were 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:38.360
 starting to train I think it was scored 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.490
 a little bit everything but he showed that he has to 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.490
 has quality has many good things 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:46.280
 and hopefully and it goes well in the 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.110
 official matches that for the team 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:51.669
 it would be very important 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:55.520
 I would love someone from your country always 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:58.210
 it is very good to have in the day to day and 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.280
 apart is a friend I think 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.960
 in the person I could do very well and the 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.800
 club also because he is a great player 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:08.979
 comes from being in Barcelona that already 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:12.190
 says everything I think it would be a good signing 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:15.039
 for everyone and I do not know how things are 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:17.340
 but hopefully we can have it here if it has 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:19.500
 talked and he knows 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:24.330
 how well it is here how well it is 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:26.639
 lives and is a thing that is not much 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.949
 in his hands is also Barcelona and 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:31.110
 who is the one who decides their future and is 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:34.729
 waiting a bit to see what decision 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.729
 take with the new coach
