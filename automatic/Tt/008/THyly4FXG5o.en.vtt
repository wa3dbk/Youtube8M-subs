five heroes at the same time one of the
things<00:01:42.810> that's<00:01:42.930> really<00:01:43.080> nice<00:01:43.680> about<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.190> way

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
things that's really nice about the way

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.340 
things that's really nice about the way
the<00:01:44.370> champions<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:44.940> designed<00:01:45.330> though<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.780> that

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
the champions is designed though is that

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.540 
the champions is designed though is that
there<00:01:46.470> are<00:01:46.680> places<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.190> the<00:01:47.280> world<00:01:47.430> where

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
there are places in the world where

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.370 
there are places in the world where
you're<00:01:47.670> going<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.850> fight<00:01:48.030> bigger<00:01:48.900> villains

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
you're going to fight bigger villains

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.930 
you're going to fight bigger villains
almost<00:01:49.650> cosmic<00:01:50.190> level

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
almost cosmic level

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.400 
almost cosmic level
that's<00:01:52.940> certainly<00:01:53.180> actually<00:01:53.450> seen<00:01:53.660> groups

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
that's certainly actually seen groups

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.190 
that's certainly actually seen groups
working<00:01:55.070> together<00:01:55.600> many<00:01:56.600> parts<00:01:56.900> of<00:01:56.960> the<00:01:57.050> game

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
working together many parts of the game

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.750 
working together many parts of the game
are<00:01:57.260> actually<00:01:57.770> designed<00:01:58.160> to<00:01:58.370> use<00:01:58.580> what<00:01:58.670> we

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
are actually designed to use what we

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.520 
are actually designed to use what we
call<00:01:58.940> the<00:01:59.060> reinforcement<00:01:59.780> system

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
call the reinforcement system

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.610 
call the reinforcement system
this<00:02:00.800> is<00:02:00.980> particularly<00:02:01.580> noticeable<00:02:02.540> in<00:02:02.840> open

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
this is particularly noticeable in open

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.620 
this is particularly noticeable in open
areas<00:02:03.950> of<00:02:03.980> the<00:02:04.160> world<00:02:04.370> what<00:02:05.060> that<00:02:05.240> means<00:02:05.450> is

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
areas of the world what that means is

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.210 
areas of the world what that means is
that<00:02:05.660> if<00:02:05.870> I<00:02:05.990> go<00:02:06.140> through<00:02:06.410> as<00:02:06.590> a<00:02:06.620> solo<00:02:06.980> player

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
that if I go through as a solo player

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.710 
that if I go through as a solo player
the<00:02:07.790> games<00:02:08.000> going<00:02:08.180> to<00:02:08.210> be<00:02:08.330> set<00:02:08.540> to<00:02:08.630> be

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
the games going to be set to be

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.510 
the games going to be set to be
challenging<00:02:09.200> for<00:02:09.380> me<00:02:09.530> and<00:02:09.680> fun<00:02:09.890> for<00:02:10.100> me<00:02:10.190> as<00:02:10.369> an

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
challenging for me and fun for me as an

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.460 
challenging for me and fun for me as an
individual<00:02:10.970> but<00:02:11.180> when<00:02:11.480> I<00:02:11.600> start<00:02:11.870> adding<00:02:12.050> more

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
individual but when I start adding more

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.260 
individual but when I start adding more
players<00:02:12.830> to<00:02:12.920> my<00:02:13.160> group<00:02:13.370> so<00:02:13.400> if<00:02:13.580> there's<00:02:13.760> three

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
players to my group so if there's three

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.790 
players to my group so if there's three
heroes<00:02:14.660> of<00:02:14.750> them<00:02:14.840> for<00:02:14.960> their<00:02:15.080> five<00:02:15.320> heroes<00:02:15.650> I'm

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
heroes of them for their five heroes I'm

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.290 
heroes of them for their five heroes I'm
playing<00:02:16.070> with<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.640> enemies<00:02:17.090> that<00:02:17.120> I'm

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
playing with the enemies that I'm

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.970 
playing with the enemies that I'm
fighting<00:02:17.600> we'll<00:02:17.690> go<00:02:17.840> and<00:02:18.050> get<00:02:18.260> reinforcements

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
fighting we'll go and get reinforcements

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.290 
fighting we'll go and get reinforcements
they'll<00:02:19.100> make<00:02:19.370> it<00:02:19.520> more<00:02:19.670> difficult<00:02:19.850> more

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
they'll make it more difficult more

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.300 
they'll make it more difficult more
challenging<00:02:20.360> and<00:02:21.260> that<00:02:21.410> way<00:02:21.500> more<00:02:21.710> fun<00:02:22.010> for<00:02:22.220> me

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
challenging and that way more fun for me

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.950 
challenging and that way more fun for me
to<00:02:22.400> go<00:02:22.520> through<00:02:22.850> so<00:02:23.210> when<00:02:23.390> you<00:02:23.480> go<00:02:23.630> out<00:02:23.780> you

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
to go through so when you go out you

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.930 
to go through so when you go out you
want<00:02:24.200> to<00:02:24.290> find<00:02:24.560> players<00:02:24.980> that<00:02:25.460> have<00:02:25.610> built

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
want to find players that have built

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.730 
want to find players that have built
characters<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:26.930> it<00:02:26.990> built<00:02:27.200> those<00:02:27.350> heroes

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
characters and it built those heroes

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.710 
characters and it built those heroes
that<00:02:27.920> fill<00:02:28.160> specific<00:02:28.760> roles<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:29.210> then<00:02:29.600> get

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
that fill specific roles and then get

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.360 
that fill specific roles and then get
them<00:02:29.840> together<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:30.350> it's<00:02:30.620> actually<00:02:30.950> okay<00:02:31.220> if

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
them together and it's actually okay if

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.980 
them together and it's actually okay if
you<00:02:31.430> have<00:02:31.550> multiple<00:02:32.000> heroes<00:02:32.330> that<00:02:32.720> have<00:02:32.870> the

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
you have multiple heroes that have the

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.420 
you have multiple heroes that have the
same<00:02:33.200> type<00:02:33.440> of<00:02:33.470> role<00:02:33.770> together<00:02:33.920> so<00:02:34.250> if<00:02:34.310> you

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
same type of role together so if you

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.250 
same type of role together so if you
have<00:02:34.610> three<00:02:35.120> or<00:02:35.270> four<00:02:35.300> really<00:02:35.810> super<00:02:36.200> strong

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
have three or four really super strong

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.860 
have three or four really super strong
characters<00:02:37.100> that<00:02:37.520> are<00:02:37.640> built<00:02:37.820> around<00:02:37.940> having

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
characters that are built around having

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.060 
characters that are built around having
a<00:02:38.930> lot<00:02:39.050> of<00:02:39.170> muscles<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.590> lot<00:02:39.740> of<00:02:39.770> strength

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
a lot of muscles and a lot of strength

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.220 
a lot of muscles and a lot of strength
and<00:02:40.310> dealing<00:02:40.610> a<00:02:40.820> lot<00:02:41.060> of<00:02:41.180> melee<00:02:41.510> damage<00:02:41.690> that's

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
and dealing a lot of melee damage that's

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.570 
and dealing a lot of melee damage that's
okay<00:02:42.590> because<00:02:42.770> they're<00:02:43.040> going<00:02:43.130> to<00:02:43.190> be<00:02:43.280> built

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
okay because they're going to be built

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.850 
okay because they're going to be built
differently<00:02:44.270> because<00:02:44.720> of<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.230> massive

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
differently because of the massive

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.740 
differently because of the massive
amounts<00:02:46.160> of<00:02:46.220> flexibility<00:02:46.790> such<00:02:47.360> a<00:02:47.390> nice

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
amounts of flexibility such a nice

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.960 
amounts of flexibility such a nice
system<00:02:48.110> and<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.320> fact<00:02:48.560> that<00:02:48.680> you<00:02:49.250> can<00:02:49.459> have

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
system and the fact that you can have

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.750 
system and the fact that you can have
people<00:02:50.450> that<00:02:50.570> have<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:50.990> same<00:02:51.640> general<00:02:52.640> idea

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
people that have the same general idea

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.060 
people that have the same general idea
like<00:02:53.240> we're<00:02:53.480> all<00:02:53.660> super<00:02:54.020> strong<00:02:54.080> but<00:02:54.800> because

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
like we're all super strong but because

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.590 
like we're all super strong but because
of<00:02:55.100> all<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.459> upgrades<00:02:55.670> they<00:02:56.090> have<00:02:56.270> the<00:02:56.420> power

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
of all the upgrades they have the power

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.240 
of all the upgrades they have the power
system<00:02:57.110> chosen<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.770> look<00:02:57.980> of<00:02:58.100> their

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
system chosen the look of their

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.680 
system chosen the look of their
characters<00:02:58.700> they're<00:02:59.030> all<00:02:59.180> going<00:02:59.360> to<00:02:59.480> play

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
characters they're all going to play

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.090 
characters they're all going to play
differently<00:03:00.350> and<00:03:00.650> they're<00:03:00.739> all<00:03:00.860> gonna<00:03:00.980> be

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
differently and they're all gonna be

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.260 
differently and they're all gonna be
able<00:03:01.160> to<00:03:01.310> contribute<00:03:01.610> very<00:03:01.880> uniquely

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
able to contribute very uniquely

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.750 
able to contribute very uniquely
hopefully<00:03:02.690> super<00:03:03.620> groups<00:03:03.830> are<00:03:04.070> really<00:03:04.580> easy

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
hopefully super groups are really easy

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.340 
hopefully super groups are really easy
to<00:03:05.000> use<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:05.360> they're<00:03:05.510> a<00:03:05.540> great<00:03:05.750> way<00:03:06.050> to<00:03:06.080> get

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
to use and they're a great way to get

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.720 
to use and they're a great way to get
people<00:03:06.650> together<00:03:06.800> whether<00:03:07.430> they're<00:03:07.610> people

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
people together whether they're people

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:08.979 
people together whether they're people
that<00:03:07.970> you<00:03:08.060> know<00:03:08.209> in<00:03:08.239> your<00:03:08.510> life<00:03:08.690> and<00:03:08.900> you

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
that you know in your life and you

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.449 
that you know in your life and you
played<00:03:09.200> other<00:03:09.320> games<00:03:09.410> with<00:03:09.800> or<00:03:10.100> someone

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
played other games with or someone
