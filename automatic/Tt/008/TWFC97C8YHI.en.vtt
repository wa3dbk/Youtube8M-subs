minute pouring with rain and the next

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.660 
minute pouring with rain and the next
minute<00:02:42.450> can<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:43.470> believe<00:02:43.739> that<00:02:43.769> just

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
minute can you believe that just

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.560

completely<00:02:45.150> cleared<00:02:45.570> away<00:02:46.580> if<00:02:47.580> I<00:02:47.760> had<00:02:47.790> another

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
completely cleared away if I had another

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.590

canvas<00:02:49.530> or<00:02:50.010> car<00:02:50.550> door<00:02:50.850> or<00:02:51.470> something<00:02:52.470> with<00:02:52.620> me

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
canvas or car door or something with me

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.990 
canvas or car door or something with me
I'll<00:02:54.600> be<00:02:54.780> very<00:02:54.989> tempted<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.730> paint<00:02:56.730> this<00:02:56.850> all

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
I'll be very tempted to paint this all

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.910 
I'll be very tempted to paint this all
over<00:02:57.180> again<00:02:57.330> but<00:02:57.930> very<00:02:58.380> differently<00:02:58.739> this

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
over again but very differently this

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:08.280 
over again but very differently this
time<00:02:59.160> isn't<00:02:59.580> that<00:02:59.670> fantastic

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.349
