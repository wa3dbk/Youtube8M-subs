watching<00:02:21.890> another<00:02:22.010> guy<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.730> he<00:02:23.210> had<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.720> same

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
watching another guy and he had the same

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.490 
watching another guy and he had the same
thing<00:02:24.230> happening<00:02:24.950> with<00:02:25.010> way<00:02:25.460> earlier<00:02:25.880> already

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
thing happening with way earlier already

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.900 
thing happening with way earlier already
and<00:02:27.500> I<00:02:27.770> didn't<00:02:28.100> have<00:02:28.250> that<00:02:28.280> so<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:28.670> thought<00:02:28.850> ah

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
and I didn't have that so I thought ah

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.360 
and I didn't have that so I thought ah
maybe<00:02:29.270> that<00:02:29.570> was<00:02:29.690> just<00:02:29.900> him<00:02:30.110> but<00:02:30.770> now<00:02:31.040> I<00:02:31.070> can

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
maybe that was just him but now I can

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.790 
maybe that was just him but now I can
definitely<00:02:31.550> relate<00:02:32.180> I<00:02:32.600> mean<00:02:32.840> I<00:02:33.140> don't<00:02:33.530> usually

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
definitely relate I mean I don't usually

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.380 
definitely relate I mean I don't usually
dream<00:02:34.280> that<00:02:35.170> deep<00:02:36.170> that<00:02:36.740> I<00:02:36.770> can<00:02:37.160> get<00:02:37.390> these

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
dream that deep that I can get these

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.140 
dream that deep that I can get these
vivid<00:02:38.780> dreams<00:02:39.230> like<00:02:39.590> that<00:02:39.800> it<00:02:40.580> might<00:02:40.880> be

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
vivid dreams like that it might be

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.960 
vivid dreams like that it might be
because<00:02:41.960> I<00:02:41.990> went<00:02:42.380> to<00:02:42.530> bed<00:02:42.740> like<00:02:43.220> wait<00:02:43.520> earlier

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
because I went to bed like wait earlier

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.970 
because I went to bed like wait earlier
I<00:02:44.060> usually<00:02:44.540> go<00:02:44.660> to<00:02:44.690> bed<00:02:44.810> way<00:02:45.140> too<00:02:45.200> late<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:45.710> I

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
I usually go to bed way too late and I

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.470 
I usually go to bed way too late and I
do<00:02:46.040> get<00:02:46.280> don't<00:02:46.460> get<00:02:46.550> enough<00:02:46.790> sleep<00:02:47.060> so<00:02:47.090> maybe

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
do get don't get enough sleep so maybe

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.230 
do get don't get enough sleep so maybe
it's<00:02:47.810> just<00:02:47.930> because<00:02:48.590> I'm<00:02:48.920> getting<00:02:49.070> the<00:02:49.610> proper

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
it's just because I'm getting the proper

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.120 
it's just because I'm getting the proper
amount<00:02:50.480> of<00:02:50.570> sleep<00:02:50.630> that<00:02:51.560> I'm<00:02:51.710> having<00:02:51.890> these

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
amount of sleep that I'm having these

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.840 
amount of sleep that I'm having these
dreams<00:02:53.170> but<00:02:54.170> it<00:02:54.710> could<00:02:54.890> also<00:02:55.070> be<00:02:55.370> you<00:02:55.730> know

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
dreams but it could also be you know

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.810 
dreams but it could also be you know
related<00:02:56.240> to<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.600> water<00:02:56.780> fast<00:02:57.490> so<00:02:58.490> I<00:02:58.520> don't

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
related to the water fast so I don't

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.400 
related to the water fast so I don't
know<00:02:58.910> but<00:02:59.120> either<00:02:59.510> way<00:02:59.870> it's<00:03:00.110> kind<00:03:00.350> of

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
know but either way it's kind of

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.120 
know but either way it's kind of
interesting<00:03:00.890> and<00:03:01.750> today<00:03:02.750> on<00:03:03.050> day<00:03:03.230> 14<00:03:03.740> I<00:03:03.770> had<00:03:04.100> a

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.400 
actually not since I induced one with
the<00:03:13.210> salt<00:03:14.210> water<00:03:14.420> flush<00:03:14.800> and<00:03:15.850> I<00:03:16.850> was<00:03:17.030> very

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
the salt water flush and I was very

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.530 
the salt water flush and I was very

surprised I had the urge to go and I
went<00:03:20.720> and<00:03:21.230> I<00:03:21.680> don't<00:03:22.340> want<00:03:22.550> to<00:03:22.610> go<00:03:22.700> into<00:03:22.970> any

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
went and I don't want to go into any

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.150 
went and I don't want to go into any
details<00:03:23.660> but<00:03:24.080> you<00:03:24.380> know<00:03:24.500> it<00:03:24.590> felt<00:03:24.830> really<00:03:24.980> good

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
details but you know it felt really good

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.000 
details but you know it felt really good
and<00:03:25.490> it<00:03:25.580> seems<00:03:25.850> like<00:03:26.140> amazing<00:03:27.140> that<00:03:27.290> after<00:03:27.590> 14

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
and it seems like amazing that after 14

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.310 
and it seems like amazing that after 14
days<00:03:28.040> you<00:03:28.250> still<00:03:28.910> have<00:03:29.360> things<00:03:29.720> in<00:03:29.930> your<00:03:30.050> colon

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
days you still have things in your colon

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.790 
days you still have things in your colon
that<00:03:30.680> you<00:03:30.830> can<00:03:30.980> get<00:03:31.130> out<00:03:31.720> so<00:03:32.720> it's<00:03:33.260> good<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.680> get

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
that you can get out so it's good to get

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.400 
that you can get out so it's good to get
that<00:03:34.040> out<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:34.580> if<00:03:35.060> I<00:03:35.150> had<00:03:35.300> stopped<00:03:35.690> earlier<00:03:36.140> I

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
that out and if I had stopped earlier I

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.990 
that out and if I had stopped earlier I
wouldn't<00:03:36.740> have<00:03:36.830> gotten<00:03:37.130> this<00:03:37.280> out<00:03:37.460> and<00:03:37.760> would

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
wouldn't have gotten this out and would

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.520 
wouldn't have gotten this out and would
have<00:03:38.090> not<00:03:38.300> been<00:03:38.510> able<00:03:38.630> to<00:03:38.750> clean<00:03:39.050> it<00:03:39.080> as<00:03:39.320> well

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
have not been able to clean it as well

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.760 
have not been able to clean it as well
so<00:03:39.740> the<00:03:40.700> cleansing<00:03:41.180> really<00:03:41.960> you<00:03:42.650> know

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
so the cleansing really you know

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.670 
so the cleansing really you know
continues<00:03:43.430> and<00:03:43.760> it's<00:03:44.450> important<00:03:44.960> the<00:03:45.350> longer

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
continues and it's important the longer

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.210 
continues and it's important the longer
you<00:03:45.830> stay<00:03:46.100> in<00:03:46.130> this<00:03:46.400> fast<00:03:46.730> the<00:03:47.150> better<00:03:47.770> so<00:03:48.770> I'm

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
you stay in this fast the better so I'm

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.920 
you stay in this fast the better so I'm
just<00:03:49.400> gonna<00:03:49.520> stick<00:03:50.000> to<00:03:50.210> the<00:03:50.330> end<00:03:50.480> and<00:03:50.690> see

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
just gonna stick to the end and see

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.540 
just gonna stick to the end and see
what's<00:03:51.170> gonna<00:03:51.380> happen<00:03:51.770> but<00:03:51.890> it's<00:03:52.160> you<00:03:52.490> know

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
what's gonna happen but it's you know

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.780 
what's gonna happen but it's you know
certainly<00:03:53.020> certainly<00:03:54.020> changing<00:03:54.530> my<00:03:54.680> body<00:03:55.520> in

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
certainly certainly changing my body in

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:56.760 
certainly certainly changing my body in
a<00:03:55.880> good<00:03:56.030> way

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
a good way

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.480 
a good way
yeah<00:03:57.770> and<00:03:58.270> today<00:03:59.270> I<00:03:59.420> took<00:03:59.840> some<00:04:00.020> pictures<00:04:00.490> some

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
yeah and today I took some pictures some

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.600 
yeah and today I took some pictures some
comparison<00:04:02.060> pictures<00:04:02.360> I<00:04:02.480> have<00:04:02.600> lost<00:04:02.900> 6<00:04:03.260> pounds

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
comparison pictures I have lost 6 pounds

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.630 
comparison pictures I have lost 6 pounds
since<00:04:04.610> last<00:04:04.940> week<00:04:05.270> and<00:04:06.070> it<00:04:07.070> seems<00:04:07.280> like<00:04:07.460> this

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
since last week and it seems like this

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.160 
since last week and it seems like this
is<00:04:07.790> all<00:04:07.940> fat<00:04:08.240> at<00:04:08.420> this<00:04:08.570> point<00:04:08.870> I<00:04:09.020> mean

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
is all fat at this point I mean

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.870 
is all fat at this point I mean
obviously<00:04:09.380> I<00:04:09.710> don't<00:04:09.830> have<00:04:10.070> any<00:04:10.220> other<00:04:10.430> reason

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
obviously I don't have any other reason

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.110 
obviously I don't have any other reason
reserves<00:04:11.480> and<00:04:11.930> I<00:04:12.590> mean<00:04:13.040> it<00:04:13.430> could<00:04:13.670> be<00:04:13.820> some

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
reserves and I mean it could be some

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.410 
reserves and I mean it could be some
muscle<00:04:14.450> but<00:04:14.630> I<00:04:14.870> also<00:04:15.290> measured<00:04:15.740> my<00:04:16.190> body<00:04:17.060> again

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
muscle but I also measured my body again

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.440 
muscle but I also measured my body again
today<00:04:17.690> and<00:04:17.930> I<00:04:18.440> lost<00:04:18.680> about<00:04:19.280> an<00:04:19.549> inch<00:04:19.850> again

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
today and I lost about an inch again

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.130 
today and I lost about an inch again
everywhere<00:04:21.580> except<00:04:22.580> my<00:04:22.700> arms<00:04:23.030> which<00:04:23.630> you<00:04:24.050> know

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
everywhere except my arms which you know

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.780 
everywhere except my arms which you know
which<00:04:24.650> I<00:04:24.830> was<00:04:24.950> worried<00:04:25.160> about<00:04:25.220> that<00:04:25.490> I<00:04:25.550> lose

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
which I was worried about that I lose

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.730 
which I was worried about that I lose
muscle<00:04:26.270> but<00:04:26.450> it<00:04:26.600> seems<00:04:26.840> like<00:04:27.020> I'm<00:04:27.229> keeping

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
muscle but it seems like I'm keeping

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.480 
muscle but it seems like I'm keeping
muscle<00:04:28.479> only<00:04:29.479> lost<00:04:29.690> a<00:04:30.139> quarter-inch<00:04:30.710> which

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
muscle only lost a quarter-inch which

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.070 
muscle only lost a quarter-inch which
could<00:04:31.729> have<00:04:31.819> been<00:04:31.910> also<00:04:32.270> some<00:04:32.569> fat<00:04:32.780> that<00:04:32.960> was

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
could have been also some fat that was

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.330 
could have been also some fat that was
there<00:04:33.319> and<00:04:33.800> also<00:04:34.610> my<00:04:34.759> legs<00:04:35.060> and<00:04:35.590> my<00:04:36.590> legs<00:04:37.009> I

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
there and also my legs and my legs I

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.909 
there and also my legs and my legs I
only<00:04:37.520> lost<00:04:37.970> about<00:04:38.240> a<00:04:38.840> quarter<00:04:39.319> of<00:04:39.440> an<00:04:39.560> inch<00:04:39.680> as

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
only lost about a quarter of an inch as

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.770 
only lost about a quarter of an inch as
well<00:04:40.750> so<00:04:42.310> it<00:04:43.310> seems<00:04:43.639> like<00:04:43.849> it's<00:04:44.030> mostly<00:04:44.330> you

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
well so it seems like it's mostly you

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.900 
well so it seems like it's mostly you
know<00:04:44.810> where<00:04:45.319> my<00:04:45.500> fat<00:04:45.710> really<00:04:46.069> is<00:04:46.220> which<00:04:46.520> is<00:04:46.729> you

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
know where my fat really is which is you

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.629 
know where my fat really is which is you
know<00:04:47.030> my<00:04:47.150> belly<00:04:47.419> and<00:04:47.780> my<00:04:47.990> back<00:04:48.259> and<00:04:48.650> my<00:04:48.889> head<00:04:49.310> I

noticed<00:04:50.240> my<00:04:50.389> head<00:04:50.599> is<00:04:50.750> a<00:04:50.780> lot<00:04:51.110> thinner<00:04:51.530> and

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:54.339 
noticed my head is a lot thinner and
there's<00:04:52.460> a<00:04:52.550> lot<00:04:52.699> more<00:04:52.880> definition<00:04:53.539> so<00:04:53.990> you

another good thing that it's been

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.920 
another good thing that it's been
changing<00:05:19.639> is<00:05:19.759> my<00:05:19.880> blood<00:05:20.120> pressure<00:05:20.389> I<00:05:20.509> used<00:05:20.780> to

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
changing is my blood pressure I used to

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.800 
changing is my blood pressure I used to
have<00:05:21.020> very<00:05:21.169> high<00:05:21.409> blood<00:05:21.440> pressure<00:05:22.000> in<00:05:23.000> the<00:05:23.150> 150

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
have very high blood pressure in the 150

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.200 
have very high blood pressure in the 150
110<00:05:24.550> sometimes<00:05:25.550> even<00:05:25.759> a<00:05:25.789> little<00:05:25.880> bit<00:05:26.030> higher

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
110 sometimes even a little bit higher

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.950 
110 sometimes even a little bit higher
range<00:05:26.810> and<00:05:27.740> I<00:05:28.099> had<00:05:28.220> to<00:05:28.340> take<00:05:28.490> medication<00:05:28.840> and<00:05:29.840> I

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
range and I had to take medication and I

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.490 
range and I had to take medication and I
haven't<00:05:30.199> taken<00:05:30.409> it<00:05:30.620> for<00:05:30.800> 14<00:05:31.159> days<00:05:31.190> and<00:05:32.500> my

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
haven't taken it for 14 days and my

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:39.189 
haven't taken it for 14 days and my
blood<00:05:33.710> pressure<00:05:33.919> today<00:05:34.099> was<00:05:34.900> 116<00:05:35.900> over<00:05:36.889> 63<00:05:38.199> 63

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.199 
blood pressure today was 116 over 63 63

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:41.950 
blood pressure today was 116 over 63 63
being<00:05:39.590> actually<00:05:40.159> actually<00:05:41.000> close<00:05:41.360> to<00:05:41.570> 60

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
being actually actually close to 60

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.080 
being actually actually close to 60
which<00:05:42.080> is<00:05:42.259> the<00:05:42.560> very<00:05:43.009> low<00:05:43.280> end<00:05:43.310> of<00:05:43.639> the<00:05:43.759> normal

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
which is the very low end of the normal

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.589 
which is the very low end of the normal
range

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:44.599 
range

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:47.469 
range
but<00:05:45.440> it's<00:05:45.590> expected<00:05:45.979> that<00:05:46.340> you<00:05:46.610> have<00:05:46.909> a<00:05:47.180> lower

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:47.479 
but it's expected that you have a lower

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:49.420 
but it's expected that you have a lower
blood<00:05:47.690> pressure<00:05:47.810> during<00:05:48.680> the<00:05:48.830> water<00:05:49.099> fast

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
blood pressure during the water fast

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.490 
blood pressure during the water fast
because<00:05:49.849> you<00:05:49.940> don't<00:05:50.120> take<00:05:50.300> any<00:05:50.449> salts<00:05:50.900> in<00:05:51.110> you

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
because you don't take any salts in you

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.249 
because you don't take any salts in you
you<00:05:52.219> know<00:05:52.340> you<00:05:52.400> don't<00:05:52.639> eat<00:05:53.090> so<00:05:53.870> all<00:05:54.080> these

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:54.259 
you know you don't eat so all these

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:55.689 
you know you don't eat so all these
different<00:05:54.469> things<00:05:54.710> that<00:05:55.130> are<00:05:55.190> happening<00:05:55.280> in

00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:55.699 
different things that are happening in

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:57.610 
different things that are happening in
your<00:05:55.759> body<00:05:56.000> that<00:05:56.330> would<00:05:56.449> usually<00:05:56.659> increase

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
your body that would usually increase

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.100 
your body that would usually increase
your<00:05:57.800> blood<00:05:57.889> pressure<00:05:58.190> are<00:05:59.180> not<00:05:59.479> there<00:05:59.690> so<00:05:59.990> I'm

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
your blood pressure are not there so I'm

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.320 
your blood pressure are not there so I'm
not<00:06:00.139> concerned<00:06:00.530> but<00:06:01.070> I'm<00:06:01.219> very<00:06:01.460> happy<00:06:01.880> that

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
not concerned but I'm very happy that

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.240 
not concerned but I'm very happy that
I'm<00:06:02.509> actually<00:06:02.539> the<00:06:03.139> loop<00:06:03.409> my<00:06:03.590> body<00:06:03.800> is<00:06:03.919> able<00:06:04.099> to

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250 
I'm actually the loop my body is able to

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.480 
I'm actually the loop my body is able to
lower<00:06:04.580> the<00:06:04.940> blood<00:06:05.060> pressure<00:06:05.449> by<00:06:05.840> itself

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
lower the blood pressure by itself

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.730 
lower the blood pressure by itself
without<00:06:07.490> the<00:06:07.699> medication<00:06:08.240> to<00:06:09.139> a<00:06:09.169> level<00:06:09.440> where

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
without the medication to a level where

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.370 
without the medication to a level where
you<00:06:10.190> know<00:06:10.310> once<00:06:11.180> I<00:06:11.300> recover<00:06:11.630> and<00:06:11.900> I<00:06:11.990> get<00:06:12.199> to<00:06:12.349> a

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380 
you know once I recover and I get to a

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.080 
you know once I recover and I get to a
normal<00:06:13.270> blood<00:06:14.270> pressure<00:06:14.330> I'd<00:06:14.810> be<00:06:14.990> very<00:06:15.139> happy

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
normal blood pressure I'd be very happy

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:21.459 
normal blood pressure I'd be very happy
yeah<00:06:17.090> so<00:06:17.590> -<00:06:18.590> anything<00:06:19.310> else<00:06:19.570> no<00:06:20.570> actually<00:06:21.229> I'm

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:21.469 
yeah so - anything else no actually I'm

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:22.959 
yeah so - anything else no actually I'm
just<00:06:21.860> pretty<00:06:22.430> much<00:06:22.610> it

00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:22.969 
just pretty much it
