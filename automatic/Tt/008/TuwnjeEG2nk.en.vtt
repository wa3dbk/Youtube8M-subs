you<00:01:02.280> need<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.489> get<00:01:02.610> four<00:01:03.089> wires<00:01:03.510> because<00:01:04.170> we

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
you need to get four wires because we

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.460 
you need to get four wires because we
need<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.799> expand<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:06.479> microphone<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.440> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
need to expand the microphone and the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.600 
need to expand the microphone and the
earpiece<00:01:09.680> that's<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.860> only<00:01:11.220> way<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.520> a

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
earpiece that's the only way that a

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.180 
earpiece that's the only way that a
finger<00:01:11.940> phone<00:01:12.090> that's<00:01:12.330> going<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.659> work<00:01:13.190> so

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
finger phone that's going to work so

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.080 
finger phone that's going to work so
slice<00:01:14.549> off<00:01:14.789> the<00:01:15.149> earphone<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:17.460> Waco<00:01:17.940> and

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
now we're doing a little bit of

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.389 
now we're doing a little bit of
soldering<00:01:25.630> here<00:01:26.020> we're<00:01:26.560> going<00:01:26.740> to<00:01:26.890> expand

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
soldering here we're going to expand

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:30.240 
soldering here we're going to expand
those<00:01:27.579> wires<00:01:27.909> that<00:01:28.180> you<00:01:28.299> saw<00:01:28.479> earlier<00:01:29.189> now<00:01:30.189> you

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
those wires that you saw earlier now you

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.160 
those wires that you saw earlier now you
don't<00:01:30.460> necessarily<00:01:30.729> need<00:01:31.240> a<00:01:31.450> soldering<00:01:31.780> iron

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
don't necessarily need a soldering iron

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.490 
don't necessarily need a soldering iron
you<00:01:32.890> can<00:01:33.159> use<00:01:33.429> tape<00:01:33.820> or<00:01:34.079> anything<00:01:35.079> else<00:01:35.259> you

glove to make this work correctly we've

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.500 
glove to make this work correctly we've
light<00:02:19.269> it<00:02:19.420> up<00:02:19.540> it<00:02:19.720> looks<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:20.049> be<00:02:20.140> okay<00:02:21.360> so<00:02:22.360> we're

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
light it up it looks to be okay so we're

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.750 
light it up it looks to be okay so we're
going<00:02:22.630> to<00:02:22.690> proceed<00:02:22.930> with<00:02:23.739> the<00:02:23.890> process<00:02:24.340> here

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.190 

we're<00:02:27.760> going<00:02:27.880> to<00:02:27.970> slice<00:02:28.239> a<00:02:28.269> little<00:02:28.660> hole<00:02:28.930> right

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
we're going to slice a little hole right
