obviously<00:00:07.609> we<00:00:07.729> have<00:00:07.879> the<00:00:08.029> board<00:00:08.240> itself

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:08.930 
obviously we have the board itself

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:09.790 
obviously we have the board itself
now<00:00:09.170> the

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:09.800 
now the

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.590 
now the
is<00:00:10.010> designed<00:00:10.370> to<00:00:10.670> replicate<00:00:11.210> all<00:00:11.450> the

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:11.600 
is designed to replicate all the

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.360 
is designed to replicate all the
movements<00:00:11.990> of<00:00:12.080> snowboarding<00:00:12.680> specifically

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:13.370 
movements of snowboarding specifically

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.299 
movements of snowboarding specifically
so<00:00:13.910> it<00:00:14.360> will<00:00:14.600> tip<00:00:14.809> from<00:00:14.990> a<00:00:15.050> toe<00:00:15.320> edge<00:00:15.530> to<00:00:15.980> a<00:00:16.010> heel

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:16.309 
so it will tip from a toe edge to a heel

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.450 
so it will tip from a toe edge to a heel
edge<00:00:16.520> it<00:00:17.270> will<00:00:17.420> also<00:00:17.840> go<00:00:18.110> up<00:00:18.350> and<00:00:18.890> down

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
edge it will also go up and down

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.790 
edge it will also go up and down
slightly<00:00:19.939> as<00:00:20.330> well<00:00:20.810> as<00:00:20.990> a<00:00:21.200> little<00:00:21.410> bit<00:00:21.500> of<00:00:21.590> your

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
now a combination of all of these moves

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.130 
now a combination of all of these moves
at<00:00:24.529> the<00:00:24.560> same<00:00:24.800> time<00:00:25.189> will<00:00:25.939> imitate<00:00:26.720> or

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
at the same time will imitate or

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.870 
at the same time will imitate or
replicate<00:00:27.740> the<00:00:27.890> movements<00:00:28.400> that<00:00:28.520> you

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
replicate the movements that you

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.790 
replicate the movements that you

closer to their balancing capabilities
what<00:00:49.250> happens<00:00:49.640> is<00:00:49.820> if<00:00:50.000> they're<00:00:50.179> now<00:00:50.329> relying

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
what happens is if they're now relying

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.200 
what happens is if they're now relying
on<00:00:50.929> the<00:00:51.050> skeleton<00:00:51.620> for<00:00:51.649> maximum<00:00:52.309> support<00:00:52.789> and

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
on the skeleton for maximum support and

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.970 
on the skeleton for maximum support and
the<00:00:53.719> muscles<00:00:54.109> are<00:00:54.230> simply<00:00:54.530> protect<00:00:54.890> the

the muscles are simply protect the
joints<00:00:55.399> and<00:00:55.579> then<00:00:55.760> a<00:00:55.940> movement<00:00:56.269> by<00:00:57.050> lining<00:00:57.530> up

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
joints and then a movement by lining up

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.799 
joints and then a movement by lining up
their<00:00:57.859> knees<00:00:58.070> ankles<00:00:58.399> and<00:00:58.850> hips<00:00:59.000> specifically

their knees ankles and hips specifically

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:01.630 
their knees ankles and hips specifically
in<00:00:59.989> the<00:01:00.199> way<00:01:00.320> that<00:01:00.530> suits<00:01:00.769> your<00:01:01.070> skeletal

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
in the way that suits your skeletal

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.150 
in the way that suits your skeletal
structure<00:01:02.059> you<00:01:02.570> now<00:01:02.780> have<00:01:03.050> maximum<00:01:03.769> range<00:01:04.010> of

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:04.160 
structure you now have maximum range of

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.250 
structure you now have maximum range of
movements<00:01:04.640> therefore<00:01:05.330> you<00:01:05.480> have<00:01:05.690> maximum

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
movements therefore you have maximum

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.240 
movements therefore you have maximum

increments<00:01:11.090> of<00:01:11.240> measurements<00:01:11.720> are<00:01:11.810> already

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 
increments of measurements are already

on the machine

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.360 
on the machine
so<00:01:13.870> from<00:01:14.870> an<00:01:15.080> operator's<00:01:15.620> perspective<00:01:16.160> is

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:16.370 
so from an operator's perspective is

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.930 
so from an operator's perspective is
very<00:01:16.670> easy<00:01:17.030> to<00:01:17.300> read<00:01:17.540> the<00:01:17.930> stance<00:01:18.500> width

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
very easy to read the stance width

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.850 
very easy to read the stance width
introduce<00:01:19.940> you<00:01:20.090> to<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:20.390> seats<00:01:20.660> right<00:01:21.200> here<00:01:21.260> so

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
introduce you to the seats right here so

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.350 
introduce you to the seats right here so
the<00:01:22.130> seat<00:01:22.370> is<00:01:22.580> part<00:01:22.910> of<00:01:23.000> the<00:01:23.120> measurement

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
the seat is part of the measurement

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.570 
the seat is part of the measurement
procedure<00:01:23.810> we<00:01:24.350> start<00:01:24.650> off<00:01:24.950> seated

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
procedure we start off seated

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.790 
procedure we start off seated
specifically<00:01:26.330> before<00:01:26.690> standing<00:01:27.020> and<00:01:27.620> of

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
specifically before standing and of

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.890 
specifically before standing and of
course<00:01:28.010> using<00:01:28.190> the<00:01:28.370> safety<00:01:28.580> rail<00:01:28.910> stability

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
course using the safety rail stability

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.570 
course using the safety rail stability
and<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:30.290> fact<00:01:30.500> that<00:01:30.560> this<00:01:30.770> can<00:01:31.070> be<00:01:31.220> relied

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
and the fact that this can be relied

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.790 
and the fact that this can be relied
upon<00:01:31.610> to<00:01:31.940> support<00:01:32.240> you<00:01:32.690> the<00:01:33.140> machine<00:01:33.440> itself

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
upon to support you the machine itself

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.170 
upon to support you the machine itself
obviously<00:01:34.130> is<00:01:34.430> built<00:01:34.640> to<00:01:34.790> look<00:01:34.940> like<00:01:35.150> a

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
obviously is built to look like a

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.630 
obviously is built to look like a
snowboard<00:01:35.480> and<00:01:35.930> on<00:01:36.410> the<00:01:36.560> machine<00:01:36.890> here<00:01:37.190> we<00:01:37.460> can

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
snowboard and on the machine here we can

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.300 
snowboard and on the machine here we can
actually<00:01:37.790> see<00:01:38.240> these<00:01:38.750> measurements<00:01:39.590> stance

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
actually see these measurements stance

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.000 
actually see these measurements stance
width<00:01:40.820> they<00:01:41.360> are<00:01:41.600> in<00:01:41.840> there<00:01:42.050> one<00:01:42.350> centimetre

increments<00:01:43.670> specifically<00:01:44.300> so<00:01:44.840> that<00:01:45.320> we<00:01:45.410> can

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
increments specifically so that we can

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.380 
increments specifically so that we can
actually<00:01:45.680> figure<00:01:46.070> out<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.820> distance<00:01:47.030> from

current<00:01:58.670> locking<00:01:59.090> mechanism<00:01:59.720> is<00:01:59.990> simply<00:02:00.500> this

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
current locking mechanism is simply this

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.770 
current locking mechanism is simply this
plate<00:02:00.920> that<00:02:01.160> slides<00:02:01.430> forward<00:02:01.760> and<00:02:02.120> that

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
plate that slides forward and that

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.750 
plate that slides forward and that
prevents<00:02:03.410> the<00:02:03.530> plate<00:02:03.770> from<00:02:03.980> spinning<00:02:04.370> too

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
prevents the plate from spinning too

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.640 
prevents the plate from spinning too
much<00:02:05.000> now<00:02:05.270> it<00:02:05.450> doesn't<00:02:05.660> look<00:02:05.780> it<00:02:05.930> completely

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
much now it doesn't look it completely

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.949 
much now it doesn't look it completely
it<00:02:07.100> actually<00:02:07.430> just<00:02:07.580> makes<00:02:07.940> it<00:02:08.149> so<00:02:08.660> that<00:02:08.869> it

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
it actually just makes it so that it

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.470 
it actually just makes it so that it
won't<00:02:09.170> spin<00:02:09.649> too<00:02:10.220> much<00:02:10.459> and<00:02:10.729> we'll<00:02:11.090> see<00:02:11.330> how

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
won't spin too much and we'll see how

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.220 
won't spin too much and we'll see how
that<00:02:11.660> works<00:02:11.870> later<00:02:12.110> on<00:02:12.410> in<00:02:12.530> the<00:02:12.680> procedure
