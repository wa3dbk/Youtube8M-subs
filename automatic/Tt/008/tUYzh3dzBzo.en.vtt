00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.230
 for all that such today I bring you the tag 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.120
 of the 7 capital sins' of beauty 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.099
 I've been nominated by this channel Coti 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.450
 makeup 3 and the truth that when open 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.309
 I thought it was pretty fun 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.259
 they liked the kind of questions that came 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.730
 then I decided to be able to record the 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.110
 tag and especially that it does quite that 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.300
 I do not upload any videos like this in this style 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.130
 so nothing is the video that you are going to see 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.869
 Today I'm going to leave the information box 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.310
 the video that made this shut up and 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.449
 especially also the link to your channel 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.650
 so you can enter and you can see the 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.839
 videos they have on their channel when 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.099
 Makeup reviews like that, so 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:31.650
 I'm going to leave all link the box 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.780
 information so nothing let's start 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.370
 already with the questions the first sin is 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.900
 greed and the question is what is my 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.000
 cheapest beauty product and what is 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.380
 my most expensive beauty product inside the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.180
 cheaper I have to mention the 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.580
 wotan lipsticks while that is for a 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.560
 dollar and little bit and the truth that 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.170
 they are great food is very 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.060
 good and within the price that the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.160
 true the quality is quite high like this 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.280
 that this is my first and then the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.080
 most expensive product is the face school and 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.270
 high life of charlotte tÃ­lbury is the 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.580
 palette they have to be able to do the 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.820
 contour bronzer illuminator these 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.490
 they are about 60 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.530
 little 73 dollars and beat little for many 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.300
 others nor three dollars within the 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.800
 products that I have is the most expensive 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.600
 I was looking in pallets and everything but the 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.070
 true that price is the most expensive 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.729
 and I love it or the product is 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.300
 hallucinatory 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:23.500
 the palette or what is the packaging 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.320
 itself is beautiful and 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.240
 I like that I'm going to say I love the 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.680
 next would be anger and the question is 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.280
 what is the beauty product that I have 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:36.130
 love relationship hate the first the benefit 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.170
 the professional this product when what 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.550
 buy was supposed to be to minimize 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.840
 the pores and the girl told me that I was going 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.600
 to come well for my mixed skin type 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.369
 to go through the brightness is not like that or 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.979
 be it minimizes the pores leaves one aspect 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.960
 as very silky on the skin and if I like it 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.850
 the finish shines as well as a 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.340
 I personally can not bear anything 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.810
 so there are seasons that I say there 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.040
 where is the first and I use it and I say 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.020
 I love the result and suddenly 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.820
 seasons that I say small shit then 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.700
 he leaves it in the drawer and I do not like it and 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.039
 especially because many times 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.379
 divide the products and separate 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.060
 let's say the composition then we get 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:13.269
 just as creamy but it comes out as a 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.819
 little watery liquid then I get to 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.310
 move the little boat and there is no way like that 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.099
 what 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.230
 I like it but I would not like to finish the 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.030
 product because it's quite expensive but not 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.400
 I know if I'll buy this first one 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.130
 put by the moments of doubt that 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.720
 it's not worth it I do not know 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.860
 the next sin would be gluttony and 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.840
 question is what is my product of 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.700
 most delicious beauty and I have girl 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.720
 You have chocolate to face because this palette 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.580
 Smells that feeds amazing chocolate 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.290
 It is also simply open the palette and 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.880
 you get that smell that smells 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.040
 great but then make up the 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.670
 eyes and does not stay the smell or anything but 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.670
 it smells 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.840
 to face has this palette and has 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.420
 also a tan that is chocolate 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.580
 usually go so or something like that in name and 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.470
 it also smells a lot of chocolate and I 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.840
 I love the products that I have 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.580
 this is the one that smells the best 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.959
 sin is laziness and ask what 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.120
 is the beauty product you neglect 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.250
 because of laziness I have to say that 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.480
 are the lips that is after doing 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.970
 all face after doing the 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.890
 eyebrows eyes all have half put the 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.840
 outlined and paint the lips is a 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.640
 I do not feel like it, so I'm going 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.310
 directly anglos some balm with 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.290
 color anything that is fast and 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.870
 ready because I have to put myself here 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.280
 delineate and then you take the lipstick 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.650
 you paint it well especially I have 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.530
 I have to mark the beak well 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.849
 but I have to have a lot of desire or be 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.959
 some day that does not have makeup 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.819
 eyes simply wear masks 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.610
 lashes and say come, it's better 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.650
 time the lips but if not gloss and 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.970
 list the next sin is the pride 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.189
 and the question is what beauty product 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.709
 It gives you more confidence in yourself I have 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:53.260
 to say that they are eyebrows and eyelashes 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.970
 for me personally it is what I most 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.980
 like and more attracts me to a makeup 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.269
 I can maybe take a little 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.280
 only of corrector does not have a base of 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:03.069
 makeup or anything but if I do not wear 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.989
 eyebrows and I do not wear the eyelashes done not 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.760
 I like a lot result then times 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.139
 right now it has to be the brou wish or 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.430
 the book to meditate on has to be 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.829
 choose are two products that I am 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.810
 enchanting to be able to make up this 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.819
 rebellion that I have up here and of 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.320
 eyelash mask right now I have you 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.810
 to mention the mind so secret face 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.850
 I love the perversion of the 'bund' 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.199
 and what is amazing are two masks of 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.260
 eyelashes that I like because they leave them 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:28.449
 voluptuous and hallucinatory bushy blacks 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.010
 and they are also used a lot is the first 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:31.180
 of one andy that you have to be subversion 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.490
 that I usually mix with any 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.919
 mascara and the result is 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.510
 a thousand times better or is good eyelashes 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:38.590
 chubby although that's what I like 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.840
 good eyes 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.640
 it would be lust the only thing that 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.730
 question of this sin I do not see any 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.020
 kind of sense in any kind of normal 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.100
 in relation to what is the theme of the 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.930
 make up what we are talking about 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.610
 the question to lust is what 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.190
 Attributes are more attractive to you 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.530
 the opposite sex there where is the 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.390
 makeup anywhere so I 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.580
 personally I am going to change it because of 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:02.740
 a question too much and very silly 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.950
 then inside the halo julia I'm going to 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.300
 mention the beauty product let's say 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:08.410
 Of course I bought that I had 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.150
 eager to buy because everything 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.910
 world spoke well of him and then I did not 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:16.110
 I 've used it or used it very little 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.110
 because I do not see the grace 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:22.300
 chanel request from janet to see no me 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.960
 cost expensive expensive expensive because I bought it in 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.970
 fine 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.770
 then you give me with I have about 20 euros 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.600
 in relation to Portuguese besides I went 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.190
 first to the english court I decided myself 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.680
 they said no one is left is super 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.389
 exhausted a paste I went to primary 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.050
 times and we will continue we have all and it costs 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:40.630
 $ 20 euros less and said it to me 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.060
 I obviously took then I like the 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:44.580
 product but I find it a pain in the ass 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.600
 when I'm doing all the makeup 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.889
 put me with another night to catch the 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.169
 product that is like a mousse 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:54.360
 as if it were a cream put to work 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:54.360
 the cream on the face and then 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:06:00.569
 The course will use is in 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.569
 I'm going to use the spent money but 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:04.539
 that does not cost me more and in the last 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.009
 Sin would be envy and the question is 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:09.129
 what product would you like to receive as 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:10.509
 gift if I had to choose I would take a 

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:12.490
 brush let kudo the truth that I 

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:13.870
 like to receive any brush giving 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.610
 the face as the eyes of the brand 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:17.860
 jabugo to be able to taste them because everything 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.419
 the world speaks well of them but they are 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.610
 very expensive faces, I think that 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:24.849
 are 100 dollars the eyes are usually 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.830
 between 50 to 60 dollars is a pass 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:28.870
 so he trumpeted if it's a gift for 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.879
 ask for asking that there be no missing 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.139
 japan brush and nothing is really 

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:33.310
 that you liked the tag and I'm going to 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:34.840
 leave here the information box to 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.849
 my nominees so they also do tar 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.469
 and answer all these questions and 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:40.300
