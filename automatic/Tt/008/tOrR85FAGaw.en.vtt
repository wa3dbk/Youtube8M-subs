00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
working with real wood veneer so the

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.890 
working with real wood veneer so the
knife<00:04:06.709> will<00:04:06.950> tend<00:04:07.220> to<00:04:07.340> follow<00:04:07.519> the<00:04:07.819> grain<00:04:08.060> this

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
knife will tend to follow the grain this

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.479 
knife will tend to follow the grain this
is<00:04:09.110> why<00:04:09.260> the<00:04:09.319> first<00:04:09.709> score<00:04:10.099> is<00:04:10.220> the<00:04:10.340> most

is why the first score is the most

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.400 
is why the first score is the most
important<00:04:11.060> and<00:04:11.299> you<00:04:11.720> should<00:04:11.900> focus<00:04:12.109> on

important and you should focus on

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.560 
important and you should focus on
keeping<00:04:12.890> the<00:04:13.010> score<00:04:13.250> straight<00:04:13.700> rather<00:04:14.329> than

keeping the score straight rather than

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.830
