00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.680
 own lie 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:04.980
 City Hall itself 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.870
 this supermatch 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.579
 we pour 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:11.439
 Danni and Kerzhakov very good 

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:14.609
 penetrating pass of Magomed does not care 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:17.550
 eighteenth number 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.840
 shakuri and easily ran off 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.949
 a little inaccurate behind the back like a tail 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:23.089
 Sasha dozed off 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.970
 where and how it seemed to me not target 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.019
 now if i have any time u 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.099
 st and then if the belt is okay then 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:31.739
 here of course 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:33.350
 criterion again tried to help 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.700
 Kerzhakova but Sasha seems to me 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.230
 Neda faked nothing 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.620
 given cosmo what it put there was to pierce 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.780
 Ion played great here, but 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.360
 if no less great played 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.640
 want haig 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.810
 good pass from the novel shirokov 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.610
 I repeat my diagnosis and even 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.300
 second after the second half 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.100
 save nastasia polisom the moment of 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.560
 man of three more 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.130
 flank midfielders 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.230
 on 10 players 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.050
 we were rather 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.760
 it was hard to score 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.200
 gave a little bit far 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.630
 wide 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.160
 edition of course 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.040
 if he wanted to 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.900
 come up with something so funny it was 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.790
 meaning was sense immediately make the transfer 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.590
 my new right 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.340
 from here already 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.770
 yes if called beautiful 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.080
 Alexey Ion 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.860
 will take out their verdict drug union 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.500
 the most interesting moment 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.140
 winger of four 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.920
 losers in mid rf in these two matches 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.090
 compositions 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.530
 they have and have not shared swiftly 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.180
 did not look so dangerous as alexei 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.570
 of ions 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.480
 we were shown our first half an hour 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.230
 second half 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.230
 leaves harsh was higher 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.010
 very beautiful somewhere at the zenith players 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.690
 here is another extremely dangerous 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.800
 moment at the gate Vyacheslav malafeeva 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.420
 highest replacement boris nemtsov nothing 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.020
 Razin here seems to me 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.020
 overlooked a little 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.410
 Well, you can punch yourself 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.600
 episodes 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.670
 but the twentieth number 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.000
 Murmansk tomb signal 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.319
 selflessly 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.459
 essentially will 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.459
 threatened to come up with something ugliness 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.379
 one of the many 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:19.389
 not strong inaccurate blows yes here 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:21.429
 would be asked of course 

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:24.429
 like a predator 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:26.629
 the forest is burning 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.510
 it was a blow or burned down barcelona 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.009
 world here 

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:33.689
 could not have time to which class in the section 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:35.199
 smartphone injustice 

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.779
 o'clock 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:37.489
 it seemed a little closer 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:38.739
 a little closer 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.439
 Well, that's essentially 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:42.159
 go from 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.919
 Persepolis Target Transfer Rosy 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:47.159
 semashko 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:48.650
 It is with such an account ended 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.349
 today's match worked for you Fedor 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.310
 got lost see you soon
