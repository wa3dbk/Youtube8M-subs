things so this video is to clarify some
of<00:00:23.449> those<00:00:23.599> important<00:00:24.529> questions<00:00:25.029> one<00:00:26.029> of<00:00:26.119> the

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
of those important questions one of the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.880 
of those important questions one of the
most<00:00:26.359> frequently<00:00:26.779> asked<00:00:26.960> questions<00:00:27.050> is<00:00:27.619> where

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
most frequently asked questions is where

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.769 
most frequently asked questions is where
should<00:00:28.039> I<00:00:28.099> start<00:00:28.310> building<00:00:28.880> a<00:00:28.939> city<00:00:29.179> and<00:00:29.419> the

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
should I start building a city and the

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.300 
should I start building a city and the
answer<00:00:29.960> to<00:00:30.079> that<00:00:30.109> question<00:00:30.560> is<00:00:30.619> quite<00:00:30.829> complex

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
answer to that question is quite complex

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.440 
answer to that question is quite complex
so<00:00:31.489> I'm<00:00:31.550> going<00:00:31.730> to<00:00:31.789> break<00:00:31.970> it<00:00:32.090> down<00:00:32.119> a<00:00:32.270> little

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
so I'm going to break it down a little

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.690 
so I'm going to break it down a little
bit<00:00:32.599> let's<00:00:33.410> just<00:00:33.710> assume<00:00:33.980> you<00:00:34.160> want<00:00:34.370> to<00:00:34.430> build

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
bit let's just assume you want to build

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.810 
bit let's just assume you want to build
a<00:00:35.140> kind<00:00:36.140> of<00:00:36.200> middle<00:00:36.649> European<00:00:37.190> medieval

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
a kind of middle European medieval

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.910 
a kind of middle European medieval
stylish<00:00:38.420> city<00:00:38.690> for<00:00:39.200> that<00:00:39.320> you<00:00:39.500> should<00:00:39.560> always

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
stylish city for that you should always

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.890 
stylish city for that you should always
and<00:00:40.430> really<00:00:40.640> always<00:00:41.030> try<00:00:41.300> to<00:00:41.330> find<00:00:41.600> a<00:00:41.750> place

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
and really always try to find a place

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.560 
and really always try to find a place
where<00:00:42.530> you<00:00:42.650> have<00:00:42.860> either<00:00:43.220> a<00:00:43.610> river<00:00:43.910> or<00:00:44.150> an

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
where you have either a river or an

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.500 
where you have either a river or an
ocean<00:00:44.720> or<00:00:45.080> preferably<00:00:45.950> both<00:00:46.490> because<00:00:47.300> the

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
ocean or preferably both because the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.770 
ocean or preferably both because the
ocean<00:00:48.050> is<00:00:48.290> for<00:00:48.860> having<00:00:49.100> a<00:00:49.160> big<00:00:49.280> Harbor<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:49.940> the

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
ocean is for having a big Harbor and the

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.930 
ocean is for having a big Harbor and the
river<00:00:51.020> is<00:00:51.260> for<00:00:51.590> having<00:00:51.860> a<00:00:51.920> freshwater<00:00:52.310> supply

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
river is for having a freshwater supply

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.060 
river is for having a freshwater supply
which<00:00:53.210> is<00:00:53.240> very<00:00:53.570> important<00:00:54.050> and<00:00:54.200> to<00:00:54.260> have<00:00:54.680> also

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
which is very important and to have also

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.910 
which is very important and to have also
a<00:00:55.280> harbor<00:00:55.790> to<00:00:56.060> have<00:00:56.360> trade<00:00:56.780> routes<00:00:57.020> into<00:00:57.890> the

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
a harbor to have trade routes into the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.880 
a harbor to have trade routes into the
landscape<00:00:58.220> to<00:00:58.910> other<00:00:59.060> cities<00:00:59.420> for<00:00:59.600> example<00:01:00.050> so

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
landscape to other cities for example so

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.020 
landscape to other cities for example so
the<00:01:01.040> landscape<00:01:01.190> we<00:01:01.490> are<00:01:01.580> flying<00:01:01.760> through

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
the landscape we are flying through

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.109 
the landscape we are flying through
right<00:01:02.210> now<00:01:02.420> as<00:01:02.690> a<00:01:02.720> seat<00:01:03.650> I<00:01:03.800> found<00:01:04.100> the<00:01:04.820> seat<00:01:05.030> is

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
right now as a seat I found the seat is

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:06.850 
right now as a seat I found the seat is
going<00:01:05.269> to<00:01:05.449> be<00:01:05.600> in<00:01:05.720> the<00:01:05.810> description<00:01:06.290> I<00:01:06.439> think

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
going to be in the description I think

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.429 
going to be in the description I think
it's<00:01:07.159> pretty<00:01:07.369> neat<00:01:07.790> except<00:01:08.780> for<00:01:08.960> this<00:01:09.200> lava

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
it's pretty neat except for this lava

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.920 
it's pretty neat except for this lava
pool<00:01:09.770> over<00:01:09.980> here<00:01:10.240> it's<00:01:11.240> a<00:01:11.360> pretty<00:01:11.540> nice

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
pool over here it's a pretty nice

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.870 
pool over here it's a pretty nice
landscape<00:01:12.770> to<00:01:12.890> build<00:01:13.070> a<00:01:13.159> city<00:01:13.370> and<00:01:13.460> because

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
landscape to build a city and because

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.330 
landscape to build a city and because
the<00:01:14.090> area<00:01:14.720> is<00:01:14.780> not<00:01:15.080> too<00:01:15.440> mountainy<00:01:16.130> and

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
the area is not too mountainy and

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.790 
the area is not too mountainy and
there's<00:01:16.850> a<00:01:16.940> river<00:01:17.630> and<00:01:17.900> the<00:01:18.170> ocean<00:01:18.409> close<00:01:18.590> by

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
there's a river and the ocean close by

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.830 
there's a river and the ocean close by
so<00:01:19.490> once<00:01:19.670> you've<00:01:19.820> found<00:01:19.970> a<00:01:20.120> good<00:01:20.150> location<00:01:20.570> to

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
so once you've found a good location to

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.210 
so once you've found a good location to
start<00:01:21.050> building<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:21.500> city<00:01:21.710> at<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:21.979> next

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
start building the city at the next

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.920 
start building the city at the next
question<00:01:22.670> is<00:01:22.790> what<00:01:23.300> should<00:01:23.330> be<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:23.690> first

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
question is what should be the first

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.690 
question is what should be the first
building<00:01:24.229> how<00:01:24.650> should<00:01:24.950> you<00:01:25.040> start<00:01:25.370> building

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
building how should you start building

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.520 
building how should you start building
this<00:01:26.030> city<00:01:26.210> and<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.930> answer<00:01:27.110> to<00:01:27.229> that<00:01:27.260> is

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
this city and the answer to that is

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.070 
this city and the answer to that is
quite<00:01:28.040> easy<00:01:28.430> for<00:01:28.550> me<00:01:28.850> I<00:01:29.030> would<00:01:29.659> always<00:01:29.810> start

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
quite easy for me I would always start

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.530 
quite easy for me I would always start
with<00:01:30.380> a<00:01:30.409> central<00:01:30.830> point<00:01:31.190> which<00:01:31.310> does<00:01:32.060> not<00:01:32.270> mean

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
with a central point which does not mean

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.149 
with a central point which does not mean
that<00:01:32.570> this<00:01:32.900> point<00:01:33.170> has<00:01:33.350> to<00:01:33.470> be<00:01:33.500> in<00:01:33.680> the<00:01:33.800> exact

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
that this point has to be in the exact

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.039 
that this point has to be in the exact
center<00:01:34.580> of<00:01:34.610> the<00:01:34.820> city<00:01:35.030> it<00:01:35.479> just<00:01:35.720> means<00:01:35.960> that

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
center of the city it just means that

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:37.960 
center of the city it just means that
this<00:01:36.320> is<00:01:36.409> a<00:01:36.440> really<00:01:36.979> important<00:01:37.490> part<00:01:37.670> where

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
this is a really important part where

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.120 
this is a really important part where
everything<00:01:38.720> of<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:39.170> city<00:01:39.380> develops<00:01:39.890> around

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
everything of the city develops around

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.320 
everything of the city develops around
it<00:01:40.670> so<00:01:41.330> I<00:01:41.780> would<00:01:42.320> absolutely<00:01:42.799> not<00:01:43.340> take<00:01:44.090> a

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
it so I would absolutely not take a

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.830 
it so I would absolutely not take a
circular<00:01:45.049> wall<00:01:45.530> and<00:01:45.830> put<00:01:46.250> like<00:01:46.820> something<00:01:47.659> in

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
circular wall and put like something in

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.350 
circular wall and put like something in
exactly<00:01:48.409> the<00:01:48.619> middle<00:01:48.890> which<00:01:49.400> is<00:01:49.549> totally

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
exactly the middle which is totally

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.730 
exactly the middle which is totally
unnatural<00:01:50.869> or<00:01:51.049> not<00:01:51.170> unnatural<00:01:51.619> but

unnatural or not unnatural but
unrealistic<00:01:53.080> so<00:01:54.080> I<00:01:54.110> would<00:01:54.290> start<00:01:54.500> with<00:01:54.650> a

that was decided by

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.640 
that was decided by
thing<00:02:19.150> called<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.570> town<00:02:19.840> charter<00:02:20.260> or<00:02:20.560> the

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
town law and a Market Square was a huge

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.910 
town law and a Market Square was a huge
accomplishment<00:02:25.330> for<00:02:25.990> that<00:02:26.110> because<00:02:26.290> all<00:02:26.620> the

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
accomplishment for that because all the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.550 
accomplishment for that because all the
traders<00:02:27.340> from<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.060> areas<00:02:28.690> around<00:02:28.810> came<00:02:29.350> to

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
traders from the areas around came to

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.970 
traders from the areas around came to
that<00:02:29.800> spot<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.400> traded<00:02:31.270> their<00:02:31.510> goods<00:02:31.780> and

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
that spot and traded their goods and

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.230 
that spot and traded their goods and
therefore<00:02:32.980> it<00:02:33.160> had<00:02:33.340> a<00:02:33.370> huge<00:02:33.760> commercial

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
therefore it had a huge commercial

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.750 
therefore it had a huge commercial
meaning<00:02:34.810> for<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.170> surrounding<00:02:35.800> areas<00:02:36.130> which

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
meaning for the surrounding areas which

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.240 
meaning for the surrounding areas which
made<00:02:37.000> a<00:02:37.030> Market<00:02:37.420> Square<00:02:37.510> really<00:02:38.080> a<00:02:38.260> one<00:02:39.100> of<00:02:39.190> the

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
most important things as I said so now

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.630 
most important things as I said so now
that<00:02:41.500> you<00:02:41.650> have<00:02:41.680> your<00:02:41.920> central<00:02:42.250> point<00:02:42.460> you

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
that you have your central point you

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.980 
that you have your central point you
want<00:02:42.790> to<00:02:42.820> start<00:02:43.030> expanding<00:02:43.360> to<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:43.600> sides

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
want to start expanding to the sides

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.510 
want to start expanding to the sides
what<00:02:44.320> else<00:02:44.530> is<00:02:44.800> important<00:02:45.280> what<00:02:45.490> other

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
what else is important what other

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.480 
what else is important what other
buildings<00:02:46.240> are<00:02:46.830> necessary<00:02:47.830> to<00:02:48.010> have<00:02:48.190> in<00:02:48.400> a

stuff<00:03:33.670> just<00:03:34.420> you<00:03:35.200> know<00:03:35.320> but<00:03:35.500> but<00:03:35.650> that's<00:03:35.739> a

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
stuff just you know but but that's a

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.460 
stuff just you know but but that's a
ballpark<00:03:36.190> figure<00:03:36.340> it's<00:03:37.270> just<00:03:37.600> like<00:03:38.080> that<00:03:38.230> if

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
ballpark figure it's just like that if

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.360 
ballpark figure it's just like that if
you<00:03:38.560> think<00:03:38.590> about<00:03:38.950> it<00:03:39.100> for<00:03:39.730> example<00:03:40.030> a<00:03:40.270> tailor

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
you think about it for example a tailor

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.880 
you think about it for example a tailor
he<00:03:42.370> hadn't<00:03:42.730> really<00:03:42.940> had<00:03:43.270> the<00:03:43.480> money<00:03:43.780> to<00:03:44.230> buy<00:03:44.650> an

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
he hadn't really had the money to buy an

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.250 
he hadn't really had the money to buy an
extra<00:03:45.220> house<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.790> have<00:03:46.030> all<00:03:46.330> his<00:03:46.510> sewing<00:03:46.840> stuff

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
extra house to have all his sewing stuff

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.440 
extra house to have all his sewing stuff
in<00:03:47.560> there<00:03:47.769> so<00:03:47.980> probably<00:03:48.790> what<00:03:48.910> he<00:03:49.030> did<00:03:49.209> was

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
in there so probably what he did was

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.449 
in there so probably what he did was
that<00:03:49.930> he<00:03:49.989> sold<00:03:50.380> his<00:03:50.530> cloths<00:03:50.860> in<00:03:51.160> his<00:03:51.340> own

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
that he sold his cloths in his own

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.130 
that he sold his cloths in his own
living<00:03:51.730> room<00:03:51.940> if<00:03:52.090> he<00:03:52.180> even<00:03:52.360> had<00:03:52.600> a<00:03:52.630> living<00:03:52.989> room

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
living room if he even had a living room

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.400 
living room if he even had a living room
or<00:03:53.290> in<00:03:53.350> his<00:03:53.590> bedroom<00:03:53.910> so<00:03:54.959> many<00:03:55.959> of<00:03:56.200> the

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
or in his bedroom so many of the

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.890 
or in his bedroom so many of the
craftsmanship<00:03:57.190> could<00:03:57.880> be<00:03:58.060> executed<00:03:58.720> from

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
craftsmanship could be executed from

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.890 
craftsmanship could be executed from
home<00:03:59.290> and<00:03:59.530> therefore<00:04:00.400> you<00:04:00.760> need<00:04:00.940> really<00:04:01.269> a<00:04:01.570> lot

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
home and therefore you need really a lot

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.770 
home and therefore you need really a lot
of<00:04:02.140> residential<00:04:02.980> houses<00:04:03.310> as<00:04:03.700> I<00:04:03.730> said<00:04:04.030> about<00:04:04.330> 60

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
of residential houses as I said about 60

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.229 
of residential houses as I said about 60
to<00:04:04.900> 40<00:04:05.170> percent<00:04:05.470> another<00:04:06.310> really<00:04:06.670> nice<00:04:06.880> thing

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
to 40 percent another really nice thing

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.690 
to 40 percent another really nice thing
is<00:04:07.480> to<00:04:07.780> have<00:04:07.959> all<00:04:08.260> the<00:04:08.470> buildings<00:04:08.830> build

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
is to have all the buildings build

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.190 
is to have all the buildings build
really<00:04:09.940> close<00:04:10.269> together<00:04:10.510> like<00:04:10.780> here<00:04:11.170> for

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
really close together like here for

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.670 
really close together like here for
example<00:04:11.380> that<00:04:12.340> they<00:04:12.940> are<00:04:13.180> like<00:04:13.750> they<00:04:14.019> give

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
example that they are like they give

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.320 
example that they are like they give
this<00:04:14.830> cramped<00:04:15.280> impression<00:04:15.970> of<00:04:16.090> the<00:04:16.180> city

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
this cramped impression of the city

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.130 
this cramped impression of the city
which<00:04:17.049> adds<00:04:17.320> flair<00:04:17.980> to<00:04:18.220> the<00:04:18.340> city<00:04:18.930> also<00:04:19.930> it's

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
which adds flair to the city also it's

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.130 
which adds flair to the city also it's
important<00:04:20.620> to<00:04:20.650> have<00:04:21.090> landmarks<00:04:22.090> like<00:04:22.360> like

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
important to have landmarks like like

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.130 
important to have landmarks like like
for<00:04:23.380> example<00:04:23.440> a<00:04:23.770> ruin<00:04:24.190> a<00:04:24.490> tower<00:04:24.850> a<00:04:25.030> mansion<00:04:25.810> or

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
for example a ruin a tower a mansion or

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.770 
for example a ruin a tower a mansion or
a<00:04:26.169> castle<00:04:26.530> in<00:04:26.950> the<00:04:27.340> city<00:04:27.550> just<00:04:28.180> to<00:04:28.270> break<00:04:28.570> up

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
a castle in the city just to break up

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.650 
a castle in the city just to break up
the<00:04:29.169> town<00:04:29.470> scape<00:04:29.890> a<00:04:29.919> little

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
the town scape a little

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.050 
the town scape a little
another<00:04:31.290> common<00:04:31.770> question<00:04:31.920> is<00:04:32.370> about<00:04:32.490> waltz

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
another common question is about waltz

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.640 
another common question is about waltz
you<00:04:33.450> don't<00:04:33.630> necessarily<00:04:33.720> have<00:04:34.140> to<00:04:34.410> have<00:04:34.620> a

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
you don't necessarily have to have a

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.530 
you don't necessarily have to have a
city<00:04:35.010> wall<00:04:35.250> but<00:04:35.460> it's<00:04:35.610> a<00:04:35.700> nice<00:04:35.850> thing<00:04:36.180> to<00:04:36.210> have

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
city wall but it's a nice thing to have

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.130 
city wall but it's a nice thing to have
on<00:04:36.780> the<00:04:37.410> 100x<00:04:37.980> protection<00:04:38.580> duh<00:04:39.240> and<00:04:39.540> on<00:04:40.020> the

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
on the 100x protection duh and on the

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.380 
on the 100x protection duh and on the
other<00:04:40.260> hand<00:04:40.560> it's<00:04:40.950> a<00:04:41.610> kind<00:04:41.940> of<00:04:42.000> representation

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
other hand it's a kind of representation

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.390 
other hand it's a kind of representation
for<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:43.020> power<00:04:43.320> and<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.560> might<00:04:43.800> of<00:04:43.830> your<00:04:44.160> city

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
for the power and the might of your city

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.610 
for the power and the might of your city
so<00:04:44.610> you<00:04:44.670> kind<00:04:44.970> of<00:04:45.030> want<00:04:45.330> to<00:04:45.390> have<00:04:45.600> one<00:04:45.870> one

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
so you kind of want to have one one

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.110 
so you kind of want to have one one
thing<00:04:46.800> I<00:04:46.860> found<00:04:47.040> out<00:04:47.190> for<00:04:47.340> myself<00:04:47.490> is<00:04:47.880> that<00:04:48.060> I

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
thing I found out for myself is that I

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.210 
thing I found out for myself is that I
prefer<00:04:48.540> building<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:49.020> city<00:04:49.230> first<00:04:49.590> and<00:04:49.830> then

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
prefer building the city first and then

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.950 
prefer building the city first and then
building<00:04:50.910> the<00:04:50.970> city<00:04:51.540> wall

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
building the city wall

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.440 
building the city wall
afterwards<00:04:52.590> around<00:04:53.070> it<00:04:53.250> then<00:04:53.910> doing<00:04:54.150> it<00:04:54.360> the

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
afterwards around it then doing it the

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.780 
afterwards around it then doing it the
other<00:04:54.600> way<00:04:54.780> around<00:04:54.830> because<00:04:55.830> you<00:04:56.220> are<00:04:56.340> simply

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790 
other way around because you are simply

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.730 
other way around because you are simply
more<00:04:57.300> flexible<00:04:57.840> and<00:04:57.960> not<00:04:58.110> bound<00:04:58.380> to<00:04:58.560> the

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
more flexible and not bound to the

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.860 
more flexible and not bound to the
boundaries<00:04:59.190> of<00:04:59.310> the<00:04:59.430> wall<00:04:59.550> another<00:05:00.420> common

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
boundaries of the wall another common

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.170 
boundaries of the wall another common
question<00:05:01.020> is<00:05:01.530> where<00:05:02.070> should<00:05:02.280> I<00:05:02.340> put<00:05:02.640> buildings

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
question is where should I put buildings

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.550 
question is where should I put buildings
how<00:05:03.390> should<00:05:03.570> I<00:05:03.630> know<00:05:03.690> where<00:05:04.110> I<00:05:04.170> should<00:05:04.290> put

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
how should I know where I should put

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.790 
how should I know where I should put
buildings<00:05:05.340> well<00:05:06.300> let<00:05:06.660> me<00:05:06.780> demonstrate<00:05:06.930> it<00:05:07.350> how

buildings well let me demonstrate it how

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.350 
buildings well let me demonstrate it how
