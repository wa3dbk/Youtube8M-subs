the reps with the first team this week
that's<00:01:53.689> going<00:01:53.899> to<00:01:53.960> be<00:01:54.049> a<00:01:54.079> huge<00:01:54.350> advantage<00:01:54.740> for

00:01:54.999 --> 00:01:55.009 
that's going to be a huge advantage for

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.620

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
him and you also have to remember that

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.440

Wallace<00:01:57.109> was<00:01:57.530> you<00:01:57.829> know<00:01:57.979> anointed<00:01:58.969> the<00:01:59.119> backup

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
Wallace was you know anointed the backup

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.450 
Wallace was you know anointed the backup
quarterback<00:01:59.630> late<00:02:00.439> in<00:02:00.649> the<00:02:00.829> game<00:02:01.009> he<00:02:01.280> didn't

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
quarterback late in the game he didn't

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.660 
quarterback late in the game he didn't
even<00:02:01.520> get<00:02:01.759> any<00:02:01.929> preseason<00:02:02.929> uh<00:02:03.499> snaps<00:02:04.399> with

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
even get any preseason uh snaps with

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.300 
even get any preseason uh snaps with
green<00:02:04.909> baize<00:02:05.179> so<00:02:05.570> I<00:02:05.749> think<00:02:06.289> he's<00:02:06.530> going<00:02:07.219> to

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
green baize so I think he's going to

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.070 
green baize so I think he's going to
improve<00:02:07.640> significantly<00:02:07.909> from<00:02:08.630> what<00:02:08.810> we<00:02:08.929> saw

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
improve significantly from what we saw

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.110 
improve significantly from what we saw
on<00:02:09.110> Monday<00:02:09.619> vs<00:02:10.009> chicago<00:02:10.160> just<00:02:10.610> despite<00:02:10.940> the

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
on Monday vs chicago just despite the

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.430 
on Monday vs chicago just despite the
benefit<00:02:11.480> of<00:02:11.540> having<00:02:11.690> a<00:02:11.960> pool<00:02:12.170> we<00:02:12.319> could

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
benefit of having a pool we could

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.410 
benefit of having a pool we could
practice<00:02:12.590> with<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:13.069> first<00:02:13.310> team<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:13.910> also<00:02:14.360> a

the<00:03:07.739> helm<00:03:07.980> not<00:03:08.609> so<00:03:08.760> much<00:03:08.910> from<00:03:09.030> seneca<00:03:09.450> wallace

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
the helm not so much from seneca wallace

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.210 
the helm not so much from seneca wallace
it'll<00:03:09.989> be<00:03:10.049> a<00:03:10.109> much<00:03:10.290> more<00:03:10.470> conservative<00:03:10.829> game

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
it'll be a much more conservative game

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.470 
it'll be a much more conservative game
plan<00:03:11.489> but<00:03:11.879> i<00:03:11.909> think<00:03:12.150> they're<00:03:12.239> going<00:03:12.329> to<00:03:12.420> be

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
you think that there may be due for a

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.339 
you think that there may be due for a
let<00:03:23.159> down<00:03:23.190> here<00:03:23.810> well<00:03:24.810> i<00:03:24.840> thought<00:03:25.109> they<00:03:25.230> were

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
let down here well i thought they were

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:26.869 
let down here well i thought they were
due<00:03:25.500> for<00:03:25.530> a<00:03:25.709> balanced<00:03:26.099> last<00:03:26.310> week<00:03:26.549> that<00:03:26.700> was

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
due for a balanced last week that was

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.879 
due for a balanced last week that was
one<00:03:27.060> of<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.209> main<00:03:27.359> reasons<00:03:27.780> i<00:03:27.870> had<00:03:28.109> the<00:03:28.290> over

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
one of the main reasons i had the over

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:30.559 
one of the main reasons i had the over
in<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.130> game<00:03:29.340> with<00:03:29.609> Oakland<00:03:30.090> I<00:03:30.180> thought<00:03:30.389> that

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
in the game with Oakland I thought that

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.140 
in the game with Oakland I thought that
Philadelphia<00:03:31.230> after<00:03:31.500> you<00:03:32.310> know<00:03:32.430> scoring<00:03:33.060> a

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
Philadelphia after you know scoring a

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.909 
Philadelphia after you know scoring a
lot<00:03:33.180> of<00:03:33.510> points<00:03:33.900> I<00:03:34.019> actually<00:03:34.169> the<00:03:34.440> first<00:03:34.620> five

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
lot of points I actually the first five

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:36.650 
lot of points I actually the first five
weeks<00:03:35.099> the<00:03:35.340> season<00:03:35.760> then<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.000> next<00:03:36.150> two<00:03:36.450> games

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
weeks the season then the next two games

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.330 
weeks the season then the next two games
they<00:03:36.930> were<00:03:36.989> dreadful<00:03:37.590> they<00:03:37.680> scored<00:03:37.950> 10<00:03:38.160> points

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
they were dreadful they scored 10 points

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.220 
they were dreadful they scored 10 points
combined<00:03:38.940> in<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.239> two<00:03:39.389> games<00:03:39.540> right<00:03:39.810> before

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
combined in the two games right before

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.229 
combined in the two games right before
Oakland<00:03:40.769> so<00:03:41.160> they<00:03:41.310> definitely<00:03:41.700> were<00:03:41.879> super<00:03:42.209> a

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
Oakland so they definitely were super a

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.690 
Oakland so they definitely were super a
balance<00:03:42.780> last<00:03:43.049> week<00:03:43.319> and<00:03:43.470> they<00:03:43.620> got<00:03:43.859> that<00:03:44.160> but

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
balance last week and they got that but

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.670 
balance last week and they got that but
I<00:03:44.730> just<00:03:44.970> think<00:03:45.030> right<00:03:45.389> here<00:03:45.660> you<00:03:45.810> know<00:03:45.840> the

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
I just think right here you know the

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.440 
I just think right here you know the
line<00:03:46.980> would<00:03:47.220> have<00:03:47.370> been<00:03:47.549> green<00:03:47.819> bay<00:03:48.000> minus

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
line would have been green bay minus

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.449 
line would have been green bay minus
nine<00:03:48.690> or<00:03:48.900> so<00:03:48.930> if<00:03:49.319> Rogers<00:03:49.709> in<00:03:49.829> the<00:03:49.919> game<00:03:50.129> is<00:03:50.310> now

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
nine or so if Rogers in the game is now

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.909 
nine or so if Rogers in the game is now
two<00:03:50.519> and<00:03:50.730> a<00:03:50.910> half<00:03:51.120> so<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.660> loss<00:03:51.870> of<00:03:52.109> Rogers<00:03:52.590> we

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
two and a half so the loss of Rogers we

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.189 
two and a half so the loss of Rogers we
get<00:03:53.099> compensation<00:03:53.730> for<00:03:53.970> that<00:03:54.209> the<00:03:54.510> line<00:03:54.690> tears

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:55.199 
get compensation for that the line tears

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:57.050 
get compensation for that the line tears
I've<00:03:55.470> got<00:03:55.620> no<00:03:55.769> problem<00:03:55.799> laying<00:03:56.310> under<00:03:56.699> a<00:03:56.730> field

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
I've got no problem laying under a field

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.640 
I've got no problem laying under a field
goal<00:03:57.209> with<00:03:57.269> green<00:03:57.599> bay<00:03:57.750> in<00:03:58.019> this<00:03:58.440> ballgame

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
goal with green bay in this ballgame

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.349 
goal with green bay in this ballgame
with<00:03:58.949> Seneca<00:03:59.340> Wallace<00:03:59.370> so<00:04:00.090> you<00:04:00.180> think<00:04:00.329> that

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
with Seneca Wallace so you think that

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:01.819 
with Seneca Wallace so you think that
the<00:04:00.510> line<00:04:00.750> moving<00:04:00.989> from<00:04:01.230> like<00:04:01.410> you<00:04:01.530> know<00:04:01.590> nine

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
the line moving from like you know nine

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.229 
the line moving from like you know nine
ten<00:04:02.160> all<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:02.430> way<00:04:02.519> down<00:04:02.699> to<00:04:02.730> like<00:04:03.060> you<00:04:03.209> know

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
ten all the way down to like you know

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.819 
ten all the way down to like you know
two<00:04:03.389> or<00:04:03.569> two<00:04:03.810> and<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:03.989> half<00:04:04.109> here<00:04:04.379> is<00:04:04.530> maybe<00:04:04.739> a

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
two or two and a half here is maybe a

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.059 
two or two and a half here is maybe a
bit<00:04:05.010> of<00:04:05.040> an<00:04:05.160> overreaction<00:04:05.370> I<00:04:06.859> would<00:04:07.859> say<00:04:08.010> it's

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
bit of an overreaction I would say it's

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.920 
bit of an overreaction I would say it's
an<00:04:08.190> I<00:04:08.400> think<00:04:08.579> moving<00:04:08.910> from<00:04:09.150> three<00:04:09.449> to<00:04:09.629> two<00:04:09.780> and

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
an I think moving from three to two and

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.210 
an I think moving from three to two and
a<00:04:09.959> half<00:04:10.109> percent<00:04:10.230> of<00:04:10.500> reaction<00:04:10.949> i'm<00:04:11.040> going<00:04:11.160> to

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
a half percent of reaction i'm going to

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.039 
a half percent of reaction i'm going to
put<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.459> line<00:04:11.639> at<00:04:11.819> minus-3<00:04:12.209> right<00:04:12.750> now<00:04:12.900> you're

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
put the line at minus-3 right now you're

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.360 
put the line at minus-3 right now you're
getting<00:04:13.290> two<00:04:13.440> and<00:04:13.560> a<00:04:13.620> half<00:04:13.799> so<00:04:14.010> i<00:04:14.069> think<00:04:14.129> that

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
getting two and a half so i think that

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.580 
getting two and a half so i think that
there's<00:04:14.760> definitely<00:04:15.389> valued<00:04:15.810> their<00:04:16.079> minus

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
there's definitely valued their minus

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.319 
there's definitely valued their minus
two<00:04:16.709> and<00:04:16.739> a<00:04:16.859> half<00:04:17.010> or<00:04:17.190> less<00:04:17.220> all<00:04:17.820> right<00:04:18.060> I'll

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
two and a half or less all right I'll

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:19.909 
two and a half or less all right I'll
mcmurtrey<00:04:18.810> making<00:04:19.019> a<00:04:19.049> very<00:04:19.260> compelling<00:04:19.590> case

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
mcmurtrey making a very compelling case

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.949
