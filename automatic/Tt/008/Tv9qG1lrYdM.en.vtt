Harbor Coast Guard Station we're coming
down<00:00:41.460> they're<00:00:41.670> gonna<00:00:41.730> be<00:00:41.879> breaking<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.329> ice

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
down they're gonna be breaking the ice

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.869 
down they're gonna be breaking the ice
allowing<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.469> rest<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.219> ice<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.399> flow

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.000 
allowing the rest of the ice to flow
through<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.870> wasn't<00:00:46.590> causing<00:00:46.770> any<00:00:46.980> more

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
through so wasn't causing any more

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.979 
through so wasn't causing any more
flooding<00:00:47.399> than<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.670> already<00:00:47.760> has<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.840> that's

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
flooding than it already has so that's

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.000 
flooding than it already has so that's
