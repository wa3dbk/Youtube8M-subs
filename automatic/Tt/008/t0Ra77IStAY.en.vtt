00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
and what it's on but it's it's pretty

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.870 
and what it's on but it's it's pretty
hard<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.200> be<00:01:52.409> honest<00:01:52.680> with<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:52.979> I'm<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.430> don't

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
hard to be honest with you I'm I don't

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.719 
hard to be honest with you I'm I don't
think<00:01:54.090> it's<00:01:54.210> on<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.360> basic<00:01:54.930> difficulty<00:01:55.729> and

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
think it's on the basic difficulty and

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.700 
think it's on the basic difficulty and
the<00:01:56.969> game<00:01:57.180> does<00:01:57.420> offer<00:01:57.689> challenges<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.560> can

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
the game does offer challenges you can

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.010 
the game does offer challenges you can
see<00:01:58.890> here<00:01:59.130> we<00:01:59.340> jump<00:01:59.729> right<00:02:00.119> into<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.750> first

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
see here we jump right into the first

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.050 
see here we jump right into the first
overtime<00:02:02.149> gear<00:02:03.149> down<00:02:03.409> 49-42<00:02:04.409> in<00:02:04.740> overtime<00:02:05.700> one

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
overtime gear down 49-42 in overtime one

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.990 
overtime gear down 49-42 in overtime one
and<00:02:06.299> again<00:02:06.960> just<00:02:07.259> like<00:02:07.500> against<00:02:08.390> Oregon<00:02:09.390> last

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
and again just like against Oregon last

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.960 
and again just like against Oregon last
we<00:02:10.119> this<00:02:10.929> USC<00:02:11.560> team<00:02:11.770> is<00:02:11.980> having<00:02:12.190> an<00:02:12.430> awfully

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
we this USC team is having an awfully

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.720 
we this USC team is having an awfully
hard<00:02:13.240> time<00:02:13.570> tackling<00:02:14.350> our<00:02:14.710> receivers<00:02:15.280> after

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
hard time tackling our receivers after

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.800 
hard time tackling our receivers after
the<00:02:15.850> catch<00:02:16.120> but<00:02:17.370> you<00:02:18.370> know<00:02:18.460> that<00:02:19.270> is<00:02:19.420> something

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
the catch but you know that is something

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.360 
the catch but you know that is something
I'll<00:02:20.170> take<00:02:20.530> I'll<00:02:20.710> take<00:02:20.770> that<00:02:21.070> if<00:02:21.220> they're

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
I'll take I'll take that if they're

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.700 
I'll take I'll take that if they're
having<00:02:21.610> trouble<00:02:22.000> tackling<00:02:22.210> no<00:02:23.140> big<00:02:23.410> deal<00:02:23.650> for

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
having trouble tackling no big deal for

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.500 
having trouble tackling no big deal for
me<00:02:24.040> as<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:25.420> now<00:02:26.250> our<00:02:27.250> coach<00:02:27.640> Trust<00:02:28.030> is<00:02:28.240> all<00:02:28.390> the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
me as of now our coach Trust is all the

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.270 
me as of now our coach Trust is all the
way<00:02:28.630> up<00:02:28.780> there<00:02:28.959> as<00:02:29.140> well<00:02:29.350> I<00:02:29.380> kinda<00:02:29.890> I<00:02:30.010> probably

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
way up there as well I kinda I probably

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.780 
way up there as well I kinda I probably
could<00:02:30.550> have<00:02:30.580> through<00:02:30.850> that<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.270> circle<00:02:31.780> but<00:02:32.560> I

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
could have through that to circle but I

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.970 
could have through that to circle but I
decided<00:02:33.790> to<00:02:34.000> run<00:02:34.209> that<00:02:34.390> in<00:02:34.600> and<00:02:34.780> dive<00:02:34.990> in<00:02:35.320> 46

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
decided to run that in and dive in 46

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.760 
decided to run that in and dive in 46
points<00:02:36.220> we<00:02:37.060> kick<00:02:37.330> the<00:02:37.480> field<00:02:37.720> goal<00:02:37.870> it's<00:02:38.470> good

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
points we kick the field goal it's good

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.580 
points we kick the field goal it's good
so<00:02:39.010> we<00:02:39.190> get<00:02:39.490> the<00:02:39.760> ball<00:02:40.000> back<00:02:40.240> to<00:02:41.020> start<00:02:41.380> the

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
so we get the ball back to start the

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.350 
so we get the ball back to start the
second<00:02:42.160> overtime<00:02:42.430> off<00:02:42.910> and<00:02:44.280> I<00:02:45.280> didn't<00:02:46.180> think

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
second overtime off and I didn't think

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.030 
second overtime off and I didn't think
this<00:02:46.540> was<00:02:46.750> ever<00:02:46.900> gonna<00:02:47.170> end<00:02:47.410> to<00:02:47.680> be<00:02:47.800> honest

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
this was ever gonna end to be honest

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.650 
this was ever gonna end to be honest
with<00:02:48.160> you<00:02:48.310> I<00:02:48.340> was<00:02:48.489> like<00:02:48.610> it<00:02:49.120> was<00:02:49.270> back<00:02:49.450> and

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
with you I was like it was back and

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.390 
with you I was like it was back and
forth<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:50.020> entire<00:02:50.410> game<00:02:50.680> I<00:02:50.739> thought<00:02:51.100> we<00:02:51.250> were

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
forth the entire game I thought we were

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.630 
forth the entire game I thought we were
just<00:02:51.550> gonna<00:02:52.200> play<00:02:53.200> all<00:02:53.440> night<00:02:53.650> I<00:02:53.680> thought<00:02:54.310> to

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
just gonna play all night I thought to

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.460 
just gonna play all night I thought to
be<00:02:54.730> honest<00:02:54.940> with<00:02:55.090> you<00:02:55.150> I<00:02:55.420> thought<00:02:56.170> we<00:02:56.350> were

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
be honest with you I thought we were

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.770 
be honest with you I thought we were
going<00:02:56.590> to<00:02:56.620> go<00:02:56.830> into<00:02:57.010> 10<00:02:57.850> /<00:02:58.180> times<00:02:58.390> but<00:02:58.630> then<00:02:58.750> I

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
going to go into 10 / times but then I

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.449 
going to go into 10 / times but then I
forgot<00:02:59.080> that<00:02:59.200> you<00:02:59.410> had<00:02:59.440> to<00:02:59.709> go<00:02:59.860> for<00:03:00.070> two<00:03:00.190> later

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
forgot that you had to go for two later

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:03.240 
forgot that you had to go for two later
on<00:03:00.670> after<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.810> first<00:03:02.050> two<00:03:02.320> so<00:03:02.650> kind<00:03:03.040> of<00:03:03.100> made

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
on after the first two so kind of made

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.920 
on after the first two so kind of made
it<00:03:03.370> hard<00:03:03.940> I<00:03:04.030> kind<00:03:04.270> of<00:03:04.300> made<00:03:04.480> it<00:03:04.630> challenging

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
it hard I kind of made it challenging

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.040 
it hard I kind of made it challenging
which<00:03:05.830> is<00:03:06.010> something<00:03:06.280> nice<00:03:06.730> to<00:03:07.540> see<00:03:07.750> from

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
which is something nice to see from

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.080 
which is something nice to see from
these<00:03:08.200> games<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:08.800> unlike<00:03:09.489> baseball<00:03:09.910> this

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
these games and unlike baseball this

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.300 
these games and unlike baseball this
game<00:03:10.300> does<00:03:10.540> offer<00:03:10.840> a<00:03:11.290> lot<00:03:11.860> of<00:03:11.980> challenge

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
game does offer a lot of challenge

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.949 
game does offer a lot of challenge
because<00:03:12.610> it<00:03:12.730> is<00:03:12.850> something<00:03:13.060> new<00:03:13.360> for<00:03:13.390> me<00:03:13.630> as<00:03:13.750> we

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
because it is something new for me as we

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.920 
because it is something new for me as we
hit<00:03:14.200> circle<00:03:15.040> wide<00:03:15.250> open<00:03:15.640> there<00:03:15.790> he<00:03:16.390> just<00:03:16.600> cuts

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
hit circle wide open there he just cuts

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.370 
hit circle wide open there he just cuts
it<00:03:17.140> outside<00:03:17.560> for<00:03:17.860> some<00:03:18.070> more<00:03:18.370> and<00:03:19.380> really

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
it outside for some more and really

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.410 
it outside for some more and really
putting<00:03:20.739> this<00:03:20.830> on<00:03:21.040> top<00:03:21.310> here<00:03:21.610> we<00:03:21.790> really<00:03:22.120> felt

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
putting this on top here we really felt

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.289 
putting this on top here we really felt
good<00:03:22.480> we<00:03:22.750> got<00:03:22.900> a<00:03:22.959> lot<00:03:23.260> of<00:03:23.290> these<00:03:23.500> games<00:03:23.940> at<00:03:24.940> home

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
good we got a lot of these games at home

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.670 
good we got a lot of these games at home
against<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:25.870> ranked<00:03:26.200> opponents<00:03:26.620> as<00:03:26.709> you<00:03:27.519> saw

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
against the ranked opponents as you saw

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.110 
against the ranked opponents as you saw
we've<00:03:29.680> played<00:03:29.950> Oregon<00:03:30.430> at<00:03:30.549> home<00:03:30.760> we<00:03:30.910> played

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
we've played Oregon at home we played

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.030 
we've played Oregon at home we played
Stanford<00:03:31.690> home<00:03:31.870> I<00:03:31.900> know<00:03:32.080> we<00:03:32.290> lost<00:03:32.410> a<00:03:32.590> Stanford

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
Stanford home I know we lost a Stanford

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.740 
Stanford home I know we lost a Stanford
which<00:03:33.160> was<00:03:33.310> a<00:03:33.340> hard<00:03:33.640> loss<00:03:33.820> as<00:03:34.030> we<00:03:34.120> hated<00:03:34.480> right

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
which was a hard loss as we hated right

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.979 
which was a hard loss as we hated right
up<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:35.019> mill<00:03:35.200> here<00:03:35.640> for<00:03:36.640> six<00:03:37.120> more<00:03:37.420> points<00:03:37.720> we

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
up the mill here for six more points we

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.819 
up the mill here for six more points we
take<00:03:38.230> the<00:03:38.350> lead<00:03:38.530> 55<00:03:39.280> to<00:03:40.120> 49<00:03:40.959> so<00:03:41.320> it's<00:03:41.590> looking

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
take the lead 55 to 49 so it's looking

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.050 
take the lead 55 to 49 so it's looking
pretty<00:03:42.400> for<00:03:43.299> the<00:03:43.360> Utah<00:03:43.780> Utes<00:03:44.380> but<00:03:45.280> you<00:03:45.910> know
