 auth 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.110
 So 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.560
 auto atp in the story and yourself in the diploma 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:13.360
 for various reasons not to avoid mention 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.339
 diablo 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:16.660
 Firstly because we are far from 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.859
 perfect but then it comes from 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.220
 blizzard nose is primarily caused 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.779
 association with the phenomenal 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:24.559
 eleven years of success 

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:25.649
 prescription 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:28.649
 and yet we have them apples mide 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:31.339
 unlikely to be the plot basis 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:33.069
 seem to someone original 

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:35.079
 London must open the gates 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.699
 the address of which hordes of demons died 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:39.539
 main character cart 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.689
 the leadership of the player will play in 

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:43.740
 unfolding conflict 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.140
 into the role and ultimately save the world from 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.260
 terrible threat 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.610
 this ingenuous start screenwriters and 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.390
 designer beat up beautiful and tasteful 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.320
 the shapeless ruins are barely 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.370
 guess the outlines of quarters 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.149
 London 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.989
 old streets filled 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:00:59.770
 monsters 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.590
 of all stripes 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.640
 the role of refuge for surviving residents 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.820
 English capital perform stations 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.140
 the oldest metro in the world is possible 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.830
 the atmosphere is hardly capable of keeping 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.280
 player in constant tension but 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.729
 style designers are not 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.280
 will refuse 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.049
 the game starts with the traditional 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:19.530
 generating your own 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.860
 character after you define 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.240
 an appearance that would satisfy your 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.670
 esthetically musk 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.909
 will have to make a choice between six 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.350
 class it seems to me it is each of the classes 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.759
 has his gear skills 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.070
 and ultimately battle tactics 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.730
 so the arrows can hit the enemy 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.220
 at a distance of demonology 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.450
 subdues enemy monsters 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.500
 single mode is pretty typical and 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.909
 is unlikely to surprise you with anything 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.329
 you will make a mistake if you immediately start learning 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:50.909
 multiplayer in which without 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.950
 the main emphasis is made joint 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.869
 the passage is really 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.460
 perform brew then significantly 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.829
 more interesting by joining in 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:59.840
 groups with other players skills 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.890
 different classes are perfectly capable 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.009
 complement each other they are useful 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.069
 his mate subjects can 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.259
 perfect to your character 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.669
 to the word about inventory 

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.419
 after his death is regularly left 

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:14.090
 trophy 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.680
 among which you can find a lot 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.220
 the most diverse things themselves sometimes 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.529
 to themselves they do not possess serious value 

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:22.699
 however the original build system 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:23.370
 items 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.110
 will allow you to create unique 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.610
 modifications that make life easier 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.239
 further 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.549
 London residents are unlikely to recognize their native 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:32.560
 choose a city 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.860
 and not only because of 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.270
 its pretty here walked level all 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.860
 able london generated 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.280
 randomly 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.360
 however too with skin tangled 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.430
 they can not be called for good reason 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.860
 grieves only the fact that flying designer 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.600
 thoughts we also observe not 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.600
 have to 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:55.239
 technological breakthrough body diploma 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.780
 of course will not realize 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.630
 the game looks pretty average 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.120
 also contains a lot of 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.359
 flaws and conventional banks 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.149
 now the developers started 

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:05.559
 correct why 

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:06.809
 however initial 

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:07.819
 impression 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:09.939
 somewhat spoiled 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:11.689
 anyway fans er 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:13.430
 the program will be able to evaluate 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.349
 hellgate identity london don't let it be diablo 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:17.250
 in a new way 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.360
 but your face 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.740
 too worth it
