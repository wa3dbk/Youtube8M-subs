 Minsk in the late evening the meeting took place 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.340
 in a one- to-one format she 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.320
 lasted two hours and both ended up 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.630
 the president was commented rather sparingly 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.020
 nevertheless in the west very carefully 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.130
 listened to the words of Putin and Poroshenko 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.410
 comment on the outcome of the negotiations we 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.340
 asked two European experts on 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.440

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.690
 In Innsbruck In Austria, Gerhard Manga 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.750
 the 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.090
 and that's what they said from the bush is fate 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.250
 school cup from the good that chapters two 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.440
 states are negotiating well what 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.900
 Poroshenko said he would introduce 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.880
 truce plan 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:57.709
 there will be a positive result 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:03:00.810
 option on positivism, tsvetan described 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.489
 results match up modest expectations 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.950
 three directions there is not much success 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.440
 firstly the negotiations will continue with 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.870
 Russia about the consequences of the agreement on 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.820
 Association of Ukraine with the European Union here 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.250
 Russia is seeking protection measures and and 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.530
 Secondly, the economy will negotiate 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.440
 Minister of Energy of Russia and Ukraine with 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.720
 Commissioner with these mountains in Moscow to 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.209
 settle gas disputes between both 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.430
 countries and thirdly it is renewing 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.579
 negotiations in contact group b 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.370
 with e where russia ukraine representative b s 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.290
 e and separatists can agree on 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.290
 truce 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.120
 now lucky few hours before 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.790
 meeting in Minsk received a message stating 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.100
 that the Ukrainian security forces captured 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.100
 Russian paratroopers Kiev considered 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.910
 this fact is another proof 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.220
 direct participation of Russia in 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.320
 the conflict in the east of Ukraine Vladimir 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.519
 Putin repeated the allegations of the Ministry of Defense 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.560
 that the paratroopers 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.540
 supposedly got lost did not make it clear that 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.790
 Moscow does not consider itself a party 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.620
 conflict in the east of Ukraine and does not want 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.370
 participate in termination negotiations 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.680
 fire we can not here we are Russia 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.409
 can't talk about any conditions 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.230
 possible ceasefires 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:15.750
 agreements between Kiev Donetsk and 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:19.380
 Luhansk is not our business is in 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.290
 Ukraineâ€™s internal affairs interviewed 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.520
 we are skeptical Western experts 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.560
 responded to these words of Putin, they 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.760
 believe that this position of the Kremlin is not 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:32.580
 contributes to the escalation of the conflict sign 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.160
 and intestine sherry din response complicates 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.830
 negotiations and of course everyone knows that 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.780
 Russia with its military intervention 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.669
 plays an important role in the conflict remains 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.889
 hope that in the framework of the so-called 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.330
 contact group everything where there is and 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.460
 Russian representatives 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.810
 they will participate in regular 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.180
 negotiations in Minsk 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.940
 although Putin pretends that Russia is here 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:55.560
 nothing to do with what he wants peace 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.430
 in Ukraine and the conflict itself is not 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.380
 intervenes 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.600
 but in Russian society in every 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.520
 the case in social networks is increasingly active 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.280
 there is a discussion why then 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.380
 the bodies of Russian soldiers are not mercenaries or 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.210
 volunteers attila military personnel 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.490
 come from Ukraine to Russia 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:14.160
 why do you have to keep soldiers 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.550
 the official version of Russia in battles is not 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.810
 participate 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.430
 Putin Mr. Putin said that 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.830
 conflict resolution in the east 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.380
 Ukraine did Ukraine he is not 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.539
 intervene but this is not true because Russia 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.510
 wages war with Ukraine on the territory 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:31.590
 Ukraine there are Russian soldiers 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.240
 Russia directly carries 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.430
 responsible for what happens there 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.729
 and could take care of fast 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.500
 Conflict Resolution Chancellor FRG 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:42.180
 angel merkel today on the phone 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.599
 discussed with President Petro Poroshenko 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.490
 conflict in the east of Ukraine the role of Russia 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:49.500
 and the outcome of the negotiations in Minsk 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.900
 if Moscow still does not make concessions 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.039
 what can the west do and in particular 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.260
 EU countries 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:56.310
 can they eventually tighten the sanctions 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.620
 against Russia 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:02.340
 that's what they say about it 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:04.590
 European experts sharpened and force 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.449
 cut off roads or milongas and sanctions 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.940
 European Union there are supporters of further 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:10.919
 tightening sanctions namely input 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.740
 direct sanctions against individual industries 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:14.410
 of the economy 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.300
 but among the industrialists of Germany and even 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.910
 other EU countries sound louder 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.190
 other voices they say we already feel 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.080
 negative effects of the sanctions both for 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.530
 economic growth so for the market 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.900
 labor 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:28.840
 so do not need new sanctions which 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.639
 only exacerbate the situation and then in fact 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:34.270
 European economy can start 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:36.190
 recession so i don't believe that in 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:39.069
 new sanctions will follow soon 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:41.319
 unless of course russia starts open and 

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:44.830
 large-scale military intervention on 

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:47.169
 Ukraine so with u now a little 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:50.800
 tools pressure on russia wrote 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:52.900
 art for vaness month break 20 Zahar 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.220
 water if you didn't want anything yet 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.050
 take to prevent 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.789
 escalation but there will be Russia 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.449
 directly engage in hostilities 

00:06:57.789 --> 00:06:59.830
 in Ukraine 

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:02.919
 then additional 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:05.860
 it will inevitably give sanctions and stuck it 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:08.050
 grabbed the development of events and also about 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:10.419
