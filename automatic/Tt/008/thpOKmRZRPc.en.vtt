I'm<00:00:55.000> still<00:00:55.059> trying<00:00:55.449> to<00:00:55.480> figure<00:00:55.660> this<00:00:55.839> thing

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
I'm still trying to figure this thing

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:59.719 
I'm still trying to figure this thing
out<00:00:56.230> I<00:00:56.530> haven't<00:00:57.460> played<00:00:57.610> with<00:00:57.640> it<00:00:57.820> a<00:00:57.850> whole<00:00:58.030> lot

00:00:59.719 --> 00:00:59.729 
out I haven't played with it a whole lot

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:04.139 
out I haven't played with it a whole lot
tons<00:01:00.729> of<00:01:00.820> parameters<00:01:02.760> differently<00:01:03.760> gauges

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:04.149 
tons of parameters differently gauges

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:06.920 
tons of parameters differently gauges
you<00:01:04.269> can<00:01:04.420> do<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:05.710> shows<00:01:06.040> two<00:01:06.310> at<00:01:06.399> the<00:01:06.430> same<00:01:06.640> time

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
you can do it shows two at the same time

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.899 
you can do it shows two at the same time
you<00:01:07.930> can<00:01:08.080> actually<00:01:08.409> have<00:01:08.590> it<00:01:08.710> scan<00:01:09.159> as<00:01:09.430> well

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
you can actually have it scan as well

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:11.219 
you can actually have it scan as well
but<00:01:10.119> every<00:01:10.360> eight<00:01:10.450> seconds<00:01:10.869> it<00:01:10.960> will<00:01:11.020> flip

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
but every eight seconds it will flip

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.499 
but every eight seconds it will flip
through<00:01:11.440> two<00:01:11.680> more<00:01:11.979> or<00:01:12.820> you<00:01:12.940> can<00:01:13.090> manually

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
through two more or you can manually

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:19.469 
through two more or you can manually
choose<00:01:13.920> what<00:01:14.920> you<00:01:14.950> want<00:01:18.030> just<00:01:19.030> kind<00:01:19.179> of<00:01:19.270> show

I'm fighting off cold here the mount
that<00:02:30.410> I<00:02:30.500> used<00:02:31.840> is<00:02:33.519> actually<00:02:34.519> a<00:02:34.550> steering<00:02:35.300> gauge

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
that I used is actually a steering gauge

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.740 
that I used is actually a steering gauge
pod<00:02:37.120> steering<00:02:38.120> column<00:02:38.330> gauge<00:02:38.510> pod<00:02:38.780> for<00:02:39.590> at<00:02:39.680> 97

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
pod steering column gauge pod for at 97

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.780 
pod steering column gauge pod for at 97
2014<00:02:41.750> to<00:02:41.930> f-150<00:02:42.709> I<00:02:42.890> believe<00:02:43.340> are<00:02:43.489> the<00:02:43.519> years

for this thing i like it i bought enough
summit<00:02:48.050> I<00:02:48.170> think<00:02:48.350> for<00:02:48.500> like<00:02:48.590> 25<00:02:49.070> or<00:02:49.130> 30<00:02:49.489> bucks

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
summit I think for like 25 or 30 bucks

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.400 
summit I think for like 25 or 30 bucks
worth<00:02:52.100> it<00:02:52.280> for<00:02:52.430> like<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:53.000> OEM<00:02:53.390> cool<00:02:53.900> factor

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
worth it for like the OEM cool factor
