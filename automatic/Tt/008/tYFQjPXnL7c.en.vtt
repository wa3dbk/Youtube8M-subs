would like to apologize for being unable
to<00:00:11.460> post<00:00:11.759> my<00:00:12.059> video<00:00:12.330> last<00:00:12.840> week<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.500> that's

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
to post my video last week and that's

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.770 
to post my video last week and that's
because<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.070> was<00:00:14.309> in<00:00:14.460> Berlin<00:00:14.820> on<00:00:15.059> some<00:00:15.330> business

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
because I was in Berlin on some business

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.290 
because I was in Berlin on some business
and<00:00:16.020> I<00:00:16.949> didn't<00:00:17.220> have<00:00:17.400> good<00:00:17.880> internet

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
and I didn't have good internet

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.300 
and I didn't have good internet
connection<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:19.170> that's<00:00:19.380> why<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.740> was<00:00:20.039> unable

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
connection and that's why I was unable

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.590 
connection and that's why I was unable
to<00:00:20.520> upload<00:00:21.740> my<00:00:22.740> home<00:00:23.130> video<00:00:23.430> but<00:00:24.240> don't<00:00:24.420> worry

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
to upload my home video but don't worry

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.720 
to upload my home video but don't worry
about<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.930> I'm<00:00:25.019> going<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.470> post<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.099> on<00:00:26.250> one<00:00:26.699> of

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
about it I'm going to post it on one of

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.830 
about it I'm going to post it on one of
the<00:00:27.029> following<00:00:27.240> Saturdays<00:00:27.990> so<00:00:28.560> don't<00:00:29.160> think

and the science that we currently have
for<00:01:08.460> example<00:01:08.549> it<00:01:09.060> can<00:01:09.270> be<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.420> toll<00:01:09.689> portation

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
for example it can be a toll portation

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.800 
for example it can be a toll portation

that are in The Hunger Games series

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.080 
that are in The Hunger Games series
that's<00:01:24.659> also<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.080> part<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.590> science<00:01:26.400> fiction

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
that's also a part of science fiction

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.190 
that's also a part of science fiction
it's<00:01:27.360> like<00:01:27.659> devices<00:01:28.320> that<00:01:28.530> are<00:01:29.270> we're<00:01:30.270> able<00:01:30.630> to

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
it's like devices that are we're able to

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.550 
it's like devices that are we're able to
produce<00:01:31.409> right<00:01:32.340> now<00:01:32.579> with<00:01:33.030> our<00:01:33.540> with<00:01:34.530> the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
produce right now with our with the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.429 
produce right now with our with the
means<00:01:35.009> we<00:01:35.850> have<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.540> that's<00:01:36.990> basically

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
means we have and that's basically

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.359 
means we have and that's basically
because<00:01:37.740> our<00:01:38.250> science<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:38.970> not<00:01:39.180> as<00:01:39.390> advanced

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 
because our science is not as advanced

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.450 
because our science is not as advanced
concerning<00:01:41.369> of<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:42.680> limitations<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
concerning of the limitations of the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.899 
concerning of the limitations of the
laws<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.939> physics<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.780> we<00:01:46.470> have<00:01:46.950> discovered

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
laws of physics that we have discovered

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.980 
laws of physics that we have discovered
the<00:01:48.780> reason<00:01:48.990> I'm<00:01:49.409> here<00:01:49.829> today<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:50.990> curly

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
the reason I'm here today in this curly

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.859 
the reason I'm here today in this curly
hair<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.670> makeup<00:01:53.670> which<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.329> don't<00:01:54.479> think<00:01:54.780> you

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
hair and makeup which I don't think you

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.760 
hair and makeup which I don't think you
can<00:01:55.049> really<00:01:55.799> see<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:57.180> clearly<00:01:57.810> in<00:01:58.229> this

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
can really see it that clearly in this

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.429 
can really see it that clearly in this
camera<00:02:00.049> I'm<00:02:01.049> like<00:02:01.729> so<00:02:02.729> full<00:02:03.149> with<00:02:03.540> like<00:02:03.869> gold

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
camera I'm like so full with like gold

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:10.050 
camera I'm like so full with like gold
and<00:02:04.890> silver<00:02:05.520> all<00:02:06.420> over<00:02:06.780> my<00:02:07.350> naked<00:02:07.619> body

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.149 

basically<00:02:11.060> because<00:02:11.359> to<00:02:12.230> me<00:02:12.349> science<00:02:12.709> fiction

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:13.159 
basically because to me science fiction

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:15.819 
basically because to me science fiction
can<00:02:13.459> be<00:02:13.579> something<00:02:13.849> that<00:02:14.540> defies<00:02:14.959> basically

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:15.829 
can be something that defies basically

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:20.470 
can be something that defies basically
any<00:02:16.540> logic<00:02:17.540> and<00:02:17.810> that<00:02:18.799> can<00:02:19.219> be<00:02:19.370> like<00:02:19.609> something

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
any logic and that can be like something

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.670 
any logic and that can be like something
gobbling<00:02:21.290> such<00:02:22.099> as<00:02:22.340> angels<00:02:22.999> and<00:02:23.389> that's<00:02:24.200> where

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
gobbling such as angels and that's where

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.750 
gobbling such as angels and that's where
I<00:02:24.709> draw<00:02:25.099> inspiration<00:02:25.250> from<00:02:26.030> my<00:02:26.209> looks

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
I draw inspiration from my looks

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.599 
I draw inspiration from my looks
yeah<00:02:28.760> contrary<00:02:29.629> to<00:02:29.840> popular<00:02:30.319> belief<00:02:30.560> I<00:02:31.250> don't

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:31.609 
yeah contrary to popular belief I don't

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:34.089 
yeah contrary to popular belief I don't
draw<00:02:31.939> inspiration<00:02:32.780> for<00:02:32.989> my<00:02:33.170> looks<00:02:33.439> from<00:02:33.680> anime

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
draw inspiration for my looks from anime

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.300 
draw inspiration for my looks from anime
and<00:02:34.969> to<00:02:35.389> me<00:02:35.510> anime<00:02:35.810> is<00:02:35.870> a<00:02:35.959> wonderful<00:02:36.469> media<00:02:36.829> but

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
and to me anime is a wonderful media but

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.099 
and to me anime is a wonderful media but
for<00:02:37.609> me<00:02:37.730> that's<00:02:37.939> only<00:02:38.269> like<00:02:38.950> inspiring<00:02:39.950> me<00:02:40.310> to
