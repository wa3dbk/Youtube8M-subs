00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
what so how strong thousand these

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.630 
what so how strong thousand these
transmitters<00:02:46.200> are<00:02:46.500> because<00:02:46.860> look<00:02:47.100> as<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:47.430> see

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
transmitters are because look as you see

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.850 
transmitters are because look as you see
the<00:02:47.790> signal<00:02:48.030> bar<00:02:48.360> it's<00:02:49.110> being<00:02:49.380> established

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
the signal bar it's being established

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.800 
the signal bar it's being established
already<00:02:50.340> so<00:02:50.670> they've<00:02:50.910> open<00:02:51.510> it

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
already so they've open it

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.410 
already so they've open it
but<00:02:52.620> they're<00:02:52.800> hurting<00:02:53.010> it<00:02:53.280> or<00:02:53.490> once<00:02:54.240> it's

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
but they're hurting it or once it's

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.650 
but they're hurting it or once it's
destroyed<00:02:54.570> it's<00:02:54.990> all<00:02:55.170> about<00:02:55.380> what<00:02:55.590> 4,000<00:02:56.340> feet

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
destroyed it's all about what 4,000 feet

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.780 
destroyed it's all about what 4,000 feet
that's<00:02:57.660> how<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:57.959> have<00:02:58.110> to<00:02:58.200> protect<00:02:58.610> so<00:02:59.610> yeah

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
that's how you have to protect so yeah

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.960 
that's how you have to protect so yeah
so<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.120> tip<00:03:00.300> is<00:03:00.330> really<00:03:00.690> just<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.640> look<00:03:02.640> on<00:03:02.820> the

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
so the tip is really just to look on the

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.640 
so the tip is really just to look on the
mini-map<00:03:04.340> just<00:03:05.340> the<00:03:05.670> heads-up<00:03:05.970> display<00:03:06.650> and

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
mini-map just the heads-up display and

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.320 
mini-map just the heads-up display and
in<00:03:07.769> just<00:03:07.980> anticipate<00:03:08.550> where<00:03:08.700> those<00:03:08.880> duties

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
in just anticipate where those duties

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.280 
in just anticipate where those duties
will<00:03:09.600> be<00:03:09.630> coming<00:03:10.610> and<00:03:11.610> it<00:03:11.790> just<00:03:12.030> shoots<00:03:12.290> into

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
will be coming and it just shoots into

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.340 
will be coming and it just shoots into
the<00:03:13.590> path<00:03:13.940> that<00:03:14.940> they'll<00:03:15.120> be<00:03:15.239> going<00:03:15.360> here<00:03:15.720> that

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
the path that they'll be going here that

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.770 
the path that they'll be going here that
they'll<00:03:16.530> be<00:03:16.650> headed<00:03:16.950> into<00:03:17.420> if<00:03:18.420> that<00:03:18.630> main

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
they'll be headed into if that main

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.270 
they'll be headed into if that main
sensor<00:03:19.110> don't<00:03:19.320> shoot<00:03:19.500> it<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:19.769> right<00:03:19.920> into<00:03:20.190> the

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
sensor don't shoot it to right into the

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.729 
sensor don't shoot it to right into the
plane<00:03:20.660> now<00:03:21.660> shoot<00:03:21.930> see<00:03:22.080> the<00:03:22.200> pulse<00:03:22.470> of<00:03:22.620> the

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
plane now shoot see the pulse of the

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.500 
plane now shoot see the pulse of the
plane<00:03:22.950> could<00:03:23.160> just<00:03:23.310> go<00:03:23.550> head<00:03:23.850> straight<00:03:24.239> into

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
plane could just go head straight into

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.650 
plane could just go head straight into
the<00:03:24.780> bullets<00:03:25.820> now<00:03:26.820> bunch<00:03:27.120> of<00:03:27.239> free

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
the bullets now bunch of free

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.350 
the bullets now bunch of free
order<00:03:29.350> order<00:03:31.230> yeah<00:03:32.230> it<00:03:32.710> so<00:03:32.830> fell<00:03:33.240> missed<00:03:34.240> a

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
order order yeah it so fell missed a

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.990 
order order yeah it so fell missed a
little<00:03:34.540> bit<00:03:34.920> check<00:03:35.920> those<00:03:36.610> off

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
little bit check those off

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.500 
little bit check those off
oh<00:03:37.030> yeah<00:03:38.400> now<00:03:39.400> bill<00:03:39.670> signals<00:03:40.120> get<00:03:40.300> hurt

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
oh yeah now bill signals get hurt

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:41.270 
oh yeah now bill signals get hurt
already

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
already

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.130 
already
but<00:03:42.280> say<00:03:42.460> yeah<00:03:42.670> so<00:03:42.850> just<00:03:43.000> keep<00:03:43.240> going<00:03:43.780> skip

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
but say yeah so just keep going skip

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.020 
but say yeah so just keep going skip
good<00:03:44.350> and<00:03:44.590> see<00:03:44.770> the<00:03:44.860> time<00:03:45.100> is<00:03:45.280> counting<00:03:45.400> down

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
good and see the time is counting down

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.130 
good and see the time is counting down
make<00:03:46.690> sure<00:03:46.870> you<00:03:47.050> survive<00:03:48.840> until<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:49.960> time

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
make sure you survive until the time

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.710 
make sure you survive until the time
runs<00:03:50.170> up<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:50.710> it<00:03:51.250> does<00:03:51.460> where<00:03:52.150> the<00:03:52.450> mission

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
runs up and it does where the mission

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.380 
runs up and it does where the mission
pause<00:03:52.990> now<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:53.980> figure<00:03:54.490> is<00:03:54.550> the<00:03:54.730> beginning<00:03:55.180> is

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
pause now the figure is the beginning is

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.880 
pause now the figure is the beginning is
not<00:03:55.570> locked<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:57.760> kapu<00:03:58.170> what<00:03:59.170> a<00:03:59.350> stick<00:03:59.650> gets

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
not locked the kapu what a stick gets

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.650 
not locked the kapu what a stick gets
towards<00:04:00.220> the<00:04:00.280> end<00:04:00.520> before<00:04:00.730> like<00:04:01.240> the<00:04:01.450> last

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
towards the end before like the last

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.560 
towards the end before like the last
minute<00:04:02.170> or<00:04:02.500> so<00:04:02.650> or<00:04:03.550> shall<00:04:03.850> say<00:04:04.000> first<00:04:04.270> second

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
minute or so or shall say first second

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.000 
minute or so or shall say first second
the<00:04:04.660> last<00:04:04.810> fifth<00:04:05.050> section<00:04:05.260> also<00:04:05.470> and<00:04:05.800> then<00:04:05.890> it

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
the last fifth section also and then it

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.980 
the last fifth section also and then it
gets<00:04:06.160> a<00:04:06.340> little<00:04:06.370> bit<00:04:06.670> trickier<00:04:07.060> when<00:04:07.810> it's

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:07.990 
gets a little bit trickier when it's

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.930 
gets a little bit trickier when it's
more<00:04:08.170> planes<00:04:08.470> coming<00:04:08.800> from<00:04:08.950> all<00:04:09.580> sorts<00:04:09.790> of

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
more planes coming from all sorts of

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.350 
more planes coming from all sorts of
directions<00:04:10.320> so<00:04:11.320> it<00:04:11.620> will<00:04:11.860> be<00:04:12.010> difficult<00:04:12.910> for

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
directions so it will be difficult for

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.270 
directions so it will be difficult for
you<00:04:13.540> to<00:04:13.570> necessarily<00:04:14.320> side<00:04:15.750> where<00:04:16.750> you<00:04:16.930> want

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
you to necessarily side where you want

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.800 
you to necessarily side where you want
where<00:04:18.280> you<00:04:18.549> want<00:04:18.670> to<00:04:18.880> through<00:04:19.060> first<00:04:19.330> you<00:04:19.690> know

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
where you want to through first you know

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.660 
where you want to through first you know
to<00:04:19.840> seek<00:04:20.320> out<00:04:20.530> which<00:04:20.680> is<00:04:20.799> your<00:04:20.920> first<00:04:21.070> priority

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:21.670 
to seek out which is your first priority

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.360 
to seek out which is your first priority
so<00:04:22.080> as<00:04:23.080> you<00:04:23.230> just<00:04:23.260> saw<00:04:23.590> we<00:04:23.620> lost<00:04:24.010> from<00:04:24.190> one

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
so as you just saw we lost from one

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.620 
so as you just saw we lost from one
transcript<00:04:24.820> already<00:04:25.380> and<00:04:27.090> yeah<00:04:28.090> so<00:04:28.330> we<00:04:28.480> just

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
transcript already and yeah so we just

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.310 
transcript already and yeah so we just
have<00:04:28.750> to<00:04:28.870> do<00:04:29.020> our<00:04:29.050> best<00:04:29.380> to<00:04:29.500> protect<00:04:29.890> it<00:04:31.320> last

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
have to do our best to protect it last

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.260 
have to do our best to protect it last
for<00:04:32.560> two<00:04:32.650> seconds<00:04:33.040> now<00:04:33.220> is<00:04:33.610> getting<00:04:34.120> a<00:04:34.150> little

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
for two seconds now is getting a little

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.390 
for two seconds now is getting a little
bit<00:04:34.450> hectic<00:04:34.630> just<00:04:35.140> now<00:04:35.290> you<00:04:35.620> know<00:04:35.740> when<00:04:36.040> when

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
bit hectic just now you know when when

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.690 
bit hectic just now you know when when
the<00:04:36.790> one<00:04:36.970> got<00:04:37.120> destroyed<00:04:37.510> go<00:04:38.350> ahead<00:04:38.560> -<00:04:38.770> no<00:04:39.550> my

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
the one got destroyed go ahead - no my

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.840 
the one got destroyed go ahead - no my
try<00:04:39.910> to<00:04:39.970> read<00:04:40.300> the<00:04:40.420> map<00:04:40.630> there<00:04:41.170> it<00:04:41.320> is

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
try to read the map there it is

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.580 
try to read the map there it is
it's<00:04:42.850> one<00:04:43.090> there

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
it's one there

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.740 
it's one there
minimal<00:04:45.310> where<00:04:45.520> is<00:04:45.610> everything<00:04:46.030> all<00:04:46.720> right

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750 
minimal where is everything all right

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.900 
minimal where is everything all right
there<00:04:46.840> is<00:04:47.880> there's<00:04:48.880> one<00:04:49.180> thing<00:04:50.250> yeah<00:04:51.250> a<00:04:51.460> little

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
there is there's one thing yeah a little

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.270
