00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.620
 hello we are here at mwc 2015 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.170
 of course still and have us here 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.270
 times the shoes baywatch caught the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.090
 is basically the first smart watch of the 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.369
 chinese by huawei and yes you like yourself 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.350
 here android runs where he is in the case 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.410
 of course only demo mode one can 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.449
 So do not change that much here 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.300
 we among other things not possible 1 of the 40 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.200
 announced various watch races 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.670
 try 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.370
 but as you can see it is 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.710
 that one very well made or the one with 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.540
 very noble-looking smart watch that there 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.520
 from china work should come to us 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.559
 about mid of the year the announcement to 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.149
 price there is also no announcement of 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.579
 but not necessarily one 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.199
 To be cheap because the device works like 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.370
 said extremely high quality we have here 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.379
 a stainless steel case and the ip67 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.239
 certified is so waterproof and 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.770
 dust should be repellent and in 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.690
 various colors therefore there are 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.430
 of course a silver variation and 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.049
 also a golden version 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.310
 I'll probably be the same then 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.490
 we also have one here 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.950
 amoled panel giving a resolution of 400 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.720
 x 400 pixels offers and completely round 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.890
 So it is because of the first 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.479
 pixeldichte of 168 pp so very much 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.610
 high and compared to the others 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.220
 Android smartphones previously available 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.530
 are 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.070
 even higher than in the other all 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.720
 simply the whole thing is Ralf Dickel 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.420
 Guess I would say that's it 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.400
 so loose 12 to 13 millimeters on the 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.520
 back we have a glass cover 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.410
 and a heart rate monitor here the 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.000
 four contacts become the location of the 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.310
 device is used so it seems 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.440
 a wireless charging included but 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.030
 will be with a newsweek I will 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.060
 just loaded here you can see 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.280
 already on these recordings that it was 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.540
 a standard but you can trade 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.850
 So any user here 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.440
 probably use like that then too 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.410
 are then available at the individual 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.810
 but at least not 20 22 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.350
 mm here are relatively difficult to 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.619
 to get 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.479
 So I think it will be 20 or 18 mm 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.640
 also give bracelets for women so 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.680
 This watch also worn by ladies 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.990
 become another special feature around here 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.240
 to do the cloud is this 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.790
 A cover on the display made of glass 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.550
 So it is clear they what apple 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.010
 now known to be not in 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.720
 but we could use iphone 6 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.760
 just then with the huawei people 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.410
 is used to these suggestions and 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.390
 to protect scratches and that should 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.700
 be much more resistant than 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.820
 about gorilla glass in the case the whole 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.470
 thing relatively much I can now for 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.790
 weight relatively little but say it 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.290
 that this is just this high quality 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.850
 stainless steel wise to use 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.290
 probably not the whole number 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.540
 be easy I would like it 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.660
 Almost tap the 70 grams 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.790
 complete with the bracelet is the bracelet 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.500
 also made of metal is also very 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.049
 high quality there are as I said 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.910
 other variants of the other colors and 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.740
 it just becomes the bottom one 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.390
 put together and latched in and 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.640
 then the whole thing is connected 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.710
 caught silver variant and shall 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.740
 Overall, a large variety of 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.180
 be different bracelet I say 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.770
 give it now 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.810
 so now we have each other again 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.850
 the golden version respectively 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.670
 I would say bronze golden now 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.980
 the baywatch worried and that works yes 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.930
 well, that's probably very noble 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.970
 one or the other quite well 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.490
 The on metal bracelets and high 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.860
 quality is synonymous or like times 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.290
 spend a little more money or money 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.250
 would just show what you have to say 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.050
 I just now 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.200
 and yes technical principle exactly that 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:44.790
 same as 400 x 400 pixel resolution 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.140
 and pixel density of 286 ppi and 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.330
 Of course, then probably I'll take 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.520
 now s.einer snapdragon ssc under 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.080
 the hood to the purely technical data 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.310
 So to the inner life of the clock are ours 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.890
 here are still a few information 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.170
 but the whole thing works here 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.030
 ever extremely noble as sitting down 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.950
 then again the stainless steel 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.820
 Cover including charging contacts 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.620
 and of course the hartz iv receiver 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.120
 The whole thing can just as said with 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.890
 operated different bracelets 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.260
 be and do not come to one yet 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.030
 Known white about the middle of the 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.859
 year to hang on the market of course 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.330
 also a bit of google from when 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.330
 the release takes place
