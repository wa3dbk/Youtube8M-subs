00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.090

Montreal pushed up to avoid the offside

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.620

trap<00:03:45.160> but<00:03:45.730> it<00:03:45.880> didn't<00:03:46.150> work<00:03:46.330> for<00:03:46.360> them<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:49.510> it

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
trap but it didn't work for them and it

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.540 
trap but it didn't work for them and it
was<00:03:49.750> extremely<00:03:50.110> tight<00:03:50.530> the<00:03:50.770> offside<00:03:51.190> but<00:03:51.220> I

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
was extremely tight the offside but I

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.880 
was extremely tight the offside but I
think<00:03:51.910> that<00:03:52.060> aligns<00:03:52.270> with<00:03:52.450> the<00:03:52.570> assistant<00:03:53.440> got

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
think that aligns with the assistant got

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.800 
think that aligns with the assistant got
it<00:03:54.070> right<00:03:54.280> I<00:03:54.430> think<00:03:54.730> the<00:03:54.940> way<00:03:55.030> near<00:03:55.240> Rosario<00:03:55.660> is

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
it right I think the way near Rosario is

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.690 
it right I think the way near Rosario is
great<00:03:56.140> level<00:03:56.620> when<00:03:56.800> the<00:03:56.920> ball<00:03:57.070> was<00:03:57.220> played<00:03:57.460> for
