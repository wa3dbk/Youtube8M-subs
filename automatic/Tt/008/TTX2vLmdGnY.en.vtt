upgrading and three I actually did not
have<00:01:38.909> this<00:01:39.000> game<00:01:39.180> yet<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:39.509> I<00:01:39.750> thought<00:01:40.470> this<00:01:40.619> was

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
have this game yet so I thought this was

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.950 
have this game yet so I thought this was
the<00:01:40.799> perfect<00:01:40.890> opportunity<00:01:41.189> opportunity<00:01:41.970> to

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
the perfect opportunity opportunity to

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.380 
the perfect opportunity opportunity to
get<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.860> newer<00:01:44.130> console<00:01:44.750> for<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:46.079> ps3<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.240> as<00:01:48.240> you

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
get a newer console for a ps3 so as you

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.719 
get a newer console for a ps3 so as you
can<00:01:48.479> see<00:01:48.630> here<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.439> box<00:01:49.680> in<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.070> box<00:01:50.250> so

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
can see here it is a box in a box so

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.289 
can see here it is a box in a box so
let's<00:01:51.630> go<00:01:51.720> ahead<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.899> take<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.229> out<00:01:53.210> just<00:01:54.210> so

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
let's go ahead and take this out just so

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.179 
let's go ahead and take this out just so
