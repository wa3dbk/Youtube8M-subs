00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.170
 i 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.920
 salama from contamana the guitarists i am 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.550
 juancho oak and this is karma remove 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.910
 well let's learn to play the 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.590
 song think of me but with chords already 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.110
 you know you have the video of the 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:31.070
 introduction on the other hand 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:33.820
 the link will appear here and good just 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.820
 to the introduction was 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.850
 Y 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.699
 Y 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.850
 Y 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.739
 and now just as we entered 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:11.270
 it's a minor we do it twice for the 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:14.090
 introduction with the bolero rhythm that 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:18.580
 now I explain it we continue in my minor if 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:23.750
 you have a seventh if 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:27.190
 my little salt thinks of me 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.190
 we are still in my youngest 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:38.260
 if you have if I felt more like crying 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.260
 or better think of me 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:52.570
 you know that seventh but your image my 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.570
 better life 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:01.610
 formulates the minor may that being more 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.149
 sharp seventh we simply have 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:09.000
 that the middle finger the two finger move it 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:12.040
 the sixth string second fret 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:19.439
 he taught me to see 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:22.540
 yes seventh salt and mascarita there and now 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:27.849
 think of me tell us to the letter 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:33.939
 what is coming is a myth they think has not 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:40.799
 Sharp Minor Sun Sharp Minor Sun 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:40.799
 minor when he has sustained minor suffer 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:52.260
 when you cry and seventh give again was 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:52.260
 sustained minor 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.400
 min 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:07.510
 and when you want to hold the sun 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:13.349
 less sun sharp lower removes the sun 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.349
 minor in the fa sharp better life 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:31.960
 for nothing if seventh for sustained fa 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:36.090
 minor nothing if seventh serves me without you and 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.090
 torn in me and we would enter with him 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.530
 Now what is good for us 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:48.440
 learning is the pace of this bolero 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.000
 then as the iris of the song is not 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.920
 an easy song to agree because 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.380
 we have many capo here 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.780
 in the chorus part but remember 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.290
 if the minor sun or the fa 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.290
 sustained minor 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:07.989
 we have here we go down to the room after 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:09.790
 the third second is worth good not me 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:13.719
 I roll up I go to the rhythm 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.010
 the rhythm is tonic if we are in my 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:20.070
 minor for example happy anti that the 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.070
 tonic is the sixth string is worth then 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:33.070
 Everything we do is sixth chan chan 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:38.860
 chan fifth fifth sixth and fifth fifth 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:42.550
 sixth fifth fifth sixth is worth you chan 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:46.330
 chan chan yung jan chan chan chan 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:50.199
 chan chan chan puncture a better chan 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:53.500
 tonic three ripped ripped tonic 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:55.360
 good the tonic unforgiven in the fifth 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.240
 in this case fifth fifth torn 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.620
 Last I remembered my child we will do it 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.620
 always like this you already know 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:11.240
 those are the bars in my minor in the 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.870
 smaller as the tonic is the fifth 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:20.500
 we are going to give to the fifth sixth 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:23.830
 Sixth sixth fifth sixth fifth 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:26.260
 you already know the fingers we put them here 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:29.770
 to give him with the four and the thumb 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:33.050
 playing with the fat man and with the fifth 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:36.980
 rope then if seventh then we put 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:41.210
 is and seventh equal fifth sixth sixth 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:44.590
 fifth sixth sixth fifth queen 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:47.310
 peculiarity in the six seventh 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:52.600
 so that we can do this dynamic of 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:54.250
 notes we can fifth and now in the sixth 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.190
 the only thing that we have to move from 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:06:01.450
 this finger to the sixth second string 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:07.840
 fret is worth it but when we do sixth 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:09.200
 sixth fifth sixth sixth fifth of 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.680
 agreement 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:16.130
 so we have that then the fa 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:21.320
 sustained seventh that would be putting the 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:23.600
 finger here equal sixth fifth and 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.970
 that's like half a beat alone there 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.060
 remains and nothing and chords then 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:32.680
 we have then you already know me in the mouth is 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.680
 in the chorus and we 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.110
 6 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:46.009
 sixth sixth and fifth fifth sixth 

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:54.120
 6 agree a bit with that dynamic of 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:57.090
 what is at the time of what is the 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:07:01.110
 bolero rhythm, it will be much more 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:03.300
 easy to agree and nothing simply because 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:05.250
 I'm going to put us link by touching the 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:08.340
 whole song so you can see how 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:11.729
 would be good comrades an hour of 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:13.289
