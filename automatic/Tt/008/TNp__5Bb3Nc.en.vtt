00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.310 
one of the hardest things to do in GTA 5
I<00:02:50.040> mean<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:50.460> think<00:02:50.700> all<00:02:51.060> five<00:02:51.390> ice<00:02:51.660> in<00:02:51.900> total<00:02:52.080> is

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
I mean I think all five ice in total is

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.660 
I mean I think all five ice in total is
going<00:02:52.440> to<00:02:52.530> be<00:02:52.590> like<00:02:52.710> over<00:02:53.070> eight<00:02:53.250> hours<00:02:53.280> of

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
going to be like over eight hours of

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.220 
going to be like over eight hours of
gameplay<00:02:53.880> or<00:02:54.120> eight<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.600> ten<00:02:54.810> hours<00:02:54.960> at<00:02:55.200> least

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
gameplay or eight to ten hours at least

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.160 
gameplay or eight to ten hours at least
of<00:02:55.740> gameplay<00:02:56.070> and<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:57.000> not<00:02:57.180> die<00:02:57.390> at<00:02:57.630> all<00:02:57.930> with

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
of gameplay and to not die at all with

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.990 
of gameplay and to not die at all with
the<00:02:58.290> same<00:02:58.320> group<00:02:58.800> of<00:02:58.920> players<00:02:59.160> and<00:02:59.430> throughout
