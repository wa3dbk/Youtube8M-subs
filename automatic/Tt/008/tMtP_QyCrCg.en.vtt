00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:47.740 
want to do is get a metronome if you

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.830 
want to do is get a metronome if you
have<00:00:47.920> it<00:00:48.100> and<00:00:48.280> set<00:00:48.610> it<00:00:48.640> to<00:00:48.910> you<00:00:49.120> know<00:00:49.210> about<00:00:49.330> 100

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
have it and set it to you know about 100

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.390 
have it and set it to you know about 100
beats<00:00:49.960> per<00:00:50.050> minute<00:00:50.410> if<00:00:50.590> that's<00:00:50.860> too<00:00:51.010> fast<00:00:51.190> you

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
beats per minute if that's too fast you

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.040 
beats per minute if that's too fast you
can<00:00:51.520> back<00:00:51.670> it<00:00:51.850> down<00:00:51.970> or<00:00:52.090> whatever<00:00:52.210> but<00:00:52.450> this<00:00:52.900> is

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
can back it down or whatever but this is

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.540 
can back it down or whatever but this is
going<00:00:53.170> to<00:00:53.260> be<00:00:53.350> a<00:00:53.380> 100<00:00:53.740> beats<00:00:53.860> per<00:00:53.950> minute<00:00:54.280> this

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
going to be a 100 beats per minute this

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:55.920 
going to be a 100 beats per minute this
example<00:00:54.940> and<00:00:55.150> I'm<00:00:55.210> doing<00:00:55.360> right<00:00:55.540> now<00:00:55.690> and<00:00:55.720> what

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
example and I'm doing right now and what

example and I'm doing right now and what
you're<00:00:56.020> gonna<00:00:56.110> do<00:00:56.260> is<00:00:56.440> set<00:00:57.430> the<00:00:57.460> metronome<00:00:57.640> to

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
you're gonna do is set the metronome to

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.820 
you're gonna do is set the metronome to
be<00:00:58.210> permanent<00:00:58.630> hit<00:00:58.720> start<00:00:58.990> and<00:00:59.110> then<00:00:59.470> play

00:00:59.820 --> 00:00:59.830

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
like when you play just each node value

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:17.110 
like when you play just each node value
for<00:01:55.000> just<00:01:55.180> one<00:01:55.360> measure<00:01:55.600> here<00:01:55.930> you<00:01:55.990> go

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
timing you know actually I took this

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.369 
timing you know actually I took this
exercise<00:02:51.090> from<00:02:51.359> a<00:02:51.420> drummer<00:02:51.780> friend<00:02:52.049> of<00:02:52.200> mine

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
exercise from a drummer friend of mine

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.619 
exercise from a drummer friend of mine
so<00:02:52.650> that's<00:02:52.950> one<00:02:53.190> area<00:02:53.400> that<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:54.000> lot<00:02:54.269> of<00:02:54.390> guitar

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
so that's one area that a lot of guitar

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:56.180 
so that's one area that a lot of guitar
players<00:02:54.930> we<00:02:55.109> use<00:02:55.230> guitar<00:02:55.470> players<00:02:55.739> can<00:02:55.890> stand

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
players we use guitar players can stand

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.830 
players we use guitar players can stand
work<00:02:56.459> on<00:02:56.579> a<00:02:56.609> lot<00:02:56.849> is<00:02:57.030> that<00:02:57.060> rhythm<00:02:57.450> in<00:02:57.660> our

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
work on a lot is that rhythm in our

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.839 
work on a lot is that rhythm in our
timing<00:02:58.230> now<00:02:58.349> in<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.980> next<00:02:59.129> lesson<00:02:59.489> we're

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
timing now in the next lesson we're

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.069 
timing now in the next lesson we're
going<00:02:59.879> to<00:03:00.030> take<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.239> look<00:03:00.569> at<00:03:00.720> something<00:03:00.930> called

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
going to take a look at something called

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:02.899 
going to take a look at something called
the<00:03:01.500> constant<00:03:02.010> strumming<00:03:02.370> technique<00:03:02.519> and

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
the constant strumming technique and

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:04.910 
the constant strumming technique and
that<00:03:03.359> is<00:03:03.480> an<00:03:03.569> awesome<00:03:04.170> way<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.349> start<00:03:04.680> figuring

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
that is an awesome way to start figuring

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.440 
that is an awesome way to start figuring
out<00:03:05.220> your<00:03:05.310> favorite<00:03:05.489> strumming<00:03:06.000> patterns<00:03:06.299> and

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
out your favorite strumming patterns and

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.849 
out your favorite strumming patterns and
coming<00:03:06.840> up<00:03:06.900> with<00:03:06.959> some<00:03:07.319> really<00:03:07.620> wicked

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
coming up with some really wicked

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:11.510 
coming up with some really wicked
strumming<00:03:08.310> patterns<00:03:08.640> of<00:03:08.790> your<00:03:08.909> own<00:03:09.000> see<00:03:09.359> that
