00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:06.310
 my name is mine and in this video I 

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:09.450
 I'm going to teach how to make some rich hoops 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:12.099
 of apple in particular I 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.610
 He loved how are the truth is that 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:18.400
 my family also loved it and without more 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.830
 and we're going ingredients 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.589
 we need 4 red or green apples 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.900
 a cup of flour 2 tablespoons 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:27.999
 sugar a quarter of a tablespoon of powder 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.339
 to bake a quarter of a tablespoon of 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:32.770
 ground cinnamon 2 tablespoons vanilla 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:35.820
 three quarters of milk case an egg and 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.820
 frying oil 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.470
 I will use as you can see four 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.440
 I'm going to remove the green apples 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.170
 stick and we will continue cutting them in 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.530
 slices this is very important because 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.809
 we are also going to remove the seeds 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.180
 the apple because they know they contain 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.940
 toxins are actually in very 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.909
 small quantities and better avoid us 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.829
 these I'm going to use this one that is 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:06.740
 like a screw cap that I had 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.659
 only the time and the 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.750
 cookie cutter to be a perfect 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.869
 this is just everything to improvise 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.550
 but let's see that it is not necessarily 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.550
 expensive to make this recipe 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.460
 for the mix I used a cup of 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.979
 hot cakes flour if you can 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.770
 also use wheat flour there is no 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.409
 no problem we will also use 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.770
 a quarter teaspoon of powder for 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.140
 bake and then we're going to 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.479
 add two tablespoons of ions sugar 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.369
 useless for muscovado sugar but if 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.100
 you want to use standard sugar 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:50.530
 it's perfect we're also going to add 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.530
 a picture cinnamon habitat 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:04.460
 and we're going to beat an egg and we're going to 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.460
 go adding little by little 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.280
 now we only need to add three 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.980
 quarter cup of milk and of course 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.090
 I'm going to add two spoonfuls of 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.599
 vanilla essence so they remain 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.599
 enough flavors 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.060
 Y 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:40.290
 Now let's prepare a mixture 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.540
 usable sugar mascabado and cinnamon 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.700
 all to taste but of course not 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.430
 try to put as much cinnamon any 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.189
 flavor would be very very strong this 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.219
 we 're going to beat it, I'm going to use a 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:55.560
 fork to stir this mixture and 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:59.280
 guess what we are going to use them for 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.439
 then there we are going to submerge to soak the 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.709
 apple rings already fried and they're going to 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:06.689
 get these treats me fascinated me 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.909
 I hope you will also go to 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:11.549
 fascinate because they are rich and this has been 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:14.700
 I hope you liked it a lot 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.400
 the result and if they know a better recipe 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.689
 I can still be left in the 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.959
 comments so you already know in a few 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:23.849
 I'm like a bigger community 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:27.030
