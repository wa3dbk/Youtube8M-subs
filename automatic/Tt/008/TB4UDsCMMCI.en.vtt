Detroit most show and this behind me is
the<00:00:05.460> brand-new<00:00:05.990> 06<00:00:06.990> it's<00:00:07.529> not<00:00:07.649> only<00:00:07.740> released

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
the brand-new 06 it's not only released

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.120 
the brand-new 06 it's not only released
till<00:00:08.309> 2015<00:00:09.269> but<00:00:09.690> it<00:00:10.170> really<00:00:10.380> looks<00:00:10.620> really

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
till 2015 but it really looks really

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.620 
till 2015 but it really looks really
really<00:00:11.370> exciting<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:11.880> was<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.000> big<00:00:12.150> fan<00:00:12.179> of<00:00:12.389> the

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
really exciting I was a big fan of the

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.860 
really exciting I was a big fan of the
old<00:00:12.660> 06<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.940> the<00:00:14.940> options<00:00:15.299> on<00:00:15.420> this<00:00:15.570> sound

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
old 06 and the options on this sound

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.930 
old 06 and the options on this sound
absolutely<00:00:16.320> mouth-watering<00:00:16.740> so<00:00:17.490> let's<00:00:17.730> start

absolutely mouth-watering so let's start

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.359 
absolutely mouth-watering so let's start
with<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.359> engine<00:00:18.840> well<00:00:19.199> it's<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.770> LT<00:00:20.070> for

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
with the engine well it's the LT for

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.429 
with the engine well it's the LT for
engine<00:00:20.730> which<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.539> new<00:00:21.660> version<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.020> ls1

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439

called<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.840> 07<00:00:49.710> package<00:00:50.370> I've<00:00:51.090> done<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.690> lot<00:00:51.870> of

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
called the 07 package I've done a lot of

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.630 
called the 07 package I've done a lot of
work<00:00:52.050> with<00:00:52.440> aerodynamics<00:00:53.039> in<00:00:53.160> this<00:00:53.280> car<00:00:53.489> they

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
work with aerodynamics in this car they

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.869 
work with aerodynamics in this car they
developed<00:00:54.090> at<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.300> same<00:00:54.510> time<00:00:54.780> as<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.879> c7.r

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879

developed at the same time as the c7.r
race<00:00:57.180> car<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.379> standard<00:00:58.559> car<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.039> called

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
race car so the standard car is called

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.889 
race car so the standard car is called
the<00:00:59.309> 06<00:00:59.850> but<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.149> can<00:01:00.270> also<00:01:00.390> add<00:01:00.660> something

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
the 06 but you can also add something

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.969 
the 06 but you can also add something
which<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.289> called<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.500> 07<00:01:02.070> package<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:03.510> adds

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
which is called the 07 package that adds

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.530 
which is called the 07 package that adds
things<00:01:04.979> like<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.339> which<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.510> the

things like this which is the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.450 
things like this which is the
aerodynamics<00:01:07.380> it's<00:01:07.560> got<00:01:07.680> end<00:01:07.890> plates<00:01:08.159> on<00:01:08.369> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
aerodynamics it's got end plates on the

aerodynamics it's got end plates on the
front<00:01:08.640> splitter<00:01:08.939> which<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.330> haven't<00:01:09.810> seen

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
front splitter which I haven't seen

front splitter which I haven't seen
before<00:01:10.170> some<00:01:10.680> hot<00:01:10.890> ones<00:01:11.010> as<00:01:11.250> large<00:01:11.460> as<00:01:11.670> this

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
before some hot ones as large as this

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.679 
before some hot ones as large as this
you<00:01:12.750> also<00:01:12.990> get<00:01:13.080> carbon<00:01:13.409> ceramic<00:01:13.619> brakes<00:01:13.799> and

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
you also get carbon ceramic brakes and

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.690 
you also get carbon ceramic brakes and
you<00:01:15.689> get<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.080> back<00:01:16.290> wing<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.830> clear<00:01:17.430> panel

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
you get on the back wing a clear panel

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.190 
you get on the back wing a clear panel
section<00:01:18.119> its<00:01:18.330> most<00:01:18.509> aggressive<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.080> can

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
section its most aggressive you can

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.410 
section its most aggressive you can
change<00:01:19.439> your<00:01:19.590> man<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.159> can<00:01:20.310> own<00:01:21.240> it's

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
change your man you so you can own it's

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.820 
change your man you so you can own it's
going<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.630> set<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.810> up<00:01:21.960> for<00:01:22.020> specific<00:01:22.619> tracks

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
going to set it up for specific tracks

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
front is this front grill it's been

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.890 
front is this front grill it's been
redesigned<00:01:28.020> 406<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.070> forms<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.750> actually

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
redesigned 406 and forms it actually

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.990 
redesigned 406 and forms it actually
channels<00:01:31.380> more<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.950> if<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.430> have<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.700> in<00:01:32.790> place

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
channels more in if you have it in place

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.429 
channels more in if you have it in place
as<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.360> suppose<00:01:33.600> if<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.930> get<00:01:34.079> rid<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.320> it

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
as I suppose if you get rid of it

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.300 
as I suppose if you get rid of it
completely<00:01:34.970> fairly<00:01:35.970> extraordinary<00:01:36.210> stuff

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
completely fairly extraordinary stuff

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.440 
completely fairly extraordinary stuff
transmission<00:01:38.310> options<00:01:38.400> were<00:01:38.880> you've<00:01:39.270> got

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
transmission options were you've got

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.719 
transmission options were you've got
8-speed<00:01:40.020> automatic<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:41.009> you've<00:01:41.159> also<00:01:41.310> got<00:01:41.579> a

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
8-speed automatic but you've also got a

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.940 
8-speed automatic but you've also got a
7-speed<00:01:42.329> manual<00:01:42.360> with<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:42.930> rev<00:01:43.619> matching

option on it it all adds up to something
that<00:01:47.159> sounds<00:01:47.549> pretty<00:01:47.909> exciting<00:01:48.090> it's<00:01:48.780> already

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
that sounds pretty exciting it's already
