00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:09.150
 further emotional game 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.349
 both teams wanted to win we didn't 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:20.180
 fought to the end to the last second 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:22.859
 but unfortunately the completion is generally 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.539
 need to score need to score what to win 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:30.769
 such games we had quite good moments 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.769
 answer getting ready home match 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:40.079
 thank you all thanks to the team from 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:55.489
 set stitch on edge 7 working in 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:55.489
 favor of a production of a kind 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.630
 stay 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.600
 right 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:10.260
 a very similar game at the top home 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:16.720
 the team played well for two periods and then 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.220
 Then 3 before it did not quite work out 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:33.640
 there is 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:38.590
 sea hockey synergy with emotions and 5 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:47.380
 what kind of games 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:53.649
 but and yes, I understood whether it was already after 4 and 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:55.899
 the temptation still trust you know 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.119
 giving a good perspective gate and 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:02.920
 surely all the time of course we are about it 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:05.830
 we think yes but the price is very high 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:08.140
 match and, in general, throw Varna in such 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.489
 The moment I need Misha too 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.239
 say certain responsibility 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.060
 carry 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.160
 so in general we are more 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.450
 face the problem that we cannot 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.450
 score like everything because 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.800
 that's rival vikernes poured so 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.970
 sorry more than that and the main 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.550
 this is a young good looking guy 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.550
 but the eyes are different therefore 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.959
 three hatch 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:43.510
 auris continuing the theme of the battery all the same 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:47.019
 our big as all hard 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:50.349
 of only with the right to vote from genital 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:53.049
 girls and a parish 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:57.040
 your lies are red or for young of 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:59.500
 people comfort and many day after day you 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.040
 see at least once what's new 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:10.700
 anton 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:12.439
 and will help the madness driven ending 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:18.970
 as far as the players and the coaching staff 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:22.420
 I feel this support so much she already 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:26.820
 tyson crazy you 9 kcal breed of 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:30.310
 how do I sanitize the police 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:37.960
 firefighter puts the night comes 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:43.840
 for people he is handsome and only having disconnected 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:46.690
 turned around and where I certainly helps 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.360
 of course we hear much easier to play 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.220
 when is there before the house if he is the same 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.430
 The basis of the third period in Ufa was much 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.430
 more difficult 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.460
 moment 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.460
 it could be 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:10.750
 how much is decisive but you know about 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.569
 in most cases there were many moments 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.099
 when playing five by five here probably not 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:17.260
 need to concentrate only on one 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:20.500
 something yes a good moment called in 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.910
 equal compositions were moments of the 6th game 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.389
 so we are lucky today just less 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:28.150
 than an opponent and playoff games are they in general 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:31.949
 then very heavy equal i can say 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:34.840
 that somewhere playing food with drops 

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:38.020
 that the floor is really already said 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:49.360
 that this is the same game as it was in Ufa from 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:51.880
 which logically soon means well we 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.949
 same not the first year of hockey so how 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.120
 say such matches 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:58.539
 they just need to be analyzed and 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:02.699
 analyze analyze mistakes you go 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.699
 go ahead and more so boy 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.690
 polaris 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.870
 a lot of things did not work previous 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.710
 matches and mistakes and excitement and how snapped 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.710
 no points 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.940
 how do you rate hong kong center your 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.660

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:32.380
 ceased to be and how 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.110
 lavita repair inspector praise them became 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:37.930

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:06.760
 of polish is observed by 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:10.050
 a player who I am still experiencing 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:13.300
