00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
the epoxy underneath and then you're

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.150 
the epoxy underneath and then you're
done<00:02:53.550> but<00:02:54.810> push<00:02:55.810> down<00:02:56.110> our<00:02:56.440> shirt<00:02:56.740> on<00:02:56.890> shore

done but push down our shirt on shore
where<00:02:57.550> we<00:02:58.120> do<00:02:58.450> that<00:02:59.580> she's<00:03:00.580> not<00:03:00.700> polite<00:03:01.060> but

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:01.209 
where we do that she's not polite but

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.420 
where we do that she's not polite but
first<00:03:01.540> we<00:03:01.900> need<00:03:02.050> to<00:03:02.140> do<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.320> head<00:03:02.500> really

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
first we need to do the head really

first we need to do the head really
enough<00:03:03.670> this<00:03:03.820> step<00:03:04.060> actually<00:03:04.180> doesn't

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
enough this step actually doesn't

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.199 
enough this step actually doesn't
involve<00:03:04.870> any<00:03:05.050> sewing<00:03:05.410> just<00:03:05.620> just<00:03:06.010> gluing<00:03:06.370> lots

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209

involve any sewing just just gluing lots
of<00:03:07.330> gluing<00:03:07.660> you<00:03:07.930> can<00:03:08.050> use<00:03:08.170> some<00:03:08.350> of<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.500> yarn

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
of gluing you can use some of the yarn

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:09.840 
of gluing you can use some of the yarn
you've<00:03:08.830> got<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.160> measure<00:03:09.310> out<00:03:09.550> different

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
you've got to measure out different

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.100 
you've got to measure out different
widths<00:03:10.060> so<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.239> armatures<00:03:10.570> head<00:03:10.750> so<00:03:10.900> you<00:03:10.989> can

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
widths so the armatures head so you can

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.479 
widths so the armatures head so you can
make<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.380> two<00:03:11.530> pieces<00:03:11.860> of<00:03:11.890> fabric<00:03:12.130> fit

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
make the two pieces of fabric fit

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.310 
make the two pieces of fabric fit
correctly<00:03:12.760> getting<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.780> right<00:03:13.930> shape<00:03:14.170> may

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
correctly getting the right shape may

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.870 
correctly getting the right shape may
take<00:03:14.500> a<00:03:14.530> few<00:03:14.620> tries<00:03:14.739> but<00:03:15.250> keep<00:03:15.430> at<00:03:15.610> it<00:03:15.640> and

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
take a few tries but keep at it and

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.160 
take a few tries but keep at it and
eventually<00:03:16.180> you'll<00:03:16.600> get<00:03:16.690> something<00:03:17.019> that

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
eventually you'll get something that

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.630 
eventually you'll get something that
works<00:03:17.380> once<00:03:17.769> you've<00:03:17.890> got<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.130> two<00:03:18.250> pieces<00:03:18.280> of

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
works once you've got the two pieces of

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.949 
works once you've got the two pieces of
the<00:03:18.730> head<00:03:18.880> figured<00:03:19.180> out<00:03:19.300> glue<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.600> center<00:03:19.780> of

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
the head figured out glue the center of

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.300 
the head figured out glue the center of
one<00:03:20.140> piece<00:03:20.350> for<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.620> center<00:03:20.830> of<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.010> back<00:03:21.160> of

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
one piece for the center of the back of

one piece for the center of the back of
the<00:03:21.370> head<00:03:21.519> and<00:03:21.730> then<00:03:21.850> tightly<00:03:22.420> wrap<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:22.810> felt

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
the head and then tightly wrap the felt

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.509 
the head and then tightly wrap the felt
onto<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:23.440> head<00:03:23.620> while<00:03:23.800> gluing<00:03:24.040> from<00:03:24.280> bottom

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
onto the head while gluing from bottom

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.190 
onto the head while gluing from bottom
to<00:03:24.580> top<00:03:24.670> then<00:03:25.420> do<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.630> same<00:03:25.810> of<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:25.959> front

to top then do the same of the front
hopefully<00:03:26.800> this<00:03:26.950> will<00:03:27.070> move<00:03:27.220> all<00:03:27.459> of<00:03:27.670> the

hopefully this will move all of the

that's<00:03:41.260> what<00:03:41.470> we're<00:03:41.620> going<00:03:41.739> to<00:03:41.769> do<00:03:41.920> next<00:03:42.130> now

unfortunately<00:03:42.970> this<00:03:43.390> is<00:03:43.540> probably<00:03:43.780> the<00:03:43.900> most

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
unfortunately this is probably the most

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.990 
unfortunately this is probably the most
tedious<00:03:44.320> part<00:03:44.680> of<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:44.830> process<00:03:45.310> since<00:03:45.760> you

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
tedious part of the process since you

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.910 
tedious part of the process since you
need<00:03:46.180> to<00:03:46.330> glue<00:03:46.959> each<00:03:47.230> strand<00:03:47.590> of<00:03:47.739> hair

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
need to glue each strand of hair

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.630 
need to glue each strand of hair
individually<00:03:48.760> to<00:03:48.880> the<00:03:48.970> scalp<00:03:50.130> but<00:03:51.130> hey<00:03:51.280> I<00:03:51.310> mean

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
individually to the scalp but hey I mean

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.220 
individually to the scalp but hey I mean
it<00:03:51.760> could<00:03:51.910> be<00:03:51.940> pretty<00:03:52.239> relaxing<00:03:52.780> if<00:03:52.930> you<00:03:53.080> do

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
it could be pretty relaxing if you do

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.490 
it could be pretty relaxing if you do
well<00:03:53.620> watching<00:03:53.799> TV<00:03:54.250> or<00:03:54.549> YouTube<00:03:54.880> videos

well watching TV or YouTube videos
that's<00:03:56.500> what<00:03:56.680> I<00:03:56.709> do<00:03:56.830> at<00:03:57.040> least<00:03:57.070> so<00:03:57.489> take<00:03:57.670> your

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
that's what I do at least so take your

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.310 
that's what I do at least so take your
yarn<00:03:57.940> and<00:03:58.150> cut<00:03:58.239> out<00:03:58.360> copious<00:03:58.840> amounts<00:03:59.230> of

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
yarn and cut out copious amounts of

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.840 
yarn and cut out copious amounts of
small<00:03:59.530> strands<00:03:59.860> for<00:04:00.100> each<00:04:00.250> strand<00:04:00.519> of<00:04:00.670> hair

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
small strands for each strand of hair

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.729 
small strands for each strand of hair
and<00:04:01.150> you<00:04:01.780> can<00:04:01.930> begin<00:04:02.080> gluing<00:04:02.290> them<00:04:02.590> I

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
and you can begin gluing them I

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.140 
and you can begin gluing them I
recommend<00:04:03.070> starting<00:04:03.340> at<00:04:03.549> the<00:04:03.640> hairline<00:04:03.940> and

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
recommend starting at the hairline and

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.670 
recommend starting at the hairline and
then<00:04:04.269> slowly<00:04:04.630> making<00:04:04.959> your<00:04:05.170> way<00:04:05.290> up<00:04:05.470> to<00:04:05.500> the

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
then slowly making your way up to the

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.290 
then slowly making your way up to the
swirly<00:04:06.160> thing<00:04:06.400> that<00:04:06.610> people

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
swirly thing that people

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
haircut to the proper length as you go
