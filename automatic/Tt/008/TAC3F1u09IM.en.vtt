00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.749 
in the gaming to know that maybe women
are<00:01:28.200> jumping<00:01:28.500> on<00:01:28.590> board<00:01:28.770> yeah<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.130> think<00:01:29.549> it's

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
are jumping on board yeah I think it's

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.810 
are jumping on board yeah I think it's
great<00:01:29.970> but<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.750> know<00:01:30.780> I'm<00:01:30.930> more<00:01:31.290> just<00:01:31.320> in

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
great but I you know I'm more just in

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.429 
great but I you know I'm more just in
knowing<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.030> we<00:01:33.090> were<00:01:33.180> talking<00:01:33.360> upset<00:01:34.229> about

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
knowing and we were talking upset about

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.700 
knowing and we were talking upset about
you<00:01:35.400> know<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.520> first<00:01:36.000> remember<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.960> Atari<00:01:37.320> then

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
you know I first remember the Atari then

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.560 
you know I first remember the Atari then
you<00:01:38.009> were<00:01:38.130> really<00:01:38.340> revolutionary<00:01:39.180> when

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
you were really revolutionary when

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.630 
you were really revolutionary when
coming<00:01:39.960> into<00:01:40.020> gaming<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.979> some<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.549> these

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
coming into gaming and some of these

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.069 
coming into gaming and some of these
different<00:01:41.850> games<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.360> were<00:01:42.420> introduced<00:01:42.840> but

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
different games that were introduced but

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.109 
different games that were introduced but
now<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.860> seems<00:01:43.920> like<00:01:44.399> demographics<00:01:45.030> have

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
now it seems like demographics have

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.300 
now it seems like demographics have
really<00:01:45.420> changed<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:46.170> maybe<00:01:46.380> start<00:01:46.829> looking<00:01:47.189> at

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
really changed to maybe start looking at

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.670 
really changed to maybe start looking at
opportunities<00:01:47.990> with<00:01:48.990> age<00:01:49.200> groups<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.590> are

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
opportunities with age groups that are

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.560 
opportunities with age groups that are
older<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.189> I'm<00:01:50.460> wondering<00:01:50.579> as<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.060> industry

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
older so I'm wondering as the industry

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.319 
older so I'm wondering as the industry
looks<00:01:51.840> at<00:01:52.110> demographics<00:01:52.530> how<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:54.180> can

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
looks at demographics how you can

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.209 
looks at demographics how you can
capitalize<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.439> know<00:01:55.530> moving<00:01:55.740> forward

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
capitalize that you know moving forward

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.249 
capitalize that you know moving forward
sure<00:01:56.579> well<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.240> mean<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.689> hit<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:57.990> on<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.140> head

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
sure well I mean you hit it on the head

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.830 
sure well I mean you hit it on the head
it's<00:01:58.680> fair<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.009> say<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.399> 10<00:02:00.000> years<00:02:00.180> ago<00:02:00.299> the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
it's fair to say that 10 years ago the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.249 
it's fair to say that 10 years ago the
core<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.560> gaming<00:02:01.920> base<00:02:02.130> was<00:02:02.969> 15<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.869> 25

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
core of the gaming base was 15 to 25

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.170 
core of the gaming base was 15 to 25
years<00:02:04.320> old<00:02:04.829> well<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.549> couple<00:02:05.759> things<00:02:05.909> have

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
years old well a couple things have

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.399 
years old well a couple things have
happened<00:02:06.509> first<00:02:06.630> those<00:02:06.869> consumers<00:02:07.290> have

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
happened first those consumers have

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.440 
happened first those consumers have
gotten<00:02:07.619> older<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.610> wanting<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.149> make<00:02:09.300> sure

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
gotten older so wanting to make sure

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.089 
gotten older so wanting to make sure
that<00:02:09.629> we<00:02:09.720> continue<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:10.229> speak<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.739> them<00:02:10.890> as

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
that we continue to speak to them as

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.670 
that we continue to speak to them as
they've<00:02:11.459> gotten<00:02:11.730> older<00:02:12.420> very<00:02:12.810> important

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
they've gotten older very important

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.910 
they've gotten older very important
but<00:02:14.010> also<00:02:14.280> from<00:02:15.209> an<00:02:15.329> overall<00:02:15.930> demographic

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
but also from an overall demographic

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.580 
but also from an overall demographic
basis<00:02:17.370> by<00:02:17.700> ignoring<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.329> consumer<00:02:18.870> 25-plus

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590
