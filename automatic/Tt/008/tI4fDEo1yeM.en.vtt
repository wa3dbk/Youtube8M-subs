 yes 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.940
 [Music] 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.750
 hello back over Spartan calls 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.480
 and today I come to bring a new video of 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.340
 how to make a very good profile picture 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.330
 that is not easy for our 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.750
 computer 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.610
 I want forgiveness for our YouTube without 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.720
 no kind of program like that I say 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.640
 when the set now because it hides 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.320
 I put the desktop background 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.260
 profile picture so that's why at 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.239
 better I got confused like that then 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.440
 Let's start being someone who 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.379
 left in the description that is the 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.540
 good online photoshop program first 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.370
 let's go and I'm going to our 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.900
 favorite browser between let's put 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:07.240
 in the bar to find the link that 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.040
 I will put in the fib description a 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.799
 Once we are here, we are going to give 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.080
 create a new image among new 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.850
 is this whole cuadrito seem to 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.220
 say name and that is that I know that they put the 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.420
 name that you want if before 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.799
 start writing clarify that if you 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.240
 listen to the quiet keyboard that is a 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.369
 problem that I in the next video I 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.260
 it's not going to happen anymore and we're suppose 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.260
 name we are going to put 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.760
 so in its height we put in widths 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.490
 500 in height 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.980
 500 once we have all this 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.780
 except the name that we can 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.370
 put like you who left us like this 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.790
 we give to why 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:53.700
 then better and this box then 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.960
 the next step of doing would be this 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.690
 let's go another window that would be google 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.180
 and we are going to put in search that is this 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.810
 I would be in my case I do not know how to put 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.569
 is looking to sell or by a keyboard 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.190
 render and you put render what 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.770
 you want for example in render 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.590
 field ticos renderman capturing what 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.970
 you want the render would be images 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.650
 that they do not have a background 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.160
 squares that is transparent and does not go 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.840
 to help put pictures for images 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.400
 for our putting our finally 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.410
 we did them in my case I want 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.330
 search for minecraft renders and how 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.920
 you can see we see little drawings that 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.380
 this one does not like to put the profile contribution or 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.630
 directly funds for the photo of 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.810
 profile in three you here begin to 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.239
 put the begin to choose the renders 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.769
 what do you like then once 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.090
 we have the render we are going to 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.519
 open it up let's hope that we are 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.400
 load the hd so that it looks good we go 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:52.160
 to give left click save image 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.680
 how they keep it in the place that you 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.670
 want if in my case the desk 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.230
 then once you have an image 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.580
 I have it here I'm going to open it for 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.690
 that looks good that is what I have to 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:04.310
 put in profile and it would be this 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.330
 HD download is not really that the 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.040
 declares girls but has to 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.370
 wait for the image to load and there the 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.990
 download we hope to start going to another 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.860
 once again here and we will go where 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:18.040
 says file open image since we 're going to 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.210
 find where we keep the image if 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.820
 then an estimated life I mentioned 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:26.330
 as his being is to grab it and put it to 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:28.100
 down and grabbed it says layers where it says 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.730
 background and time to have a padlock the 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:34.100
 we drag to the window / will not 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.600
 appear this then we can eliminate 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.970
 the other very well 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.370
 this would remain this but empty with 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.710
 followers when next we fill and 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.970
 we can write what we 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:48.800
 we want for example let's live here 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.660
 test and between agree I can do 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.850
 very small then here it will be able to be 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.280
 source the text showed inscribe or 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.080
 we want it to appear like this in source 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.600
 we can choose the type of letter that 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.460
 we want we feel like it 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.920
 in my case I will choose any one 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.050
 this for example and the size what 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.450
 enlarge as much as possible 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:10.490
 so that it looks good in the photo of 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.020
 profile and if that long name is not going to 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.510
 to be able to enlarge a lot because they are going to 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.959
 leave the box if then size does not 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:21.370
 we have it we can choose the color that 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.560
 in case we are going to put a red 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.710
 we have to do all this if we choose 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.800
 first something to do we have a 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.210
 circle and a rhombus then what 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.400
 we do is first choose in the circle 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.110
 large outside we choose the color and 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.240
 they have a rhombus up to the black color and 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.770
 you put it, we pass it to the red color if 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.540
 this would be the clarity of how they want 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.210
 that look simpler I put it 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.800
 always to the maximum it will look good once 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.780
 we have all this because we can 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.820
 move to the place that we want and 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.760
 once we have it that way we give it to 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.520
 ok later if you want to put those others 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.650
 chiquitos writings do if even 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.229
 can have up can change the 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:02.250
 size also change the font to the 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:05.229
 another word to the fetters and decoration 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.530
 then we would even like that which 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.860
 would be the next step let's give it to 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.860
 archive 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.900
 save them in a population this 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.159
 box then the name we're going to 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.460
 put the name that we want 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:21.199
 I said at the beginning and the format us 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.960
 You have to give God and I have news and 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:25.310
 png on how to get that size is not going to 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.550
 spend nothing at least depends what 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:31.759
 you put it and 8k bytes then 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.020
 we have it so we give it to ok let's go 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:36.110
 erase I do not need that we create 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.030
 in the case the desk a crisis 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.490
 email save that means it's the 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:43.189
 saved then we will be able to see in 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.860
 the desk how we have the 

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:47.680
 zip image 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:50.289
 in my case since I just had a booty or 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.689
 failed that a kid who modified it 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:53.110
 what is it that I forget in proof of putting 

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:55.060
 okay 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.280
 there is a box appears and this 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.319
 it would be this then again for this one 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.300
 in my case we're going to give it back to 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:02.680
 keep this in my case I have the govern 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:07.719
 is that I also get a small bug 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:09.310
 they give ok they give him desk or to the site 

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:12.930
 that you want to save it and now if 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:15.870
 supposedly perfect have to follow 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:18.509
 alright then to colors that we have this 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.699
 it would be the last step to select it as 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:23.330
 profile picture then let's go to 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:23.330
