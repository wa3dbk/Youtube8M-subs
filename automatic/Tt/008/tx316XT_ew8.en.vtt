00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:06.630
 hello hello how are we here in a 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:09.600
 video and in the scene them 

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.630
 I bring you a map created by me that 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.260
 good is a pvp map is to capture 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.340
 the money 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:20.440
 and good this map 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.330
 and I did it 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.330
 and well I hope you like it before 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:29.460
 start I wanted to tell you not to be 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.460
 uploading videos so often because 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:36.199
 and I started with the exams and I do not have 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.739
 a long time now I hope that what 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:38.739
 understand 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:44.020
 and well let's start with what would be 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.660
 the map 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.750
 as you see here are the 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.750
 the 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.530
 instructions 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.230
 How to play 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:09.820
 and the rules 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:14.040
 and well here they just take a main card and 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.040
 they go to the team they want 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.980
 and well let's see what the map would be 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:23.080
 it's not a very big map 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.080
 It's small to hang out 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.900
 and it is that the way is already very 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.790
 as you see is a small map here would come 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:43.010
 in what would be the swords the arcs 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:45.220
 the armor the food the helmet and blocks 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.220
 as well 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.600
 and good as you see here there are how are you 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.049
 things so that here they wait with the 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.049
 bows 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.860
 here is how 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:12.720
 good some of the water and then here 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.720
 they have to jump 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:23.489
 and then they come here and it's 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:23.489
 forbidden stealing and reliable 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:32.270
 to the other base and good to capture the 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.270
 wool would be here have here 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.390
 and in this they trusted to do all the 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.040
 wool 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.040
 and then they have to be returned 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.770
 and good later when they are returned 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:58.010
 they come here 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:01.100
 and here below will be your hole of your base 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.350
 and they will have to put the wool here once 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.840
 they have already won 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.500
 and well this has been practically everything 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:13.280
 the map I hope you liked it is not 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.650
 a very large map but 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.650
 to hang out with friends 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.480
 and well this was all 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.939
