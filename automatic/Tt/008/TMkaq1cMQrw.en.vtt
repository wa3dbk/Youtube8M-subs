decided we would put this video together

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.320 
decided we would put this video together
to<00:00:25.410> make<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.620> easy<00:00:25.950> for<00:00:26.190> everyone<00:00:26.610> to<00:00:26.790> get<00:00:27.150> the

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
to make it easy for everyone to get the

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.300 
to make it easy for everyone to get the
gear<00:00:27.540> put<00:00:27.780> away<00:00:28.020> after<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.650> big<00:00:28.830> game

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
gear put away after the big game

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.389 
gear put away after the big game
it<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.420> simple<00:00:30.780> 6<00:00:31.260> step<00:00:31.500> process<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.040> make

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
it is a simple 6 step process to make

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:32.990 
it is a simple 6 step process to make
this<00:00:32.550> happen

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
this happen

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.350 
this happen
the<00:00:33.840> first<00:00:34.200> step<00:00:34.470> is<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:35.370> simply<00:00:35.820> loosen<00:00:36.270> the

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
the first step is to simply loosen the

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.840 
the first step is to simply loosen the
straps<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.870> hold<00:00:37.080> the<00:00:37.260> net<00:00:37.410> upright<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:38.100> is

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
straps that hold the net upright it is

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.270 
straps that hold the net upright it is
really<00:00:39.180> easy<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.540> do<00:00:39.810> just<00:00:40.050> hold<00:00:40.650> the<00:00:40.770> clamp<00:00:41.010> on

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
really easy to do just hold the clamp on

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.040 
really easy to do just hold the clamp on
the<00:00:41.400> strap<00:00:41.700> down<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.420> should<00:00:42.600> loosen<00:00:42.900> on

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
the strap down and it should loosen on

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.770 
the strap down and it should loosen on
its<00:00:43.200> own<00:00:43.430> the<00:00:44.430> second<00:00:44.880> step<00:00:45.060> is<00:00:45.270> pretty<00:00:45.570> easy

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
its own the second step is pretty easy

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.770 
its own the second step is pretty easy
to<00:00:46.160> but<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.400> critical<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:47.970> folding<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> net

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
to but it is critical to folding the net

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.710 
to but it is critical to folding the net
into<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.110> neat<00:00:49.410> circle<00:00:49.860> like<00:00:50.040> you<00:00:50.190> want<00:00:50.720> you

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
into a neat circle like you want you

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.660 
into a neat circle like you want you
have<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:52.079> get<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.380> back<00:00:52.620> face<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.430> net

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
have to get the back face in the net

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.150 
have to get the back face in the net
fold<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.180> up<00:00:54.300> under<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.410> front<00:00:55.440> base<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:56.070> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
fold it up under the front base of the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.530 
fold it up under the front base of the
net<00:00:56.480> there<00:00:57.480> pretty<00:00:58.260> easy<00:00:58.500> huh<00:00:59.000> the<00:01:00.000> third<00:01:00.270> step

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
net there pretty easy huh the third step

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.920 
net there pretty easy huh the third step
is<00:01:00.780> most<00:01:01.200> critical<00:01:01.440> step<00:01:02.310> of<00:01:02.489> all<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:03.540> have<00:01:03.750> to

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
is most critical step of all you have to

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.190 
is most critical step of all you have to
fold<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.439> top<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.040> net<00:01:05.220> down<00:01:05.550> to<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.880> base

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
fold the top of the net down to the base

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.140 
fold the top of the net down to the base
when<00:01:07.200> my<00:01:07.409> dog<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.010> do<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.370> together<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:09.000> is

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
when my dog and I do it together it is

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.450 
when my dog and I do it together it is
simple<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:10.050> I<00:01:10.080> recommend<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.920> get<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> little

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
simple so I recommend you get a little

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.120 
simple so I recommend you get a little
help<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.850> complete<00:01:12.270> this<00:01:12.420> step<00:01:12.590> once<00:01:13.590> again<00:01:13.920> we

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
help to complete this step once again we

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.360 
help to complete this step once again we
make<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.460> look<00:01:14.610> easy<00:01:14.850> don't<00:01:15.270> we<00:01:15.920> you'll<00:01:16.920> notice

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:17.370 
make it look easy don't we you'll notice

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.520 
make it look easy don't we you'll notice
that<00:01:17.640> when<00:01:17.970> mad<00:01:18.210> dog<00:01:18.450> gets<00:01:18.690> the<00:01:18.810> net<00:01:19.110> folded

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
that when mad dog gets the net folded

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.590 
that when mad dog gets the net folded
down<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.979> creates<00:01:20.340> wings<00:01:20.790> on<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.180> right<00:01:21.390> and

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
down it creates wings on the right and

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.140 
down it creates wings on the right and
left<00:01:21.810> side<00:01:22.080> this<00:01:23.010> is<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.250> fourth<00:01:23.670> step<00:01:23.909> and

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
left side this is the fourth step and

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.510 
left side this is the fourth step and
when<00:01:24.479> done<00:01:24.750> you'll<00:01:25.140> have<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> neat<00:01:25.680> circle<00:01:26.310> all

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
when done you'll have a neat circle all

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.780 
when done you'll have a neat circle all
folded<00:01:26.909> up<00:01:27.260> take<00:01:28.260> the<00:01:28.440> right<00:01:28.680> wing<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.220> fold

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
folded up take the right wing and fold

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.120 
folded up take the right wing and fold
it<00:01:29.909> over<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.150> base<00:01:30.420> then<00:01:31.140> take<00:01:31.440> the<00:01:31.590> left<00:01:31.830> wing

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
it over the base then take the left wing

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.370 
it over the base then take the left wing
and<00:01:32.280> fold<00:01:32.640> it<00:01:32.760> down<00:01:32.790> on<00:01:33.119> top<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.450> both<00:01:33.659> cool

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
and fold it down on top of both cool

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.120 
and fold it down on top of both cool
right<00:01:35.960> now<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.020> just<00:01:37.350> have<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.530> put<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.010> away

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
right now you just have to put it away

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.880 
right now you just have to put it away
the<00:01:39.030> fifth<00:01:39.360> step<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.869> get<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.440> girdle<00:01:40.799> on

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
the fifth step is to get the girdle on

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.210 
the fifth step is to get the girdle on
it<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.909> really<00:01:42.119> easy<00:01:42.320> just<00:01:43.320> put<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.770> labels

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
it it is really easy just put the labels

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.520 
it it is really easy just put the labels
on<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.549> girdle<00:01:44.939> in<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.479> center<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.290> net

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
on the girdle in the center of the net

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.390 
on the girdle in the center of the net
on<00:01:46.710> either<00:01:47.189> side<00:01:48.409> once<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:49.860> done<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.369> can

putting the net in the bag isn't very

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.000 
putting the net in the bag isn't very
hard<00:02:12.819> at<00:02:12.970> all<00:02:13.090> my<00:02:14.020> dog<00:02:14.260> and<00:02:14.410> I<00:02:14.530> decide<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:14.890> use

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
hard at all my dog and I decide to use

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.970 
hard at all my dog and I decide to use
the<00:02:15.400> rolling<00:02:15.670> maneuver<00:02:16.270> by<00:02:17.020> placing<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.770> bag

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
the rolling maneuver by placing the bag

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.460 
the rolling maneuver by placing the bag
next<00:02:18.760> to<00:02:18.849> the<00:02:18.970> upright<00:02:19.390> net<00:02:19.599> and<00:02:19.870> rolling<00:02:20.319> the

next to the upright net and rolling the
net<00:02:20.620> into<00:02:21.010> it<00:02:21.160> I<00:02:21.540> think<00:02:22.540> it's<00:02:22.690> the<00:02:22.810> easiest<00:02:22.840> way

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
to do it you just have to be sure you

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.960 
to do it you just have to be sure you
get<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.230> bottom<00:02:26.739> half<00:02:26.980> inside<00:02:27.489> of<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.790> bag
