Chelsea I think we will PSU have been so
dominant<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:18.300> Liga<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:18.869> it's<00:00:19.020> hard<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.380> work

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
dominant in Liga and it's hard to work

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.109 
dominant in Liga and it's hard to work
out<00:00:19.740> just<00:00:19.770> where<00:00:20.310> they<00:00:20.460> stand<00:00:20.789> in<00:00:20.970> the

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
out just where they stand in the

out just where they stand in the
international<00:00:21.630> context<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.260> last<00:00:22.859> year<00:00:23.160> we

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
international context and last year we

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.830 
international context and last year we
saw<00:00:23.490> them<00:00:23.640> getting<00:00:23.820> very<00:00:24.150> close<00:00:24.300> against<00:00:24.779> the

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
saw them getting very close against the

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.929 
saw them getting very close against the
Barcelona<00:00:25.350> site<00:00:25.619> that<00:00:25.800> were<00:00:25.920> vulnerable<00:00:26.160> so

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
Barcelona site that were vulnerable so

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.820 
Barcelona site that were vulnerable so
I'm<00:00:27.060> not<00:00:27.210> quite<00:00:27.390> sure<00:00:27.480> just<00:00:27.720> how<00:00:28.170> much<00:00:28.439> that

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
I'm not quite sure just how much that

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.589 
I'm not quite sure just how much that
said<00:00:29.099> about<00:00:29.310> PSG<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:29.880> how<00:00:30.090> much<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.449> said

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
said about PSG and how much it said

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.959 
said about PSG and how much it said
about<00:00:30.810> Barcelona<00:00:31.050> this<00:00:31.949> year<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.489> think<00:00:32.550> again

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
about Barcelona this year I think again

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.360 
about Barcelona this year I think again
the<00:00:33.660> ease<00:00:33.870> with<00:00:33.899> which<00:00:34.200> they<00:00:34.559> blew<00:00:35.190> away

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
the ease with which they blew away

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.100 
the ease with which they blew away
Leverkusen<00:00:36.090> hasn't<00:00:36.360> really<00:00:36.540> told<00:00:36.719> us<00:00:36.899> much

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
Leverkusen hasn't really told us much

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.569 
Leverkusen hasn't really told us much
and<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.410> think<00:00:37.469> Chelsea<00:00:37.860> one<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.399> most

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
and I think Chelsea one of the most

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.490 
and I think Chelsea one of the most
awkward<00:00:39.030> teams<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.420> can<00:00:39.600> come<00:00:39.809> up<00:00:39.899> against<00:00:40.350> a

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
awkward teams you can come up against a

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.350 
awkward teams you can come up against a
team<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:41.190> will<00:00:41.309> find<00:00:41.610> your<00:00:41.760> weaknesses<00:00:42.180> and

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
team that will find your weaknesses and

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.420 
team that will find your weaknesses and
punish<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.719> for<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.230> think<00:00:43.829> will<00:00:43.950> know<00:00:44.129> just

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
punish you for it I think will know just

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.940 
punish you for it I think will know just
how<00:00:44.910> good<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.239> team<00:00:45.420> up<00:00:45.629> he<00:00:46.289> senses<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.680> bit<00:00:46.860> of

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
how good this team up he senses a bit of

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.670 
how good this team up he senses a bit of
anger<00:00:47.430> amongst<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.940> PSG<00:00:48.500> Brigade<00:00:49.500> that

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
anger amongst the PSG Brigade that

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.660 
anger amongst the PSG Brigade that
they're<00:00:49.800> not<00:00:49.920> being<00:00:50.190> given<00:00:50.309> enough<00:00:50.640> credit

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
they're not being given enough credit

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.430 
they're not being given enough credit
this<00:00:51.149> certainly<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:51.840> think<00:00:52.020> partly<00:00:52.289> that

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
this certainly and I think partly that

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.080 
this certainly and I think partly that
comes<00:00:52.649> down<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.250> Reformation<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.910> league

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
comes down to is Reformation the league

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.490 
comes down to is Reformation the league
that<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.360> plan<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.750> also<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.170> fact<00:00:55.379> that

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
that the plan and also the fact that

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.229 
that the plan and also the fact that
people<00:00:55.890> are<00:00:56.039> saying<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.210> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
people are saying that this is the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.180 
people are saying that this is the
developing<00:00:57.870> same<00:00:58.109> but<00:00:58.530> then<00:00:58.620> Mourinho<00:00:59.039> will

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
developing same but then Mourinho will

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.740 
developing same but then Mourinho will
put<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.520> same<00:00:59.670> argument<00:00:59.879> up<00:01:00.270> saying<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:00.600> is

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
put that same argument up saying this is

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.330 
put that same argument up saying this is
my<00:01:00.899> first<00:01:01.170> year<00:01:01.320> back<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.680> Chelsea<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.219> I'm
