for today's video it is to actually talk

for today's video it is to actually talk
about<00:00:30.470> the<00:00:30.619> equipment<00:00:30.859> that<00:00:31.160> I<00:00:31.339> use<00:00:31.369> to<00:00:31.609> record

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
about the equipment that I use to record

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.290 
about the equipment that I use to record
videos<00:00:32.509> now<00:00:32.839> on<00:00:33.199> de<00:00:33.440> Risley<00:00:33.710> com<00:00:34.220> now<00:00:34.580> the

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
videos now on de Risley com now the

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.240 
videos now on de Risley com now the
reason<00:00:35.480> these<00:00:35.750> videos<00:00:36.260> are<00:00:36.440> called<00:00:36.650> flip<00:00:36.949> tips

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
reason these videos are called flip tips

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.680 
reason these videos are called flip tips
by<00:00:37.430> the<00:00:37.489> way<00:00:37.730> is<00:00:37.790> because<00:00:38.089> for<00:00:38.449> the<00:00:38.510> longest

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
by the way is because for the longest

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.950 
by the way is because for the longest
time<00:00:38.989> I<00:00:39.730> used<00:00:40.730> this<00:00:40.879> which<00:00:41.360> is<00:00:41.480> a<00:00:41.510> flip<00:00:41.809> video

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
time I used this which is a flip video

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.500 
time I used this which is a flip video
is<00:00:42.409> actually<00:00:42.559> a<00:00:42.769> flip<00:00:43.129> mino<00:00:43.610> HD<00:00:43.820> could

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
is actually a flip mino HD could

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.350 
is actually a flip mino HD could
probably<00:00:44.750> see<00:00:45.110> it<00:00:45.140> there<00:00:45.530> it's<00:00:45.739> a<00:00:45.860> HD<00:00:46.850> and<00:00:47.210> it's

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
probably see it there it's a HD and it's

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.279 
probably see it there it's a HD and it's
a<00:00:47.570> really<00:00:48.500> cool<00:00:48.770> little<00:00:48.829> camera<00:00:49.609> now<00:00:50.300> it's

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
a really cool little camera now it's

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.349 
a really cool little camera now it's
good<00:00:51.559> for<00:00:51.739> portability<00:00:52.340> obviously<00:00:53.059> it's<00:00:53.180> real

00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:53.359 
good for portability obviously it's real

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:55.930 
good for portability obviously it's real
is<00:00:53.480> really<00:00:53.750> really<00:00:53.899> small<00:00:54.609> however<00:00:55.609> the

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
is really really small however the

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.049 
is really really small however the
quality<00:00:56.420> is<00:00:56.690> questionable<00:00:57.379> it<00:00:58.309> does<00:00:58.550> do<00:00:58.699> HD

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
quality is questionable it does do HD

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.910 
quality is questionable it does do HD
quality<00:00:59.300> however<00:00:59.780> if<00:01:00.379> you're<00:01:00.590> true<00:01:00.800> if<00:01:00.859> you

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
quality however if you're true if you

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.110 
quality however if you're true if you
really<00:01:01.250> want<00:01:01.430> your<00:01:01.519> videos<00:01:01.850> to<00:01:01.879> look

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
really want your videos to look

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.939 
really want your videos to look
professional<00:01:02.559> you're<00:01:03.559> going<00:01:03.679> to<00:01:03.769> have<00:01:03.890> a

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
professional you're going to have a

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:05.800 
professional you're going to have a
difficult<00:01:04.220> time<00:01:04.580> with<00:01:04.910> these<00:01:05.059> only<00:01:05.300> because

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
difficult time with these only because

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.749 
difficult time with these only because
it's<00:01:06.050> got<00:01:06.140> no<00:01:06.410> stabilization<00:01:07.340> so<00:01:07.550> if<00:01:07.640> you're

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
it's got no stabilization so if you're

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:09.520 
it's got no stabilization so if you're
walking<00:01:07.910> around<00:01:08.270> doing<00:01:08.539> stuff<00:01:08.960> it's<00:01:09.229> going<00:01:09.470> to

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
walking around doing stuff it's going to

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.440 
walking around doing stuff it's going to
be<00:01:09.649> it's<00:01:09.830> going<00:01:09.920> to<00:01:10.100> look<00:01:10.190> real<00:01:10.340> shaky<00:01:10.820> the

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
be it's going to look real shaky the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.779 
be it's going to look real shaky the
other<00:01:11.600> thing<00:01:11.869> is<00:01:12.110> that<00:01:12.140> the<00:01:12.380> zoom<00:01:12.649> is<00:01:12.950> only<00:01:13.429> 2x

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:13.789 
other thing is that the zoom is only 2x

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:16.480 
other thing is that the zoom is only 2x
and<00:01:14.390> when<00:01:15.050> you<00:01:15.170> do<00:01:15.410> zoom<00:01:15.740> sometimes<00:01:16.340> the

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
and when you do zoom sometimes the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.490 
and when you do zoom sometimes the
quality<00:01:16.880> does<00:01:17.030> not<00:01:17.209> look<00:01:17.450> that<00:01:17.509> good<00:01:17.959> I<00:01:18.020> mean<00:01:18.410> a

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
quality does not look that good I mean a

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.809 
quality does not look that good I mean a
lot<00:01:18.649> of<00:01:18.709> times<00:01:18.920> are<00:01:19.069> a<00:01:19.099> little<00:01:19.130> kind<00:01:19.459> of<00:01:19.550> grainy

00:01:19.809 --> 00:01:19.819 
lot of times are a little kind of grainy

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:21.639 
lot of times are a little kind of grainy
or<00:01:20.030> a<00:01:20.300> look<00:01:20.569> a<00:01:20.660> little<00:01:20.810> blurry<00:01:21.140> or<00:01:21.349> something

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
or a look a little blurry or something

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.949 
or a look a little blurry or something
like<00:01:21.770> that<00:01:21.830> so<00:01:22.190> pretty<00:01:22.550> much<00:01:22.759> it's<00:01:23.179> just<00:01:23.360> a<00:01:23.479> 1x

00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:23.959 
like that so pretty much it's just a 1x

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:26.320 
like that so pretty much it's just a 1x
whatever<00:01:24.830> you<00:01:25.009> see<00:01:25.220> is<00:01:25.340> what<00:01:25.369> you<00:01:25.640> get<00:01:25.880> if<00:01:26.119> you

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
whatever you see is what you get if you

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.910 
whatever you see is what you get if you
try<00:01:26.690> to<00:01:26.750> zoom<00:01:26.869> it's<00:01:27.259> not<00:01:27.440> going<00:01:27.560> to<00:01:27.649> look<00:01:27.709> that

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
try to zoom it's not going to look that

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.309 
try to zoom it's not going to look that
great<00:01:28.099> and<00:01:28.459> the<00:01:29.119> other<00:01:29.239> thing<00:01:29.330> is<00:01:29.569> it's<00:01:29.989> got<00:01:30.110> no

00:01:30.309 --> 00:01:30.319 
great and the other thing is it's got no

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:32.650 
great and the other thing is it's got no
audio<00:01:30.649> input<00:01:31.069> so<00:01:31.310> it<00:01:31.640> just<00:01:32.030> uses<00:01:32.149> the<00:01:32.330> little

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
audio input so it just uses the little

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.440 
audio input so it just uses the little
Mike<00:01:32.840> you<00:01:33.500> know<00:01:33.590> speakers<00:01:34.099> that<00:01:34.250> are<00:01:34.280> on<00:01:34.520> it<00:01:34.550> to

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
Mike you know speakers that are on it to

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.900 
Mike you know speakers that are on it to
to<00:01:35.750> pick<00:01:36.170> up<00:01:36.289> sound<00:01:36.560> so<00:01:36.890> what<00:01:37.130> happens<00:01:37.550> is<00:01:37.759> all

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
to pick up sound so what happens is all

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.419 
to pick up sound so what happens is all
the<00:01:38.090> sound<00:01:38.690> sounds<00:01:39.140> kind<00:01:39.319> of<00:01:39.349> echoey<00:01:39.800> it<00:01:40.160> picks

00:01:40.419 --> 00:01:40.429 
the sound sounds kind of echoey it picks

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:42.520 
the sound sounds kind of echoey it picks
up<00:01:40.550> all<00:01:40.759> the<00:01:40.970> background<00:01:41.450> noise<00:01:41.569> I<00:01:42.020> mean<00:01:42.500> for

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
up all the background noise I mean for

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.529 
up all the background noise I mean for
camera<00:01:43.039> the<00:01:43.190> size<00:01:43.399> is<00:01:43.640> fantastic<00:01:44.390> but<00:01:44.479> you

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
camera the size is fantastic but you

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.029 
camera the size is fantastic but you
have<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:44.869> realize<00:01:44.989> that<00:01:45.229> a<00:01:45.440> camera<00:01:45.739> this<00:01:45.830> size

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:46.039 
have to realize that a camera this size

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.880 
have to realize that a camera this size
has<00:01:46.310> limitations<00:01:46.819> to<00:01:47.270> it<00:01:47.390> which<00:01:48.020> is<00:01:48.170> why<00:01:48.440> I<00:01:48.470> am

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
has limitations to it which is why I am

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.919 
has limitations to it which is why I am
now<00:01:49.220> using<00:01:49.520> another<00:01:50.030> camera<00:01:50.539> here<00:01:50.750> in<00:01:50.810> my

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
here's the camera it's actually a canon

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.870 
here's the camera it's actually a canon
vixia<00:02:30.020> hf<00:02:31.020> 100<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.220> can<00:02:32.370> see<00:02:32.550> that<00:02:32.580> I've<00:02:32.850> got

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
vixia hf 100 you can see that I've got

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.140 
vixia hf 100 you can see that I've got
the<00:02:33.390> screen<00:02:34.170> pointed<00:02:34.650> at<00:02:34.860> me<00:02:35.160> right<00:02:35.460> now<00:02:35.490> if

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
the screen pointed at me right now if

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.060 
the screen pointed at me right now if
you<00:02:36.240> look<00:02:36.390> over<00:02:36.600> here<00:02:36.720> that's<00:02:37.620> where<00:02:37.830> I<00:02:37.860> was

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
you look over here that's where I was

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.430 
you look over here that's where I was
just<00:02:38.220> sitting<00:02:38.570> so<00:02:39.570> I've<00:02:39.720> got<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:40.050> screen

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
just sitting so I've got that screen

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.140 
just sitting so I've got that screen
point<00:02:40.740> at<00:02:40.920> me<00:02:41.070> so<00:02:41.250> that<00:02:41.370> I<00:02:41.400> can<00:02:41.490> actually<00:02:41.910> see

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
point at me so that I can actually see

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.950 
point at me so that I can actually see
myself<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:43.260> lens<00:02:43.470> is<00:02:43.650> wide<00:02:43.860> open<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:44.960> and

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
myself and the lens is wide open and and

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.800 
myself and the lens is wide open and and
so<00:02:46.470> this<00:02:46.620> thing<00:02:46.830> is<00:02:46.860> it's<00:02:47.220> an<00:02:47.370> HD<00:02:47.820> camera<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.600> is

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
so this thing is it's an HD camera it is

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.260 
so this thing is it's an HD camera it is
a<00:02:48.840> 1080p<00:02:49.440> camera<00:02:50.040> which<00:02:50.310> is<00:02:50.430> incredibly<00:02:51.060> high

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
a 1080p camera which is incredibly high

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.450 
a 1080p camera which is incredibly high
def<00:02:51.540> much<00:02:51.960> more<00:02:52.260> than<00:02:52.410> I<00:02:52.470> actually<00:02:52.680> need<00:02:53.160> for

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
def much more than I actually need for

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.030 
def much more than I actually need for
the<00:02:53.550> Internet<00:02:53.970> however<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.230> lens<00:02:55.440> quality<00:02:55.950> is

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
the Internet however the lens quality is

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.840 
the Internet however the lens quality is
superior<00:02:56.550> by<00:02:56.880> far<00:02:57.560> over<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.590> flip<00:02:58.860> mino<00:02:59.100> HD<00:02:59.130> so

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
superior by far over the flip mino HD so

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.030 
superior by far over the flip mino HD so
therefore<00:03:00.660> a<00:03:00.690> hand<00:03:00.990> was<00:03:01.080> light<00:03:01.350> better<00:03:01.620> it

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
therefore a hand was light better it

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.740 
therefore a hand was light better it
handles<00:03:02.400> a<00:03:02.490> lot<00:03:02.610> of<00:03:03.000> things<00:03:03.090> better<00:03:03.360> it's<00:03:03.630> got

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
handles a lot of things better it's got

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.830 
handles a lot of things better it's got
image<00:03:03.990> stabilization<00:03:04.940> now<00:03:05.940> this<00:03:06.570> thing<00:03:06.750> on

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
image stabilization now this thing on

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.630 
image stabilization now this thing on
the<00:03:06.870> top<00:03:07.140> is<00:03:07.440> actually<00:03:07.860> called<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.100> shotgun

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
the top is actually called a shotgun

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.720 
the top is actually called a shotgun
microphone<00:03:09.510> now<00:03:10.350> it's<00:03:10.620> got<00:03:10.860> this<00:03:11.040> dead<00:03:11.430> cat

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
microphone now it's got this dead cat

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.790 
microphone now it's got this dead cat
looking<00:03:12.090> thing<00:03:12.330> on<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.720> but<00:03:12.959> what<00:03:13.260> this<00:03:13.440> is<00:03:13.650> is

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
looking thing on it but what this is is

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.830 
looking thing on it but what this is is
just<00:03:13.950> basically<00:03:14.400> a<00:03:14.490> wind<00:03:14.790> filter<00:03:15.060> if<00:03:15.450> I<00:03:15.600> were

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
just basically a wind filter if I were

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.890 
just basically a wind filter if I were
to<00:03:16.250> take<00:03:17.250> that<00:03:17.520> off<00:03:17.700> you'd<00:03:18.060> see<00:03:18.330> that<00:03:18.630> that's

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
to take that off you'd see that that's

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.780 
to take that off you'd see that that's
what<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.350> actual<00:03:19.650> microphone<00:03:20.250> looks<00:03:20.520> like

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
what the actual microphone looks like

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.090 
what the actual microphone looks like
this<00:03:21.360> this<00:03:21.570> filter<00:03:22.080> basically<00:03:22.560> just<00:03:22.740> goes<00:03:22.920> on

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
this this filter basically just goes on

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.650 
this this filter basically just goes on
it<00:03:23.340> in<00:03:23.459> order<00:03:23.520> to<00:03:23.820> filter<00:03:24.450> out<00:03:24.630> background

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
it in order to filter out background

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.260 
it in order to filter out background
noise<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.680> things<00:03:25.890> like<00:03:26.070> that<00:03:26.130> now<00:03:26.910> what<00:03:27.090> this

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
noise and things like that now what this

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.570 
noise and things like that now what this
thing<00:03:27.510> does<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.810> shotgun<00:03:28.500> mic<00:03:28.709> is<00:03:28.980> that<00:03:29.160> it<00:03:29.280> more

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
thing does a shotgun mic is that it more

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.050 
thing does a shotgun mic is that it more
properly<00:03:30.120> focuses<00:03:30.989> the<00:03:31.380> this<00:03:32.190> it<00:03:32.459> gets<00:03:32.910> the

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
properly focuses the this it gets the

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.520 
properly focuses the this it gets the
sound<00:03:33.330> directly<00:03:33.690> in<00:03:33.810> front<00:03:33.840> of<00:03:33.989> the<00:03:34.080> camera

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
sound directly in front of the camera

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.960 
sound directly in front of the camera
and<00:03:34.650> that's<00:03:35.040> what<00:03:35.250> it<00:03:35.340> picks<00:03:35.519> up<00:03:35.640> better<00:03:35.910> than

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
and that's what it picks up better than

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.810 
and that's what it picks up better than
everything<00:03:36.300> else<00:03:36.600> now<00:03:37.110> if<00:03:38.010> we<00:03:38.160> go<00:03:38.190> look<00:03:38.610> at<00:03:38.700> the

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
everything else now if we go look at the

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.479 
everything else now if we go look at the
furry<00:03:39.380> front<00:03:40.380> of<00:03:40.440> this<00:03:40.530> camera<00:03:41.100> right<00:03:41.430> here

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
furry front of this camera right here

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.509 
furry front of this camera right here
are<00:03:42.209> actually<00:03:42.440> two<00:03:43.440> little<00:03:43.650> microphone<00:03:44.160> areas

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
are actually two little microphone areas

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.880 
are actually two little microphone areas
the<00:03:45.180> problem<00:03:45.630> is<00:03:45.780> it's<00:03:46.110> an<00:03:46.230> omnidirectional

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
the problem is it's an omnidirectional

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.190 
the problem is it's an omnidirectional
microphone<00:03:47.730> so<00:03:47.880> it<00:03:47.970> picks<00:03:48.120> up<00:03:48.269> everything<00:03:48.510> in

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
microphone so it picks up everything in

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.780 
microphone so it picks up everything in
the<00:03:49.290> room<00:03:49.440> including<00:03:49.950> all<00:03:50.070> background<00:03:50.580> noise

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
the room including all background noise

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.850 
the room including all background noise
so<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.269> idea<00:03:51.390> would<00:03:51.810> be<00:03:51.870> that<00:03:52.019> I<00:03:52.200> put<00:03:52.410> this<00:03:52.620> on

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
so the idea would be that I put this on

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.040 
so the idea would be that I put this on
top<00:03:53.070> of<00:03:53.310> it<00:03:53.459> and<00:03:53.640> it<00:03:54.360> filters<00:03:54.570> along<00:03:54.900> that

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
top of it and it filters along that

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.380 
top of it and it filters along that
stuff<00:03:55.290> out<00:03:55.470> now<00:03:56.010> it's<00:03:56.160> not<00:03:56.340> perfect<00:03:57.060> this<00:03:57.209> is<00:03:57.330> a

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
stuff out now it's not perfect this is a

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.570 
stuff out now it's not perfect this is a
pretty<00:03:57.600> good<00:03:57.900> mic<00:03:58.170> but<00:03:58.440> it's<00:03:58.560> not<00:03:58.739> perfect<00:03:59.340> and

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
pretty good mic but it's not perfect and

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.250 
pretty good mic but it's not perfect and
that's<00:03:59.970> what<00:04:00.239> you<00:04:00.360> were<00:04:00.450> listening<00:04:00.600> to<00:04:00.989> me<00:04:01.140> on

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
that's what you were listening to me on

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.050 
that's what you were listening to me on
just<00:04:01.440> a<00:04:01.590> bit<00:04:01.709> ago<00:04:01.769> but<00:04:02.250> in<00:04:02.340> a<00:04:02.400> second<00:04:02.820> i'll<00:04:02.880> show

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.040 
on the other camera now so you probably
notice<00:04:08.580> there's<00:04:08.700> a<00:04:08.790> definite<00:04:09.209> difference<00:04:09.750> in

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
notice there's a definite difference in

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.170 
notice there's a definite difference in
quality<00:04:10.230> here<00:04:10.830> and<00:04:11.040> again<00:04:11.580> you're<00:04:11.760> listening

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
here was this thing it is a clonal

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.910 
here was this thing it is a clonal
Avalere<00:04:40.570> microphone<00:04:41.230> this<00:04:41.470> one's<00:04:41.680> made<00:04:41.800> by

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:41.920 
Avalere microphone this one's made by

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.040 
Avalere microphone this one's made by
audio<00:04:42.280> technica<00:04:43.470> and<00:04:45.030> now<00:04:46.030> this<00:04:46.210> is<00:04:46.390> my<00:04:46.540> second

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
audio technica and now this is my second

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.080 
audio technica and now this is my second
one<00:04:47.170> I<00:04:47.440> have<00:04:47.860> one<00:04:48.070> down<00:04:48.250> here<00:04:48.580> in<00:04:48.670> the<00:04:48.760> floor

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
right now that I'm not actually using

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.340 
right now that I'm not actually using
right<00:04:51.880> now<00:04:51.910> but<00:04:52.270> basically<00:04:52.600> what<00:04:52.840> this<00:04:53.050> is<00:04:53.320> a

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
right now but basically what this is a

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.260 
right now but basically what this is a
little<00:04:53.710> microphone<00:04:54.160> so<00:04:54.790> what<00:04:54.940> you'll<00:04:55.060> see

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
little microphone so what you'll see

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.000 
little microphone so what you'll see
sometimes<00:04:55.750> with<00:04:55.930> me<00:04:56.110> when<00:04:56.290> I<00:04:56.320> record<00:04:56.710> videos

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
sometimes with me when I record videos

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.460 
sometimes with me when I record videos
now<00:04:57.250> is<00:04:57.490> you'll<00:04:58.240> see<00:04:58.480> me<00:04:59.050> wearing<00:04:59.350> a

microphone on my shirt and so the mic is
right<00:05:02.050> here<00:05:02.350> it<00:05:02.530> picks<00:05:02.770> up<00:05:02.920> my<00:05:03.100> voice<00:05:03.400> very

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
right here it picks up my voice very

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.450 
right here it picks up my voice very
clearly<00:05:04.300> and<00:05:04.480> it<00:05:05.110> actually<00:05:05.560> has<00:05:05.890> a<00:05:05.920> wire<00:05:06.250> that

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
clearly and it actually has a wire that

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:07.890 
clearly and it actually has a wire that
goes<00:05:06.520> across<00:05:06.760> and<00:05:07.180> plugs<00:05:07.390> into<00:05:07.570> the<00:05:07.690> back<00:05:07.750> of

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
goes across and plugs into the back of

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.530 
goes across and plugs into the back of
this<00:05:08.080> camera<00:05:08.500> now<00:05:09.040> that's<00:05:09.220> a<00:05:09.340> big<00:05:09.820> thing<00:05:10.120> if

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
this camera now that's a big thing if

about 16 bucks or 17 bucks they're not

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.420 
about 16 bucks or 17 bucks they're not
expensive<00:05:35.350> the<00:05:35.680> reason<00:05:35.950> why<00:05:36.040> this<00:05:36.100> one<00:05:36.340> is

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.580 
issues i actually did buy a wireless and
I<00:06:00.400> was<00:06:00.580> not<00:06:00.820> happy<00:06:01.180> at<00:06:01.330> all<00:06:01.360> with<00:06:01.960> the<00:06:02.140> sound

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
I was not happy at all with the sound

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.490 
I was not happy at all with the sound
quality<00:06:02.770> so<00:06:03.580> that<00:06:04.150> was<00:06:04.300> a<00:06:04.330> $90<00:06:04.930> mike<00:06:05.260> by<00:06:05.440> the

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.500 
quality so that was a $90 mike by the

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.410 
quality so that was a $90 mike by the
way<00:06:05.740> the<00:06:05.860> woman<00:06:06.070> I<00:06:06.130> tried<00:06:06.340> earlier<00:06:06.580> this<00:06:07.150> one

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:07.420 
way the woman I tried earlier this one

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.300 
way the woman I tried earlier this one
16<00:06:07.870> bucks<00:06:08.140> sounds<00:06:08.560> a<00:06:08.620> hell<00:06:08.830> of<00:06:08.860> a<00:06:08.980> lot<00:06:09.100> better

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
16 bucks sounds a hell of a lot better

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.150 
16 bucks sounds a hell of a lot better
and<00:06:09.550> it's<00:06:09.640> because<00:06:09.970> it's<00:06:10.120> not<00:06:10.240> using<00:06:10.540> wireless

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 
and it's because it's not using wireless

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.580 
and it's because it's not using wireless
so<00:06:12.390> that's<00:06:13.390> pretty<00:06:13.690> much<00:06:13.780> what<00:06:14.080> i'm<00:06:14.200> using<00:06:14.440> now

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.970 
so that's pretty much what i'm using now

it's<00:06:51.690> one<00:06:51.810> of<00:06:51.900> the<00:06:51.990> cool<00:06:52.200> things<00:06:52.230> I<00:06:52.560> like<00:06:52.710> about

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:52.740 
it's one of the cool things I like about

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:54.680 
it's one of the cool things I like about
the<00:06:53.100> math<00:06:53.280> is<00:06:53.520> that<00:06:53.640> we<00:06:53.730> can<00:06:53.850> plug<00:06:54.060> stuff<00:06:54.300> into

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:54.690 
the math is that we can plug stuff into

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.650 
the math is that we can plug stuff into
it<00:06:54.840> usually<00:06:55.320> just<00:06:55.350> works<00:06:56.330> now<00:06:57.330> I've<00:06:57.480> heard

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660 
it usually just works now I've heard

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.940 
it usually just works now I've heard
some<00:06:57.930> people<00:06:58.200> say<00:06:58.380> you<00:06:58.440> have<00:06:58.650> to<00:06:58.770> use<00:06:58.920> a

00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:58.950 
some people say you have to use a

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.350 
some people say you have to use a
special<00:06:59.430> software<00:06:59.670> that<00:07:00.000> came<00:07:00.120> in<00:07:00.270> this

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 
special software that came in this

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.360 
special software that came in this
camera<00:07:00.780> in<00:07:00.990> order<00:07:01.260> to<00:07:01.290> get<00:07:01.440> movies<00:07:01.800> off<00:07:01.980> of<00:07:02.220> it

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.370 
camera in order to get movies off of it

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.820 
camera in order to get movies off of it
I've<00:07:02.610> also<00:07:03.000> heard<00:07:03.330> that<00:07:03.390> Sony<00:07:03.990> Vegas<00:07:04.320> which<00:07:04.710> is

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:04.830 
I've also heard that Sony Vegas which is

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:05.960 
I've also heard that Sony Vegas which is
apparently<00:07:05.130> a<00:07:05.340> pretty<00:07:05.610> good<00:07:05.790> piece<00:07:05.940> of

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:05.970 
apparently a pretty good piece of

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.000 
apparently a pretty good piece of
software<00:07:06.420> can<00:07:06.660> deal<00:07:06.870> with<00:07:07.080> this<00:07:07.200> format<00:07:07.650> of<00:07:07.770> a

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.010 
software can deal with this format of a

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.280 
software can deal with this format of a
movie<00:07:08.550> just<00:07:08.700> fine<00:07:09.000> so<00:07:09.450> you<00:07:09.900> might<00:07:10.110> have<00:07:10.200> to

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:10.290 
movie just fine so you might have to

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:11.570 
movie just fine so you might have to
deal<00:07:10.530> with<00:07:10.680> that<00:07:10.740> but<00:07:11.100> one<00:07:11.280> way<00:07:11.400> the<00:07:11.550> other

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:11.580 
deal with that but one way the other

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.040 
deal with that but one way the other
you'll<00:07:11.940> be<00:07:12.060> able<00:07:12.180> to<00:07:12.330> get<00:07:12.480> your<00:07:12.570> footage<00:07:12.900> off

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.050 
you'll be able to get your footage off

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:16.670 
you'll be able to get your footage off
the<00:07:13.080> camera<00:07:13.590> and<00:07:13.770> then<00:07:15.170> play<00:07:16.170> with<00:07:16.350> it<00:07:16.470> the<00:07:16.560> way

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 
the camera and then play with it the way

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.340 
the camera and then play with it the way
you<00:07:16.740> see<00:07:16.860> fit<00:07:17.070> so<00:07:17.580> anyway<00:07:17.940> that<00:07:18.180> is<00:07:18.780> a<00:07:19.020> rough

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:19.350 
you see fit so anyway that is a rough

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:20.990 
you see fit so anyway that is a rough
overview<00:07:19.770> of<00:07:20.070> the<00:07:20.160> equipment<00:07:20.430> that<00:07:20.700> I'm<00:07:20.820> now

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 
overview of the equipment that I'm now

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.390 
overview of the equipment that I'm now
using<00:07:21.030> to<00:07:21.750> produce<00:07:21.990> internet<00:07:22.650> video<00:07:23.010> and

using to produce internet video and

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.520 
using to produce internet video and
hopefully<00:07:24.000> that<00:07:24.450> was<00:07:24.540> helpful<00:07:24.600> to<00:07:24.900> you<00:07:25.050> catch

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:25.530
