00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
have some some materials that I've

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.419 
have some some materials that I've
gathered<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:13.019> basically<00:00:13.320> how<00:00:13.650> we<00:00:13.679> make<00:00:14.190> the

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429

iron cross bow which is actually the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.890 
iron cross bow which is actually the
weakest<00:00:17.039> type<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:17.940> by<00:00:18.300> making<00:00:18.449> an<00:00:18.720> iron

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
weakest type is by making an iron

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.439 
weakest type is by making an iron
pickaxe<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.710> putting<00:00:20.490> string<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.270> the

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.140 
pickaxe and putting string in the
armpits<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.140> we<00:00:22.289> will<00:00:22.470> get<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:23.640> iron<00:00:23.850> cross

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
armpits and we will get the iron cross

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.320 
armpits and we will get the iron cross
bow<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.750> this<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:25.080> manly<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:25.890> if<00:00:26.189> we<00:00:27.060> want<00:00:27.269> to

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.300 
bow and this is manly and if we want to
upgrade<00:00:27.480> basically<00:00:28.140> just<00:00:28.320> make<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.830> diamond

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310

and surround it with diamonds and that

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.069 
and surround it with diamonds and that
will<00:00:47.219> give<00:00:47.250> us<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.670> app<00:00:48.120> across<00:00:48.570> bone<00:00:48.809> as<00:00:48.989> you

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
will give us the app across bone as you

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.080 
will give us the app across bone as you
can<00:00:49.170> see<00:00:49.350> there's<00:00:49.559> not<00:00:49.800> really<00:00:50.129> much<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.789> a

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
can see there's not really much of a
