00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 a samurai who was considered a 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.509
 demon movements were so fast 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.500
 which were compared to the hands of a 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.450
 God 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.160
 after nearly a decade of massacres 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.590
 and old the body always bathed in 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.420
 and I decided to give up this life and 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.580
 become one of the line but the instinct of a 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.039
 Assassin is always tapping hold on the 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.279
 time to make the blood gush more 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.109
 once with whom you curse and Moorish 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.150
 lipstick sar the idea behind the 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.310
 character was to abuse the concept of 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.099
 low salary or a rich soil already 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.149
 technique actually feared is the serve in 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.950
 anime and manga 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.899
 The name of this technique is low along which 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.820
 means without winning the sword 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.559
 to gain more force and speed 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.960
 impact to symbolize this technique 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.789
 we chose the samurai theme and with it 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.860
 we see a power for now called 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.140
 araujo when rolling our initiative 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.820
 we can also kick half of our 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.559
 speed than the type of motion that 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.960
 not an attack of opportunity 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.059
 if we stop adjacent to the enemy we 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.980
 we won two more in the attack against him 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.379
 but the most important is that our 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.449
 initiative was higher than all 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.000
 the other opponents our attacks on 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.760
 first round and criticize 18 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.920
 to fitch the idea then is to start the 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.990
 fighting everything at the speed of 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.030
 a god for that we choose the class 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.979
 slayer who is a warrior based on 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.350
 Dada, but what about a woman? 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.330
 samurais use captains as we do not 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.490
 we have the option to select a catana 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.409
 As a weapon I selected a fugue lady I 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.570
 I will explain why in any system 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.909
 following is considered the summit of a 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.600
 Combat Blade was the most perfect 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.799
 possible 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.259
 many people say that the sword 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.119
 would be a macana but I 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.640
 I strongly disagree at the end of the day 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.329
 escape is much higher than it is enough. 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.430
 world 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.740
 so we 're in a milk leak like 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.390
 if it was a macana but with two hands 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.149
 now we have to make our 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.530
 first useful shift or abuse of the 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.630
 critic from 18 to 20 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.210
 for that we are the lucky strike talent 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.219
 and with it all two attack dice 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.540
 in the first attack of an encounter that 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.790
 our initiative was the highest 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.290
 accumulating two data which means 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.450
 that our chances of causing a 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.040
 critical issues are higher since the 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.870
 census is a talent that makes us look 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.660
 two dice said 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.030
 This is very good if the 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.130
 too, not going very useful and 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.380
 now we have fought 20 against 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.540
 positive enemies lower than our 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.280
 in the first name of combat but the stop 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.710
 is to ensure more attacks from the first 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.770
 because we are going to stay all of them 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.350
 18 to 20 and for this our to buy 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.850
 metrics layer falls like a glove with it 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.310
 when we spend our country action 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.590
 we won a mini break for free 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.900
 as a free nation, and we still have the 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.670
 standard action we gain from bridge action 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.500
 we also select a boom is a 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.330
 different type of male has 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.760
 get in the power of guns we spend 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.250
 a standard action to win two attacks 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.910
 but with 2 less in set to 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.160
 the two 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.140
 with all this together we have four 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.010
 attacks in a tunnel that we spend 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.900
 edson bridge 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.370
 This is a lot cooler than 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.050
 who knows the battlefield 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.970
 so the guys are not throwing a 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.380
 hollow pirouette carrying another brother in the 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.700
 No one comes around, he wants to. 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.830
 So we have to try. 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.660
 to do this we decided to invest in 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.210
 actions of his invested 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.670
 Our home is only rain, it is very useful. 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.470
 protect us from invested actions with him 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.660
 our movement as part of a 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.190
 invested does not generate opportunity taxi 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.010
 this is very useful 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:23.400
 wang is good is our weapon plus one of 8 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.459
 of damage in perfect meat actions love 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.020
 off shore indy is our mature 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.970
 we have a power by meeting us 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.650
 we have invisible until the end of the turn 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.420
 after performing a load 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.239
 This is perfect for that 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.400
 Tim k gave me the habit he died. 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.709
 but while giving we are talking the 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.959
 attack of the one that had 24 more against 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.550
 being that it is very high level of it with more 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:48.030
 two of the fight against dengue and we arrived in 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.580
 26 more which is very good giving us base 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.500
 is one of 12 plus 22 which is very solid 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.690
 but may increase depending on the situation 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.820
 as a slayer class dream we 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.570
 We add six more thanks to our 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.959
 driver 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:03.090
 we arrived and one of 12 and over 28 but with the 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.280
 invested we are two more new 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.590
 talents that the kingdom of sports and 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.070
 plus one of 8 grace our vanguard neighborhood 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.530
 we arrived then one of 12 plus one of 8 more 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.569
 without using our power 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.669
 stretch says law just one more 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:19.799
 Lugano ie another 12 we have 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.519
 four use for now so there is more is 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.610
 what to wear 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:27.210
 we then arrived in 2012 plus one of 8 more 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.639
 30 well, our vision now imagine four 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.830
 attacks much if we use the 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.690
 four attacks criticizing 18 to 20 knots 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.280
 We can get how much damage 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.340
 the first attack goes to one of 12 more 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.580
 28 with which draws in 2012 and more than 28 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.699
 then three attacks of 11 of 12 plus 28 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.910
 we then arrived in five of 12 plus 112 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:50.759
 in mass sixth taxi criticize remember remember 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.960
 that you go maximum value of 12 and sounds 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:55.949
 water magic 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:59.789
 this would put the kin shing at 172 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:03.060
 base damage plus the rolled water and this 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:05.970
 it's a lot of damage what they found on the boat 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.400
 and the power plate comes to the 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.740
 end in the next video is explaining the 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.610
 new series for the construction of 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.930
 characters 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.099
 I do not want to give more details in this 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.349
 video so you do not have to wait for the 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:18.980
 close but for all we had a good time. 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:22.130
 week and good stores 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:29.740
 your movements were yours if you did not win 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:39.700
 Samurai theme that has a ball that is 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:43.520
 as we do not have the option to leave like this 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:45.550
 It is not whether or not the Constitution is not 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:48.550
 have none during the attack a little 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.550
 like this
