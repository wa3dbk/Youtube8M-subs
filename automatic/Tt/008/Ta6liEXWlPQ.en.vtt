downtown bridge this might be the new

downtown bridge this might be the new
front<00:00:24.750> door<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.140> Louisville<00:00:25.560> what's<00:00:26.160> right

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
front door to Louisville what's right

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.830 
front door to Louisville what's right
about<00:00:26.400> this<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.240> gets<00:00:27.359> traffic

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
about this is that it gets traffic

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.720 
about this is that it gets traffic
across<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.349> river<00:00:28.590> what's<00:00:29.189> wrong<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.699> that

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
across the river what's wrong is that

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.429 
across the river what's wrong is that
it's<00:00:29.939> upriver<00:00:30.300> from<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.630> Kennedy<00:00:30.990> bridge<00:00:31.199> and

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
it's upriver from a Kennedy bridge and

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.440 
it's upriver from a Kennedy bridge and
therefore<00:00:31.769> mostly<00:00:32.130> invisible<00:00:32.489> from<00:00:32.969> downtown

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
therefore mostly invisible from downtown

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.720 
therefore mostly invisible from downtown
also<00:00:34.290> its<00:00:34.500> proximity<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.370> Kennedy

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
also its proximity to the Kennedy

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.069 
also its proximity to the Kennedy
emphasizes<00:00:36.450> they're<00:00:36.630> very<00:00:36.840> different

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
if they're from Indiana I think maybe

they're all in on this so here's a right

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.929 
they're all in on this so here's a right

more<00:01:38.759> welcoming<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.390> Kentucky<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.229> from<00:01:40.770> the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
more welcoming to Kentucky and from the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.980 
more welcoming to Kentucky and from the
park<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.220> bridges<00:01:41.520> look<00:01:41.700> like<00:01:41.909> bookends<00:01:42.600> and

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
park the bridges look like bookends and

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.530 
park the bridges look like bookends and
so<00:01:43.710> they<00:01:43.829> should<00:01:44.070> be<00:01:44.250> these<00:01:45.090> additional

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
so they should be these additional

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.940 
so they should be these additional
arched<00:01:45.840> elements<00:01:46.350> while<00:01:46.500> literally

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
arched elements while literally

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.679 
arched elements while literally
supported<00:01:47.520> by<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.670> two<00:01:47.880> bridges<00:01:48.119> also

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
supported by the two bridges also

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.870 
supported by the two bridges also
connected<00:01:49.200> them<00:01:49.350> there<00:01:49.860> were<00:01:50.009> two<00:01:50.280> but<00:01:50.579> adding

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
connected them there were two but adding

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.670 
connected them there were two but adding
this<00:01:50.970> doesn't<00:01:51.299> make<00:01:51.420> three<00:01:51.899> it's<00:01:52.530> a

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
this doesn't make three it's a

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.120 
this doesn't make three it's a

thing<00:01:56.390> it<00:01:57.390> should<00:01:57.540> be<00:01:57.689> said<00:01:57.869> here<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.170> this

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
thing it should be said here that this

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.080 
thing it should be said here that this
is<00:01:58.469> less<00:01:58.680> expensive<00:01:58.890> than<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.640> original

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
is less expensive than the original

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.750 
is less expensive than the original
proposal<00:02:00.979> it's<00:02:01.979> better<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:03.390> costs<00:02:03.840> less

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760 
proposal it's better and it costs less

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.700 
proposal it's better and it costs less
this<00:02:05.360> all<00:02:05.540> just<00:02:05.660> takes<00:02:05.930> advantage<00:02:06.440> of<00:02:06.590> the

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
this all just takes advantage of the

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.710 
this all just takes advantage of the
unusual<00:02:07.010> opportunity<00:02:07.280> created<00:02:08.060> by<00:02:08.330> bridges

unusual opportunity created by bridges

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.930 
unusual opportunity created by bridges
being<00:02:08.930> so<00:02:09.140> close<00:02:09.410> together<00:02:09.650> the<00:02:10.520> arches<00:02:10.850> are

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
being so close together the arches are

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.310 
being so close together the arches are
very<00:02:11.150> efficient<00:02:11.720> because<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:12.110> bridge

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
very efficient because the bridge

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.990 
very efficient because the bridge
columns<00:02:12.770> are<00:02:12.890> already<00:02:13.250> there<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.460> help<00:02:13.670> carry

the<00:02:20.030> artist<00:02:20.720> peaked<00:02:20.990> when<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.290> bridges

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
the artist peaked when the bridges

to Kentucky perhaps the best thing is

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.580 
to Kentucky perhaps the best thing is

with<00:02:46.820> this<00:02:46.970> though<00:02:47.180> is<00:02:47.210> that<00:02:47.390> we're<00:02:47.600> not

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
with this though is that we're not

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.300 
with this though is that we're not
really<00:02:47.900> thinking<00:02:48.200> big<00:02:48.260> enough<00:02:48.440> more<00:02:48.890> planning

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
really thinking big enough more planning

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.160 
really thinking big enough more planning
long-term<00:02:49.850> enough<00:02:50.150> and<00:02:50.390> there<00:02:50.840> still<00:02:51.050> seems

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
long-term enough and there still seems

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.020 
long-term enough and there still seems
to<00:02:51.260> be<00:02:51.380> something<00:02:51.620> missing<00:02:52.130> so<00:02:52.580> since<00:02:52.850> this

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
to be something missing so since this

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.610 
to be something missing so since this
shouldn't<00:02:53.300> end<00:02:53.480> up<00:02:53.600> is<00:02:53.750> simply<00:02:54.050> a<00:02:54.110> sculptural

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
shouldn't end up is simply a sculptural

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.260 
shouldn't end up is simply a sculptural
decoration<00:02:54.830> which<00:02:55.490> is<00:02:55.610> just<00:02:55.790> not<00:02:56.030> quite

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
decoration which is just not quite

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.690 
decoration which is just not quite
iconic<00:02:56.540> enough<00:02:57.170> let's<00:02:57.920> add<00:02:58.130> cables<00:02:58.580> to<00:02:58.670> the

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
iconic enough let's add cables to the

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.790 
iconic enough let's add cables to the
arches<00:02:59.180> that<00:02:59.330> support<00:02:59.870> a<00:03:00.050> series<00:03:00.410> of<00:03:00.440> beams

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
arches that support a series of beams

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
arches that support a series of beams
which<00:03:01.280> in<00:03:01.459> turn<00:03:01.700> support<00:03:02.320> something<00:03:03.320> else<00:03:03.820> we

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
which in turn support something else we

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.430 
which in turn support something else we
have<00:03:04.970> to<00:03:05.120> get<00:03:05.209> up<00:03:05.270> there<00:03:05.510> though<00:03:05.690> so<00:03:06.320> the

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
have to get up there though so the

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.050 
have to get up there though so the
bridge<00:03:06.620> is<00:03:06.770> now<00:03:06.950> really<00:03:07.250> interact<00:03:07.850> with<00:03:07.940> the

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
bridge is now really interact with the

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.910 
bridge is now really interact with the
part<00:03:08.360> to<00:03:08.600> include<00:03:08.900> an<00:03:09.050> entry<00:03:09.320> Plaza<00:03:09.530> with

spiral steps circumnavigating an
elevator<00:03:12.080> tower<00:03:12.910> this<00:03:13.910> is<00:03:14.030> going<00:03:14.209> to<00:03:14.270> take<00:03:14.420> a

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
elevator tower this is going to take a

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.630 
elevator tower this is going to take a
little<00:03:14.630> longer<00:03:15.220> Indiana<00:03:16.220> will<00:03:16.340> also

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
little longer Indiana will also

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.940 
little longer Indiana will also
eventually<00:03:17.030> build<00:03:17.570> one<00:03:17.780> since<00:03:18.530> their<00:03:18.709> bridge

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
eventually build one since their bridge

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.740 
eventually build one since their bridge
is<00:03:19.100> now<00:03:19.250> no<00:03:19.430> better<00:03:19.670> than<00:03:19.760> Kentucky's<00:03:20.420> and<00:03:20.630> so

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
is now no better than Kentucky's and so

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.150 
is now no better than Kentucky's and so
they'll<00:03:20.900> want<00:03:21.110> to<00:03:21.200> know<00:03:21.320> why<00:03:21.500> that<00:03:21.739> was<00:03:21.920> worth

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
they'll want to know why that was worth
