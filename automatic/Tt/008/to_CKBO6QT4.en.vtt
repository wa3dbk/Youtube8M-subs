00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
 You know that you can not paint at school.

 You know that you can not paint at school. 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.020

 Who would want to use these showers at all? 

00:00:12.815 --> 00:00:16.025
 (I would use it, but I'm ashamed of my nephew.) 

00:00:16.535 --> 00:00:19.275
 And this was also necessary to read? 

00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:21.405
 (But I am A MODERN actor.) 

00:00:23.115 --> 00:00:24.115
 FUUUJ girl. 

00:00:24.485 --> 00:00:26.165

00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:33.255
 Are we going to truancy? Well! Great idea! 

00:00:33.585 --> 00:00:36.515
 Give me break up. (You will not go because you are scared.) 

00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:39.385
 (You will not even go through the fence. And you?) 

00:00:39.385 --> 00:00:42.445
 (You will definitely sell us.) Do not you like it? 

00:00:42.445 --> 00:00:45.395
 Well, what are you vodka delicious. (What a hideous one.) 

00:00:47.335 --> 00:00:47.835

00:00:47.835 --> 00:00:48.335
 Ping pong today. 

00:00:48.535 --> 00:00:50.775
 (Together: That's why I changed clothes.) 

00:00:51.465 --> 00:00:57.645
 Hi dear! What a pretty blouse. Thank you. (It's nice that I already had it a month ago.) 

00:00:59.465 --> 00:01:00.465
 Let me write down. No, I'm wrong. 

00:01:00.715 --> 00:01:03.645
 (I do not want to remove my backpack's exercise.) 

00:01:03.645 --> 00:01:06.275
 * * ??? 

00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:08.645
 (What do all the history teachers have a mustache? 

00:01:09.415 --> 00:01:11.815
 Why are you late again ?! 

00:01:11.815 --> 00:01:13.755
 (Because I overslept because I overslept.) Because I collapsed! 

00:01:15.615 --> 00:01:18.295
 Sweetheart. See what I have. We take a photo? 

00:01:19.625 --> 00:01:22.035

00:01:22.465 --> 00:01:23.515
 You smoke? heh 

00:01:23.945 --> 00:01:27.005

00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:29.375
 Mrs. Because I'm not available.

00:01:33.195 --> 00:01:35.895

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:38.225
 (Do not X8 me) 

00:01:39.585 --> 00:01:40.085
 (Fuck) 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.000
 Have you had lunch at school today? Yes Yes. (I've eaten all promotions on Steam.) 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.800
 Guys, give your hand for agreement 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.800
 (Dray dog ​​fool gull) 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.900
 (Total: What are they doing forever.) 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.400
 (Is there a couple in each school that is constantly licking?) 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.700
 (I wonder if they are feeding better in prison.) (In total, I can not escape from this.) 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.800
 (He can not find out I'm puking one beer.) 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.900
 Wow! Have you already drunk? 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.000
 Well, * wa * 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 That's how Rudolf from Habsburg came to power. Did you understand now? 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 (Nothing and nothing) 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:21.100
 Number 16 to answer. 16? Number 16 ?! 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.000
 (Quiet because I will give you a broken egg.) 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.900
 But these boys in our class are ugly. Well, stupid. 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.900
 (Total: But so sweet). 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.700
 Ah there 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.200
 Something is happening here * 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.200
 What have I wrestled without paper? 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.000
 Have you changed your shoes? 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.800
 (No) 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.800
 Hey, but how will the school end up, we will continue to be compatriots? No? 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.000
 Well. Probably not 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.800
 Please, this was not in the textbook. 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.600
 And how do you know. You probably did not read it. 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.000
 (Because I have him on my knees.) 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.000
 Do not think about it, do not think about it. Łeeee, I thought 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 Everyone will know each other now. (I would like to have a girlfriend too.) 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.400
 You what in the fifth you marked? B? 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.600

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:12.800
 I counted twice * ??? * and you? 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.000
 I'm also in the fifth probably also B. 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.800
 Well, of course, that I marked C. 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.700
 Did you buy a city card? Yes, Dad. 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.200
 I ride the stow but in what style. 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.500
 My children would never paint such a thing. What is it supposed to be? 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.500
 You have children? I did not know. 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.100
 (Who was able to do that.) 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.800
 To answer you will not get up if you do not get up. 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
 (Here, what was up)
