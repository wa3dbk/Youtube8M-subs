00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.930 
we've got two crew chiefs and doing our
best<00:03:29.349> to<00:03:29.530> capitalize<00:03:30.040> on<00:03:30.069> that<00:03:30.250> and<00:03:30.459> go<00:03:30.819> out

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
best to capitalize on that and go out

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.240 
best to capitalize on that and go out
and<00:03:30.970> win<00:03:31.150> races<00:03:31.599> I've<00:03:32.440> had<00:03:32.650> made<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.069> point

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
and win races I've had made the point

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.920 
and win races I've had made the point
earlier<00:03:33.609> although<00:03:33.760> I<00:03:33.879> exaggerated<00:03:34.690> a<00:03:34.900> little

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
earlier although I exaggerated a little

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.569 
earlier although I exaggerated a little
bit<00:03:35.170> because<00:03:35.319> I<00:03:35.500> couldn't<00:03:35.769> couldn't<00:03:36.340> read<00:03:36.549> the

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
bit because I couldn't couldn't read the

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:38.940 
bit because I couldn't couldn't read the
zeros<00:03:37.299> that<00:03:37.599> approached<00:03:38.049> our<00:03:38.230> drag<00:03:38.530> racing

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
zeros that approached our drag racing

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.890 
zeros that approached our drag racing
maybe<00:03:39.160> the<00:03:39.370> most<00:03:39.519> competitive<00:03:39.970> form<00:03:40.750> of

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
maybe the most competitive form of

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.020 
maybe the most competitive form of
racing<00:03:41.290> anywhere<00:03:41.590> on<00:03:41.739> the<00:03:41.919> planet<00:03:42.370> I<00:03:42.700> said<00:03:42.910> the

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
racing anywhere on the planet I said the

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.550 
racing anywhere on the planet I said the
fields<00:03:43.299> were<00:03:43.389> covered<00:03:43.690> by<00:03:43.780> seven<00:03:44.109> thousands

fields were covered by seven thousands

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.440 
fields were covered by seven thousands
it's<00:03:44.829> actually<00:03:45.010> seven<00:03:45.489> hundredths<00:03:45.970> of<00:03:46.060> a

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
it's actually seven hundredths of a

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.190 
it's actually seven hundredths of a
second<00:03:46.900> they'll<00:03:47.799> send<00:03:48.099> home<00:03:48.310> you<00:03:48.639> know<00:03:48.760> the

second they'll send home you know the

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.319 
second they'll send home you know the
quarter<00:03:50.200> of<00:03:50.349> the<00:03:50.470> cars<00:03:50.680> that<00:03:50.829> show<00:03:51.340> up<00:03:51.370> and<00:03:51.790> the

division have happened in the last year
and<00:03:56.440> a<00:03:56.530> half<00:03:56.709> so<00:03:57.160> you've<00:03:57.280> got<00:03:57.310> this<00:03:57.519> incredibly

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
and a half so you've got this incredibly

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.099 
and a half so you've got this incredibly
competitive<00:03:59.079> field<00:03:59.950> I'm<00:04:00.629> wondering<00:04:01.629> why<00:04:02.049> you

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
competitive field I'm wondering why you

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:04.259 
competitive field I'm wondering why you
jumped<00:04:02.769> into<00:04:02.919> that<00:04:03.010> snake<00:04:03.459> pit<00:04:03.819> why<00:04:04.090> did<00:04:04.239> you

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
jumped into that snake pit why did you

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:06.479 
jumped into that snake pit why did you
want<00:04:04.540> to<00:04:04.629> become<00:04:04.720> a<00:04:04.900> pro<00:04:05.169> stock<00:04:05.470> racer<00:04:05.949> rather

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
want to become a pro stock racer rather

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.009 
want to become a pro stock racer rather
