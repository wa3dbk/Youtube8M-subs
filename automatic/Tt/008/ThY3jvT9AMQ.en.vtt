now<00:01:55.000> that<00:01:55.030> we've<00:01:55.270> got<00:01:55.479> control<00:01:55.960> over

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
now that we've got control over

have a dynamic brightness slider which

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.050 
have a dynamic brightness slider which
really<00:02:02.380> gives<00:02:02.710> us<00:02:02.800> a<00:02:02.950> new<00:02:03.130> look<00:02:03.369> which<00:02:03.610> allows

really gives us a new look which allows

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.450 
really gives us a new look which allows
us<00:02:04.270> to<00:02:04.450> dynamically<00:02:05.259> adjust<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:06.250> brightness

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
of an image for example I could darken

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.620 
of an image for example I could darken
this<00:02:08.770> down<00:02:09.039> and<00:02:09.310> if<00:02:09.789> you'll<00:02:09.940> notice<00:02:10.300> all<00:02:10.479> the

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
this down and if you'll notice all the

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.570 
this down and if you'll notice all the
highlights<00:02:10.810> stayed<00:02:11.560> where<00:02:11.860> they<00:02:11.890> were<00:02:12.040> and<00:02:12.459> it

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
highlights stayed where they were and it

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.580 
highlights stayed where they were and it
just<00:02:12.820> lowered<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.600> brightness<00:02:14.020> values<00:02:14.410> of

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
just lowered the brightness values of

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.940 
just lowered the brightness values of
the<00:02:14.709> darker<00:02:15.040> tones<00:02:15.280> so<00:02:15.910> it's<00:02:16.090> an<00:02:16.180> adaptive

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
the darker tones so it's an adaptive

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.370 
the darker tones so it's an adaptive
type<00:02:17.950> edit<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:18.880> then<00:02:19.360> in<00:02:19.510> contrast<00:02:19.780> this<00:02:20.320> is

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
type edit and then in contrast this is

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.960 
type edit and then in contrast this is
another<00:02:20.709> area<00:02:20.920> where<00:02:21.070> we've<00:02:21.310> really<00:02:21.790> done<00:02:21.910> a

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
another area where we've really done a

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.580 
another area where we've really done a
lot<00:02:22.060> of<00:02:22.209> work<00:02:22.390> we've<00:02:22.600> got<00:02:22.630> amplify<00:02:23.260> whites

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
lot of work we've got amplify whites

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.770 
lot of work we've got amplify whites
blacks<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.280> and<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.820> slider<00:02:25.030> called<00:02:25.300> soft

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
blacks and and a slider called soft

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.110 
blacks and and a slider called soft
contrast<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:26.590> again<00:02:27.190> by<00:02:27.340> clicking<00:02:27.400> that<00:02:27.850> soft

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
contrast and again by clicking that soft

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.640 
contrast and again by clicking that soft
contrast<00:02:28.510> you<00:02:28.720> can<00:02:28.870> see<00:02:29.050> it<00:02:29.140> just<00:02:29.170> adds<00:02:29.530> a

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
contrast you can see it just adds a

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.740 
contrast you can see it just adds a
little<00:02:29.800> extra<00:02:30.370> depth<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:30.880> defines<00:02:31.390> the

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
little extra depth it defines the

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.170 
little extra depth it defines the
foreground<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:32.739> mid<00:02:33.100> ground<00:02:33.400> as<00:02:33.580> well<00:02:33.910> as<00:02:34.060> the

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
foreground and mid ground as well as the

foreground and mid ground as well as the
background<00:02:34.630> and<00:02:34.780> it<00:02:34.870> sort<00:02:35.080> of<00:02:35.140> identifies

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
background and it sort of identifies

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.650 
background and it sort of identifies
more<00:02:36.130> depth<00:02:36.459> in<00:02:36.610> our<00:02:36.670> pictures<00:02:37.030> to<00:02:37.360> really<00:02:37.630> a

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
more depth in our pictures to really a

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.790 
more depth in our pictures to really a
great<00:02:37.930> tool<00:02:38.110> in<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.959> structure<00:02:41.380> area<00:02:41.650> you'll

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
great tool in the structure area you'll

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.080 
great tool in the structure area you'll
notice<00:02:42.070> that<00:02:42.160> we<00:02:42.280> now<00:02:42.310> have<00:02:42.640> structure

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
notice that we now have structure

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.240 
notice that we now have structure
control<00:02:43.480> over<00:02:43.870> highlights<00:02:44.440> mid-tones<00:02:44.830> and

control over highlights mid-tones and

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.340 
control over highlights mid-tones and
shadows<00:02:45.340> as<00:02:45.790> well<00:02:45.970> and<00:02:46.209> we've<00:02:46.750> also<00:02:46.900> got<00:02:47.200> this

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
shadows as well and we've also got this

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.170 
shadows as well and we've also got this
new<00:02:47.560> feature<00:02:47.800> called<00:02:48.130> fine<00:02:48.489> structure<00:02:49.000> which

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
new feature called fine structure which

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.289 
new feature called fine structure which
really<00:02:49.540> gives<00:02:49.870> us<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.160> small<00:02:51.160> finest<00:02:51.970> minor

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
really gives us the small finest minor

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.650 
really gives us the small finest minor
details<00:02:52.930> of<00:02:53.230> contrast<00:02:53.890> and<00:02:54.400> textures<00:02:55.120> within
