00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.870
 good 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.610
 or not 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.010
 then analysis 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.930
 we get but a doubt by the 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.079
 result for the game by attitude 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.079
 of the team 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.760
 We already knew about the rival's difficulty and 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.140
 his winning streak also with 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.740
 followed in the same way as the one that has 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.510
 raised the the party to wait for us 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.130
 and to try to take advantage of any 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.780
 the mistakes that we could make in the 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.969
 build a very well- armed team 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.320
 the sevilla that dominates very well on 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.420
 the whole phase of kickback 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.430
 some looking at the legation ya ya 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.380
 we predict that the ball will be like that 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.810
 for us we have tried to generate them 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.070
 problems and I think the party has 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.990
 state 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.270
 in some moments for any of 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.760
 both of us despite our of our 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.230
 domain and in the second part I think that 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.750
 we have known 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.250
 and counteract that piling up of 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.540
 players inside we have tried 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.560
 attack much more on the outside we have 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.000
 tried to get with second-class people 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.120
 line we tried to move fast the 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.550
 ball 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.590
 but even if you try to pass things 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.950
 difficult because they have players in front 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.940
 of the level of cow or gameiro then when 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.020
 have made the two changes of the 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.020
 band players among the kings 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.640
 come in jairo 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.289
 a very well armed team very well 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.500
 worked already we said it yesterday and for 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:54.270
 we are a vital vital triumph gives you 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.549
 Much moral to my players gives a lot 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.079
 moral to the hobby that has seen that 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.110
 we have been able to suffer for 90 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.940
 minutes 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.940
 more that they be satisfied 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.600
 from where did he study if I see the goal 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:14.160
 I give thanks and besides you already know I think that 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.170
 you have never heard me speak of 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.540
 of no arbitration decision 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.159
 I am not going to do it 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.910
 today I will not do either because 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:29.140
 besides this is not the way the way of 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.820
 the path of arbitration is to forget about 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.090
 that exist to facilitate your work 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.320
 forget what they are or what they can be 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.880
 decisive so that the result and 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.890
 focus myself as a coach and the 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.900
 players I tell them in what we can 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.060
 control the others are imponderables of the 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.950
 soccer is very difficult to be a referee I know 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.990
 every week that I train I'm not the 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.810
 referee of my kids and he looks at me with 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.520
 a face that you do not see 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.460
 and we are all subject to pressure 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.590
 players 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.890
 coaches and also the referees or 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.890
 be that 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.650
 I would expect to focus on what things we can 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.750
 control and leave an arbitration that 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.250
 do your job as everyone like the 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.680
 trained and the players are right and they 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.350
 wrong and after 38 days each 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.790
 team will have your supposed reservation and 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.770
 it will not be for what they have done the sac 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.110
 my favor against 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.680
 that is my opinion today that we have won and 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.680
 any other day 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:24.600
 well it does not have anything good in 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.370
 I have not been told by doctors 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.620
 or the drops doctor has nothing beyond 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.790
 of has been blocked in an evil 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.130
 gesture has jumped and has been 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.340
 blocked but in principle I do not think that 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.340
 be nothing 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.100
 and I wish it were only 36 but I do not trust 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.630
 neither I nor any of us are going to go for 40 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.180
 and then we 'll see how the 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.090
 principle I always said that it's 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.530
 from almost half of the turn that in 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.360
 theory with 38 to point per day 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.220
 it should be enough but we the 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.410
 objective we go with the 40 is that gives 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.770
 a victory and a draw and as soon as possible 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.600
 be better now come a match 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.150
 with a direct rival encourages us very much 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.439
 this result at home 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.000
 or follow vallecas, as we have gone 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:13.209
 all year round for the game and for the 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.209
 three points 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.650
 no no what happens that is a very match 

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:26.500
 suffered a rival that sucks champions not 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.730
 let's forget and a rival that we saw the 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.370
 dangerousness in any action is 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.970
 I could go down the match is fine 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.140
 all the equipment on all lines but 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:38.470
 exceptional for me the excessive line 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.480
 of the goalie in not not focusing only on 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.680
 attack and be well covered and 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.680
 against those transitions 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:48.059
 very happy to spend a good weekend 

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:48.059
 week 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.050
 yes right now I just say level 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.580
 defensive 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.490
 in fact the two phases are 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.110
 related to be able to attack well and 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.370
 to be able to defend well to be able to press 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.289
 in the last phase you have to attack well 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.879
 ordered I think we've been a 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:10.080
 computer ordered in all aspects in 

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:12.690
 the offensive in the defensive have 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.930
 pressed we have created problems to him 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.699
 Seville 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.669
 I repeat the potential and the profile of 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:22.389
 players who have and I leave satisfied 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:22.389
 We have been 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.270
 we do it from points and this was 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.880
 boxing match I think we've been 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.050
 superiors not by much the truth because 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.970
 at the end of accounts to the occasions and 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.920
 the goals but we have had chances 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.720
 very good we have generated many 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:38.289
 situations of approaching the area of 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.960
 have them locked there 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:42.369
 and we have managed to be effective in a 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.059
 time in which it costs each 

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:45.059
 more time to score a goal 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.480
 rafa gave me the change is making a 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.920
 very strong effort because you already know that 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.050
 it takes time without being able to train at the 

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:58.500
 of others today has started again 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.000
 to be able to play it is good that 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.040
 recognize the merits that you do not only 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.920
 races but all the players like he did 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:07.140
 at the time borja as he did august and 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.270
 other players who infiltrate to 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:14.000
 play even knowing that it is not the best 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:14.000
 to release your health but the degree d 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:18.539
 the activation and the degree of 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:20.630
 concentration that this group of 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:22.640
 players is very high and 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:26.350
 I congratulate you and encourage you to continue like this 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.350
 because it is the way to 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:36.780
 at home and outside we do not change 

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:38.340
 away from home regardless of what 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.440
 trying to hurt the opponent more 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.870
 we can qualify and look for a profile or 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.100
 another today with him at home has been to 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.930
 a level 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:49.230
 bestial is a player of much 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:50.670
 personality that will not burn the shot 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:54.470
 has generated many situations of 

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.470
 superiority thanks to its conductions 

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:59.870
 and it has been decisive I believe in the match 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.310
 Thank you
