much<00:01:59.340> a<00:02:00.290> top<00:02:01.290> player<00:02:01.560> in<00:02:01.680> respect<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.130> scoring

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579

goals<00:02:02.790> at<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.630> highest<00:02:03.869> level<00:02:04.290> but<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.740> think

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
goals at the highest level but I think

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.380 
goals at the highest level but I think
we<00:02:05.159> need<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.460> strengthen

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
we need to strengthen

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.279 
we need to strengthen
goalkeeper<00:02:08.390> think<00:02:09.050> we<00:02:09.110> need<00:02:09.259> another

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
goalkeeper think we need another

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.130 
goalkeeper think we need another
goalkeeper<00:02:09.770> to<00:02:10.190> go<00:02:10.369> alongside<00:02:11.180> Chesney<00:02:11.900> so

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
goalkeeper to go alongside Chesney so

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.470 
goalkeeper to go alongside Chesney so
then<00:02:12.560> hopefully<00:02:12.980> Chesney<00:02:13.400> can<00:02:13.910> kick<00:02:14.120> on<00:02:14.240> with

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
then hopefully Chesney can kick on with

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.680 
then hopefully Chesney can kick on with
a<00:02:14.510> good<00:02:14.840> goalkeeper<00:02:15.380> to<00:02:15.530> follow<00:02:15.770> I<00:02:16.600> think<00:02:17.600> we

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
a good goalkeeper to follow I think we

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.490 
a good goalkeeper to follow I think we
need<00:02:17.870> definitely<00:02:18.650> we<00:02:18.830> need<00:02:19.240> we<00:02:20.240> need<00:02:20.270> a

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
need definitely we need we need a

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.500 
need definitely we need we need a
left-back<00:02:21.500> maybe<00:02:21.770> four<00:02:22.070> not<00:02:22.640> even<00:02:22.760> for<00:02:23.120> for

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
left-back maybe four not even for for

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.300 
left-back maybe four not even for for
cover<00:02:23.720> but<00:02:23.810> we<00:02:23.990> need<00:02:24.140> a<00:02:24.170> top<00:02:24.500> left<00:02:24.770> but<00:02:24.950> i<00:02:24.980> think

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
cover but we need a top left but i think

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.420 
cover but we need a top left but i think
i<00:02:25.490> think<00:02:25.790> if<00:02:26.420> Gibbs<00:02:26.930> he<00:02:27.110> can<00:02:27.320> stay<00:02:27.950> fit<00:02:28.280> then

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
i think if Gibbs he can stay fit then

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
season playing at left but I think we

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.660 
season playing at left but I think we
need<00:02:33.290> a<00:02:33.350> right<00:02:33.590> back<00:02:33.830> now<00:02:33.980> i'm<00:02:34.100> not<00:02:34.280> sure<00:02:34.520> if

would I finish in the top four this
season<00:06:09.910> I<00:06:10.890> think<00:06:11.890> when<00:06:11.980> you<00:06:12.070> look<00:06:12.100> at<00:06:12.340> Spurs

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:12.700 
season I think when you look at Spurs

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.380 
season I think when you look at Spurs
the<00:06:13.480> injured<00:06:13.840> Spurs<00:06:14.170> have<00:06:14.350> had<00:06:14.470> today<00:06:14.680> around

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:15.390 
the injured Spurs have had today around

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.570 
the injured Spurs have had today around
their<00:06:16.390> top<00:06:16.600> players<00:06:16.870> at<00:06:17.170> this<00:06:17.290> stage<00:06:17.590> I<00:06:17.890> think

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:18.580 
their top players at this stage I think

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.020 
their top players at this stage I think
that's<00:06:18.730> going<00:06:18.880> to<00:06:18.940> cost<00:06:19.240> them

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
that's going to cost them

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.010 
that's going to cost them
and<00:06:22.030> I<00:06:22.120> think<00:06:22.300> they've<00:06:22.420> got<00:06:22.570> some<00:06:22.750> difficult

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
and I think they've got some difficult

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.980 
and I think they've got some difficult
games<00:06:23.440> coming<00:06:23.740> up<00:06:23.920> just<00:06:24.550> like<00:06:24.730> arson<00:06:25.150> got

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 
games coming up just like arson got

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:27.030 
games coming up just like arson got
games<00:06:26.200> coming<00:06:26.440> up<00:06:26.530> that<00:06:26.650> you<00:06:26.710> after<00:06:26.980> the

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.040 
games coming up that you after the

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.010 
games coming up that you after the
winner<00:06:27.220> for<00:06:27.340> the<00:06:28.150> game<00:06:28.360> against<00:06:28.600> west<00:06:28.810> brom

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
winner for the game against west brom

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.140 
winner for the game against west brom
was<00:06:29.200> fantastic<00:06:29.920> isn't<00:06:30.160> as<00:06:30.640> a<00:06:30.730> must-win

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:31.150 
was fantastic isn't as a must-win

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:35.790 
was fantastic isn't as a must-win
situation<00:06:31.390> and<00:06:32.250> then<00:06:33.250> Spurs<00:06:33.580> drew<00:06:33.970> I<00:06:34.210> feel<00:06:34.960> of

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 
situation and then Spurs drew I feel of

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.440 
situation and then Spurs drew I feel of
Chelsea<00:06:36.280> the<00:06:36.340> amount<00:06:36.610> of<00:06:36.670> games<00:06:36.850> that<00:06:36.970> Chelsea

added a lot long period of time where we

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:14.700 
added a lot long period of time where we
didn't<00:07:13.870> even<00:07:14.050> look<00:07:14.110> like<00:07:14.170> we<00:07:14.410> might<00:07:14.590> not

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:14.710 
didn't even look like we might not

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:17.100 
didn't even look like we might not
finish<00:07:14.920> in<00:07:15.160> there<00:07:15.310> because<00:07:15.490> of<00:07:16.110> Chelsea's

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:17.110 
finish in there because of Chelsea's

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.380 
finish in there because of Chelsea's
fixture<00:07:18.100> pile<00:07:18.340> up<00:07:18.460> cuz<00:07:18.910> of<00:07:19.030> Tottenham's

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:19.390 
fixture pile up cuz of Tottenham's

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.300 
fixture pile up cuz of Tottenham's
injuries<00:07:19.870> we<00:07:20.260> might<00:07:20.440> take<00:07:20.650> advantage<00:07:21.100> of<00:07:21.160> it

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:21.310 
injuries we might take advantage of it

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.400 
injuries we might take advantage of it
and<00:07:21.370> that<00:07:21.580> is<00:07:21.670> the<00:07:21.790> reason<00:07:21.820> why<00:07:22.330> we<00:07:22.600> may<00:07:23.080> get<00:07:23.260> in

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:23.410 
and that is the reason why we may get in

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.020 
and that is the reason why we may get in
there<00:07:23.620> I<00:07:23.770> think<00:07:24.160> we<00:07:24.220> will<00:07:24.370> finish<00:07:24.580> in<00:07:24.850> there

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:25.030 
there I think we will finish in there

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:27.090 
there I think we will finish in there
but<00:07:25.360> it's<00:07:25.510> still<00:07:25.840> if<00:07:26.230> he<00:07:26.320> doesn't<00:07:26.710> splash<00:07:26.950> the

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:27.100 
but it's still if he doesn't splash the

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:28.470 
but it's still if he doesn't splash the
cash<00:07:27.130> in<00:07:27.400> the<00:07:27.430> summer<00:07:27.700> it's<00:07:28.150> just<00:07:28.300> gonna<00:07:28.360> be

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:28.480 
cash in the summer it's just gonna be

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.570 
cash in the summer it's just gonna be
another<00:07:28.600> season<00:07:29.110> of<00:07:29.200> maybe<00:07:29.410> hoping<00:07:30.340> that<00:07:30.490> we

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:30.580 
another season of maybe hoping that we

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:32.610 
another season of maybe hoping that we
qualified<00:07:31.030> fourth<00:07:31.420> and<00:07:31.600> hoping<00:07:32.260> that<00:07:32.320> we<00:07:32.500> can

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:32.620 
qualified fourth and hoping that we can

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.650 
qualified fourth and hoping that we can
go<00:07:32.770> as<00:07:32.860> far<00:07:33.070> as<00:07:33.160> we<00:07:33.250> can<00:07:33.400> insert<00:07:33.730> competitions

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:34.660 
go as far as we can insert competitions

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.170 
go as far as we can insert competitions
it's<00:07:34.840> not<00:07:34.990> good<00:07:35.140> enough
