 support with the globe 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.769
 when you discovered elements what you are going to do in relation to them 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.049

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.909
 among others do not have this worse 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.159

 observed 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:29.109

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:39.180
 what observes 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.180
 that there is an observer who owns what matters 

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:44.679
 ten after speech 

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:46.319
 up to 20 days 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.319

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.260
 when there is no delay of interest in the conservative 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.339
 then pure observation 

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:06.459
 the year plates 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:07.609
 this creates 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:09.809
 the perception is clear 

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:12.459
 pattatically it passes 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.459
 but attachment is not present 

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:18.599
 in the episode that year after year with her 

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:22.409
 the philanthropic adevanil boxes and I want to accuse the pt

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.059
 everything for this antennas 

00:04:29.059 --> 00:04:33.180
 that way you could keep what you perceive with a precious 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.840
 reverting your attention to your conscience to the place 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.270

 the mba observes 

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:44.129
 because there are tweets when observed returns to Brazil 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:47.330
 it is of these beats stayed with the art decision of the actor 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.330

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.599
 on track 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:57.000
 so object 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.400
 of perception 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.539
 observation does not disturb 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:02.270

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.199
 in theory, please 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.710

 because here we bill bunten glaicy weitz almeida sex appeal 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:48.929
 so let's start again with this idea that there are thoughts 

00:05:48.929 --> 00:05:51.880
 movements and desires projections 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.159
 moving like waves on the surface of the ocean 

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:57.229

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:03.870
 you have the feeling that these waves should not be there

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:11.619
 but this feeling that the waves should not be there 

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:15.759
 is the cougar joins riding with the Scottish motorcycle abreu

 This one or two 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:42.639
 so the feeling that some experiences do not belong to me 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:45.169
 this in itself is a wave 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:47.580
