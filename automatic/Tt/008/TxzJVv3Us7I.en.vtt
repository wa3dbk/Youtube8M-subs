00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.370 
pretty awesome alright so you see this
ah<00:02:09.340> it's<00:02:10.340> better<00:02:10.580> if<00:02:10.640> you<00:02:10.700> see<00:02:10.880> this<00:02:11.030> way<00:02:11.209> I<00:02:11.480> was

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
ah it's better if you see this way I was

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.690 
ah it's better if you see this way I was
just<00:02:12.470> thinking<00:02:12.890> maybe<00:02:12.920> might<00:02:13.400> be<00:02:13.490> able<00:02:13.580> be

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
just thinking maybe might be able be

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.120 
just thinking maybe might be able be
easier<00:02:14.000> to<00:02:14.030> see<00:02:14.209> it<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.330> other<00:02:14.420> way<00:02:14.540> but<00:02:15.130> this

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
easier to see it the other way but this

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:23.580 
easier to see it the other way but this
one<00:02:16.310> looks<00:02:16.340> like<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.910> spirit<00:02:17.270> jailbreak<00:02:20.620> um

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
one looks like the spirit jailbreak um

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.660 
one looks like the spirit jailbreak um
there's<00:02:24.590> a<00:02:24.620> little<00:02:24.800> white<00:02:24.980> bar<00:02:25.190> if<00:02:25.400> you<00:02:25.459> can't

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
there's a little white bar if you can't

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:26.860 
there's a little white bar if you can't
really<00:02:25.820> see<00:02:25.940> it<00:02:26.000> but<00:02:26.060> there's<00:02:26.180> this<00:02:26.660> great

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
really see it but there's this great

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.170 
really see it but there's this great
thin<00:02:27.110> white<00:02:27.290> bar<00:02:27.500> and<00:02:27.770> it's<00:02:28.489> about<00:02:28.820> this<00:02:29.030> much

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
thin white bar and it's about this much

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.040 
thin white bar and it's about this much
left<00:02:30.970> it's<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.090> consumed<00:02:32.420> in<00:02:32.540> on<00:02:32.630> that<00:02:32.780> oh

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
left it's the consumed in on that oh

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:40.180 
left it's the consumed in on that oh
it's<00:02:34.010> all<00:02:34.190> you<00:02:34.280> done<00:02:34.370> okay<00:02:38.739> alright<00:02:39.739> so<00:02:40.010> it

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190

does not that was really quick and
really<00:02:47.330> easy<00:02:47.600> I<00:02:47.930> didn't<00:02:48.890> have<00:02:48.980> to<00:02:49.220> reboot<00:02:49.790> I'd

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
really easy I didn't have to reboot I'd

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.699 
really easy I didn't have to reboot I'd
have<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.269> reinstall<00:02:50.660> firmware<00:02:51.140> it<00:02:51.290> didn't<00:02:51.500> say

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
have to reinstall firmware it didn't say

reboot um yeah if you said it just it
just<00:02:59.420> installed<00:02:59.900> cydia<00:03:00.110> so<00:03:00.410> if<00:03:00.470> you're<00:03:00.590> using

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
just installed cydia so if you're using

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.000 
just installed cydia so if you're using
something<00:03:01.370> like<00:03:01.459> I<00:03:01.610> see<00:03:01.940> a<00:03:01.970> rocky<00:03:02.390> or<00:03:02.690> whatever

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
something like I see a rocky or whatever

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.520 
something like I see a rocky or whatever
and<00:03:04.010> other<00:03:04.310> you<00:03:04.730> know<00:03:04.820> Joe<00:03:05.060> broken<00:03:05.530> installer

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
and other you know Joe broken installer

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.259 
and other you know Joe broken installer
apps<00:03:06.769> then<00:03:07.130> I<00:03:07.310> guess<00:03:07.610> you<00:03:07.910> have<00:03:08.030> to<00:03:08.060> wait<00:03:08.239> for

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
apps then I guess you have to wait for

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.890 
apps then I guess you have to wait for
those<00:03:08.540> but<00:03:09.110> cities<00:03:09.650> onda<00:03:10.340> is<00:03:11.060> on<00:03:11.269> my<00:03:11.420> iPad<00:03:11.750> now

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
better picture here so it's me one is

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.490 
better picture here so it's me one is
this<00:03:51.560> is<00:03:51.650> basically<00:03:51.890> basically<00:03:52.340> cydia<00:03:53.500> come

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
this is basically basically cydia come

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.990 
this is basically basically cydia come
on<00:03:55.840> sounds<00:03:56.840> really<00:03:56.959> fast<00:03:57.230> it<00:03:57.950> took<00:03:58.549> literally

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
on sounds really fast it took literally

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.869 
on sounds really fast it took literally
it<00:03:59.630> didn't<00:04:00.170> do<00:04:00.230> it<00:04:00.380> in<00:04:00.530> it<00:04:00.739> just<00:04:00.859> all<00:04:01.519> the<00:04:01.730> did

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:01.879 
it didn't do it in it just all the did

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:03.910 
it didn't do it in it just all the did
was<00:04:01.970> reboot<00:04:02.150> send<00:04:03.140> in<00:04:03.230> some<00:04:03.379> code<00:04:03.620> and<00:04:03.890> that

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
was reboot send in some code and that

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.059 
was reboot send in some code and that
thing<00:04:04.250> I<00:04:04.340> was<00:04:04.459> it<00:04:04.580> I<00:04:04.760> didn't<00:04:05.150> really<00:04:05.300> do<00:04:05.480> much

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
thing I was it I didn't really do much

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:14.679 
thing I was it I didn't really do much
it's<00:04:07.819> pretty<00:04:07.969> easy<00:04:12.519> so<00:04:13.519> I'm<00:04:14.120> gonna<00:04:14.239> that<00:04:14.659> I

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:14.689 
it's pretty easy so I'm gonna that I

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:16.840 
it's pretty easy so I'm gonna that I
think<00:04:15.109> that's<00:04:15.230> enough<00:04:15.409> you<00:04:15.769> guys<00:04:16.459> want<00:04:16.699> to<00:04:16.759> see

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
think that's enough you guys want to see

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.240 
think that's enough you guys want to see
that<00:04:16.880> but<00:04:17.509> again<00:04:17.539> um<00:04:18.019> yeah<00:04:18.829> it's<00:04:18.979> real<00:04:19.100> simple

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
that but again um yeah it's real simple

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.529 
that but again um yeah it's real simple
all<00:04:19.609> you<00:04:19.669> have<00:04:19.759> to<00:04:19.820> do<00:04:19.880> is<00:04:20.000> download<00:04:20.150> it<00:04:20.419> and

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
all you have to do is download it and

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:25.749 
all you have to do is download it and
run<00:04:20.720> it<00:04:20.750> and<00:04:21.019> that's<00:04:22.009> it<00:04:22.100> oh<00:04:22.280> it's<00:04:23.150> uh<00:04:23.300> I<00:04:24.759> think

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:25.759 
run it and that's it oh it's uh I think

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:31.210 
run it and that's it oh it's uh I think
it's<00:04:25.940> rebooting<00:04:26.270> no<00:04:27.490> sound<00:04:28.490> rebooting<00:04:30.220> all

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
it's rebooting no sound rebooting all

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.290 
it's rebooting no sound rebooting all
right<00:04:31.430> let's<00:04:31.580> go<00:04:31.729> back<00:04:31.880> and<00:04:32.030> see<00:04:32.090> if<00:04:32.240> we

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
right let's go back and see if we
