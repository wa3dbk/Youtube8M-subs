 after this new incident since the good 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.330
 in a cave a little less strong and 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.700
 it's not on this side 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.099
 it's the biggest train 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.099

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.590
 okay 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.150
 hard to stay focused 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:57.629
 it is well has improved times 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:03.029
 fleeing would be disappointed in me i act 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:05.129
 just no juice because actually keep 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:06.110
 to take risks does not pay 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:08.520
 always 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.930
 after we slip what it's full of fake 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:14.400
 after games then take a little bit of 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.939
 distance but dialectical jacques these 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.219
 slippage has really hit 

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:21.689
 ok it's going slower than car circuit 

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:23.639
 ferrari and everything but frankly 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:26.460
 it's repaired near the ground in addition 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:26.819
 coach here is the track to us the 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:32.039

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:36.500
 quickly put another challenge to dry 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.759

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:56.270
 slash the age of 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:06:03.050
 of the human cut while he is halal 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:06.919
 bronze cpj who wins eddy king and the 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:08.629

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.740
 won this time I think in the 

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:20.689
 best map 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.830
 there was a better map ah but 

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:24.379
 it's right the accelerator 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:27.229
 what right foot yeah yeah but that's me 

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:33.189
 exceeds the help to shift speeds 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:36.199
 let's stay first victory dance 

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:41.930
 you saw after ok I read a little 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:42.949
 affected for the double and a month I 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.209
 do not know if you saw well there is a 

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:46.309
 chicane it's impossible to take it 

00:06:44.209 --> 00:06:48.020
 too fast he says it's dead frozen inches 

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:49.729
 there is I saw arrive straight ahead 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.789
 he did not try to take me well 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:56.269
 the bend or what not direct me I know 

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:58.759
 that and I saw him laughing without success 

00:06:56.269 --> 00:07:02.330
 because data wait wait wait by 

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:03.919
 against you lost you have a pledge yeah not 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.089
 say it was because at the base 

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:06.469
 when we created the channel we said 

00:07:05.089 --> 00:07:08.269
 whoever loses in the parades commits 

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:11.449
 all right what's the thing 

00:07:08.269 --> 00:07:14.209
 to arrive in the middle of my next challenge 

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:16.550
 who will do he will have to have the line at 

00:07:14.209 --> 00:07:18.499
 middle it's my favorite the same time 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:22.039
 and in the middle that this adrian h to the senate 

00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:24.080
 it was rather not scratching the next 

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:25.219
 video the next challenge and it'll go 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.749
 crescendo caesar those who speak 

00:07:25.219 --> 00:07:28.580
 next then whoever loses the 

00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:30.229
 next challenge so already to launch the 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.149
 challenges but it does that against times that we 

00:07:30.229 --> 00:07:35.569
 now says sealed and the next who 

00:07:32.149 --> 00:07:38.059
 lose dyeing the beard in blond the 

00:07:35.569 --> 00:07:39.709
 dfid after that will be the hair and she 

00:07:38.059 --> 00:07:41.149

00:07:41.149 --> 00:07:43.789
