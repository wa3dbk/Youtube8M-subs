00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hello, I continue to improve 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.359
 my quadrocopter and this time to me 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.260
 such a wonderful box came 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.179
 dealextreme site . com with her robot 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.780
 there is a controller 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.570
 about m2 and 67 by the way known cream making 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.720
 very good but for now whether the parcel and 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:23.760
 even quality control is present 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.109
 mean besides controllers here and also 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.109
 ordered a minimum set 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:32.489
 This is a GPS module and a stand for it. 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.700
 the controller comes with a minimum 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.040
 necessary amount of wires now 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.570
 I will unpack and turn on 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.059
 do first turn on check 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.550
 performance in the mail of course 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.210
 unpacked and checked for hiv and but not yet 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:52.230
 turned it on your controller 267 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.440
 famous ordug opt also we will see 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:07.970
 what's inside the tab try 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:07.970
 unleash the controller horde itself capture 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:34.360
 and the truth set also proved here 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:36.930
 gps module gps module with stand itself 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.930
 cap module 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:51.110
 for mounting + module so 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:54.140
 let's look at the very throat 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.140
 control and 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:15.840
 so mean 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.840
 remove the cap and see 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.519
 good quality principle 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.390
 means control on the processor from mega 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.550
 2560 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:43.019
 means without a compass. he you 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.019
 is gps-module 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.930
 and so now let's see which one with gps of 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:03:05.380
 used in this configuration and 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:09.980
 how it is installed so unwind 4 years old 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:12.700
 under protection we see the controller not 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:19.520
 control more precisely a jeep with a module then u-blox 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:22.820
 6 m again so it is well installed and I 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.660
 I will not even get it out there 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:28.580
 of necessity 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:31.250
 and so now we will connect the controller to 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.130
 zbt and see check it out 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:38.150
 performance to start without gps 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:39.739
 then connected gps and so let's 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.290
 Now let's connect the controller to the computer 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.780
 let's see how it is determined 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:49.780
 what will we use micro usb on 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:54.310
 cable og and through the adapter and the second 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:58.569
 we insert to extend the computer 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:01.660
 and so mean arduino mega 2560 here 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:05.920
 a lump of 4 was visible well and control 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:13.720
 loading miles pictures red light 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:22.090
 and veronica means let's run mishin 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:24.300
 planner let's see between planar 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:29.979
 load 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:35.310
 we need to put on a chudo 4 well 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:35.310
 and press connect so the download went 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:52.100
 In principle, the controller is loaded so 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:56.540
 he came to life means it shows that not 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:05:01.160
 Calibrated compass and desir the main thing is that 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:02.950
 it booted up that is so here forward 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:08.200
 him here 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:08.200
 left right so everything shows right 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.750
 so now we connect tps modules also 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.960
 boot from DPS he basically have me 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:21.220
 already happy that the controller is working and so 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:25.820
 then 2 now let's connect the gps module 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:30.350
 it means gps-module is connected according to 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:39.490
 so the picture of the day 3 + read connects 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:39.490
 Well here I understand it here 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.989
 So 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:48.989
 next means turn off the microusb and again 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.620
 here is the cover 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:04.080
 so you understand connect 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:04.080
 Well, turn on the adapter 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:14.650
 means control and boot so again 

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:18.720
 what's interesting is we mostly jeepers aha 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.720
 the green light is on 

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:27.230
 principle and everyone is very happy that the control 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.870
 the work of the bartender is at least milled and 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:32.650
 Mishin launch panel 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.650
 thank you all bye bye
