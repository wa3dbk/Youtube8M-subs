00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.350
 I am smith and I dedicate myself to doing 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.939
 graffiti illustration and music a bit 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.710
 also in my first years of 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.560
 graffiti if there were many people who 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:27.150
 it inspired too much because all the old 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.769
 smoke school juniors and the joker all 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.929
 these people who have started doing 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.490
 effects and character is to say that I understand 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.440
 they do not necessarily arrive by the letters 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.660
 like I started to like more is 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:42.070
 graffiti plus who of the letters is 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.810
 where you can make faces or characters 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.410
 Y 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.410
 no no 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:55.580
 I think my way of working is 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.400
 many simple gods very very to have 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:01.010
 references and of these references there 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.370
 necessarily copy it but to know 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.409
 that has already been done 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.800
 and on that basis transform it into something 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:11.490
 I feel that nobody has seen it 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.610
 in oil mode has changed by 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.430
 many reasons with you 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.980
 I think they are also like places before 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.260
 when I first entered sun and graffiti 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.800
 all brands turn it over or have 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.800
 use it 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.770
 begins to lower the wave again and I think 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.910
 that is rising again and that's it 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:37.070
 it's almost almost going down but if the 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.570
 graffiti has to evolve and always 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.870
 has evolved and will always continue 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.870
 evolving 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.960
 the other part of my life is this me 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.780
 I dedicate to do illustration for agencies 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.090
 of advertising or not necessarily 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.610
 agencies but discs or covers of 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.060
 magazines if it's more docile more commercial 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:01.330
 but because that last one you need to live on 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.550
 something not and apart from doing this from the 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.070
 illustration the design also has a 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.250
 clothing brand is called tony delfino and 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.490
 that was like more a hobby with the 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.380
 initiative to have a graph in a 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.320
 shirt on a graphic of yours in a 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.330
 shirt then started a little bit that's not 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.819
 how to know that nothing was had is club and 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.310
 your friends 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.219
 and from there it started to grow, not like that without 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.780
 want to start doing instead of 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:29.700
 t-shirts thinking of making sweatshirts 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:37.500
 then what it took to do something else 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:39.650
 like it started to grow like it was my 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.609
 connection with the cid and beds as 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:46.860
 we started in just with my brand they were 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.870
 they approached because they want to do this 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.000
 put together artists says a collection of 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.120
 clothes I liked the idea and we started 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.700
 working more a pair of shirts and I think 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:14.160
 that there is a desire to click along with these 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:16.990
 guys good the new york project 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.530
 set with canvas cinema this 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:23.200
 well nothing the challenge was how to do not what 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.350
 that it was very very big it was almost like 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.110
 from corner to corner not this wall and then 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.710
 the challenge was how to do it in 15 days and 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:35.560
 apart from having live recordings my 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:38.010
 first idea was a screen of a 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.260
 eagle with nothing 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.269
 with a weird tooth 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.220
 and they were fighting over a big apple 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.450
 then it was like a little to represent 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.090
 these icons 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.000
 the apple that was the new york city 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:56.360
 and the eagle of course of its states 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.060
 united and the other people were like all 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.400
 this immigrant gang that is there and that 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.640
 they are just the column of this 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.540
 East city that are working and are 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.790
 doing the work that does not 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.300
 necessarily the Americans want 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.300
 do what 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:28.350
 what represents the fact that it is 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:31.050
 doing and traveling to another country and you're 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.240
 leaving a bit of a seed of the logo of 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.790
 where are you or what are you living 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:40.610
 I think that I then like a little bit already has 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.610
 your corner of immortality in the world 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.870
