now and we service both commercial and

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.039 
now and we service both commercial and
community<00:00:11.639> radio<00:00:11.940> as<00:00:12.120> well<00:00:12.150> as<00:00:12.420> education

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
community radio as well as education

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.230 
community radio as well as education
yeah<00:00:14.009> what<00:00:14.190> we<00:00:14.309> want<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.580> do<00:00:14.730> is<00:00:14.910> create<00:00:15.150> a

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
yeah what we want to do is create a

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.970 
yeah what we want to do is create a
broadcast<00:00:15.960> mixer<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:16.529> could<00:00:16.650> run<00:00:16.770> on<00:00:16.890> the

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
broadcast mixer that could run on the

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.359 
broadcast mixer that could run on the
standard<00:00:17.310> piece<00:00:17.550> of<00:00:17.580> PC<00:00:18.480> equipment<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:20.070> the

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
standard piece of PC equipment and the

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.580 
standard piece of PC equipment and the
interface<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.880> multi<00:00:21.420> touch<00:00:21.590> touchscreen

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
interface is a multi touch touchscreen

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.290 
interface is a multi touch touchscreen
so<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.250> can<00:00:23.369> be<00:00:23.460> driven<00:00:23.670> just<00:00:23.880> like<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.090> normal

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
so it can be driven just like a normal

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.650 
so it can be driven just like a normal
mixing<00:00:24.840> desk<00:00:25.519> we<00:00:26.519> also<00:00:26.670> wanted<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.240> make<00:00:27.449> it

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
mixing desk we also wanted to make it

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.660 
mixing desk we also wanted to make it
accessible<00:00:28.080> as<00:00:28.500> many<00:00:28.710> people<00:00:28.980> as<00:00:29.039> possible<00:00:29.130> so

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
accessible as many people as possible so

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.120 
accessible as many people as possible so
it<00:00:29.730> made<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.939> very<00:00:30.119> customizable<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.769> it

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
it made a very customizable and and it

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.040 
it made a very customizable and and it
would<00:00:32.279> be<00:00:32.369> changeable<00:00:32.820> on<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.090> per-user<00:00:33.329> basis

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
would be changeable on a per-user basis

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.830 
would be changeable on a per-user basis
this<00:00:34.739> project<00:00:35.130> was<00:00:35.250> originally<00:00:35.850> knowledge<00:00:36.660> to

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
this project was originally knowledge to

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.590 
this project was originally knowledge to
say<00:00:37.020> as<00:00:37.320> summer<00:00:37.739> projector<00:00:38.370> we<00:00:38.640> got<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.790> local

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
say as summer projector we got a local

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.750 
say as summer projector we got a local
university<00:00:39.660> interns<00:00:40.590> come<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:41.010> give<00:00:41.520> them<00:00:41.640> a

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
university interns come in give them a

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.430 
university interns come in give them a
brief<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.360> say<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:42.870> what<00:00:42.989> we'd<00:00:43.260> like<00:00:43.379> to

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
brief and say this is what we'd like to

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.779 
brief and say this is what we'd like to
achieve<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.190> really<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.520> more<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.730> a

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
achieve and really is more of a

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.540 
achieve and really is more of a
