experienced this great texture of

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.750 
experienced this great texture of
architecture<00:00:36.290> that's<00:00:36.470> been<00:00:37.040> preserved<00:00:37.489> all

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
architecture that's been preserved all

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.920 
architecture that's been preserved all
the<00:00:37.940> way<00:00:38.030> through<00:00:38.270> and<00:00:38.390> you<00:00:38.510> see<00:00:38.690> great

across Canada everybody talks about when
a<00:00:55.070> pagar<00:00:55.430> collection<00:00:55.879> being<00:00:56.059> something

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
a pagar collection being something

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.110 
a pagar collection being something
that's<00:00:56.570> that's<00:00:57.140> that<00:00:57.800> seems<00:00:58.040> to<00:00:58.129> be<00:00:58.190> brewing

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120

what's happening but the they're all

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:17.610 
what's happening but the they're all
thinking<00:01:05.300> something<00:01:05.810> is<00:01:05.899> going<00:01:06.140> on<00:01:06.320> with<00:01:06.470> it

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.010 

you<00:01:18.220> can<00:01:18.400> see<00:01:18.640> another<00:01:18.940> renaissance<00:01:19.810> of

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
you can see another renaissance of

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.590 
you can see another renaissance of
resilience<00:01:20.590> on<00:01:20.800> or<00:01:21.610> quality<00:01:22.060> design<00:01:22.390> and

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
resilience on or quality design and

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.300 
resilience on or quality design and
architecture<00:01:23.080> in<00:01:23.290> the<00:01:23.560> city<00:01:23.800> and<00:01:23.950> they

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
architecture in the city and they

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.160 
architecture in the city and they
connect<00:01:24.640> with<00:01:24.820> people<00:01:24.940> on<00:01:25.150> emotional<00:01:25.660> level

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
connect with people on emotional level

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.890 
connect with people on emotional level
right<00:01:26.590> they<00:01:27.190> do<00:01:27.250> not<00:01:27.640> leave<00:01:28.060> you<00:01:28.240> ambivalent

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
right they do not leave you ambivalent

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.470 
right they do not leave you ambivalent
about<00:01:29.140> what<00:01:29.740> it<00:01:29.860> is<00:01:29.890> and<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:31.000> but<00:01:31.180> they're<00:01:31.300> not

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.480 
about what it is and the but they're not

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.870 
about what it is and the but they're not
just<00:01:31.630> being<00:01:31.840> loud<00:01:32.050> for<00:01:32.350> for<00:01:32.890> sake<00:01:33.520> of<00:01:33.550> being

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
just being loud for for sake of being

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.000 
just being loud for for sake of being
loud<00:01:34.180> right<00:01:34.480> there<00:01:34.540> they're<00:01:35.110> all<00:01:35.230> I<00:01:35.560> would

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
loud right there they're all I would

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.270 
loud right there they're all I would
hope<00:01:36.730> to<00:01:36.790> think<00:01:37.390> that<00:01:37.540> they<00:01:37.750> they're<00:01:38.710> smart

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
hope to think that they they're smart

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.220 
hope to think that they they're smart
enough<00:01:39.370> to<00:01:39.790> do<00:01:40.060> so<00:01:40.330> people<00:01:40.630> can<00:01:40.780> relate<00:01:40.960> to

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
enough to do so people can relate to

00:01:41.230 --> 00:02:00.220 
enough to do so people can relate to
them

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:06.380 

you

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.670 

it's<00:02:07.390> a<00:02:07.450> real<00:02:07.630> city<00:02:07.840> of<00:02:07.990> neighborhoods<00:02:08.170> and

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:08.680 
it's a real city of neighborhoods and

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.340 
it's a real city of neighborhoods and
it's<00:02:08.800> a<00:02:08.890> real<00:02:09.100> tight<00:02:10.060> community<00:02:10.600> because

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
it's a real tight community because

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.200 
it's a real tight community because
we're<00:02:11.530> so<00:02:11.710> isolated<00:02:11.860> and<00:02:12.370> I<00:02:12.850> think<00:02:13.060> that's

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
we're so isolated and I think that's

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.550 
we're so isolated and I think that's
really<00:02:13.390> fostered<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.990> real<00:02:14.170> creative

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
really fostered a real creative

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.270 
really fostered a real creative
community<00:02:15.160> you<00:02:15.700> know<00:02:15.730> we<00:02:15.940> have<00:02:16.090> great<00:02:16.360> music

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
community you know we have great music

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.230 
community you know we have great music
lots<00:02:18.280> of<00:02:18.520> great<00:02:19.120> writers<00:02:19.410> artists<00:02:20.410> and

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
lots of great writers artists and

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.370 
lots of great writers artists and
architecture<00:02:22.240> is<00:02:22.330> really<00:02:22.540> becoming<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:23.080> next

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
architecture is really becoming the next

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.980 
architecture is really becoming the next
piece<00:02:23.830> of<00:02:24.070> that

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.020 

at<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.590> forks<00:02:27.860> of<00:02:27.920> pedestrian<00:02:28.400> bridge<00:02:28.610> was

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
at the forks of pedestrian bridge was

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.820 
at the forks of pedestrian bridge was
one<00:02:29.210> of<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.390> first<00:02:29.660> times<00:02:30.350> that<00:02:30.500> we<00:02:30.650> built

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
one of the first times that we built

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.620 
one of the first times that we built
something<00:02:31.040> that<00:02:31.340> was<00:02:31.490> sort<00:02:31.910> of<00:02:31.970> designed

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
something that was sort of designed

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.950 
something that was sort of designed
focused<00:02:33.110> it<00:02:33.230> was<00:02:33.350> more<00:02:33.680> than<00:02:34.040> just<00:02:34.160> the

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
focused it was more than just the

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.180 
focused it was more than just the
pragmatic<00:02:35.960> pedestrian<00:02:36.560> bridge<00:02:36.770> that<00:02:37.070> could

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
pragmatic pedestrian bridge that could

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.650 
pragmatic pedestrian bridge that could
have<00:02:37.280> been<00:02:37.340> attached<00:02:37.670> as<00:02:37.850> a<00:02:37.940> sidewalk<00:02:38.360> to<00:02:38.630> the

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
have been attached as a sidewalk to the

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.450 
have been attached as a sidewalk to the
side<00:02:38.930> of<00:02:38.960> the<00:02:39.170> automobile<00:02:39.470> bridge<00:02:39.860> we<00:02:40.190> sort<00:02:40.430> of

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
side of the automobile bridge we sort of

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.040 
side of the automobile bridge we sort of
took<00:02:40.700> it<00:02:40.760> and<00:02:40.970> made<00:02:41.120> it<00:02:41.180> something<00:02:41.300> more<00:02:41.840> and

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
took it and made it something more and

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.110 
took it and made it something more and
said<00:02:42.470> we<00:02:42.950> want<00:02:42.980> something<00:02:43.430> greater<00:02:43.730> for<00:02:44.030> the

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
said we want something greater for the

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.230 
said we want something greater for the
city

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.180 

people<00:02:52.170> are<00:02:52.290> amazed<00:02:52.530> when<00:02:52.830> they<00:02:52.920> come<00:02:53.100> to

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
people are amazed when they come to

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.890 
people are amazed when they come to
Winnipeg<00:02:53.520> I<00:02:53.640> think<00:02:53.850> there's<00:02:54.030> we're<00:02:54.630> a<00:02:54.660> bit<00:02:54.810> of

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
Winnipeg I think there's we're a bit of

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.230 
Winnipeg I think there's we're a bit of
a<00:02:54.960> hidden<00:02:55.200> jewel
