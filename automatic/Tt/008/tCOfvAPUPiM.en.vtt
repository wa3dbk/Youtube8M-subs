mr. genius in my own opinion and that's
5<00:01:26.520> bucks<00:01:26.549> for<00:01:26.880> me<00:01:27.060> Santi<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.630> they<00:01:28.439> they

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
5 bucks for me Santi and they they

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.410 
5 bucks for me Santi and they they
basically<00:01:29.310> designed<00:01:29.850> something<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.299> took

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
basically designed something it took

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.390 
basically designed something it took
like<00:01:30.540> this<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.900> third<00:01:31.140> prototype<00:01:31.439> was<00:01:31.979> not

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
like this the third prototype was not

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.800 
like this the third prototype was not
close<00:01:32.640> enough<00:01:32.820> for<00:01:33.000> rock<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.150> roll<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.600> was

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
close enough for rock and roll it was

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.289 
close enough for rock and roll it was
the<00:01:34.020> sound<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> very<00:01:35.939> very

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
the sound so this is a very very

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.330 
the sound so this is a very very
intimate<00:01:36.960> relationship<00:01:37.740> with<00:01:37.770> slash<00:01:38.159> that

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
intimate relationship with slash that

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.370 
intimate relationship with slash that
took<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.579> year<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.850> develop<00:01:38.970> he's<00:01:39.960> playing<00:01:40.259> it

you<00:03:23.150> know<00:03:23.239> what<00:03:23.390> you've<00:03:23.510> really<00:03:23.690> got<00:03:23.870> to<00:03:23.989> hear

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
you know what you've really got to hear

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.110 
you know what you've really got to hear
it<00:03:24.170> it's<00:03:24.769> it's<00:03:25.040> it's<00:03:25.280> an<00:03:25.459> amp<00:03:25.610> in<00:03:25.880> and<00:03:26.030> of

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
it it's it's it's an amp in and of

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.360 
it it's it's it's an amp in and of
itself<00:03:26.480> what<00:03:27.019> it<00:03:27.140> is<00:03:27.260> essentially<00:03:27.769> and<00:03:28.160> this

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
itself what it is essentially and this

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.410 
itself what it is essentially and this
might<00:03:28.580> sound<00:03:28.820> like<00:03:29.090> a<00:03:29.150> a<00:03:29.450> throwaway<00:03:30.260> stupid

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
might sound like a a throwaway stupid

might sound like a a throwaway stupid
generalization<00:03:32.420> this<00:03:33.110> is<00:03:33.260> just<00:03:33.440> a<00:03:33.530> great

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
generalization this is just a great

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.949 
generalization this is just a great

have elements of silver jubilee and yes
it<00:03:38.299> does<00:03:38.480> but<00:03:39.049> it's<00:03:39.170> really<00:03:39.560> based<00:03:39.769> around

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
it does but it's really based around

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.070 
it does but it's really based around
like<00:03:40.549> the<00:03:40.670> two<00:03:40.850> amps<00:03:41.120> are<00:03:41.269> used<00:03:41.450> for<00:03:41.630> apatite

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
like the two amps are used for apatite

like the two amps are used for apatite
and<00:03:42.230> what<00:03:42.799> followed<00:03:43.190> and<00:03:43.940> when<00:03:44.090> you<00:03:44.239> plug<00:03:44.480> in

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
and what followed and when you plug in

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.360 
and what followed and when you plug in
you<00:03:44.780> get<00:03:44.959> it<00:03:45.110> and<00:03:45.560> what<00:03:45.769> were<00:03:45.920> the<00:03:46.070> some<00:03:46.220> of<00:03:46.250> the

you get it and what were the some of the
things<00:03:46.580> that<00:03:46.700> slash<00:03:47.180> through<00:03:47.570> the<00:03:47.750> iterations

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
things that slash through the iterations

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.930 
things that slash through the iterations
of<00:03:48.410> the<00:03:48.680> amp<00:03:48.890> you<00:03:49.130> know<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.370> one<00:03:49.489> two<00:03:49.700> and<00:03:49.850> the

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
of the amp you know the one two and the

the things that he wanted to change that

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.640 
the things that he wanted to change that
you<00:03:53.450> know<00:03:53.570> whether<00:03:53.750> it<00:03:53.900> was<00:03:53.989> the<00:03:54.080> tubes<00:03:54.320> or<00:03:54.530> how

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
you know whether it was the tubes or how

stuff was you know sounding what was he
kind<00:03:57.019> of<00:03:57.110> therns<00:03:57.500> it<00:03:57.860> boils<00:03:58.130> down<00:03:58.160> to<00:03:58.310> you<00:03:58.730> know

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
kind of therns it boils down to you know

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.880 
answer
it's<00:04:01.549> really<00:04:01.910> it's<00:04:02.060> not<00:04:02.239> just<00:04:02.299> about<00:04:02.890> the

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
it's really it's not just about the

it's really it's not just about the
thing

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
thing

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.820 
thing
makes<00:04:04.460> amplifies<00:04:05.030> like<00:04:05.300> this<00:04:05.480> great<00:04:05.810> it's<00:04:06.530> not

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
makes amplifies like this great it's not

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.290 
makes amplifies like this great it's not
just<00:04:07.040> what<00:04:07.190> it<00:04:07.310> sounds<00:04:07.700> like<00:04:07.760> it's<00:04:08.030> how<00:04:08.180> it

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
just what it sounds like it's how it

feels to the player because to me a

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.700 
feels to the player because to me a
great<00:04:11.090> amplify<00:04:11.780> it<00:04:11.840> should<00:04:12.140> be<00:04:12.230> a<00:04:12.260> symbiotic

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
great amplify it should be a symbiotic

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:14.920 
great amplify it should be a symbiotic
relationship<00:04:12.920> between<00:04:13.760> you<00:04:14.330> between<00:04:14.750> the

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
player in itself it's like a positive

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.880 
player in itself it's like a positive
feedback<00:04:16.940> loop<00:04:17.180> you<00:04:18.140> start<00:04:18.380> playing<00:04:18.620> you<00:04:18.739> like

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
feedback loop you start playing you like

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.830

better than I really am because it

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:23.800 
better than I really am because it
sounds<00:04:22.100> kicking<00:04:22.490> and<00:04:23.120> it<00:04:23.270> makes<00:04:23.450> you<00:04:23.570> play<00:04:23.690> but
