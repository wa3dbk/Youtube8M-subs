00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
approaching the first ring in the radar

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.410 
approaching the first ring in the radar
I<00:02:22.130> start<00:02:22.970> I<00:02:24.340> got<00:02:25.340> ready<00:02:25.580> to<00:02:25.760> put<00:02:25.910> the<00:02:26.090> former

between the sugar and the first little

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.800 
between the sugar and the first little
ring<00:02:30.770> then<00:02:31.760> that's<00:02:32.150> why<00:02:32.330> I<00:02:32.360> need<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.660> boy

blue<00:04:52.130> am<00:04:52.430> on<00:04:52.820> the<00:04:53.060> Raider<00:04:53.270> is<00:04:53.840> either<00:04:54.530> on<00:04:54.950> top

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
blue am on the Raider is either on top

of the inner circle or like slightly
outside<00:04:57.920> those<00:04:58.340> ideate<00:04:58.790> sided<00:05:01.420> players<00:05:02.420> I

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
outside those ideate sided players I

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.880 
outside those ideate sided players I
think<00:05:02.990> that<00:05:03.620> first<00:05:03.920> they<00:05:04.760> tend<00:05:05.060> to<00:05:05.180> work<00:05:05.390> like

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
think that first they tend to work like

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:09.780 
think that first they tend to work like
80%<00:05:06.890> of<00:05:06.980> the<00:05:07.100> times<00:05:07.540> so<00:05:08.540> you<00:05:09.200> need<00:05:09.410> to<00:05:09.530> be

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
80% of the times so you need to be

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.380 
80% of the times so you need to be
pretty<00:05:11.350> unlucky<00:05:12.350> to<00:05:12.770> get<00:05:12.890> it<00:05:13.130> but<00:05:14.060> if<00:05:14.210> you're

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
pretty unlucky to get it but if you're

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.260 
pretty unlucky to get it but if you're
being<00:05:14.570> shot<00:05:14.840> if<00:05:15.140> you<00:05:15.290> get<00:05:15.470> like<00:05:15.790> like<00:05:16.790> five

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
being shot if you get like like five

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.360 
being shot if you get like like five
missiles<00:05:17.720> incoming<00:05:18.050> then<00:05:18.710> one<00:05:18.980> of<00:05:19.100> them<00:05:19.190> is

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
missiles incoming then one of them is

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
incoming is to probably going to do it

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.180 
incoming is to probably going to do it
so<00:05:27.310> yeah<00:05:28.310> that<00:05:28.880> was<00:05:29.060> kind<00:05:29.390> of<00:05:29.450> my<00:05:29.600> small<00:05:30.190> small

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
so yeah that was kind of my small small

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.450 
so yeah that was kind of my small small
demonstration<00:05:32.150> of<00:05:32.980> what<00:05:33.980> happens<00:05:34.340> when

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
demonstration of what happens when

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.480 
demonstration of what happens when
you're<00:05:34.610> being<00:05:34.730> shot<00:05:35.030> by<00:05:35.450> a<00:05:35.690> missile<00:05:36.020> so<00:05:36.950> here's

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
you're being shot by a missile so here's

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.190 
you're being shot by a missile so here's
where<00:05:37.640> those<00:05:37.820> crash<00:05:38.150> landings<00:05:38.570> come<00:05:38.720> in<00:05:38.840> handy

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
where those crash landings come in handy

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.340 
where those crash landings come in handy
as<00:05:39.430> you<00:05:40.430> can<00:05:40.640> see<00:05:40.790> I<00:05:40.820> safely<00:05:41.690> put<00:05:41.870> the<00:05:41.990> aircraft

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.350 
as you can see I safely put the aircraft

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.740 
as you can see I safely put the aircraft
on<00:05:42.680> the<00:05:42.710> ground<00:05:42.800> and<00:05:43.280> I<00:05:43.490> managed<00:05:43.760> to<00:05:43.940> get<00:05:44.600> out

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
on the ground and I managed to get out

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.710 
on the ground and I managed to get out
alive<00:05:45.350> and<00:05:46.160> the<00:05:46.520> thing<00:05:46.730> hasn't<00:05:46.940> exploded<00:05:47.540> yet

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
alive and the thing hasn't exploded yet

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.220 
alive and the thing hasn't exploded yet
so<00:05:48.110> that's<00:05:48.230> good

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:50.230 
so that's good

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.290 
so that's good
apart<00:05:51.230> from<00:05:51.290> that<00:05:51.380> just<00:05:51.860> remember<00:05:52.670> the<00:05:53.090> main

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
apart from that just remember the main

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.100 
outside of the inner circle that's my

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.940 
outside of the inner circle that's my
general<00:06:01.370> advice<00:06:01.640> for<00:06:01.970> flares<00:06:02.570> and<00:06:02.870> if<00:06:03.740> they

general advice for flares and if they
hit<00:06:04.070> you<00:06:04.130> make<00:06:04.760> sure<00:06:04.970> you<00:06:05.180> practice<00:06:05.450> the

operation<00:06:06.500> ending<00:06:06.770> it<00:06:06.860> up<00:06:06.980> so<00:06:07.340> you<00:06:07.430> can

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 
operation ending it up so you can

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.810
