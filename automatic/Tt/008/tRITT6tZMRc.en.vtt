00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.549
 Speak there guys who say that with you 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.980
 The river you are in the canal can 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:12.200
 create games and in today's video I'll talk 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.200
 About the game project cars 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:27.619
 The meat project is a simulator of 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:31.010
 race that was released for pc on day 7 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.239
 of May 2015 and for Playstation 4 and 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.030
 Xbox one 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.920
 this game was released on May 12 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.830
 2015 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.680
 and this game was produced by the same 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:45.860
 game producers need for speed shift 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.129
 and is a long time folks that did not reach the 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.470
 market of games the game capable of beating 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.890
 front with the powerful franchises of the 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.470
 forza and gran turismo for you to play 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.860
 this game I believe that the best option 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.900
 would be to start the career mode for 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.570
 that you can get used to the 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.090
 cars and with the form tracks 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.420
 progressive because as you go 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.700
 playing seasons the championships you 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.030
 will be able to test various categories of 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.090
 cars and various race tracks and 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:23.060
 however a positive point of the game is that 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.549
 You're not one of those players who adhere to 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.850
 play the career mode before playing a 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.969
 multiplayer for example you can play 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.250
 a unique racing mode where all the 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:37.219
 tracks of all cars will be 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.500
 released for you to train and you do not 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:42.350
 will need to play thousands of hours 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.719
 so you can release the cars and 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.539
 the tracks because all of them are already there 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:50.630
 available so that you can run and 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:54.380
 another extremely positive factor in this 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.320
 game is the graphic quality the cars 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.329
 galera are created in the smallest detail 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.969
 gives the impression that automakers 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:04.729
 participate in the process of creating 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:08.060
 game and they were also the same 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.640
 care in creating the clues and also 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.060
 the climate change occurring 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.880
 during the races as well as the time 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.640
 the race is happening but for 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.170
 that there are no defects in the 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.760
 game visual 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.450
 there is a question that could have been 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.180
 better than it would be when the 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.500
 beats because the visual damage that occurs 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.490
 in cars during 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:38.060
 the beats do not pass to the players 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:40.430
 a sense of realism and 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.740
 gameplay the producers 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.890
 took care of producing this game 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.170
 with the intention of covering a public 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.470
 greater than only that public that 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.200
 likes car simulators because the 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.590
 the crowd simulator actually has a 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.930
 very complex gameplay and is well 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.060
 Difficult for you to get accustomed to 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.100
 this type of game if you for example 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.010
 never played a racing simulator 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.980
 before and we - guys you have to 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.709
 possibility of changing the degree of 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.400
 artificial intelligence of opponents 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:18.290
 as well as put traction control 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.870
 stability assistant that helps you 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.850
 time for you to do your running and 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.970
 also helps those players who do not 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.040
 want to simulate a race and yes 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.430
 take the breaks with the friends there in the 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.310
 weekend and a negative side of the 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.799
 game are the boys who are very 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.650
 confused mainly for those 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:42.440
 players who have never played a game of 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.630
 racing simulation before the game does not 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.209
 explains for example what happens if 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.340
 change the suspension of my car what 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:53.200
 happens if you change the calibration 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.910
 tires or what happens if I 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.489
 increase front brake pressure 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.820
 and back are questions for example 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:04.310
 what you can do during the game and 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.709
 you will not have this answer in the game 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.380
 unlike forza and gran 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.570
 tourism that always have less 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.780
 explanations about any change 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:18.380
 What do you do in your vehicles? 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:21.790
 and this lack of information that has the 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:25.310
 project cas can affect the gameplay 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:28.040
 during the races and in the 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.900
 General the guys the game is very good the 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.760
 graphics are sensational to 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.760
 gameplay is great 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.310
 if you are one of those players who actually 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.010
 like racing games like 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.680
 take cracks like challenges 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.529
 I think this game is worth the 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.889
 worth being 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:48.899
 purchased and worth being tested by 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:51.209
 each of you 

00:04:48.899 --> 00:04:54.029
