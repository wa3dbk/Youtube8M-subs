a<00:00:22.680> four-stroke<00:00:23.340> engine<00:00:23.820> what<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.119> need<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.449> do

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
a four-stroke engine what you need to do

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.790 
a four-stroke engine what you need to do
is<00:00:24.920> on<00:00:25.920> your<00:00:25.949> crankshaft<00:00:26.880> you'll<00:00:27.660> find<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.320> very

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
is on your crankshaft you'll find a very

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.650 
is on your crankshaft you'll find a very
small<00:00:29.250> dot<00:00:29.869> in<00:00:30.869> between<00:00:31.500> or<00:00:32.309> on<00:00:32.610> one<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.420> the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
small dot in between or on one of the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.010 
small dot in between or on one of the
gears<00:00:34.250> so<00:00:35.250> here<00:00:35.670> I've<00:00:35.850> found<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:36.630> one<00:00:36.870> just

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
gears so here I've found this one just

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.110 
gears so here I've found this one just
here<00:00:37.260> it's<00:00:37.410> probably<00:00:37.590> very<00:00:38.309> hard<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.700> see<00:00:38.940> but

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
here it's probably very hard to see but

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.470 
here it's probably very hard to see but
it's<00:00:39.840> just<00:00:40.020> there<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.410> it's<00:00:40.620> in<00:00:40.829> between<00:00:41.480> one

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
it's just there and it's in between one

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.690 
it's just there and it's in between one
of<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.690> teeth<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.649> it's<00:00:43.860> lining<00:00:44.250> up<00:00:44.460> with<00:00:44.489> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
of the teeth so it's lining up with the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.060 
of the teeth so it's lining up with the
center<00:00:44.969> what<00:00:45.629> do<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.809> want<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.050> do<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.410> you'll

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
center what do you want to do is you'll

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.270 
center what do you want to do is you'll
bring<00:00:47.340> that<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:47.820> that's<00:00:48.059> horizontal<00:00:49.039> it<00:00:50.039> runs

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
bring that so that's horizontal it runs

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.639 
bring that so that's horizontal it runs
a<00:00:50.430> horizontal<00:00:51.120> line<00:00:51.360> with<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.170> bottom<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
a horizontal line with the bottom of the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.240 
a horizontal line with the bottom of the
block<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.239> it's<00:00:54.239> running<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.780> way<00:00:55.100> and<00:00:56.100> then

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
block so it's running that way and then

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.920 
block so it's running that way and then
what<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.520> do<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.850> you're<00:00:57.360> locate<00:00:57.750> your

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
what you do is you're locate your

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.889 
what you do is you're locate your
camshaft<00:00:58.199> on<00:00:58.800> there<00:00:59.789> you<00:01:00.000> also<00:01:00.210> have<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.629> mark

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
camshaft on there you also have a mark

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.170 
camshaft on there you also have a mark
which<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.320> just<00:01:01.710> here<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.309> one<00:01:02.550> and

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
which is just here on this one and

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.170 
which is just here on this one and
that's<00:01:03.359> actually<00:01:03.570> between<00:01:04.110> two<00:01:04.559> teeth<00:01:04.890> in<00:01:05.180> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
that's actually between two teeth in the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.620 
that's actually between two teeth in the
middle

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
middle

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.990 
middle
so<00:01:06.810> what<00:01:07.049> then<00:01:07.560> happens<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.400> little<00:01:08.640> dot

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
so what then happens is that little dot

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.149 
so what then happens is that little dot
will<00:01:09.780> line<00:01:10.020> up<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.500> middle<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.950> those<00:01:11.100> two

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
will line up in the middle of those two

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.060 
will line up in the middle of those two
teeth<00:01:11.900> so<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:12.930> don't<00:01:13.260> really<00:01:13.470> need<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.860> take

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
teeth so you don't really need to take

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.560 
teeth so you don't really need to take
the<00:01:14.220> valves<00:01:14.640> out<00:01:14.760> for<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.119> but<00:01:15.330> if<00:01:15.420> you

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
the valves out for this but if you

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.390 
the valves out for this but if you
already<00:01:15.689> ever<00:01:16.020> met<00:01:16.290> sometimes<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.100> can<00:01:17.250> make

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
already ever met sometimes it can make

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.160 
already ever met sometimes it can make
it<00:01:17.520> easier<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.270> doesn't<00:01:18.689> particularly<00:01:19.020> matter

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
it easier it doesn't particularly matter

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.149 
it easier it doesn't particularly matter
at<00:01:19.500> all<00:01:19.590> really

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
at all really

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.630 
at all really
so<00:01:20.939> then<00:01:21.060> what<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.360> do<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:22.100> you<00:01:23.100> just<00:01:23.130> line<00:01:23.610> it

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
so then what you do is you just line it

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.800 
so then what you do is you just line it
up<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.470> the<00:01:25.470> camshaft<00:01:25.770> slips<00:01:26.520> inside<00:01:26.810> but

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
up so that the camshaft slips inside but

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.620 
up so that the camshaft slips inside but
the<00:01:28.530> mark<00:01:28.829> on<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.220> camshaft<00:01:29.490> lines<00:01:30.240> up<00:01:30.479> with

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
the mark on the camshaft lines up with

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.010 
the mark on the camshaft lines up with
the<00:01:30.750> mark<00:01:31.020> on<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.670> gear<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.299> crankshaft

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
the mark on the gear on the crankshaft

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.149 
the mark on the gear on the crankshaft
now<00:01:35.689> this<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.990> same<00:01:37.229> on<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.680> comes<00:01:37.950> the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
now this is the same on to comes the

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.880 
now this is the same on to comes the
engines<00:01:38.549> on<00:01:38.820> this<00:01:39.000> particular<00:01:39.360> one<00:01:39.810> as<00:01:40.530> that

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
engines on this particular one as that

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.160 
engines on this particular one as that
hole<00:01:41.340> there<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.939> next<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.570> on<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.810> gear<00:01:43.020> it

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
hole there and next to it on the gear it

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.010 
hole there and next to it on the gear it
actually<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.680> small<00:01:43.979> dot<00:01:44.600> which<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.750> can't

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
actually is a small dot which you can't

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.620 
actually is a small dot which you can't
see<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.590> that<00:01:47.220> lines<00:01:47.520> up<00:01:47.759> with<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.970> small<00:01:48.360> dot

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
see and that lines up with a small dot

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.340 
see and that lines up with a small dot
on<00:01:49.200> this<00:01:49.680> on<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.460> camshaft<00:01:50.759> here<00:01:51.360> which<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:52.320> we

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
on this on the camshaft here which so we

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.420 
on this on the camshaft here which so we
also<00:01:52.619> be<00:01:52.979> hard<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.310> see<00:01:54.409> so<00:01:55.409> once<00:01:56.009> you've<00:01:56.189> lined

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
also be hard to see so once you've lined

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.870 
also be hard to see so once you've lined
them<00:01:56.670> up<00:01:56.790> like<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:58.100> which<00:01:59.100> I'll<00:01:59.340> try<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.759> get

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
them up like that which I'll try and get

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.139 
them up like that which I'll try and get
a<00:01:59.909> close-up<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.439> ears<00:02:02.040> you're<00:02:02.340> marking

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
a close-up so the ears you're marking

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.330 
a close-up so the ears you're marking
here<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.600> here's<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.869> dot<00:02:04.200> there<00:02:04.409> you<00:02:05.189> will

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
here and here's the dot there you will

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.139 
here and here's the dot there you will
then<00:02:05.549> get<00:02:05.729> your<00:02:06.469> oil<00:02:07.469> slinger<00:02:08.099> or<00:02:08.160> oil<00:02:08.729> pump

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
then get your oil slinger or oil pump

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.270 
then get your oil slinger or oil pump
system<00:02:09.629> depending<00:02:10.200> on<00:02:10.259> what<00:02:10.440> sort<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:10.709> images

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
system depending on what sort of images

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.340 
system depending on what sort of images
and<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:12.150> generally<00:02:12.510> want<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:12.900> line

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
and you generally want to line

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.020 
and you generally want to line
upside<00:02:13.740> that<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:14.070> edge<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.270> is<00:02:15.450> just<00:02:16.260> off

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
upside that the edge of it is just off

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.020 
upside that the edge of it is just off
the<00:02:18.030> side<00:02:18.300> of<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.600> block<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.430> pretty<00:02:20.430> sort<00:02:20.910> of

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
the side of the block and pretty sort of

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.750 
the side of the block and pretty sort of
close<00:02:21.270> to<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.690> internal<00:02:22.500> bit<00:02:22.680> because<00:02:23.370> on

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
close to the internal bit because on

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.820 
close to the internal bit because on
these<00:02:24.000> ones<00:02:25.670> it<00:02:26.670> actually<00:02:27.120> slips<00:02:27.480> in<00:02:27.800> to<00:02:28.800> a

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
these ones it actually slips in to a

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.980 
these ones it actually slips in to a
groove<00:02:29.310> on<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.670> box<00:02:29.940> so<00:02:30.120> sometimes<00:02:30.540> just<00:02:30.780> need

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
groove on the box so sometimes just need

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.530 
groove on the box so sometimes just need
to<00:02:31.140> shake<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.010> around<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.580> bit<00:02:32.610> but<00:02:33.330> generally

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
to shake it around a bit but generally

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.860 
to shake it around a bit but generally
you<00:02:33.870> can<00:02:34.050> get<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.410> go<00:02:34.440> down

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
you can get it to go down

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.050 
you can get it to go down
so<00:02:36.920> after<00:02:37.920> that<00:02:38.070> you're<00:02:38.400> ready<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:38.640> do<00:02:38.880> up<00:02:39.030> your

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
so after that you're ready to do up your

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.700 
so after that you're ready to do up your
bolts<00:02:39.510> on<00:02:39.660> you<00:02:39.810> with<00:02:39.960> this<00:02:40.080> timed<00:02:40.440> a

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
bolts on you with this timed a

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.240 
bolts on you with this timed a
four-stroke<00:02:41.370> engine<00:02:41.900> so<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:43.320> hope<00:02:43.740> that<00:02:43.950> helps

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
four-stroke engine so I hope that helps

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.140 
four-stroke engine so I hope that helps
someone<00:02:44.640> I'll<00:02:45.600> see<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:45.960> later
