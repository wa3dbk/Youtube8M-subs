00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
cheaper if you do it now so that's when

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.020 
cheaper if you do it now so that's when

they do that but if you can't wait you
know<00:06:23.150> it's<00:06:23.660> not<00:06:24.080> that<00:06:24.139> expensive<00:06:24.590> I<00:06:25.070> think

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:25.100 
know it's not that expensive I think

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.340 
know it's not that expensive I think
that<00:06:25.430> I<00:06:25.610> think<00:06:25.880> cataclysms<00:06:26.419> like<00:06:26.600> 20<00:06:27.020> or<00:06:27.139> 30

bucks and misspend area is like 40 bucks
it's<00:06:30.889> not<00:06:31.039> that<00:06:31.280> bad<00:06:31.490> but<00:06:31.550> still<00:06:32.300> you<00:06:32.389> can<00:06:32.539> get

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:32.690 
it's not that bad but still you can get

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.140 
it's not that bad but still you can get
it<00:06:32.780> cheap<00:06:32.960> if<00:06:33.140> you<00:06:33.229> wait

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:02.430 
you know it's it's a first step once you

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.610 
you know it's it's a first step once you
once<00:07:03.270> you<00:07:03.420> create<00:07:03.690> all<00:07:03.810> that<00:07:03.930> information<00:07:04.470> and
