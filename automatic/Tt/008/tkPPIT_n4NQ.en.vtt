so<00:00:00.450> we're<00:00:00.630> talking<00:00:00.840> about<00:00:01.079> the<00:00:01.439> smalls

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
so we're talking about the smalls

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.800 
so we're talking about the smalls
paradise<00:00:02.159> record<00:00:02.820> that<00:00:02.970> Jimmy<00:00:03.210> recorded<00:00:03.720> that

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
paradise record that Jimmy recorded that

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.380 
paradise record that Jimmy recorded that
the<00:00:03.929> percussion<00:00:04.440> was<00:00:04.589> stuck<00:00:04.830> on<00:00:05.040> so<00:00:05.700> here's

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
the percussion was stuck on so here's

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.760 
the percussion was stuck on so here's
the<00:00:06.600> sound<00:00:06.839> of<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.140> organ<00:00:07.319> with<00:00:07.649> the

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
the sound of the organ with the

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.480 
the sound of the organ with the
percussion<00:00:08.280> attack<00:00:08.610> that<00:00:08.849> decays<00:00:10.490> decays

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
percussion attack that decays decays

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.820 
percussion attack that decays decays
doesn't<00:00:12.300> go<00:00:12.389> through<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.750> course<00:00:13.019> so<00:00:13.710> when

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
doesn't go through the course so when

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.609 
doesn't go through the course so when
you<00:00:13.889> play<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.219> note<00:00:14.400> you<00:00:14.580> get<00:00:14.700> this<00:00:14.880> sound<00:00:15.619> it

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
you play the note you get this sound it

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.420 
you play the note you get this sound it
goes<00:00:16.830> away<00:00:17.010> real<00:00:17.369> quick<00:00:18.830> but<00:00:19.830> when<00:00:20.010> you<00:00:20.130> stick

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
goes away real quick but when you stick

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.769 
goes away real quick but when you stick
the<00:00:20.550> percussion<00:00:21.090> on<00:00:21.300> notice<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.380> stays<00:00:22.680> there

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.509 

so<00:00:27.779> we<00:00:27.930> new<00:00:28.050> groove<00:00:28.320> in<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:28.949> we<00:00:29.189> call<00:00:29.369> this

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
so we new groove in it so we call this

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.310 
so we new groove in it so we call this
the<00:00:29.580> paradise<00:00:30.119> which<00:00:30.390> because<00:00:30.779> we<00:00:30.929> knew<00:00:31.050> Grove

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
the paradise which because we knew Grove

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.590 
the paradise which because we knew Grove
and<00:00:31.529> grooving<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:31.949> paradise<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:33.059> sound<00:00:33.360> like

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
and grooving is paradise to sound like

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:51.290 
and grooving is paradise to sound like
this<00:00:48.860> little<00:00:49.860> bit<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.190> difference<00:00:50.640> man<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.210> we

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
this little bit of difference man so we

00:00:51.300 --> 00:01:06.530 
this little bit of difference man so we
go<00:01:03.530> where<00:01:04.530> without<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.369> percussion<00:01:05.880> stock<00:01:06.210> it

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
go where without the percussion stock it

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:19.310 
go where without the percussion stock it
would<00:01:06.750> sound<00:01:06.930> like<00:01:07.080> this<00:01:17.840> sometimes<00:01:18.840> little

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
would sound like this sometimes little

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.510 
would sound like this sometimes little
things<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.799> make<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.130> big<00:01:20.340> difference

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
things like that make a big difference

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:38.340 
things like that make a big difference
so<00:01:20.850> when<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.090> would<00:01:21.330> get<00:01:21.540> into<00:01:21.780> rapid<00:01:22.140> fire

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.999 

that<00:01:39.350> kind<00:01:39.560> of<00:01:39.590> sound

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
that kind of sound

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.090 
that kind of sound
so<00:01:40.159> the<00:01:40.609> the<00:01:41.210> Paradise<00:01:41.689> sound<00:01:42.020> was<00:01:42.319> was<00:01:42.890> that

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
so the the Paradise sound was was that

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.889 
so the the Paradise sound was was that
so<00:01:43.310> a<00:01:43.340> lot<00:01:43.640> of<00:01:43.700> organs<00:01:44.119> what<00:01:44.390> they'll<00:01:44.569> do<00:01:44.689> today

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
so a lot of organs what they'll do today

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:46.209 
so a lot of organs what they'll do today
is<00:01:45.020> though<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:45.500> old<00:01:45.649> organs<00:01:46.069> though

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:46.219 
is though the old organs though

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:47.740 
is though the old organs though
interrupt<00:01:46.640> that<00:01:46.700> yellow<00:01:47.090> wire<00:01:47.359> and<00:01:47.390> put<00:01:47.719> a

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
interrupt that yellow wire and put a

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.870 
interrupt that yellow wire and put a
switch<00:01:48.049> to<00:01:48.770> break<00:01:48.979> that<00:01:49.189> but<00:01:49.640> these<00:01:49.759> are

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
switch to break that but these are

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.130 
switch to break that but these are
little<00:01:49.969> things<00:01:50.119> that<00:01:50.450> you<00:01:50.630> could<00:01:50.780> do<00:01:50.869> with<00:01:51.020> the

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
little things that you could do with the

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.749 
little things that you could do with the
digital<00:01:51.530> organ<00:01:51.920> and<00:01:52.039> you<00:01:52.130> could<00:01:52.250> never<00:01:52.490> do

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
digital organ and you could never do

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.580 
digital organ and you could never do
with<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.630> old<00:01:53.719> one<00:01:53.959> unless<00:01:54.140> you<00:01:54.289> wanted<00:01:54.500> to

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
with the old one unless you wanted to

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.349 
with the old one unless you wanted to
actually<00:01:54.920> go<00:01:55.069> in<00:01:55.219> there<00:01:55.369> and<00:01:55.459> fish<00:01:56.119> another

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:56.359 
actually go in there and fish another

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:58.779 
actually go in there and fish another
wire<00:01:56.659> or<00:01:57.319> to<00:01:57.530> change<00:01:57.829> the<00:01:58.099> volume<00:01:58.549> on<00:01:58.700> the

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
wire or to change the volume on the

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:00.639 
wire or to change the volume on the
percussion<00:01:59.329> like<00:01:59.539> that<00:01:59.750> or<00:01:59.869> that<00:02:00.049> changed<00:02:00.500> the

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
percussion like that or that changed the

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.289 
percussion like that or that changed the
decay<00:02:00.950> you<00:02:00.979> had<00:02:01.159> to<00:02:01.250> take<00:02:01.429> the<00:02:01.549> back<00:02:01.759> off

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
decay you had to take the back off

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.969 
decay you had to take the back off
change<00:02:02.899> the<00:02:03.020> setting<00:02:04.179> so<00:02:05.179> thank<00:02:05.539> you<00:02:05.979> feels

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
change the setting so thank you feels

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:13.600 
change the setting so thank you feels
the<00:02:07.159> same<00:02:10.299> well<00:02:11.299> once<00:02:11.629> again<00:02:12.129> the<00:02:13.129> keyboard

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
the same well once again the keyboard

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.150 
the same well once again the keyboard
liked<00:02:13.940> wood<00:02:14.329> since<00:02:14.540> that<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.989> original<00:02:15.709> b3

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
liked wood since that the original b3

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.880 
liked wood since that the original b3
had<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.519> longer<00:02:17.000> fulcrum<00:02:17.480> for<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.810> notes<00:02:18.049> the

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
had the longer fulcrum for the notes the

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.800 
had the longer fulcrum for the notes the
notes<00:02:19.069> feel<00:02:19.519> just<00:02:19.910> a<00:02:20.000> little<00:02:20.239> bit<00:02:20.390> different

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
notes feel just a little bit different

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.289 
notes feel just a little bit different
but<00:02:20.930> but<00:02:21.260> not<00:02:21.950> that<00:02:22.190> much<00:02:22.430> different<00:02:22.910> there's

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:23.299 
but but not that much different there's

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.150 
but but not that much different there's
just<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:23.660> small<00:02:23.840> adjustment<00:02:24.829> but<00:02:24.980> you<00:02:25.069> know

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
just a small adjustment but you know

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.800 
just a small adjustment but you know
what<00:02:25.340> man<00:02:25.489> I've<00:02:25.640> played<00:02:25.910> organs<00:02:26.450> that<00:02:26.629> were

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
what man I've played organs that were

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.170 
what man I've played organs that were
you<00:02:27.500> know<00:02:27.530> weighted<00:02:28.040> real<00:02:28.250> heavy<00:02:28.549> or<00:02:28.790> weighted

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
you know weighted real heavy or weighted

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.930 
you know weighted real heavy or weighted
real<00:02:29.390> light<00:02:29.629> so<00:02:30.319> the<00:02:30.739> people<00:02:31.310> change<00:02:31.700> the

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
real light so the people change the

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.770 
real light so the people change the
weighting<00:02:32.299> on<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.540> old<00:02:32.690> ones<00:02:33.310> you<00:02:34.310> know<00:02:34.780> they

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
weighting on the old ones you know they

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.440 
weighting on the old ones you know they
vary<00:02:36.079> from<00:02:36.319> organ<00:02:36.739> to<00:02:36.829> organ<00:02:36.859> so<00:02:37.430> this<00:02:38.180> just

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
vary from organ to organ so this just

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.839 
vary from organ to organ so this just
has<00:02:38.630> its<00:02:38.870> own<00:02:39.049> feel<00:02:39.410> that's<00:02:40.010> that's<00:02:40.400> just<00:02:40.489> a

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
has its own feel that's that's just a

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.580 
has its own feel that's that's just a
little<00:02:41.000> bit<00:02:41.209> slightly<00:02:41.480> different<00:02:42.049> but<00:02:42.530> good

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
little bit slightly different but good

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.890 
little bit slightly different but good
it's<00:02:43.160> still<00:02:43.430> very<00:02:43.579> responsive<00:02:44.359> that's<00:02:44.569> that's

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
it's still very responsive that's that's

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.229 
it's still very responsive that's that's
the<00:02:45.109> key<00:02:45.290> man<00:02:45.590> if<00:02:45.980> you<00:02:46.250> can<00:02:46.430> move<00:02:46.639> on<00:02:46.880> it<00:02:47.060> I

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
the key man if you can move on it I
