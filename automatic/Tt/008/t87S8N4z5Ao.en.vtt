00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 salou and hello here is your michael 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.350
 from the bio cook we make mine today 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.350
 Herb butter 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.760
 many herbs we need 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:27.440
 soft butter 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:29.060
 alternatively it would not matter which one 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.680
 herbs like oregano the am 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.590
 tarragon also supports parsley 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.140
 a little ounce of course the praise 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.320
 onion salt and pepper can be natural 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.730
 vary depending on what I sometimes 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.350
 Only with great effort does she really offer it 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.980
 okay and I think first in the 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:58.940
 make butter the best know soft 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:01:05.050
 Just take out a lot soon enough 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.050
 can garlic that's not finished 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:12.850
 Constance a properly paint black 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.990
 pepper 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:27.610
 he just has more character this 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:38.350
 wise as you see my mother too 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:38.350
 border area also on other ingredients 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:02:03.620
 red onions are always nice and sharp 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:05.240
 I really like it all 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.470
 other herbs only take completely 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.470
 together as they are 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:19.390
 tarragon its know what turn the factory 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:21.590
 only the enraptured since slightly 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:33.220
 very thick to thin today but always 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:35.450
 again with the skewers a bit 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:41.650
 just make a bit more compact 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.650
 just cut it goes 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.030
 finished looks again very fast 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:51.280
 made the protective barriers that way 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:56.060
 classic butter firmly all depends 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:59.500
 same refrigerator purely wants is the 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.500
 then we'll see 56 minutes 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:08.330
 then she can finish later 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.400
 so kitchens touran is clean 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.910
 if you want you can already done 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.910
 but plug it in 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.450
 facebook twitter or google plus 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.020
 each worse the bio cook not 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:33.080
 would dirks fdp oper zurich yes why 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.300
 it suits potatoes very well 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.810
 many cult steaks leave and first 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.970
 It would have to be a good start 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.250
 yes today mother for cash for fresh 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.440
 baked cash can be used universally 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:48.520
