these<00:00:20.500> times<00:00:20.949> pretty<00:00:21.640> quickly<00:00:21.910> so<00:00:22.029> if<00:00:22.359> you

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:22.449 
these times pretty quickly so if you

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.450 
these times pretty quickly so if you
wanted<00:00:22.660> a<00:00:22.750> good<00:00:22.869> things<00:00:23.050> in<00:00:23.170> more<00:00:23.320> detail<00:00:23.710> you

can<00:00:24.610> pause<00:00:24.939> the<00:00:25.090> video<00:00:25.180> because<00:00:25.869> it<00:00:26.529> really

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
can pause the video because it really

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.319 
can pause the video because it really
bothers<00:00:27.130> me<00:00:27.130> when<00:00:27.579> people<00:00:27.640> are<00:00:27.970> loaded<00:00:28.240> good

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:28.329 
bothers me when people are loaded good

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.019 
bothers me when people are loaded good
videos<00:00:28.599> and<00:00:28.779> they<00:00:28.840> last<00:00:29.400> unnecessarily<00:00:30.400> long

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
videos and they last unnecessarily long

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.660 
videos and they last unnecessarily long
amount<00:00:31.480> of<00:00:31.570> time<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:34.390> yeah<00:00:34.629> if<00:00:34.840> you<00:00:35.710> want<00:00:36.550> to

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
amount of time so yeah if you want to

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.340 
amount of time so yeah if you want to
look<00:00:36.790> at<00:00:36.940> stuff<00:00:37.180> you<00:00:37.360> can<00:00:37.510> just<00:00:37.690> pause<00:00:37.900> over

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
cube and a few things to scroll most of

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:47.549 
cube and a few things to scroll most of
these<00:00:45.040> items<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.870> majority<00:00:47.140> of<00:00:47.290> them<00:00:47.500> are

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
these items the majority of them are

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:53.070 
these items the majority of them are
finished<00:00:47.890> I<00:00:49.019> think<00:00:50.019> the<00:00:50.379> badge<00:00:51.010> I<00:00:51.960> have<00:00:52.960> the

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.080 
finished I think the badge I have the

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.890 
finished I think the badge I have the
scroll<00:00:53.440> I<00:00:53.769> just<00:00:54.309> can't<00:00:54.489> remember<00:00:54.659> all<00:00:55.659> three

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
scroll I just can't remember all three

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.710 
scroll I just can't remember all three
of<00:00:55.960> my<00:00:56.080> rings<00:00:56.379> actor<00:00:56.589> cube<00:00:57.089> all<00:00:58.089> three<00:00:58.479> of<00:00:58.510> the

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720 
of my rings actor cube all three of the

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.240 
of my rings actor cube all three of the
rings<00:00:58.930> that<00:00:59.080> aren't<00:00:59.379> cubed<00:00:59.589> I<00:00:59.769> have<00:00:59.890> to<00:01:00.010> cube

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
rings that aren't cubed I have to cube

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.910 
rings that aren't cubed I have to cube
this<00:01:00.640> one<00:01:00.820> is<00:01:00.909> only<00:01:01.030> six<00:01:01.330> percent<00:01:01.420> luck<00:01:01.920> this

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
this one is only six percent luck this

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.009 
this one is only six percent luck this
is<00:01:03.040> an<00:01:03.129> absent<00:01:03.519> luck<00:01:03.670> and<00:01:04.390> I<00:01:04.479> think<00:01:04.540> that<00:01:04.780> one

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
is an absent luck and I think that one

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.450 
is an absent luck and I think that one
is<00:01:05.049> not<00:01:05.290> as<00:01:05.409> well<00:01:05.590> yeah<00:01:05.920> I'm<00:01:06.100> probably<00:01:06.310> just

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
is not as well yeah I'm probably just

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.359 
is not as well yeah I'm probably just
gonna<00:01:06.610> wait<00:01:07.150> for<00:01:07.360> potential<00:01:07.810> locks<00:01:08.369> whenever

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
gonna wait for potential locks whenever

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.179 
gonna wait for potential locks whenever
they<00:01:09.460> come<00:01:09.610> back<00:01:09.790> out<00:01:09.970> and<00:01:10.210> I'm<00:01:11.080> shoot<00:01:12.040> for

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
they come back out and I'm shoot for

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:13.859 
they come back out and I'm shoot for
fifteen<00:01:12.549> percent<00:01:12.790> loss<00:01:12.939> on<00:01:13.119> each<00:01:13.240> because<00:01:13.630> I'm

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
fifteen percent loss on each because I'm

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.570 
fifteen percent loss on each because I'm
running<00:01:14.200> all<00:01:14.350> money<00:01:14.619> in<00:01:14.740> a<00:01:14.799> minute<00:01:15.070> and<00:01:15.280> I

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
running all money in a minute and I

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.890 
running all money in a minute and I
think<00:01:15.640> it's<00:01:15.880> going<00:01:16.000> to<00:01:16.090> be<00:01:16.150> the<00:01:16.299> cheapest<00:01:16.689> and

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
think it's going to be the cheapest and

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.360 
think it's going to be the cheapest and
easiest<00:01:17.100> option

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.740 

I<00:01:20.430> think<00:01:21.090> that's<00:01:21.180> all<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.450> things<00:01:21.630> i'm

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
I think that's all the things i'm

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.950 
I think that's all the things i'm
currently<00:01:21.930> wearing<00:01:23.210> here<00:01:24.210> my<00:01:24.360> decent<00:01:24.750> sky

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
currently wearing here my decent sky

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.480 
currently wearing here my decent sky
lightens<00:01:25.230> because<00:01:25.800> these<00:01:25.980> are<00:01:26.160> kind<00:01:26.460> of

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
lightens because these are kind of

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.550 
lightens because these are kind of
important<00:01:26.850> i<00:01:26.910> guess<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:28.080> starts<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.410> these

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
important i guess the starts of these

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.770 
important i guess the starts of these
are<00:01:28.740> useless<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.400> just<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:30.360> fact<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.630> they

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
are useless is just the fact that they

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.060 
are useless is just the fact that they
have<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.020> little<00:01:31.110> potential<00:01:31.500> lines<00:01:31.800> with

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
have the little potential lines with

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.310 
have the little potential lines with
decent<00:01:32.400> skills<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:33.390> equip<00:01:33.720> these<00:01:33.870> quickly

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
decent skills I just equip these quickly

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.150 
decent skills I just equip these quickly
