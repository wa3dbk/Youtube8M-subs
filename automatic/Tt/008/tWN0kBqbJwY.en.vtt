about<00:00:12.809> three<00:00:13.170> things<00:00:13.380> I'm<00:00:13.650> going<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:13.799> say

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:13.969 
about three things I'm going to say

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.820 
about three things I'm going to say
first<00:00:14.969> one<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.330> heavy<00:00:15.570> weight<00:00:15.780> second<00:00:16.500> one<00:00:16.619> is

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
first one is heavy weight second one is

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.269 
first one is heavy weight second one is
volume<00:00:17.359> last<00:00:18.359> one<00:00:18.630> is<00:00:18.900> stretch<00:00:19.800> squeeze

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
volume last one is stretch squeeze

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.400 
volume last one is stretch squeeze
contraction<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.300> throw<00:00:21.810> pump<00:00:22.109> in<00:00:22.260> there

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
contraction and throw pump in there

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.929 
contraction and throw pump in there
somewhere<00:00:22.680> because<00:00:23.039> you<00:00:23.310> should<00:00:23.460> kind<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.820> get

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
somewhere because you should kind of get

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.670 
somewhere because you should kind of get
a<00:00:24.000> pump<00:00:24.210> with<00:00:24.330> everything<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:25.260> cover<00:00:25.470> those

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
a pump with everything so cover those

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.650 
a pump with everything so cover those
three<00:00:25.920> things<00:00:26.189> let's<00:00:26.730> let's<00:00:27.029> say<00:00:27.150> four<00:00:27.390> things

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
three things let's let's say four things

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.589 
three things let's let's say four things
heavy<00:00:28.410> weight<00:00:28.650> volume<00:00:29.429> stretch<00:00:30.269> squeeze

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
heavy weight volume stretch squeeze

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.560 
heavy weight volume stretch squeeze
contraction<00:00:31.230> pump<00:00:31.940> now<00:00:32.940> obviously<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.480> don't

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
contraction pump now obviously you don't

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.060 
contraction pump now obviously you don't
want<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.809> put<00:00:33.930> those<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.260> certain<00:00:34.530> order<00:00:34.649> I

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
want to put those in a certain order I

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.110 
want to put those in a certain order I
recommend<00:00:35.640> going<00:00:35.880> heavy<00:00:36.210> then<00:00:37.020> doing<00:00:37.320> volume

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
recommend going heavy then doing volume

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.369 
recommend going heavy then doing volume
by<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.329> point<00:00:39.540> we'll<00:00:39.629> have<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.750> pump<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.170> then

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
by that point we'll have a pump and then

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.450 
by that point we'll have a pump and then
get<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.559> stretch<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.890> squeeze<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.399> a

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
get a stretch of squeeze in a

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.150 
get a stretch of squeeze in a
contraction<00:00:42.110> here's<00:00:43.110> an<00:00:43.260> example<00:00:43.590> workout

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
contraction here's an example workout

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.250 
contraction here's an example workout
that<00:00:44.340> I'm<00:00:44.430> talking<00:00:44.640> about<00:00:44.760> now<00:00:45.539> also<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.050> want

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260

that I'm talking about now also you want
to<00:00:46.320> hit<00:00:46.410> biceps<00:00:46.829> from<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.070> few<00:00:47.489> angles<00:00:47.640> but<00:00:48.030> not

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
to hit biceps from a few angles but not

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.090 
to hit biceps from a few angles but not
the<00:00:48.840> angles<00:00:49.110> don't<00:00:49.200> matter<00:00:49.440> too<00:00:49.680> much<00:00:49.710> so

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
the angles don't matter too much so

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.160 
the angles don't matter too much so
here's<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.460> angles<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.850> recommend<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.390> regular

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
here's the angles I recommend a regular

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.010 
here's the angles I recommend a regular

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
the contraction and stuff and if you

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.789 
the contraction and stuff and if you
notice<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.869> kind<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.170> combines<00:01:49.380> everything

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
notice that kind of combines everything

talk about for getting big biceps I
don't<00:02:00.689> think<00:02:00.840> you<00:02:00.930> should<00:02:00.960> just<00:02:01.200> focus<00:02:01.380> on<00:02:01.710> one

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
don't think you should just focus on one

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.719 
don't think you should just focus on one
focusing<00:02:04.049> on<00:02:04.170> one<00:02:04.350> is<00:02:04.469> fine<00:02:04.710> if<00:02:05.189> you<00:02:05.460> got<00:02:05.610> to

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
focusing on one is fine if you got to

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.160 
focusing on one is fine if you got to
change<00:02:06.000> it<00:02:06.240> up<00:02:06.270> if<00:02:06.450> you've<00:02:06.600> always<00:02:06.780> been<00:02:06.990> going

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
change it up if you've always been going

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.050 
change it up if you've always been going
really<00:02:07.740> lightweight<00:02:07.950> high-volume<00:02:08.520> maybe<00:02:08.879> go

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
really lightweight high-volume maybe go

high-volume<00:02:11.310> but<00:02:12.060> in<00:02:12.180> general<00:02:12.569> that's<00:02:12.750> the

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
high-volume but in general that's the

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.940 
high-volume but in general that's the
way<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:13.080> recommend<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.650> train

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
way I recommend to train

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.089 
way I recommend to train
just<00:02:14.580> kind<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:14.819> combined<00:02:15.120> everything<00:02:16.099> works

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
just kind of combined everything works

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.800 
just kind of combined everything works
really<00:02:17.310> well<00:02:17.520> for<00:02:17.760> me<00:02:17.910> it's<00:02:18.209> made<00:02:18.390> my<00:02:18.540> arms

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
really well for me it's made my arms

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.740 
really well for me it's made my arms
grow<00:02:19.019> a<00:02:19.050> lot<00:02:19.379> over<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.680> years<00:02:20.330> it's<00:02:21.330> important

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
grow a lot over the years it's important

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.360 
grow a lot over the years it's important
