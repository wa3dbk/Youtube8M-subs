00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.019 
hey guys I'm back today what I've made
is<00:00:03.170> something<00:00:04.170> awesome<00:00:04.350> I've<00:00:05.160> been<00:00:05.460> wanting

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
is something awesome I've been wanting

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.179 
is something awesome I've been wanting
to<00:00:06.060> do<00:00:06.299> for<00:00:06.330> a<00:00:06.600> very<00:00:06.750> long<00:00:07.319> time

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
to do for a very long time

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.730 
to do for a very long time
and<00:00:08.280> I<00:00:09.150> mean<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.480> very<00:00:09.809> long<00:00:10.050> time<00:00:10.349> probably

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
and I mean a very long time probably

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.459 
and I mean a very long time probably
since<00:00:10.889> one-point-four<00:00:11.820> I<00:00:12.290> could<00:00:13.290> never

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
since one-point-four I could never

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.060 
since one-point-four I could never
figure<00:00:13.740> out<00:00:14.009> how<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.340> do<00:00:14.610> this<00:00:14.790> but<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:16.039> have<00:00:17.039> a

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
figure out how to do this but I have a

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.230 
figure out how to do this but I have a
solution<00:00:17.369> this<00:00:18.210> is<00:00:18.270> clear<00:00:18.900> lag<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:20.119> don't<00:00:21.119> pay

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
solution this is clear lag and don't pay

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.700 
solution this is clear lag and don't pay
any<00:00:21.359> attention<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.930> over<00:00:22.260> there<00:00:22.410> that

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
any attention to that over there that

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.679 
any attention to that over there that
will<00:00:22.800> be<00:00:22.949> in<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.189> later<00:00:23.460> video<00:00:23.609> but<00:00:24.000> it's<00:00:24.420> clear

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
will be in a later video but it's clear

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.509 
will be in a later video but it's clear

but it this does have to do with lava so
let's<00:01:15.689> just<00:01:15.930> hop<00:01:16.080> right<00:01:16.140> into<00:01:16.560> this<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.729> what

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
let's just hop right into this so what

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.550 
let's just hop right into this so what
this<00:01:18.000> is<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:19.229> button<00:01:19.710> when<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.220> press<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.400> a

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
this is is a button when you press it a

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.929 
this is is a button when you press it a
signals<00:01:22.560> redstone<00:01:23.130> which<00:01:23.689> goes<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.900> this<00:01:25.110> and

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
signals redstone which goes to this and

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.399 
signals redstone which goes to this and
what<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.060> will<00:01:27.240> do<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.900> will<00:01:27.960> set<00:01:28.380> a

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
what this will do is this will set a

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.260 
what this will do is this will set a
redstone<00:01:28.799> torch<00:01:29.570> right<00:01:30.770> here<00:01:32.090> let's<00:01:33.090> set<00:01:33.240> a

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
redstone torch right here let's set a

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.469 
redstone torch right here let's set a
redstone<00:01:33.570> torch<00:01:33.659> there<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:35.180> also<00:01:36.180> when<00:01:36.390> you

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
redstone torch there and also when you

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.480 
redstone torch there and also when you
power<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:37.310> it<00:01:38.310> will<00:01:38.610> turn<00:01:38.850> on<00:01:39.030> these<00:01:40.490> which

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
power this it will turn on these which

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.950 
power this it will turn on these which
set<00:01:41.939> block<00:01:42.210> air<00:01:43.850> and<00:01:44.850> I'll<00:01:45.000> show<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.240> where<00:01:45.479> it

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
set block air and I'll show you where it

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.399 
set block air and I'll show you where it
says<00:01:46.200> block<00:01:46.409> air<00:01:46.619> there<00:01:46.950> in<00:01:47.220> there<00:01:48.140> so<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.229> says

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
says block air there in there so it says

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.520 
says block air there in there so it says
block<00:01:49.649> air<00:01:50.640> right<00:01:51.180> here<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.780> then<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.320> sets

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
block air right here and then it sets

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.380 
block air right here and then it sets
air<00:01:52.829> right<00:01:53.220> here<00:01:55.340> so<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.460> deletes<00:01:56.759> both<00:01:57.090> those

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
air right here so it deletes both those

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.899 
air right here so it deletes both those
blocks<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:58.079> then<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.770> places<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.369> redstone

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
blocks and then it places a redstone

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.420 
blocks and then it places a redstone
block<00:02:00.469> right<00:02:02.240> here

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
block right here

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.380 
block right here
so<00:02:05.719> how's<00:02:06.719> work<00:02:06.869> if<00:02:07.550> it's<00:02:08.550> kind<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:08.879> like<00:02:09.060> a

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
so how's work if it's kind of like a

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.350 
so how's work if it's kind of like a
toggle<00:02:10.080> thing<00:02:10.489> every<00:02:11.489> time<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.819> press<00:02:12.090> it

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
toggle thing every time you press it

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.180 
toggle thing every time you press it
it'll<00:02:12.810> turn<00:02:12.989> off<00:02:13.050> and<00:02:13.560> then<00:02:13.650> turn<00:02:13.860> off<00:02:14.040> again

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
it'll turn off and then turn off again

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.410 
it'll turn off and then turn off again
so<00:02:17.190> I'll<00:02:17.430> show<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:17.879> when<00:02:17.970> I<00:02:18.030> press<00:02:18.269> the

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
so I'll show you it when I press the

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.940 
so I'll show you it when I press the
button<00:02:18.450> those<00:02:18.989> two<00:02:19.230> blocks<00:02:19.379> are<00:02:19.620> gonna<00:02:19.709> be

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
button those two blocks are gonna be

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.580 
button those two blocks are gonna be
deleted<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.819> repeater<00:02:21.180> or<00:02:21.930> clock<00:02:22.230> will

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
deleted and the repeater or clock will

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.100 
deleted and the repeater or clock will
turn<00:02:22.800> on<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.670> then<00:02:24.300> it<00:02:24.420> will<00:02:24.510> turn<00:02:24.630> back<00:02:24.900> off

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
turn on and then it will turn back off

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.190 
turn on and then it will turn back off
just<00:02:25.800> like<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.489> then<00:02:26.640> turn<00:02:26.880> off<00:02:27.140> so<00:02:28.140> it

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
just like that and then turn off so it

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.970 
just like that and then turn off so it
will<00:02:28.319> teleport<00:02:28.590> all<00:02:29.209> item<00:02:30.209> entities<00:02:30.870> into<00:02:31.680> the

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
will teleport all item entities into the

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.089 
will teleport all item entities into the
