hundred percent set direction you can go
seventy-five<00:02:07.259> percent<00:02:07.470> that<00:02:07.770> direction

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
seventy-five percent that direction

you think you want to go one hundred

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.120 
you think you want to go one hundred
percent<00:02:12.410> this<00:02:13.410> is<00:02:13.590> more<00:02:13.799> like<00:02:13.829> a<00:02:13.950> hundred

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
percent this is more like a hundred

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.420 
percent this is more like a hundred
percent<00:02:14.310> so<00:02:14.910> it's<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.540> little<00:02:15.660> triple<00:02:16.079> dare

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
percent so it's that little triple dare

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.680 
percent so it's that little triple dare

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.900 
this far with it no where is it he just
rises<00:02:26.100> up<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.519> they're<00:02:27.359> still<00:02:27.750> up<00:02:28.310> he's<00:02:29.310> down

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
rises up and they're still up he's down

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.250 
rises up and they're still up he's down
there<00:02:30.209> still<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.540> reason<00:02:33.690> I<00:02:33.930> didn't<00:02:34.109> want

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
there still and the reason I didn't want

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.160 
there still and the reason I didn't want
to<00:02:34.290> go<00:02:34.470> this<00:02:34.709> far<00:02:34.769> was<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.489> felt<00:02:35.970> like<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.959> was

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
to go this far was it felt like it was

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.129 
to go this far was it felt like it was
suddenly<00:02:38.209> it<00:02:39.209> was<00:02:39.359> suddenly<00:02:39.690> becoming

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:40.139 
suddenly it was suddenly becoming

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:44.629 
suddenly it was suddenly becoming
animation<00:02:41.209> I'm<00:02:42.209> really<00:02:42.600> aware<00:02:42.989> of<00:02:43.310> the<00:02:44.310> point

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:44.639 
animation I'm really aware of the point

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:47.150 
animation I'm really aware of the point
without<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:45.569> I'm<00:02:45.660> drawing<00:02:46.049> when<00:02:46.739> it<00:02:46.889> becomes

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
without that I'm drawing when it becomes

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.910 
without that I'm drawing when it becomes
animation<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:47.970> when<00:02:48.120> is<00:02:48.209> it<00:02:48.389> real<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:49.290> I<00:02:49.680> hit

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
animation and when is it real and I hit

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.550 
animation and when is it real and I hit
I<00:02:50.069> knew<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.340> would<00:02:50.549> work<00:02:50.579> if<00:02:51.030> I<00:02:51.180> if<00:02:52.019> I<00:02:52.170> went<00:02:52.410> back

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
I knew it would work if I if I went back

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.640 
I knew it would work if I if I went back
like<00:02:52.799> this<00:02:53.010> but<00:02:53.569> it<00:02:54.569> was<00:02:54.750> like<00:02:54.959> suddenly<00:02:55.350> the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
like this but it was like suddenly the

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.039 
like this but it was like suddenly the
animators<00:02:56.069> hand<00:02:56.370> became<00:02:56.790> clear<00:02:57.180> through<00:02:57.930> the

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
animators hand became clear through the

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.650 
animators hand became clear through the
theme<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.829> it's<00:02:59.069> any<00:02:59.340> drew<00:02:59.819> this<00:03:00.060> character

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
theme and it's any drew this character

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.620 
theme and it's any drew this character
anticipating<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.680> Bush<00:03:02.280> was<00:03:02.819> gone<00:03:03.090> and

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
anticipating and Bush was gone and

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.289 
anticipating and Bush was gone and
that's<00:03:04.019> just<00:03:04.200> there's<00:03:04.769> a<00:03:04.829> thing<00:03:05.730> that<00:03:05.760> I'm

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
that's just there's a thing that I'm

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:07.970 
that's just there's a thing that I'm
afraid<00:03:06.690> that<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.049> audience<00:03:07.410> at<00:03:07.500> any<00:03:07.590> point<00:03:07.799> is

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
afraid that the audience at any point is

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.220 
afraid that the audience at any point is
going<00:03:08.190> to<00:03:08.370> have<00:03:08.819> that<00:03:09.090> thing<00:03:09.540> broke<00:03:09.840> in<00:03:10.049> there

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
going to have that thing broke in there

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.270 
going to have that thing broke in there
that<00:03:10.380> they<00:03:10.470> don't<00:03:10.620> believe<00:03:10.859> it<00:03:11.010> as<00:03:11.099> much<00:03:11.250> as

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
that they don't believe it as much as

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.150 
that they don't believe it as much as
they<00:03:11.549> could<00:03:11.609> and<00:03:12.090> so<00:03:12.690> I<00:03:12.989> went<00:03:13.500> left<00:03:13.739> with<00:03:14.010> it

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
they could and so I went left with it

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.039 
they could and so I went left with it
that's<00:03:14.700> because<00:03:15.000> it<00:03:15.150> felt<00:03:15.359> like<00:03:15.480> it's<00:03:15.900> more

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
that's because it felt like it's more

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.020 
that's because it felt like it's more
natural<00:03:16.290> hmmm<00:03:16.950> so<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:17.639> know<00:03:17.819> he's<00:03:18.000> still

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
natural hmmm so you know he's still

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.390 
natural hmmm so you know he's still
going<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.540> head<00:03:18.690> this<00:03:18.840> direction<00:03:19.160> rather<00:03:20.160> than

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
going to head this direction rather than

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.700 
going to head this direction rather than
is<00:03:21.000> coming<00:03:21.480> back<00:03:21.660> here<00:03:22.019> no

is coming back here no
I'm<00:03:23.860> always<00:03:24.010> thinking<00:03:24.250> about<00:03:27.570> fine<00:03:28.570> then<00:03:28.930> go

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
I'm always thinking about fine then go

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.630

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.550 
ahead okay well this is another approach
know<00:03:34.060> if<00:03:34.180> it's<00:03:34.360> that<00:03:34.570> probably<00:03:35.230> wouldn't<00:03:35.500> work

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
know if it's that probably wouldn't work

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:45.450 
know if it's that probably wouldn't work
with<00:03:35.890> Oh<00:03:36.540> fine<00:03:37.540> go<00:03:38.290> ahead<00:03:38.320> and<00:03:38.860> yeah<00:03:44.460> okay
