eSATA<00:03:56.160> as<00:03:56.370> well<00:03:56.549> do<00:03:56.910> a<00:03:56.940> LAN<00:03:57.329> which<00:03:57.750> is<00:03:57.900> very

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
eSATA as well do a LAN which is very

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.360 
eSATA as well do a LAN which is very
nice<00:03:58.230> a<00:03:58.290> lot<00:03:58.500> of<00:03:58.620> boards<00:03:58.829> come<00:03:59.069> with<00:03:59.220> that

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
nice a lot of boards come with that

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.970 
nice a lot of boards come with that
these<00:03:59.549> days<00:03:59.790> and<00:04:00.060> of<00:04:00.810> course<00:04:01.109> your<00:04:01.319> HD<00:04:01.769> audio

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
these days and of course your HD audio

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.300 
these days and of course your HD audio
at<00:04:02.459> the<00:04:02.549> back<00:04:03.260> ok<00:04:04.260> so<00:04:04.650> pretty<00:04:04.889> complete

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
at the back ok so pretty complete

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.729 
at the back ok so pretty complete
looking<00:04:06.269> so<00:04:06.419> far<00:04:06.629> let's<00:04:07.049> look<00:04:07.500> at<00:04:07.590> some

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
looking so far let's look at some

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.800 
looking so far let's look at some
overclocking<00:04:08.430> how<00:04:08.819> can<00:04:09.030> we<00:04:09.120> overclock<00:04:09.480> well

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
overclocking how can we overclock well

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.780 
overclocking how can we overclock well
this<00:04:10.709> is<00:04:10.859> my<00:04:10.980> test<00:04:11.280> system<00:04:11.549> that<00:04:11.669> I'm<00:04:11.760> using

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
this is my test system that I'm using

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.930 
this is my test system that I'm using
today<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.480> Core<00:04:12.690> i5<00:04:12.720> 750<00:04:13.530> CPU<00:04:14.129> that's<00:04:14.370> default

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
today the Core i5 750 CPU that's default

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:19.460 
today the Core i5 750 CPU that's default
2.6<00:04:15.660> gigahertz<00:04:15.989> ok<00:04:16.949> got<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.699> HD<00:04:18.479> 48<00:04:18.900> 90s<00:04:19.289> and

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
2.6 gigahertz ok got to HD 48 90s and

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.979 
2.6 gigahertz ok got to HD 48 90s and
crossfire<00:04:19.979> on<00:04:20.220> here<00:04:20.549> this<00:04:21.209> is<00:04:21.449> the<00:04:21.780> default

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
crossfire on here this is the default

crossfire on here this is the default
without<00:04:22.560> me<00:04:22.710> overclocking<00:04:23.460> nothing<00:04:23.969> ok<00:04:24.510> so

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
without me overclocking nothing ok so

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.950 
without me overclocking nothing ok so
it's<00:04:24.840> just<00:04:25.340> installed<00:04:26.340> and<00:04:26.640> ready<00:04:27.210> to<00:04:27.300> go<00:04:27.539> on

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
it's just installed and ready to go on

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.379 
it's just installed and ready to go on
ms:i<00:04:28.470> board<00:04:28.800> and<00:04:29.039> i<00:04:29.580> have<00:04:29.850> not<00:04:30.000> touched

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
ms:i board and i have not touched

ms:i board and i have not touched
anything<00:04:31.020> in<00:04:31.229> the<00:04:31.350> bias<00:04:31.530> I<00:04:31.800> did<00:04:31.949> not<00:04:32.069> do

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
anything in the bias I did not do

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.550 
anything in the bias I did not do
anything<00:04:32.580> to<00:04:32.759> the<00:04:33.000> system<00:04:33.389> its<00:04:34.020> reading<00:04:34.440> it

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
anything to the system its reading it

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.550 
anything to the system its reading it
nicely<00:04:34.789> those<00:04:35.789> are<00:04:36.060> the<00:04:36.240> values<00:04:36.360> that's<00:04:37.169> the

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
nicely those are the values that's the

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.100 
nicely those are the values that's the
memory<00:04:37.770> settings<00:04:38.190> and<00:04:38.599> now<00:04:39.599> we're<00:04:39.750> gonna<00:04:39.870> go

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
memory settings and now we're gonna go

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.650 
memory settings and now we're gonna go
to<00:04:40.349> do<00:04:40.590> some<00:04:40.800> overclocking<00:04:41.580> and<00:04:41.759> see<00:04:42.479> if<00:04:42.539> we

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
to do some overclocking and see if we

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.320 
to do some overclocking and see if we
can<00:04:42.840> basically<00:04:43.590> bump<00:04:44.220> this<00:04:44.370> up<00:04:44.580> a<00:04:44.729> level<00:04:44.880> and

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
can basically bump this up a level and

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.330 
can basically bump this up a level and
bring<00:04:45.569> it<00:04:45.690> up<00:04:45.810> the<00:04:45.960> over<00:04:46.680> the<00:04:46.800> three<00:04:47.009> gigahertz

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
bring it up the over the three gigahertz

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.480 
bring it up the over the three gigahertz
or<00:04:47.880> even<00:04:48.090> four<00:04:48.300> gigahertz<00:04:48.599> so<00:04:49.380> next<00:04:50.160> thing<00:04:50.370> to

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
or even four gigahertz so next thing to

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.969 
or even four gigahertz so next thing to
do<00:04:50.639> here<00:04:51.030> is<00:04:51.120> to<00:04:51.690> press<00:04:52.020> that<00:04:52.169> overclocking

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
do here is to press that overclocking

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:54.439 
do here is to press that overclocking
genie<00:04:53.250> button<00:04:53.610> so<00:04:53.789> remember<00:04:54.180> when<00:04:54.330> the

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
genie button so remember when the

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.089 
genie button so remember when the
machine<00:04:54.720> was<00:04:54.840> off<00:04:55.020> you<00:04:55.199> press<00:04:55.440> it<00:04:55.650> you<00:04:55.680> boot<00:04:55.979> up

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
machine was off you press it you boot up

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:58.339 
machine was off you press it you boot up
your<00:04:56.250> machine<00:04:56.580> it<00:04:56.819> automatically<00:04:57.810> calculates

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
your machine it automatically calculates

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:01.219 
your machine it automatically calculates
all<00:04:58.560> the<00:04:58.710> voltages<00:04:59.250> bus<00:04:59.550> speeds<00:05:00.199> everything

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
all the voltages bus speeds everything

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:04.010 
all the voltages bus speeds everything
and<00:05:01.759> 3.3<00:05:02.759> Giga<00:05:03.000> Hertz<00:05:03.270> is<00:05:03.419> what<00:05:03.599> it<00:05:03.690> gave<00:05:03.870> me

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
and 3.3 Giga Hertz is what it gave me

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.779 
and 3.3 Giga Hertz is what it gave me
just<00:05:04.289> like<00:05:04.500> that<00:05:04.530> okay<00:05:05.190> without<00:05:05.310> me<00:05:05.490> doing

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:05.789 
just like that okay without me doing

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:08.060 
just like that okay without me doing
nothing<00:05:06.150> it<00:05:06.750> has<00:05:06.990> a<00:05:07.020> chipset<00:05:07.620> on<00:05:07.770> the

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
nothing it has a chipset on the

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.339 
nothing it has a chipset on the
motherboard<00:05:08.340> that<00:05:08.759> does<00:05:09.210> all<00:05:09.419> that<00:05:09.810> the

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:10.349 
motherboard that does all that the

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:13.129 
motherboard that does all that the
overclocking<00:05:11.160> calculations<00:05:11.849> for<00:05:12.150> you<00:05:12.330> and

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
overclocking calculations for you and

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.680 
overclocking calculations for you and
then<00:05:13.410> just<00:05:13.650> that's<00:05:14.160> it<00:05:14.400> sets<00:05:15.180> it<00:05:15.300> up<00:05:15.360> for<00:05:15.599> you

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
then just that's it sets it up for you

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.120 
then just that's it sets it up for you
then<00:05:15.810> you<00:05:15.870> can<00:05:15.900> save<00:05:16.229> the<00:05:16.440> settings<00:05:16.979> in<00:05:17.099> your

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
then you can save the settings in your

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.640 
then you can save the settings in your
bias<00:05:17.430> and<00:05:17.759> you're<00:05:17.849> done<00:05:18.060> there<00:05:18.780> you<00:05:18.900> go<00:05:19.080> okay

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
bias and you're done there you go okay

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.649 
bias and you're done there you go okay
so<00:05:19.710> Northbridge<00:05:20.310> frequencies<00:05:21.150> that's<00:05:21.449> the

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:21.659 
so Northbridge frequencies that's the

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:23.540 
so Northbridge frequencies that's the

memory timings everything it adjusted by
itself<00:05:23.880> I<00:05:24.150> didn't<00:05:24.690> do<00:05:24.780> anything<00:05:24.990> okay<00:05:25.349> that's

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
itself I didn't do anything okay that's

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:28.399 
itself I didn't do anything okay that's
the<00:05:26.159> the<00:05:26.669> easiest<00:05:27.199> overclocking<00:05:28.199> that<00:05:28.319> I've

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:28.409 
the the easiest overclocking that I've

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:30.200 
the the easiest overclocking that I've
ever<00:05:28.590> done<00:05:28.800> before<00:05:29.009> then<00:05:29.669> of<00:05:29.819> course<00:05:30.060> you've

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
ever done before then of course you've

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:31.790 
ever done before then of course you've
got<00:05:30.240> the<00:05:30.479> direct<00:05:30.810> base<00:05:31.050> overclock<00:05:31.530> remember

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
got the direct base overclock remember

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.350 
got the direct base overclock remember

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.980 
bus speed and I've increased it from 133
megahertz<00:05:43.500> to<00:05:43.979> 197<00:05:44.849> okay<00:05:45.419> already

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
megahertz to 197 okay already

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.180 
megahertz to 197 okay already
it<00:05:46.139> took<00:05:46.259> me<00:05:46.409> a<00:05:46.440> while<00:05:46.590> to<00:05:46.650> I<00:05:46.770> have<00:05:46.919> to<00:05:46.949> keep

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190 
it took me a while to I have to keep

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.680 
it took me a while to I have to keep
pressing<00:05:47.460> it<00:05:47.699> and<00:05:47.880> now<00:05:48.150> I'm<00:05:48.270> pressing<00:05:48.479> it

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
pressing it and now I'm pressing it

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:50.689 
pressing it and now I'm pressing it
again<00:05:48.990> okay<00:05:49.289> so<00:05:49.349> slowly<00:05:50.039> here<00:05:50.310> and<00:05:50.400> pressing

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 
again okay so slowly here and pressing

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:52.219 
again okay so slowly here and pressing
it<00:05:50.789> again<00:05:51.030> as<00:05:51.240> you<00:05:51.539> can<00:05:51.659> see<00:05:51.810> it's<00:05:51.930> increasing

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
it again as you can see it's increasing

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:55.999 
it again as you can see it's increasing
the<00:05:52.639> 202<00:05:53.639> 10<00:05:53.940> to<00:05:54.630> 11<00:05:55.110> in<00:05:55.199> each<00:05:55.349> you<00:05:55.650> can<00:05:55.830> just

00:05:55.999 --> 00:05:56.009 
the 202 10 to 11 in each you can just

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:57.649 
the 202 10 to 11 in each you can just
keep<00:05:56.130> going<00:05:56.190> until<00:05:56.639> your<00:05:56.880> machine<00:05:57.150> locks<00:05:57.389> up

00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:57.659 
keep going until your machine locks up

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:59.870 
keep going until your machine locks up
of<00:05:57.840> course<00:05:58.110> or<00:05:58.349> you<00:05:58.889> can<00:05:58.919> pause<00:05:59.280> and<00:05:59.310> then<00:05:59.669> and

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
of course or you can pause and then and

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.969 
of course or you can pause and then and
then<00:06:00.150> run<00:06:00.389> some<00:06:00.419> stress<00:06:01.409> testing<00:06:01.800> some

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:01.979 
then run some stress testing some

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:03.649 
then run some stress testing some
torture<00:06:02.340> testing<00:06:02.699> on<00:06:02.880> this<00:06:03.090> and<00:06:03.270> see<00:06:03.419> if<00:06:03.539> it's

00:06:03.649 --> 00:06:03.659 
torture testing on this and see if it's

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:06.560 
torture testing on this and see if it's
stable<00:06:03.870> or<00:06:04.139> not<00:06:04.199> right<00:06:04.530> so<00:06:04.770> there<00:06:05.400> you<00:06:05.520> go<00:06:05.699> very

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570 
stable or not right so there you go very

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.219 
stable or not right so there you go very
cool<00:06:07.020> way<00:06:07.380> of<00:06:07.620> overclocking<00:06:08.130> on<00:06:08.669> the<00:06:09.330> fly<00:06:09.570> then

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:10.229 
cool way of overclocking on the fly then

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:11.570 
cool way of overclocking on the fly then
of<00:06:10.409> course<00:06:10.650> there's<00:06:10.889> the<00:06:11.009> regular<00:06:11.159> bias

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
of course there's the regular bias

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.249 
of course there's the regular bias
overclocking<00:06:12.389> right<00:06:12.509> you<00:06:12.599> go<00:06:12.719> into<00:06:12.900> your<00:06:12.990> bias

00:06:13.249 --> 00:06:13.259 
overclocking right you go into your bias

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:15.439 
overclocking right you go into your bias
settings<00:06:13.650> and<00:06:13.860> you<00:06:14.370> adjust<00:06:14.759> the<00:06:14.940> base<00:06:15.120> clock

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
settings and you adjust the base clock

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:16.999 
settings and you adjust the base clock
you're<00:06:15.690> just<00:06:15.900> a<00:06:16.020> multiplier<00:06:16.530> and<00:06:16.560> that's<00:06:16.860> what

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:17.009 
you're just a multiplier and that's what

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:19.089 
you're just a multiplier and that's what
I<00:06:17.070> did<00:06:17.250> I<00:06:17.280> put<00:06:17.789> the<00:06:17.909> multiplier<00:06:18.330> up<00:06:18.419> to<00:06:18.539> 21

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:19.099 
I did I put the multiplier up to 21

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:23.719 
I did I put the multiplier up to 21
increase<00:06:20.099> the<00:06:20.330> the<00:06:21.830> bus<00:06:22.830> speed<00:06:23.159> and<00:06:23.430> there<00:06:23.639> you

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:23.729 
increase the the bus speed and there you

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:26.870 
increase the the bus speed and there you
go<00:06:23.880> 4<00:06:24.180> gigahertz<00:06:24.419> ok<00:06:25.169> stable<00:06:25.680> okay<00:06:26.610> I'll<00:06:26.759> make

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
go 4 gigahertz ok stable okay I'll make

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.149 
go 4 gigahertz ok stable okay I'll make
a<00:06:26.940> separate<00:06:27.330> video<00:06:27.419> about<00:06:27.599> the<00:06:27.870> core<00:06:28.080> i5<00:06:28.229> 750

00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:29.159 
a separate video about the core i5 750
