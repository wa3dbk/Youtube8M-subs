 45 g melted butter and finally 100 g 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.970

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.270
 think but you are many to 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.190
 like that so I took a bowl for 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.070
 do my little mixture I took a 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.450
 whip that I found at alia's if that 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.790
 interests me a weight and life batteries 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.070
 like that and I took my mag 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.050

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.390
 the tree is so we will mix all 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:59.710
 dry ingredients to comment on the 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:59.710
 flour cocoa sugar 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.950
 then you see sing 9 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.750
 eastern girl 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.310
 and butter 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.580
 then we add the spread 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.930
 that they see us all added the 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:51.519
 dough is finished so when this one 10 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.239
 to pour in two cups or four 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.900
 small cups 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:03:03.879
 I opted for sizes and 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:06.459
 cook one minute thirty to 653 so 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.590
 here I am already going to fill my guy and I 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.530
 find right after that so here I am 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.120
 half of the dough in my guy so 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.930
 never of that in the microwave and I you 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.930
 find for the result 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.980
 so here I was leaving a middle of 30 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.410
 so not if you see a little bit of that 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.460
 give be to the air not bad 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:40.950
 it smells very good so I will taste and 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:42.180
 of course give you my opinion so here is 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.920
 I listened well so I wanted you 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.440
 show the texture of the cake I not so 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.000
 you will realize but it's 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.040
 a texture that is soft but 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.880
 which is very hard I think that if he 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.990
 wanted something more basic 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.320
 you have to leave it for me 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.850
 microphone 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.250
 so there's a chocolate mellow 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.700
 do not know that the taste of such a the 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.490
 kind 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.490
 a lot of chocolate cake 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.860
 that's pretty cool and that's not 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:07.410
 against especially the taste of the dough to 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.760
 spread that I was going into me but 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.370
 here it is fast enough and I find it 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.050
 very good so here I have certainly the video 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.880
 you liked me I continued to eat the 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.750
 cake and I make you combine I 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.750
