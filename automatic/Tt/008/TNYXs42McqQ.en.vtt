00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
okay I'm going to show how to lubricate

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.509 
okay I'm going to show how to lubricate
your<00:00:06.870> motors<00:00:08.840> basically<00:00:09.889> so<00:00:10.889> here<00:00:11.219> we<00:00:11.340> have<00:00:11.490> a

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
your motors basically so here we have a

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.930 
your motors basically so here we have a
GoPro<00:00:12.150> vision<00:00:15.320> -<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.619> vision<00:00:16.800> rather<00:00:17.460> just

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
GoPro vision - a vision rather just

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:27.690 
GoPro vision - a vision rather just
plain<00:00:18.359> vision<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:22.580> near<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.760> sound

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:27.700 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.770 

little<00:00:28.360> grinding<00:00:28.900> grinding<00:00:29.890> sound<00:00:30.780> okay

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:31.780 
little grinding grinding sound okay

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
you can you can get it online and you

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.150 
you can you can get it online and you
can<00:00:55.030> you<00:00:55.330> can<00:00:55.360> get<00:00:55.660> to<00:00:55.840> the<00:00:55.989> the<00:00:56.500> bearings<00:00:56.920> on

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
can you can get to the the bearings on

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.850 
can you can get to the the bearings on
the<00:00:57.700> top<00:00:58.140> no<00:00:59.140> problem

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
the top no problem

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.710 
the top no problem
put<00:01:00.370> a<00:01:00.400> little<00:01:00.579> drop<00:01:00.820> there<00:01:01.650> right<00:01:02.650> on<00:01:02.800> the<00:01:02.920> top

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
put a little drop there right on the top

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.210 
put a little drop there right on the top
but<00:01:04.720> you<00:01:04.930> can<00:01:05.170> you<00:01:05.560> can't<00:01:05.830> get<00:01:05.979> to<00:01:06.100> the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
but you can you can't get to the

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.830 
but you can you can't get to the
bearings<00:01:06.610> on<00:01:06.820> the<00:01:06.850> bottom<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.950> what<00:01:09.490> do<00:01:09.550> we<00:01:09.640> do

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
bearings on the bottom so what do we do

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.810 
bearings on the bottom so what do we do
so<00:01:10.840> I'm<00:01:11.770> going<00:01:11.950> to<00:01:12.009> show<00:01:12.190> you<00:01:12.250> how<00:01:12.430> to<00:01:12.550> do<00:01:12.700> it

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
so I'm going to show you how to do it

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.510 
so I'm going to show you how to do it
I'm<00:01:13.450> going<00:01:13.720> to<00:01:13.810> drill<00:01:13.990> a<00:01:14.020> small<00:01:14.290> hole<00:01:14.520> eighth

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
I'm going to drill a small hole eighth

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.080 
I'm going to drill a small hole eighth
of<00:01:15.790> an<00:01:15.910> inch<00:01:16.290> right<00:01:17.290> in<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:17.800> middle<00:01:18.009> of<00:01:19.560> the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
of an inch right in the middle of the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:28.650 
of an inch right in the middle of the
motor<00:01:22.090> and<00:01:22.770> if<00:01:23.770> I<00:01:23.890> do<00:01:23.950> it<00:01:24.190> right<00:01:24.430> I<00:01:27.630> should<00:01:28.630> have

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
motor and if I do it right I should have

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.850 
motor and if I do it right I should have
the<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:31.080> the<00:01:32.080> bearing<00:01:32.470> right<00:01:32.650> under<00:01:32.950> it<00:01:33.240> so

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
the the the bearing right under it so

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.230 
the the the bearing right under it so
let's<00:01:35.860> see<00:01:36.100> if<00:01:36.159> we<00:01:36.280> got<00:01:36.460> that<00:01:36.700> done<00:01:37.030> the

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
let's see if we got that done the

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.780 
let's see if we got that done the
picture<00:01:37.920> there<00:01:38.920> I<00:01:39.130> just<00:01:39.430> drilled<00:01:39.670> a<00:01:39.760> hole

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
picture there I just drilled a hole

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.370 
picture there I just drilled a hole
there<00:01:40.120> I<00:01:40.150> don't<00:01:40.330> know<00:01:40.510> if<00:01:40.630> you<00:01:40.750> slender<00:01:41.140> drill

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
there I don't know if you slender drill

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:48.480 
there I don't know if you slender drill
it<00:01:41.820> I'll<00:01:42.820> drill<00:01:43.119> another<00:01:43.390> one<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:47.159> just<00:01:48.159> pick

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
it I'll drill another one so just pick

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.609 
it I'll drill another one so just pick
the<00:01:48.640> middle

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.029 

that's<00:01:55.619> it

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
that's it

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.840 
that's it
eighth<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.969> an<00:01:57.060> inch<00:01:57.210> hole<00:01:58.520> now<00:01:59.520> what<00:01:59.700> am<00:01:59.789> I

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
eighth of an inch hole now what am I

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.700 
eighth of an inch hole now what am I
going<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.030> do<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.420> say<00:02:00.630> well<00:02:01.380> all<00:02:01.560> the

going to do you say well all the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.660 
going to do you say well all the
dirt<00:02:01.890> will<00:02:02.009> get<00:02:02.159> in<00:02:02.280> there

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
dirt will get in there

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.180 
dirt will get in there
so<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.750> actually<00:02:04.079> bought<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:05.630> couple<00:02:06.630> little<00:02:07.190> 1/8

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
so I actually bought a couple little 1/8

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:18.380 
so I actually bought a couple little 1/8
inch<00:02:09.200> let<00:02:10.200> me<00:02:10.289> get<00:02:10.470> this<00:02:13.849> 1/8<00:02:14.849> inch<00:02:17.030> let's<00:02:18.030> see

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
inch let me get this 1/8 inch let's see

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.229 
inch let me get this 1/8 inch let's see
if<00:02:18.510> you<00:02:18.629> can<00:02:18.750> see<00:02:18.959> these<00:02:19.140> things<00:02:19.940> slug<00:02:20.940> which

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
if you can see these things slug which

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.270 
if you can see these things slug which
should<00:02:21.480> plug<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.080> up<00:02:22.319> that<00:02:22.560> hole<00:02:22.830> when<00:02:23.160> I'm

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
should plug it up that hole when I'm

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.890 
should plug it up that hole when I'm
done<00:02:24.860> there<00:02:25.860> we<00:02:26.010> go

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
done there we go

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.250 
done there we go
plugs<00:02:27.900> it<00:02:28.049> right<00:02:28.230> up<00:02:28.410> so<00:02:29.299> take<00:02:30.299> it<00:02:30.420> out<00:02:30.540> next

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
plugs it right up so take it out next

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.900 
plugs it right up so take it out next
time<00:02:31.410> you<00:02:31.500> want<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:31.709> oil<00:02:31.769> it<00:02:32.010> every<00:02:32.250> 10<00:02:32.489> flights

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
time you want to oil it every 10 flights

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.190 
time you want to oil it every 10 flights
or<00:02:33.209> so<00:02:33.590> so<00:02:34.590> that's<00:02:34.739> my<00:02:34.980> little<00:02:35.250> plan<00:02:35.549> and<00:02:36.450> I'm

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
or so so that's my little plan and I'm

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:46.430 
or so so that's my little plan and I'm
going<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.440> stick<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.829> it<00:02:44.989> okay<00:02:45.989> I'm<00:02:46.170> going<00:02:46.349> to

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
going to stick to it okay I'm going to

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.089 
going to stick to it okay I'm going to
drill<00:02:46.739> another<00:02:47.549> hole<00:02:50.150> where<00:02:51.150> I<00:02:51.209> got<00:02:51.390> one<00:02:51.599> there

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
drill another hole where I got one there

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:58.879 
drill another hole where I got one there
one<00:02:53.099> there<00:02:53.329> drill<00:02:54.329> a<00:02:54.360> hole<00:02:54.540> right<00:02:54.569> here<00:02:57.739> get<00:02:58.739> it

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889 
one there drill a hole right here get it

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:03.770 
one there drill a hole right here get it
right<00:02:59.069> in<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.220> middle<00:03:01.970> that's<00:03:02.970> it<00:03:03.269> it's

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
right in the middle that's it it's

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.069 
right in the middle that's it it's
simple<00:03:04.079> enough<00:03:05.209> not<00:03:06.209> exactly<00:03:06.690> in<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.900> middle

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
simple enough not exactly in the middle

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.390 
simple enough not exactly in the middle
but<00:03:07.350> it's<00:03:07.440> close<00:03:07.680> enough<00:03:07.709> because<00:03:08.250> the

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
but it's close enough because the

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.300 
but it's close enough because the
bearing<00:03:08.760> actually<00:03:09.889> it's<00:03:10.889> going<00:03:11.040> to<00:03:11.130> run<00:03:11.280> over

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
bearing actually it's going to run over

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.800 
bearing actually it's going to run over

so<00:03:16.340> I've<00:03:17.340> drilled<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:17.790> four<00:03:18.060> holes<00:03:18.359> and<00:03:18.750> I

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
so I've drilled the four holes and I

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.990 
so I've drilled the four holes and I
bought<00:03:19.859> the<00:03:20.100> little<00:03:21.139> the<00:03:22.139> little<00:03:23.000> plugs

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
bought the little the little plugs

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.569 
bought the little the little plugs
eighth<00:03:24.359> inch<00:03:24.660> plugs<00:03:25.079> I<00:03:25.410> remember<00:03:26.370> where<00:03:26.489> I<00:03:26.549> got

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
eighth inch plugs I remember where I got

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:31.309 
eighth inch plugs I remember where I got
them<00:03:27.109> online<00:03:28.109> somewhere<00:03:28.970> but<00:03:29.970> they<00:03:30.870> came<00:03:31.139> in

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
black just to color code it okay okay so

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.870 
black just to color code it okay okay so
now<00:03:45.090> I'm<00:03:45.239> going<00:03:45.419> to<00:03:45.480> oil<00:03:45.510> it<00:03:46.519> I'm<00:03:47.519> going<00:03:47.700> to<00:03:47.730> get

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
now I'm going to oil it I'm going to get

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.580 
now I'm going to oil it I'm going to get
my<00:03:48.829> magnifying<00:03:49.829> glass<00:03:49.950> on<00:03:50.840> so<00:03:51.840> I<00:03:51.870> can<00:03:52.169> see<00:03:52.410> real

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
my magnifying glass on so I can see real

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.220 
my magnifying glass on so I can see real
well

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.600

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
I'm going to put it one drop in there

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:13.660 
I'm going to put it one drop in there
and<00:04:02.770> one<00:04:03.770> drop<00:04:04.100> in<00:04:04.400> there<00:04:07.330> one<00:04:08.330> drop<00:04:12.400> one<00:04:13.400> drop

and one drop in there one drop one drop

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:22.990 
and one drop in there one drop one drop
in<00:04:14.000> there<00:04:17.709> we'll<00:04:18.709> go<00:04:19.180> counterclockwise<00:04:22.000> one

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
in there we'll go counterclockwise one

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.670 
in there we'll go counterclockwise one
drop<00:04:23.300> there<00:04:24.940> one<00:04:25.940> drop<00:04:26.300> there<00:04:29.500> okay

drop there one drop there okay
so<00:04:30.950> now<00:04:31.190> we<00:04:31.250> got<00:04:31.520> the<00:04:33.760> oil<00:04:34.760> on<00:04:35.090> the<00:04:35.210> bearings

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
so now we got the oil on the bearings

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.340 
so now we got the oil on the bearings
and<00:04:37.040> we're<00:04:37.580> going<00:04:37.700> to<00:04:37.760> go<00:04:37.910> back<00:04:38.150> well<00:04:39.110> let<00:04:39.260> me

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
and we're going to go back well let me

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.380 
and we're going to go back well let me
put<00:04:39.530> the<00:04:39.650> little<00:04:39.830> holes<00:04:40.100> in<00:04:40.400> the<00:04:40.430> little<00:04:41.060> plugs

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
put the little holes in the little plugs

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:51.409 
put the little holes in the little plugs
in<00:04:41.660> them

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.040 

there's<00:04:52.020> a<00:04:52.139> little<00:04:52.289> plug<00:04:53.509> and<00:04:54.509> the<00:04:54.750> rest<00:04:54.930> you

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590 
see I've got the the little plugs in a

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.640 
see I've got the the little plugs in a
little<00:05:02.129> black<00:05:02.370> one<00:05:02.610> there<00:05:03.319> clear<00:05:04.319> one<00:05:04.500> they

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
little black one there clear one they

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.580 
little black one there clear one they
are<00:05:04.770> white<00:05:05.069> one<00:05:05.280> and<00:05:06.180> so<00:05:06.389> forth<00:05:06.659> now<00:05:06.870> we're

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
are white one and so forth now we're

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.309 
are white one and so forth now we're
going<00:05:07.710> to<00:05:07.770> see<00:05:07.979> if<00:05:08.069> it<00:05:08.189> makes<00:05:08.340> any<00:05:08.550> sound<00:05:09.319> okay

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:10.319 
going to see if it makes any sound okay

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:14.209 
going to see if it makes any sound okay
now<00:05:10.830> we've<00:05:11.099> got<00:05:11.340> the<00:05:12.349> motor<00:05:13.349> back<00:05:13.500> up<00:05:13.919> there

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:14.219 
now we've got the motor back up there

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:16.490 
now we've got the motor back up there
notice<00:05:14.460> there's<00:05:14.849> no<00:05:15.030> sound<00:05:15.360> no<00:05:15.870> sound<00:05:15.900> at<00:05:16.319> all

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.540 
notice there's no sound no sound at all
oh<00:05:17.030> I<00:05:18.030> guess<00:05:18.449> I<00:05:18.599> couldn't<00:05:18.840> turn<00:05:18.990> on<00:05:19.050> the<00:05:19.259> motors

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
oh I guess I couldn't turn on the motors

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:36.040 
oh I guess I couldn't turn on the motors
okay<00:05:20.840> there's<00:05:21.840> the<00:05:21.960> motors<00:05:28.699> no<00:05:29.699> more<00:05:29.939> grinding

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.159 

no<00:05:37.050> more<00:05:37.229> grinding<00:05:37.849> so<00:05:38.849> the<00:05:39.089> high<00:05:39.659> speed<00:05:39.959> motor

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
no more grinding so the high speed motor

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:42.760 
no more grinding so the high speed motor
oil<00:05:40.439> definitely<00:05:40.919> made<00:05:41.129> a<00:05:41.159> difference

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
oil definitely made a difference

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.189 
oil definitely made a difference
okay<00:05:43.770> now<00:05:43.979> I've<00:05:44.159> put<00:05:44.520> the<00:05:44.819> propellers<00:05:45.689> on<00:05:45.959> the

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 
okay now I've put the propellers on the

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:49.850 
okay now I've put the propellers on the
drum<00:05:47.039> and<00:05:47.639> I've<00:05:48.449> waited<00:05:48.749> it<00:05:49.020> down<00:05:49.259> with<00:05:49.529> some

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
drum and I've waited it down with some

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.540 
drum and I've waited it down with some
scuba<00:05:50.339> weights<00:05:51.469> so<00:05:52.469> you<00:05:52.559> can<00:05:52.830> hear<00:05:53.069> the<00:05:53.219> sound

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
scuba weights so you can hear the sound

00:05:53.550 --> 00:06:09.499 
scuba weights so you can hear the sound
of<00:05:53.789> the<00:05:53.969> motors<00:05:54.300> now<00:06:02.240> very<00:06:03.240> smooth<00:06:08.419> trying<00:06:09.419> to

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:09.509 
of the motors now very smooth trying to

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:11.359 
of the motors now very smooth trying to
burn<00:06:09.689> down<00:06:09.719> a<00:06:09.959> little<00:06:10.169> battery<00:06:10.619> too<00:06:10.860> so<00:06:11.099> that<00:06:11.249> I

00:06:11.359 --> 00:06:11.369 
burn down a little battery too so that I

00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:18.639 
burn down a little battery too so that I
can<00:06:12.499> charge<00:06:13.499> it<00:06:13.649> up<00:06:13.800> full<00:06:16.249> anyway<00:06:17.249> that's<00:06:17.519> my

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:18.649 
can charge it up full anyway that's my

00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:24.110 
can charge it up full anyway that's my
suggestion<00:06:19.649> for<00:06:20.719> grinding<00:06:21.719> motors
