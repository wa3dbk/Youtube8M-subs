00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
you can if you can't do this

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.929 
you can if you can't do this
go<00:01:16.659> like<00:01:16.840> this<00:01:17.320> and<00:01:17.439> because<00:01:18.040> you<00:01:18.189> guys<00:01:18.369> are

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
go like this and because you guys are

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.240 
go like this and because you guys are
hard<00:01:19.149> so<00:01:19.570> basically<00:01:19.900> if<00:01:20.500> you're<00:01:20.650> guessing<00:01:21.010> for

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
hard so basically if you're guessing for

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.620 
hard so basically if you're guessing for
the<00:01:21.310> first<00:01:21.490> time<00:01:21.700> or<00:01:21.909> like<00:01:22.060> what<00:01:22.270> I<00:01:22.300> learn<00:01:22.479> how

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
the first time or like what I learn how

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.330 
the first time or like what I learn how
to<00:01:22.659> do<00:01:22.810> stuff<00:01:22.870> with<00:01:23.229> first<00:01:23.560> time<00:01:23.740> right<00:01:24.010> I

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
to do stuff with first time right I

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.450 
to do stuff with first time right I
guess<00:01:25.030> can<00:01:25.270> go<00:01:25.390> flat<00:01:25.630> handed<00:01:26.020> but<00:01:26.860> keep<00:01:27.340> in

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
guess can go flat handed but keep in

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.670 
guess can go flat handed but keep in
mind<00:01:27.490> that<00:01:27.850> eventually<00:01:28.270> you<00:01:28.720> will<00:01:28.900> have<00:01:29.140> to<00:01:29.440> go

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
mind that eventually you will have to go

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:36.840 
mind that eventually you will have to go
higher<00:01:29.890> like<00:01:30.460> this<00:01:33.900> get<00:01:34.900> into<00:01:35.140> some<00:01:36.130> push-up

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
higher like this get into some push-up

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.180 
higher like this get into some push-up
position

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:41.190 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.080 

okay<00:01:42.360> I'm<00:01:43.360> doing<00:01:43.810> clock<00:01:44.590> life<00:01:44.830> so<00:01:45.640> my<00:01:45.880> first

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
okay I'm doing clock life so my first

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.580 
okay I'm doing clock life so my first
one<00:01:46.510> I'll<00:01:46.750> move<00:01:47.049> is<00:01:47.260> my<00:01:47.700> right<00:01:48.700> butt<00:01:49.150> so<00:01:49.930> the

one I'll move is my right butt so the

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.070 
one I'll move is my right butt so the
right<00:01:50.770> hook<00:01:50.950> should<00:01:51.220> go<00:01:51.369> underneath<00:01:51.790> your<00:01:52.080> or

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
right hook should go underneath your or

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
hard is one to that to that you're going

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.050 
hard is one to that to that you're going
to<00:02:26.970> move<00:02:27.090> your<00:02:27.150> right<00:02:28.020> leg<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.950> over<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.880> your

right hand is three three should look

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.210 
right hand is three three should look
like<00:02:35.040> this<00:02:35.340> then<00:02:36.620> you<00:02:37.620> can<00:02:37.740> move<00:02:37.890> your<00:02:38.040> left
