 one that is that outside and another that is 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.049
 inside the folder we're going to 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.940

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:28.099
 folder obviously you can do the 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.620
 backing of the original theme we are going to give 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:33.739

 obviously you can search 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.620
 the route that you like and here we are going to 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.660

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.080
 the number we click on save 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.940

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:49.790

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.150
 memory 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.310
 that should be in PNG format and the 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:01.180
 same number that does not change in the 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:04.090

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.539
 way let's first extract what is 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.430
 the image to be able to edit we open it 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:51.310
 with our program that we are 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.130
 looking for editing and we modify in 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:57.340
