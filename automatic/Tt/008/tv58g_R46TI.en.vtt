00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.100
 Hello all! We're going to play a game of poker today, 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.740
 and I'm going to use my mental persuasion to let you choose the losing hand. 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.440
 I have ten cards here, which is exactly enough for two hands, 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.240
 we can shake them if you want-- 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.040
 I have no special way of shaking, so something like this-- 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.500
 and I'm going to hand them out, two cards at a time. 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.140
 and you have the free choice to choose on your own. 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.660
 I will hand out the first two cards. 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.880
 That's one and that's two. 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.120
 Now I ask you to choose a card. 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.480
 I will have to do this for you, so let's say you choose this one. 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.860
 All right so you get the queen, and I'll take the remaining card. 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.220
 OK, let's hand out two more cards. 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.560
 You have completely free choice again. 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.540
 You can choose any card you want, whatever card you want. 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.000
 Suppose you choose this card. 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.720
 OK, you have a seven, I'll take the remaining card. 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.060
 Let's hand out two more cards. 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.840
 You can choose any card you want, the left or the right, 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.020
 whichever card you want. 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.580
 Suppose you choose this card. 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.900
 That's another seven for you, I'll take the remaining card. 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.840
 To make things a little easier for you, I will hand out the cards this time. 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.640
 Please, two open cards, you can choose one at random. 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.880
 Suppose you choose the seven, please, now you have three sevens. 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.440
 To make it really easy for you, I will hand out the remaining cards one by one. 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.140
 Do you want this card or not? 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.000
 You may want to take this card away from me, as I already have a king. 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.520
 So suppose you take this card, and I take the remaining card. 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.160
 So please, I have dealt the ten cards, 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.760
 you had the free choice to choose your own hand, 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.780
 And you ended up with three sevens. 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.800
 Let's look at what I got. 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.100
 I have received a full house. 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.520
 The way to win this game is: whoever has the queen has the losing cards. 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.520
 And I forced the queen on you, and I didn't do that in a particularly subtle way. 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.520
 So I forced the queen on you and you will lose. 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.620
 You see, if you look closely at these ten cards, there are three aces, 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.160
 three kings, three sevens, and the lonely queen. 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.720
 The best thing you can do with a queen is to get three of the same. 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.400
 In that case I have a full house. 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.020
 On the other hand, if you have something else, such as two pairs, 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.380
 I have three of the same, and I will win again. 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.140
 If you have a pair, say 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.740
 I have two pairs, and I will win again. 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.620
 So whoever has the queen has the losing hand. 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.300
 Find a way to force your opponent the queen, 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.220
 then you will win, and then you can give them complete free choice. 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.700
 And that's how you do it. 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.460
 So if you did that 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:05.880
 thanks for looking.
