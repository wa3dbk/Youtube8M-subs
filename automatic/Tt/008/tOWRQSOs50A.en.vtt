00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.439
 core 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.490
 Not 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.680
 No way 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.680
 lam 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.330

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.800
 core 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.210
 as well as you probably already 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.989
 this is not the trailer for sure 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:18.970
 Assassin's creed 5 why it still tipped 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.120
 not at the moment there is no 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.130
 Trainer for Assassin's creed 2 straight 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.530
 only the fliethe comes out and 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.600
 I would say that is actually 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.790
 only two reasons why i have this 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.110
 video in the channel purely pack the first me 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.000
 I wanted to fool around a bit 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.400
 so do not cheat 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.970
 literally just a bit fooled 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.200
 and the second reason is the video though 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.790
 I did not do it myself, I did 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.370
 just a bit in my own way 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.050
 changed and in addition with the 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.030
 television zones feel too much because I like that 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.760
 be funny and for that I would just 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.160
 only to say there is only one more 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.090
 say hey five and see you next time 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.090
 peace out of mesa
