00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.220
 coffee an investment of almost 5 million 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.080

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.860
 Milan 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.140
 in order to create an exhibition 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.370
 permanent that tells through the 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.310

 coffee machines 100 years of history 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.210
 technology design and Italian style 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.790
 this museum is a dream come true 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.670
 This museum has a dream 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.320
 which we had for several years 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.730
 I was lucky enough to meet a 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.880
 collector with a collection 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.740
 extraordinary that enrico maltoni is also 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.240
 he was waiting for someone to answer 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.030
 his dream is to find a company 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.230
 and found us willing to open 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.510
 this museum 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.520
 I believe it is a tribute to a 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.770
 Made in Italy product that 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.370
 it is certainly known and appreciated by 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.320
 all of us 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.090
 the exhibition is based on the collection of 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.100
 enrico maltoni unique in the whole planet 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.920
 for quantities over 200 copies 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.530
 perfectly preserved and quality is one 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.270
 collection that has a long history of di 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.320
 search because we searched for the first ones 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.610
 historic steam column machines that 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.920
 this condor of 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.240
 institutions that have represented the beginning 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.040
 of the history of espresso because 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.750
 the espresso was a coffee prepared at 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.760
 time for the customer but the keyboard 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.560
 black smoldering but with a faint 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.930
 preparation dentistry much more 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.670
 lens because we are at the beginning of the era 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.030
 with steam system which is a system 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.640
 very slow but that had a result 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.230
 at the time, fast is always a collection 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.580
 alive so I'm always looking for 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.880
 missing pieces 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.380
 indeed launch leaves a message to those in 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.750

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.440
 subdivided for historical periods the beginnings 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.450
 of the twentieth century with the first machines a

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.780
 with the revolutionary invention of aldo 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.280
 gaggia or coffee cream and the 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.900
 consequent challenge between companies a

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.400
 the bright colors then ending with the 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.530
 technological innovations and design is 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.420
 increasingly futuristic of the 90s 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.340
 finally new millennium whose summa 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.260
 theological is constituted by the machine 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.150
 of the centenary ready to debut a 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.860
