I you discard people though it's not too

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.220 
I you discard people though it's not too
bad<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.440> guess<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:46.890> an<00:00:47.100> Oscar<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:48.230> it's

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
bad I guess it is an Oscar and it's

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.020 
bad I guess it is an Oscar and it's
still<00:00:49.469> not<00:00:49.530> great<00:00:49.950> i<00:00:50.070> dont<00:00:50.340> think<00:00:50.489> hes<00:00:50.670> cells

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
still not great i dont think hes cells

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.299 
still not great i dont think hes cells
much<00:00:51.449> but<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:52.559> know<00:00:52.680> i<00:00:52.710> guess<00:00:53.070> that's<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
much but you know i guess that's the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.729 
much but you know i guess that's the
best<00:00:53.370> pool<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:53.969> far<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.570> don't<00:00:55.199> even<00:00:55.260> know<00:00:55.530> what

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
best pool so far I don't even know what

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.470 
best pool so far I don't even know what
pack<00:00:56.010> number<00:00:56.280> this<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.550> anymore<00:00:56.879> but<00:00:57.210> we<00:00:57.239> can

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
pack number this is anymore but we can

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.020 
pack number this is anymore but we can
go<00:00:57.570> into<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:57.870> pack<00:00:58.109> now<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.699> hopefully<00:00:59.699> we

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
go into this pack now and hopefully we

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.029 
go into this pack now and hopefully we
do<00:01:00.149> most<00:01:00.359> packs<00:01:00.660> i'ma<00:01:00.870> good<00:01:01.020> i<00:01:01.050> dab<00:01:01.680> solutely

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:25.949 
we check it is that's a nagger that's
not<00:02:24.670> about<00:02:24.790> that's<00:02:25.120> probably<00:02:25.359> definitely<00:02:25.659> the

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
not about that's probably definitely the

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.569 
not about that's probably definitely the
best<00:02:26.139> pack<00:02:26.439> we've<00:02:26.650> had<00:02:26.769> some<00:02:26.920> terrible<00:02:27.189> packs
