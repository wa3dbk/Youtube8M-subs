and what I'm gonna do right now is take
any<00:00:25.210> shuffled<00:00:25.720> deck<00:00:26.670> I'll<00:00:27.670> just<00:00:27.880> give<00:00:28.060> them

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.650 
any shuffled deck I'll just give them
one<00:00:28.360> more<00:00:28.390> mix<00:00:28.750> there<00:00:29.020> and<00:00:30.029> let's<00:00:31.029> cut<00:00:31.270> it<00:00:31.420> and

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:31.660 
one more mix there and let's cut it and

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.410 
one more mix there and let's cut it and
I'm<00:00:31.810> going<00:00:32.140> to<00:00:32.169> deal<00:00:32.710> through<00:00:32.949> the<00:00:33.070> deck<00:00:33.420> using

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
I'm going to deal through the deck using

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.340 
I'm going to deal through the deck using
the<00:00:34.660> x-ray<00:00:34.900> vision<00:00:35.170> system<00:00:35.710> and<00:00:37.050> I'm<00:00:38.050> going<00:00:38.320> to

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
the x-ray vision system and I'm going to

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.549 
the x-ray vision system and I'm going to
try<00:00:38.559> to<00:00:38.620> separate<00:00:39.100> the<00:00:39.280> cards<00:00:40.410> please<00:00:41.410> be

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
try to separate the cards please be

00:00:41.559 --> 00:01:30.250 
try to separate the cards please be
quiet<00:00:41.800> I<00:00:42.129> have<00:00:42.430> to<00:00:42.519> concentrate

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.200 

I<00:01:30.320> guess<00:01:30.980> I<00:01:31.100> didn't<00:01:31.340> mix<00:01:31.490> them<00:01:31.670> as<00:01:31.760> good<00:01:31.940> as<00:01:32.060> I

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
I guess I didn't mix them as good as I

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.480 
I guess I didn't mix them as good as I
thought

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.219 

I<00:01:37.549> think<00:01:38.119> we<00:01:38.240> should<00:01:38.420> try<00:01:38.630> to<00:01:38.689> get<00:01:38.930> through

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
I think we should try to get through

00:01:39.229 --> 00:02:12.970 
I think we should try to get through
these<00:01:39.409> a<00:01:39.820> bit<00:01:40.820> quicker<00:01:41.180> if<00:01:41.420> we<00:01:41.450> can

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.759 

just<00:02:13.750> not<00:02:14.750> feeling<00:02:15.170> this<00:02:15.319> one<00:02:17.290> it<00:02:18.290> comes<00:02:18.560> and

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
just not feeling this one it comes and

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:27.250 
just not feeling this one it comes and

you know you start to get a feel for

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.869 
you know you start to get a feel for
this<00:03:07.959> you<00:03:08.959> can<00:03:09.200> kind<00:03:09.500> of<00:03:09.590> just<00:03:09.829> sense<00:03:12.879> where

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879 
this you can kind of just sense where

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:28.509 
this you can kind of just sense where
they're<00:03:14.060> supposed<00:03:14.329> to<00:03:14.420> be

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.619 

this<00:03:29.519> man<00:03:30.079> that<00:03:31.079> one<00:03:31.939> now<00:03:32.939> let's<00:03:33.150> get<00:03:33.359> there

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
this man that one now let's get there

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:43.960 
this man that one now let's get there
and<00:03:35.000> let's<00:03:36.000> say<00:03:37.849> here<00:03:40.790> see<00:03:41.790> how<00:03:41.909> I<00:03:41.939> did

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
and let's say here see how I did

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.259 
and let's say here see how I did
now<00:03:44.970> it's<00:03:45.180> normal<00:03:45.720> to<00:03:46.319> get<00:03:47.000> approximately<00:03:48.000> you

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
now it's normal to get approximately you

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.059 
now it's normal to get approximately you
know<00:03:48.359> fifty<00:03:48.719> percent<00:03:49.079> but<00:03:49.230> that<00:03:49.349> can<00:03:49.709> be<00:03:49.859> off

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
know fifty percent but that can be off

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:55.160 
know fifty percent but that can be off
quite<00:03:50.969> a<00:03:51.000> bit<00:03:51.269> you<00:03:51.510> might<00:03:53.720> see<00:03:54.720> these<00:03:54.930> are

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
quite a bit you might see these are

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:01.220 
quite a bit you might see these are
supposed<00:03:55.409> to<00:03:55.470> be<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.680> blacks<00:03:55.950> so<00:04:00.139> actually<00:04:01.139> it

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
supposed to be the blacks so actually it

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:07.069 
supposed to be the blacks so actually it
looks<00:04:03.680> pretty<00:04:04.680> good<00:04:04.919> here<00:04:05.340> I<00:04:05.370> got<00:04:06.209> look<00:04:06.959> at

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
looks pretty good here I got look at

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:12.069 
looks pretty good here I got look at
that<00:04:07.260> I<00:04:07.290> got<00:04:07.530> every<00:04:07.829> single<00:04:07.980> one<00:04:08.220> except<00:04:08.579> one

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.809 

well<00:04:13.079> there<00:04:13.260> may<00:04:13.379> be<00:04:13.409> a<00:04:13.560> lot<00:04:13.799> more<00:04:13.980> red<00:04:14.280> and<00:04:14.579> in

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
well there may be a lot more red and in

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.819 
well there may be a lot more red and in
this<00:04:15.090> side<00:04:15.329> so<00:04:15.629> maybe<00:04:15.810> I<00:04:15.930> didn't<00:04:16.259> do<00:04:16.560> as<00:04:16.739> good

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
this side so maybe I didn't do as good

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:30.500 
this side so maybe I didn't do as good
as<00:04:17.130> it<00:04:17.280> seems<00:04:17.489> let's<00:04:17.820> take<00:04:18.000> a<00:04:18.030> look<00:04:28.789> okay<00:04:29.789> I<00:04:30.180> did

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
as it seems let's take a look okay I did

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.850 
as it seems let's take a look okay I did
very<00:04:30.870> very<00:04:30.990> very<00:04:31.440> well<00:04:33.020> but<00:04:34.020> that's<00:04:34.320> because<00:04:34.710> I

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
very very very well but that's because I

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.879 
very very very well but that's because I
used<00:04:35.099> the<00:04:36.030> x-ray<00:04:36.419> vision<00:04:36.780> system<00:04:37.139> it<00:04:37.770> allows

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
used the x-ray vision system it allows

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.939 
used the x-ray vision system it allows
you<00:04:38.220> to<00:04:38.630> detect<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:40.229> color<00:04:40.470> of<00:04:40.650> a<00:04:40.710> playing

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
you to detect the color of a playing

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.870 
you to detect the color of a playing
card<00:04:41.690> from<00:04:42.690> the<00:04:42.840> back<00:04:43.020> and<00:04:43.729> they're<00:04:44.729> not

card from the back and they're not

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.240

marked<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:45.630> cards<00:04:45.930> can<00:04:46.139> be<00:04:46.320> borrowed<00:04:46.560> there

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
marked the cards can be borrowed there

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.610 
marked the cards can be borrowed there
