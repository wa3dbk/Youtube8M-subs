00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
think it's uh class Oh if I can get it

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.170 
think it's uh class Oh if I can get it
to<00:00:41.190> stay<00:00:42.590> piece<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:44.660> anyway

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
to stay piece of anyway

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.680 
to stay piece of anyway
there's<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.300> slot<00:00:48.660> in<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.399> piston<00:00:50.399> on<00:00:50.489> the

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
there's a slot in the piston on the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.080 
there's a slot in the piston on the
caliper<00:00:52.190> where<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:55.340> brake<00:00:56.340> pad<00:00:56.610> normally

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
caliper where the brake pad normally

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:04.570 
caliper where the brake pad normally
goes<00:00:57.890> and<00:00:59.539> I<00:01:01.969> imagine<00:01:02.969> there's<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.210> tool<00:01:03.510> for<00:01:03.780> it

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
goes and I imagine there's a tool for it

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.370 
goes and I imagine there's a tool for it
to<00:01:05.580> turn<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:06.030> back<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.570> yet<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.110> can't

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
to turn that back in yet you can't

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.410 
to turn that back in yet you can't
compress<00:01:07.799> these<00:01:08.100> with<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.340> c-clamp<00:01:08.880> like<00:01:09.180> well

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
compress these with a c-clamp like well

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.210 
compress these with a c-clamp like well
like<00:01:09.720> for<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.170> front<00:01:10.439> ones<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.799> have<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.040> turn

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
like for the front ones you have to turn

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.749 
like for the front ones you have to turn
this<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:13.220> and<00:01:14.479> all<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.509> could<00:01:15.720> find<00:01:16.020> was<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.759> door

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
this in and all I could find was a door

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.270 
this in and all I could find was a door
panel<00:01:17.970> remover<00:01:18.570> tool<00:01:18.890> until<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.100> know<00:01:20.220> you

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
panel remover tool until you know you

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.520 
panel remover tool until you know you
slip<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:20.850> behind<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.930> clips<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.970> pry<00:01:23.970> on<00:01:24.210> it

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
slip in behind the clips you pry on it

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.530 
slip in behind the clips you pry on it
and<00:01:25.530> that's<00:01:25.770> how<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:25.979> remove<00:01:26.340> your<00:01:26.580> door

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
and that's how you remove your door

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.030 
and that's how you remove your door
clips<00:01:28.159> anyway<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.340> got<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:30.380> and<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.650> seems<00:01:31.920> to

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
clips anyway I got that and it seems to

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.609 
clips anyway I got that and it seems to
be<00:01:32.280> pretty<00:01:32.970> decent<00:01:33.240> it's<00:01:33.840> still<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.110> it's<00:01:34.200> still

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
be pretty decent it's still a it's still

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.630 
be pretty decent it's still a it's still
kind<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.070> hard

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
kind of hard

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.120 
kind of hard
I'll<00:01:36.540> try<00:01:36.720> doing<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.140> with<00:01:37.320> one<00:01:37.350> hand<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:38.070> I

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
I'll try doing this with one hand so I

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.710 
I'll try doing this with one hand so I
can<00:01:38.310> show<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.869> jam<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.380> in<00:01:40.500> there<00:01:40.680> okay

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
can show you I just jam it in there okay

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:49.130 
can show you I just jam it in there okay
and<00:01:42.720> then<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:43.310> turn<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.340> that's<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:47.930> anyway<00:01:48.930> it's

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
and then I turn it that's it anyway it's

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.950 
and then I turn it that's it anyway it's
really<00:01:49.740> hard<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.189> turn<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.729> don't<00:01:51.630> know<00:01:51.720> if<00:01:51.810> it's

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
really hard to turn I don't know if it's

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.280 
really hard to turn I don't know if it's
supposed<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.290> be<00:01:52.439> like<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:53.750> I'm<00:01:54.750> used<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.140> the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
supposed to be like that I'm used to the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.560 
supposed to be like that I'm used to the
Cadillacs<00:01:55.829> where<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.280> have<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.090> block<00:01:57.299> that

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
Cadillacs where you have the block that

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.789 
Cadillacs where you have the block that
you<00:01:57.659> just<00:01:57.869> stick<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.320> there<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.590> put<00:01:58.680> on<00:01:58.770> a

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
you just stick in there and put on a

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.569 
you just stick in there and put on a
ratchet<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.430> turn<00:01:59.640> in<00:02:00.259> anyway<00:02:01.280> I'll<00:02:02.280> show<00:02:02.340> you

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
ratchet and turn in anyway I'll show you

I<00:02:24.590> was<00:02:25.099> metal-on-metal<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:27.590> there<00:02:28.519> ain't<00:02:28.610> no

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
I was metal-on-metal and there ain't no

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.229 
I was metal-on-metal and there ain't no
pad<00:02:28.940> left<00:02:30.250> now<00:02:31.250> when<00:02:31.430> you<00:02:31.519> put<00:02:31.700> your<00:02:31.849> new<00:02:32.000> ones

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
pad left now when you put your new ones

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.270 
pad left now when you put your new ones
in<00:02:33.459> there's<00:02:34.459> a<00:02:34.640> pin<00:02:35.360> right<00:02:35.510> here<00:02:35.569> and<00:02:36.250> you<00:02:37.250> have

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
in there's a pin right here and you have

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.350 
in there's a pin right here and you have
to<00:02:37.519> make<00:02:37.670> sure<00:02:37.849> that<00:02:37.879> pin<00:02:38.360> is<00:02:38.540> in<00:02:38.720> that<00:02:38.900> slot

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
to make sure that pin is in that slot

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.030 
to make sure that pin is in that slot
now<00:02:41.360> everything<00:02:42.049> put<00:02:42.290> these<00:02:42.440> brakes<00:02:42.739> on

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
now everything put these brakes on

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.670 
now everything put these brakes on
before<00:02:43.519> we<00:02:43.640> got<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:43.940> color<00:02:44.410> didn't<00:02:45.410> have<00:02:45.530> that

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
before we got the color didn't have that

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.240 
before we got the color didn't have that
pin<00:02:45.950> in<00:02:46.129> the<00:02:46.190> slot<00:02:46.549> and<00:02:47.409> all<00:02:48.409> if<00:02:48.650> you<00:02:48.829> can<00:02:49.010> tell

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
pin in the slot and all if you can tell

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.660 
pin in the slot and all if you can tell
but<00:02:49.400> the<00:02:49.519> brake<00:02:49.700> pad<00:02:49.970> is<00:02:50.120> worn<00:02:50.390> unevenly<00:02:51.670> the

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
but the brake pad is worn unevenly the

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.940 
but the brake pad is worn unevenly the
thickness<00:02:53.180> of<00:02:53.360> that<00:02:54.549> pin<00:02:56.410> because<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.739> brake

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
thickness of that pin because the brake

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.860 
thickness of that pin because the brake
instead<00:02:58.310> of<00:02:58.430> riding<00:02:58.730> straight<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.390> brake<00:02:59.599> pad
