00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.899 
delivers up to 12 hours of satin matte
coverage<00:02:18.269> it<00:02:18.569> is<00:02:18.959> a<00:02:19.709> weightless<00:02:20.099> texture<00:02:20.670> and

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
coverage it is a weightless texture and

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.580 
coverage it is a weightless texture and
it<00:02:21.209> reduces<00:02:21.629> the<00:02:21.780> appearance<00:02:22.080> of<00:02:22.290> pores

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
it reduces the appearance of pores

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.039 
it reduces the appearance of pores
discoloration<00:02:22.879> imperfections<00:02:23.879> and<00:02:24.239> ensures

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
it is a full coverage foundation so if

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.970 
it is a full coverage foundation so if
you're<00:02:30.360> not<00:02:30.540> into<00:02:30.810> that<00:02:30.840> pass<00:02:31.470> on<00:02:31.769> this

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
you're not into that pass on this

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.160 
you're not into that pass on this
because<00:02:32.250> this<00:02:32.549> literally<00:02:33.060> covers<00:02:33.480> everything

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
because this literally covers everything

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.410 
because this literally covers everything

probably towards the end so stay tuned
for<00:02:38.220> that<00:02:38.280> but<00:02:39.030> also<00:02:39.329> it<00:02:39.780> claims<00:02:40.079> to<00:02:40.470> have<00:02:41.099> a<00:02:41.579> 12

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.280 
for that but also it claims to have a 12

definitely agree with it lasts so long I

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.270 
definitely agree with it lasts so long I
think<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.930> most<00:02:49.109> I've<00:02:49.290> worn<00:02:49.560> this<00:02:49.739> personally

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
think the most I've worn this personally

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.030 
think the most I've worn this personally
is<00:02:50.489> probably<00:02:51.090> 9<00:02:51.390> hours<00:02:51.900> on<00:02:52.019> my<00:02:52.170> face<00:02:52.410> which<00:02:52.890> is

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
is probably 9 hours on my face which is

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.410 
is probably 9 hours on my face which is
still<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.280> really<00:02:53.579> long<00:02:53.730> time<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.030> it

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
still a really long time and it

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.380 
still a really long time and it
literally<00:02:54.690> looked<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.920> same<00:02:55.950> as<00:02:56.670> coverage

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
literally looked the same as coverage

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.229 
literally looked the same as coverage
wise<00:02:57.659> now<00:02:58.379> I'm<00:02:58.680> a<00:02:58.739> combination<00:02:59.519> oily<00:02:59.730> skin

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
wise now I'm a combination oily skin

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.839 
wise now I'm a combination oily skin
type<00:03:00.480> if<00:03:00.659> you<00:03:01.079> like<00:03:01.709> to<00:03:01.890> reference<00:03:02.040> that<00:03:02.400> for

type if you like to reference that for

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.789

me<00:03:03.030> towards<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.569> end<00:03:03.720> of<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.140> around<00:03:04.530> 9<00:03:04.769> hours

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
me towards the end of the around 9 hours

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.819 
me towards the end of the around 9 hours
ten<00:03:05.670> hours<00:03:05.700> of<00:03:06.299> wearing<00:03:06.900> this<00:03:07.079> personally<00:03:07.650> I

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
ten hours of wearing this personally I

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.589 
ten hours of wearing this personally I
thought<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.250> little<00:03:08.549> bit<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:08.879> shininess<00:03:09.239> in<00:03:09.510> the

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
thought a little bit of shininess in the

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:10.910 
thought a little bit of shininess in the
forehead<00:03:09.930> which<00:03:10.079> I<00:03:10.260> don't<00:03:10.319> think<00:03:10.470> it's<00:03:10.680> a<00:03:10.739> big

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
forehead which I don't think it's a big

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.369 
forehead which I don't think it's a big
deal<00:03:11.129> they<00:03:11.609> claimed<00:03:11.970> it<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.299> be<00:03:12.599> a<00:03:12.629> satin<00:03:13.230> matte

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
deal they claimed it to be a satin matte

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.559 
deal they claimed it to be a satin matte
finish<00:03:13.739> which<00:03:13.920> I<00:03:14.099> definitely<00:03:14.519> agree<00:03:14.940> it's

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
finish which I definitely agree it's

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.360 
finish which I definitely agree it's
satin<00:03:16.200> matte<00:03:16.349> it's<00:03:16.590> not<00:03:16.709> completely<00:03:17.099> matte

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
satin matte it's not completely matte

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.300 
satin matte it's not completely matte
you<00:03:17.549> do<00:03:17.790> get<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.030> little<00:03:18.510> bit<00:03:18.660> of<00:03:18.859> I<00:03:19.859> don't<00:03:20.190> want

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
you do get a little bit of I don't want

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.000 
you do get a little bit of I don't want
to<00:03:20.459> say<00:03:20.609> glow<00:03:21.060> but<00:03:21.540> it's<00:03:21.810> not<00:03:22.049> fully<00:03:22.410> matte<00:03:22.769> I

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
to say glow but it's not fully matte I

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.379 
to say glow but it's not fully matte I
think<00:03:23.190> this<00:03:23.310> is<00:03:23.430> perfect<00:03:23.790> for<00:03:23.940> normal<00:03:24.299> skin

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
think this is perfect for normal skin

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:26.539 
think this is perfect for normal skin
types<00:03:24.750> also<00:03:25.019> but<00:03:25.620> if<00:03:25.709> you<00:03:25.829> have<00:03:26.010> extremely

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
types also but if you have extremely

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.150 
types also but if you have extremely
extremely<00:03:27.239> dry<00:03:27.690> skin<00:03:27.720> where<00:03:28.650> your<00:03:28.859> skin

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
extremely dry skin where your skin

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.699 
extremely dry skin where your skin
actually<00:03:29.400> flakes<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:30.269> don't<00:03:31.139> really<00:03:31.470> recommend

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
actually flakes I don't really recommend

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.199 
actually flakes I don't really recommend
this<00:03:32.069> for<00:03:32.220> you<00:03:32.340> unless<00:03:32.760> you<00:03:32.940> plan<00:03:33.150> to

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
this for you unless you plan to

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.750 
this for you unless you plan to
moisturize<00:03:33.930> a<00:03:34.200> lot<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.769> night<00:03:34.950> before<00:03:35.160> or

moisturize a lot the night before or

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.080 
moisturize a lot the night before or
that<00:03:35.840> morning<00:03:36.840> of<00:03:37.049> because<00:03:37.680> I've<00:03:38.430> tried<00:03:38.940> this

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
that morning of because I've tried this

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.270 
that morning of because I've tried this
on<00:03:39.299> people<00:03:39.629> with<00:03:39.810> really<00:03:40.109> dry<00:03:40.379> skin<00:03:40.859> and<00:03:41.099> it

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
on people with really dry skin and it

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.400 
on people with really dry skin and it
really<00:03:41.489> just<00:03:41.639> accentuated<00:03:42.510> these<00:03:42.660> dry

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
really just accentuated these dry

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.770 
really just accentuated these dry
patches<00:03:43.769> on<00:03:44.099> their<00:03:44.220> face<00:03:44.489> and<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:45.419> kind<00:03:45.660> of

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
patches on their face and it kind of

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.960 
patches on their face and it kind of
flaked<00:03:46.019> on<00:03:46.230> them<00:03:46.440> so<00:03:46.769> I<00:03:47.069> personally<00:03:47.760> don't

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
flaked on them so I personally don't

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.520 
flaked on them so I personally don't
have<00:03:48.120> super<00:03:48.480> dry<00:03:48.660> skin<00:03:48.690> I<00:03:48.959> get<00:03:49.169> a<00:03:49.199> little<00:03:49.349> bit

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
have super dry skin I get a little bit

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.020 
have super dry skin I get a little bit
dry<00:03:49.769> in<00:03:49.829> the<00:03:49.949> cheeks<00:03:50.220> but<00:03:50.609> if<00:03:50.730> you<00:03:50.879> are

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
dry in the cheeks but if you are

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.479 
dry in the cheeks but if you are
extremely<00:03:51.389> dry<00:03:51.690> I<00:03:52.019> don't<00:03:52.769> think<00:03:53.190> I<00:03:53.340> would

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
extremely dry I don't think I would

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.069 
extremely dry I don't think I would
recommend<00:03:53.910> this<00:03:54.000> for<00:03:54.060> you<00:03:54.299> that<00:03:54.480> much<00:03:54.690> because

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
recommend this for you that much because

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.050 
recommend this for you that much because
again<00:03:55.440> it<00:03:55.680> really<00:03:56.160> accentuates<00:03:56.519> the<00:03:56.879> dry

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
again it really accentuates the dry

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.550 
again it really accentuates the dry
patches<00:03:57.269> just<00:03:57.690> because<00:03:57.930> it's<00:03:58.079> like<00:03:58.199> a<00:03:58.290> clay

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
patches just because it's like a clay

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.319 
patches just because it's like a clay

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
consistency again it's a clay and I

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.339 
consistency again it's a clay and I
really<00:04:14.910> love<00:04:15.090> it<00:04:15.209> it's<00:04:15.359> full<00:04:15.660> coverage<00:04:16.109> I

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349

personally like this

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.259 
personally like this
see<00:04:18.069> some<00:04:18.280> people<00:04:18.519> don't<00:04:18.699> like<00:04:18.910> like<00:04:19.120> the

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
see some people don't like like the

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.059 
see some people don't like like the
creamier<00:04:19.690> products<00:04:20.109> so<00:04:20.500> if<00:04:20.560> you're<00:04:20.680> not<00:04:20.799> into

00:04:21.059 --> 00:04:21.069 
creamier products so if you're not into

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:22.469 
creamier products so if you're not into
that<00:04:21.190> pass<00:04:21.549> on<00:04:21.789> this<00:04:21.970> because<00:04:22.210> this

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
that pass on this because this

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.589 
that pass on this because this
definitely<00:04:22.780> has<00:04:22.960> a<00:04:22.990> more<00:04:23.800> creamy<00:04:24.389> almost<00:04:25.389> like

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:25.599 
definitely has a more creamy almost like

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:28.050 
definitely has a more creamy almost like
mousse<00:04:25.900> texture<00:04:26.440> one<00:04:26.949> thing<00:04:27.129> that<00:04:27.280> I<00:04:27.310> find<00:04:27.759> on

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
mousse texture one thing that I find on

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.879 
mousse texture one thing that I find on
this<00:04:28.300> is<00:04:28.509> that<00:04:28.599> it<00:04:28.720> does<00:04:28.900> dry<00:04:29.229> to<00:04:29.289> almost<00:04:29.710> like

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
this is that it does dry to almost like

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:31.890 
this is that it does dry to almost like
a<00:04:29.949> powder<00:04:30.220> finish<00:04:30.580> so<00:04:31.180> you<00:04:31.240> don't<00:04:31.419> have<00:04:31.569> to<00:04:31.780> add

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
a powder finish so you don't have to add

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.719 
a powder finish so you don't have to add
powder<00:04:32.259> on<00:04:32.440> top<00:04:32.680> it's<00:04:32.889> not<00:04:32.949> gonna<00:04:33.159> stay<00:04:33.400> sticky

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
powder on top it's not gonna stay sticky

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.369 
powder on top it's not gonna stay sticky
throughout<00:04:34.120> the<00:04:34.270> day<00:04:34.449> but<00:04:34.900> if<00:04:34.990> you<00:04:35.050> want<00:04:35.229> more

00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:35.379 
throughout the day but if you want more

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:37.170 
throughout the day but if you want more
coverage<00:04:35.620> you<00:04:35.830> can<00:04:36.069> definitely<00:04:36.520> add<00:04:36.729> a<00:04:36.759> powder

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
coverage you can definitely add a powder

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.270 
coverage you can definitely add a powder
on<00:04:37.330> top<00:04:37.690> if<00:04:37.990> that's<00:04:38.349> what<00:04:38.560> you're<00:04:38.680> into<00:04:39.039> I

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
on top if that's what you're into I

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.950 
on top if that's what you're into I
person<00:04:39.819> like<00:04:39.940> to<00:04:40.030> dust<00:04:40.270> myself<00:04:40.419> with<00:04:40.720> a<00:04:40.750> little

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
person like to dust myself with a little

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.089 
person like to dust myself with a little
a<00:04:41.020> little<00:04:41.259> bit<00:04:41.349> of<00:04:41.440> powder<00:04:41.620> just<00:04:41.830> because<00:04:42.009> I

00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:42.099 
a little bit of powder just because I

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:44.070 
a little bit of powder just because I
get<00:04:42.250> oily<00:04:42.580> t-zone<00:04:42.940> towards<00:04:43.750> the<00:04:43.810> end<00:04:43.960> of<00:04:43.990> the

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.719 
get oily t-zone towards the end of the
day<00:04:44.229> so<00:04:44.289> I<00:04:44.530> kind<00:04:44.800> of<00:04:44.830> try<00:04:45.069> to<00:04:45.129> control<00:04:45.520> that<00:04:45.580> a

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
day so I kind of try to control that a

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.420 
day so I kind of try to control that a
little<00:04:46.000> bit<00:04:46.120> more<00:04:46.300> but<00:04:47.020> this<00:04:47.349> does<00:04:47.620> dry<00:04:48.099> to<00:04:48.159> a

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
little bit more but this does dry to a

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.510 
little bit more but this does dry to a
pretty<00:04:48.879> powdery<00:04:49.599> finish<00:04:49.870> in<00:04:50.289> my<00:04:50.710> opinion<00:04:51.130> so<00:04:51.370> I

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
pretty powdery finish in my opinion so I

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.879 
pretty powdery finish in my opinion so I
really<00:04:52.030> like<00:04:52.240> that<00:04:52.449> so<00:04:52.810> if<00:04:52.870> you're<00:04:53.020> on<00:04:53.470> the<00:04:53.710> go

traditional foundation brush not my

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:15.269

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:17.289 
gives kind of the streaks since it is a

00:06:17.289 --> 00:06:19.709 
gives kind of the streaks since it is a
clay<00:06:17.919> consistency<00:06:18.699> you<00:06:19.150> see<00:06:19.360> lot<00:06:19.569> of<00:06:19.599> the

00:06:19.709 --> 00:06:19.719 
clay consistency you see lot of the

clay consistency you see lot of the
streaks<00:06:19.960> and<00:06:20.050> it<00:06:20.139> takes<00:06:20.319> a<00:06:20.380> lot<00:06:20.529> longer<00:06:20.680> to

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 
streaks and it takes a lot longer to

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:22.409 
streaks and it takes a lot longer to
blend<00:06:21.130> out<00:06:21.279> I've<00:06:21.490> also<00:06:21.669> tried<00:06:22.029> it<00:06:22.210> with<00:06:22.300> the

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:22.419

blend out I've also tried it with the
Beauty<00:06:22.690> Blender<00:06:23.020> and<00:06:23.169> it<00:06:23.469> works<00:06:23.650> fairly<00:06:23.889> well

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:24.069 
Beauty Blender and it works fairly well

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:25.409 
Beauty Blender and it works fairly well
I<00:06:24.400> just<00:06:24.610> feel<00:06:24.729> like<00:06:24.819> since<00:06:25.060> a<00:06:25.150> Beauty<00:06:25.389> Blender

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:25.419 
I just feel like since a Beauty Blender

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:28.320 
I just feel like since a Beauty Blender
is<00:06:26.139> pretty<00:06:26.469> damp<00:06:26.770> it<00:06:27.009> just<00:06:27.219> sheers<00:06:28.000> it<00:06:28.180> out<00:06:28.300> a

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:28.330 
is pretty damp it just sheers it out a

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.070 
is pretty damp it just sheers it out a
little<00:06:28.719> bit<00:06:28.960> more<00:06:29.199> but<00:06:29.710> if<00:06:29.770> you<00:06:29.830> want

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 
little bit more but if you want

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.170 
little bit more but if you want
full<00:06:30.349> full<00:06:30.560> coverage<00:06:30.979> definitely<00:06:31.879> use<00:06:32.030> the

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180 
full full coverage definitely use the

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.580 
full full coverage definitely use the
brush<00:06:32.389> the<00:06:32.690> Beautyblender<00:06:32.990> works<00:06:33.409> really

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.059 
brush the Beautyblender works really
great<00:06:33.800> too<00:06:34.159> now<00:06:34.879> if<00:06:35.690> you<00:06:35.900> don't<00:06:36.199> like<00:06:36.680> full

00:06:37.059 --> 00:06:37.069

great too now if you don't like full
coverage<00:06:37.490> foundation<00:06:38.120> but<00:06:38.690> you<00:06:38.750> really<00:06:39.139> want
