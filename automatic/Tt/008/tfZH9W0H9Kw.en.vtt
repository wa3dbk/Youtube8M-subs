exactly<00:00:46.200> same<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.860> just<00:00:47.010> ignore<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.460> for<00:00:47.640> a

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
exactly same so just ignore that for a

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.580 
exactly same so just ignore that for a
second<00:00:48.030> he's<00:00:48.600> attacking<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.230> position<00:00:49.500> is

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
second he's attacking a position is

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.319 
second he's attacking a position is
pretty<00:00:49.860> good<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.219> then<00:00:50.520> obviously<00:00:50.670> free-kick

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
pretty good and then obviously free-kick

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.720

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
negatives he's pretty expensive he can

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.940 
negatives he's pretty expensive he can
be<00:01:48.600> playing<00:01:48.780> in<00:01:48.960> many<00:01:49.140> collisions<00:01:49.350> also<00:01:49.740> like

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950

too good though I've that's something
I've<00:01:54.840> noticed<00:01:54.990> which<00:01:55.350> isn't<00:01:55.649> obviously<00:01:55.979> great

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
I've noticed which isn't obviously great

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.760 
I've noticed which isn't obviously great
his<00:01:57.360> dribbling<00:01:57.659> for<00:01:57.840> how<00:01:58.290> tall<00:01:58.590> he<00:01:58.740> is

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
his dribbling for how tall he is

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.310 
his dribbling for how tall he is

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
obviously it's really really really good

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.840 
obviously it's really really really good
i<00:02:01.350> was<00:02:01.649> here<00:02:01.740> didn't<00:02:01.890> have<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.100> hunt<00:02:02.340> control

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
i was here didn't have the hunt control

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.459 
i was here didn't have the hunt control
on<00:02:03.000> him<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:03.479> that's<00:02:03.659> obviously<00:02:03.840> gonna<00:02:04.110> help<00:02:04.320> a

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
on him so that's obviously gonna help a

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.380 
on him so that's obviously gonna help a
bit<00:02:04.740> but<00:02:05.159> he's<00:02:05.579> dribbling<00:02:05.790> was<00:02:06.060> very<00:02:06.240> very

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
bit but he's dribbling was very very

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.960 
bit but he's dribbling was very very
good<00:02:06.479> from<00:02:06.810> what<00:02:06.960> i<00:02:06.990> did<00:02:07.259> use<00:02:07.619> it

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
good from what i did use it

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.940 
good from what i did use it
obviously<00:02:08.300> and<00:02:08.570> obviously<00:02:08.990> had<00:02:09.410> much<00:02:09.710> already

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
obviously and obviously had much already

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.770 
obviously and obviously had much already
ventures<00:02:10.399> but<00:02:10.490> he's<00:02:10.670> very<00:02:10.880> strong<00:02:11.180> so

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
ventures but he's very strong so

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.090 
ventures but he's very strong so
obviously<00:02:12.170> we<00:02:12.320> play<00:02:12.500> though<00:02:12.770> strong<00:02:13.040> he

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
obviously we play though strong he

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.800 
obviously we play though strong he
doesn't<00:02:13.970> get<00:02:14.030> talking<00:02:14.270> off<00:02:14.330> the<00:02:14.360> ball<00:02:14.570> and

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
doesn't get talking off the ball and

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.590 
doesn't get talking off the ball and
that<00:02:15.230> really<00:02:15.440> helps<00:02:15.740> in<00:02:15.800> this<00:02:15.920> game<00:02:16.100> as

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
that really helps in this game as

that really helps in this game as
strikes<00:02:17.600> a<00:02:17.690> lot<00:02:17.840> big<00:02:17.960> of<00:02:18.050> a<00:02:18.110> factor<00:02:18.340> and

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
strikes a lot big of a factor and

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.180 
strikes a lot big of a factor and
strengths<00:02:20.990> really<00:02:21.290> really<00:02:21.530> read<00:02:21.710> just<00:02:21.950> help

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
strengths really really read just help

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.970 
strengths really really read just help
in<00:02:22.400> my<00:02:22.610> opinion<00:02:22.880> so<00:02:23.690> again<00:02:24.380> just<00:02:24.560> going<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:24.860> go

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
in my opinion so again just going to go

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.180 
in my opinion so again just going to go
over<00:02:25.030> eleven<00:02:26.030> dowski<00:02:26.270> one<00:02:26.780> more<00:02:27.080> time<00:02:27.380> his

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
over eleven dowski one more time his

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.950 
over eleven dowski one more time his
positives<00:02:28.700> he's<00:02:29.120> got<00:02:29.210> a<00:02:29.240> really<00:02:29.480> good<00:02:29.570> curve

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
positives he's got a really good curve

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.170 
positives he's got a really good curve
he's<00:02:30.410> strong<00:02:30.680> his<00:02:31.310> dribbling<00:02:31.670> is<00:02:31.820> really

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
he's strong his dribbling is really

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.640 
he's strong his dribbling is really
really<00:02:32.330> good<00:02:32.540> and<00:02:33.080> it<00:02:33.260> could<00:02:33.350> be<00:02:33.380> played<00:02:33.620> in

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
really good and it could be played in

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.920 
really good and it could be played in
camp<00:02:34.040> sent<00:02:34.340> forward<00:02:34.580> and<00:02:34.820> historic<00:02:35.300> positions

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
camp sent forward and historic positions

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.540 
camp sent forward and historic positions
so<00:02:36.500> if<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:36.650> do<00:02:36.740> on<00:02:36.830> a<00:02:36.890> plane<00:02:37.070> in<00:02:37.100> that<00:02:37.400> position

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
so if you do on a plane in that position

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.949 
so if you do on a plane in that position
you<00:02:37.850> can<00:02:38.060> do<00:02:38.780> so<00:02:39.670> negatives<00:02:40.810> expensive<00:02:41.810> and

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
you can do so negatives expensive and

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.840 
you can do so negatives expensive and
his<00:02:42.050> free-kick<00:02:42.320> aren't<00:02:43.010> really<00:02:43.370> really<00:02:43.550> bad

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
his free-kick aren't really really bad

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:46.210 
his free-kick aren't really really bad
like<00:02:44.200> definitely<00:02:45.200> a<00:02:45.440> free<00:02:45.620> kick<00:02:45.770> taker<00:02:46.010> is

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
like definitely a free kick taker is

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.800 
like definitely a free kick taker is
more<00:02:46.370> of<00:02:46.430> a<00:02:46.490> target<00:02:46.730> man<00:02:47.030> up<00:02:47.120> front<00:02:47.300> if<00:02:47.750> you

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
more of a target man up front if you

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.040 
more of a target man up front if you
want<00:02:48.080> to<00:02:48.320> play<00:02:48.560> in<00:02:48.740> like<00:02:48.950> that<00:02:49.209> so<00:02:50.209> odd<00:02:50.450> to<00:02:50.690> put

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
want to play in like that so odd to put

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.840 
want to play in like that so odd to put
overall<00:02:51.470> school<00:02:51.740> I<00:02:51.950> would<00:02:52.010> write<00:02:52.280> it<00:02:52.400> an<00:02:52.580> eight

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
overall school I would write it an eight
