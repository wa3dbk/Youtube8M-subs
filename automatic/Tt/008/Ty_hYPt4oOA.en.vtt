00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:12.059
 and, um, beauty, I came back here with more 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:17.400
 a video and this time came back bringing 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:19.050
 for you or vij metro last light and me 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.730
 I'll show you how this game 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.420
 wheel on pc 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:31.289
 you must be seeing and a good that 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:33.180
 and installed the game and came in 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.530
 which marquinhos along with the game serves 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.710
 to pass the game and there is a good 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.649
 Why did not you create an icon there for me? 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.690
 desktop created no icon 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.140
 I had to go there, I always go 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.719
 in the game folders or came to see 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.440
 Why do you have to get in there to put the 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.329
 really not really 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.719
 there I saw that it was well that I scored and 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.730
 in the facility also showed there then I saw 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.510
 that you are seeing there is of a good of 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.570
 marketing should be seeing there the O 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.570
 frames there those frames there that are 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.939
 white it shows in a blank 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.939
 that cold he is totally a liar 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.890
 just increasing 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:29.240
 when in fact the game is about 35 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:32.189
 friends most of the good that scored 25 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:37.320
 years came to seven 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:43.860
 It's one more if I'm not mistaken in the game. 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:47.009
 arrived at 10 frames gas 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.189
 who is going to play a game is the same 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:55.590
 so if you think about buying this 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:58.740
 game is not buy because pc equals 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.680
 my what the worst not even worse 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:12.379
 I felt a little worse, I do not even need 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:12.379
 think because 2.2.1 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:22.550
 Anything that comes unless 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:25.460
 My times can exist baby and there's more 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:30.070
 something I needed to talk about here is good. 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:34.790
 Forgetting that I'm talking now is she 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:37.850
 a time without posting videos but time 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:41.750
 I was seeing what it was like to do with the 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:46.150
 channel and such I would stop doing 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:52.520
 videos, because I do not give a damn 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:56.780
 because this is a game and then I go 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.610
 There is a pressure on the head of the 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.920
 people 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:06.530
 play this game there low fucking 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:11.540
 does not work and gives you laziness 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:13.130
 not much laziness when you lower the 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.070
 The game does not work well with a 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:21.200
 Pedro or if it 's a game do not come like pizza 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:24.530
 install and come spoiled joÃ£o g 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:30.860
 this gives a sloth in us again has 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:33.290
 that download again and such and I think 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:37.040
 It's that today, when I go back, I'll continue. 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:40.730
 with the channel and or do something that is 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.770
 that I did one is a while back there that 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.620
 was to ask the participants to tell us 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.880
 comments what games they want 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.260
 because I think I was kind of 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:53.270
 lost, you know, it 's kind of lost in there. 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.390
 what game did you give because the people were asking 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.670
 a lot of game and I noticed I tried to remember 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.210
 headache nor is this a defect that I 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.190
 have 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.390
 and then I tried to remember my head more 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.560
 did not remember 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:10.250
 Then I'll ask you to write 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:14.660
 the comments there that you want, right? 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:19.220
 Then I'll put it on the list again and 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:20.720
 Let's find and I'll try and get in the games. 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.040
 did not work trying to download again 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.890
 that I have I did it 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.140
 before but you have an hour that gets tired or 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:32.110
 Do you want to know how it is? 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:34.180
 is I think this is 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:38.650
 I hope you like the video I hope 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:40.930
 the video has been from and 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.330
 helping to help you, what is the 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:47.170
 that I've been trying to do with these 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.370
 videos in games where being weak and guess 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:53.160

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.160
