00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.780
 talking about pregnancy means 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.090
 pay attention to the three factors 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.099
 quantity of food quality the 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.950
 distribution of these in the water of the 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:23.320
 new faces important than for the 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.390
 patient is also possible serene that 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.540
 accept changes to your body 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.790
 physiological long ago there was the axiom 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.619
 pregnancy two people eat the 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.710
 twice the double is said today 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.720
 quality the patient must lend a 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.340
 of the problems of posting all 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.890
 most women pregnant women 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.510
 pregnant and of the consequents of nicolò ge 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.390
 weight gain 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.390
 many patients are perplexed about 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.429
 almost too much or too little for i 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.679
 pounds they take in the arc of names 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:55.899
 as in solving the problem 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:58.960
 with kakà again when the mass index 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.789
 body or boris mass index ie weight 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.850
 divided the square of the height to the 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.449
 time of the beginning of the first month of 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.820
 pregnancy 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.790
 if the patient is underweight then a 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:13.689
 body mass index below 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:17.500
 19 may take between 12 and 15 TVs if 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:21.340
 normal weight therefore between 19 and 25 the patient 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.829
 can take 10 to 13 kg if there 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.960
 patient then is overweight the weight by 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:28.420
 take during pregnancy for 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.049
 bring more if in the serene possible e 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.850
 has a happy ending must always be 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.890
 minor until a serious one 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.930
 obesity use an elderly patient of 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.100
 be subjected to a regime 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.470
 ipocalorico 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.600
 what are the problems themselves 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.880
 the patient takes too much weight 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.750
 diabetes good during gestational 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:54.860
 mail of I tell you increase of 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.420
 circulatory pressure circulated and that 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.590
 the production then of a fetus that is of a 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.040
 child the moment of birth 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.030
 problematic natural sonic macro birth 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.520
 and this can be a big one 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.890
 then problematic for the gynecologist 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.710
 a healthy and correct diet and a 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.380
 good level of physical activity since 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.540
 third month are always recommended in 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.680
 any case it has long weight which in 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.920
 overweight 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.670
 as far as food is concerned 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.090
 exclude a wide range of foods 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.660
 for the risk of the onset of 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.360
 food poisoning 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.850
 therefore the milk is not well cooked well 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.950
 certainly that by now it was difficult to find 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.260
 now they are all pasteurized milk though 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.390
 place is not recommended and raw for the 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.490
 he wrote almone lusi are eliminated 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.400
 in the life of the pregnant meat raw 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.740
 raw fish can be the sushi that 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.100
 lately it's just a crime 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.870
 smoky cheeses are not recommended with 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.060
 mold due to the risk of stereo xi 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.030
 fruit and nuts are also eliminated 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.070
 vegetables must be well washed against 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.800
 rooms for example like the kitchen or 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.470
 also one therefore not recommended by 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.209
 take vegetables in three hot tables 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.700
 they are not cups for the risk precisely 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:11.450
 of a food infection can create 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.700
 of damage to women and the fetus 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.220
 substance that is not defined as a nutrient 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.050
 a food the alcohol has to be instead 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.780
 just abolished because of bills 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:25.170
 scientific community does not bring us one 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.930
 amount looks like accepted therefore for 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.450
 avoid neurological damage to the fetus comes 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.670
 advised to abstain from alcohol which 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.340
 just the other and passes the barrier of 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.680
 between directly chosen then and wines 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.230
 not recommended to reduce the salt for the 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.280
 pressure and aesthetic reason can be said 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.690
 of swelling in the lower limbs 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.000
 foods and nutrients that must be 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.210
 assumed instead greater quantity are the 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.820
 kick the iron because it is just for 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.370
 the fetus is for blood donation 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.920
 during pregnancy and the circle as 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.660
 the amount of group eme comes 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.700
 should the breath of the major happen 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.490
 iron folic acid is recommended 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.740
 so much oral integration 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.350
 in the first three months but there are a series 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:13.640
 of green leafy vegetables a stone 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:16.650
 spinach that can be rich in 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:20.130
 is born from outside with therefore assumed both 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.080
 totti that are raw but raw or well cleaned 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.520
 more advisable long phonic release and 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.900
 very volatile then assumed 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:30.150
 definitely fresh in fresh vegetables 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.700
 plus an active prince is present 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.040
 effective amount of protein 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.230
 lean proteins like carnet chicken 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.660
 also of the assault baby pig can 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.970
 fiber is taken then cereals 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.800
 integral to the complete break cookies 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.150
 to avoid a problem 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.250
 frequent 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.530
 which is the greatest constipation 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.900
 quantity of water and liquids then 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.360
 in the form of chamomile or barley water 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.370
 chamomile vitamin D then with 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:00.390
 solar exposure for the production of 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:03.810
 new carrier bone for the 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:06.570
 thick and the sun since the sun is a 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.880
 producer of rapidly endogenous 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.310
 we have mice in the water coupe 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.700
 in the fiber and movement 2 moment 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.950
 important for various reasons either 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.590
 physiological and psychological psychological 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:22.040
 I'm just to dump the attention 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.480
 just can be an expectation 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.320
 carve out some hours 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:30.330
 in the week for itself for 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:33.780
 evaluate also reduce with the movement 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:36.600
 excess weight for a right tone 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.300
 muscular and basically also for 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.940
 try to maintain a posture and a 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.070
 correct postural balance possible 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:47.750
 in such a way face the nine months and into 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.750
 most serious physiological way
