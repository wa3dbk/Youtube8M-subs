00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 um everyone and everyone welcome to the 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.710
 review of episode 419 of the anime 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.019
 naruto shippuden an episode that in 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.360
 seriously I've loved you already know that 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.450
 I had a pretty high streak without 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.490
 see naruto shippuden chapters 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.230
 basically by burning you stuffing and if 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.510
 I am aware that the chapter of the 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.449
 last week as it was quite phil al 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.920
 manga but I did not see it and basically seen 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.320
 suddenly this chapter and it has 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.570
 surprised when a chapter really 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.489
 the good and reflect it well in the anime 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.440
 it shows fuck is that you notice in this 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.110
 occasion we have seen how the 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.940
 bagpipe flashback mind your past 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.739
 basically how it ends with death 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.840
 of his father and on the other we have seen 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.000
 how has finally opened the eight 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.800
 doors of the first part of the chapter 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.590
 where we have seen the flash backs of guy 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.940
 with his father just highlight this 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.010
 lesson that is always giving us 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.989
 kishimoto in this series that is that of 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.329
 the effort will pay off and if I am 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.629
 aware that in this chapter good 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.520
 in general with mess with gates is passed 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.439
 too much since doing so much exercise 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.630
 physical is bad for the body but the 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.939
 question is that it weighs pretty well 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.680
 and wants to capture and is the fact that the 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.659
 effort pays off in the sense of 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.850
 that we have seen like in this case guys 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.049
 had put some challenges which in 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.930
 Initially not been able 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.640
 comply but as he is doing or 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.740
 practicing little by little 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.659
 fulfilling as for example giving 500 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.090
 turns at the beginning could not 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.439
 do it and then yes or later when it has 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.170
 seen that that's a part I liked 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.119
 rather that kaka is a genius 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.829
 which then wants to beat guy is like his 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.179
 eternal rival when he has realized 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.890
 that this genius is really being 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:40.110
 striving and of course you together is a genius 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.360
 with a striving and already comes out here 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.759
 mega combination of the host no and clear 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.470
 realizing this caixa put a thousand 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.869
 times as in this case it has been 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.429
 much bigger challenge in this case not 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.929
 are five hundred laps has put five 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:53.789
 a thousand also little by little has gone 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.470
 meeting that challenge and finally has 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.640
 reached the five thousand laps that 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.069
 I wanted to give and good in general 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.049
 basically highlight that although not 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.420
 you get it in the beginning to fulfill your 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.860
 Always persistent goals you'll finish 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.119
 It is basically getting what 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.250
 we can extract from this first part 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.400
 of chapter abone and also death 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.319
 from the father of guy that I've been quite 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.970
 what is basically good because open 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.799
 eight doors to save his son from 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.720
 The seven swordsmen I really like the 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.189
 character of his father and character of guy and 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.170
 if the truth is that it is a flashback that is 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.730
 in this case a story that to me 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.310
 I like it a lot when I saw it in the manga 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.810
 the story of guy and rivals not kaka 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.730
 follow and we are very good history 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.530
 honestly and I think of that first 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.629
 part of the flashback chapter of the 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.430
 piper the guy's past simply 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.019
 highlight that and talking a bit about the 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.090
 second part of the chapter simply 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.000
 say that there are indeed 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.819
 eight doors and good is going to be available to 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.799
 burst the bitch face to wood and not 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.209
 I want to say nothing more about this because 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.859
 as I have seen the manga I know what is going to 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.510
 happen and I do not want to do any kind of 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.799
 spoiler simply say that the 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.379
 transformation what I did not like 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.659
 a lot of this is the formation of eight 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:59.700
 guy doors so to speak is that I 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.720
 he reminded the fucking goku with his hair 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.420
 Red 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.000
 but good though give me your attacks and you 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.160
 I say that they will not disappoint you for 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.350
 nothing in fact you already have a clue what 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.240
 what's going to happen in this fight with that 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.770
 final good when they present us what 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.620
 is going to pass the next chapter that we 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.530
 they comment that these eight doors can 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.660
 overcome the strength of a hockey is coming 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.700
 would be one of the best battles in the 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.100
 Naruto series that is the gas and eight 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.410
 doors against killing the sweet sweet nin 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.030
 cool whores so come on this 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.610
 basically the most important thing that you 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.870
 I wanted to capture about this chapter as 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.459
 always commented on what you have left 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.260

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.270
