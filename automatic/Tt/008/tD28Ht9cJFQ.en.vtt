00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.470
 [Music] 

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.780
 to 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:06.240
 [Music] 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.490
 in this video I show you how to eliminate the 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.490
 pine processionary yourself 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.490
 [Music] 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.239
 the pine processionary is super 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:27.910
 dangerous for people and animals to 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:29.769
 Early autumn starts training 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.929
 of its characteristic white bags in 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.850
 the tops of the pines these bags 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:36.399
 white are going to be their dens during 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.739
 the next months where they nest and leave 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.930
 to play in a more advanced stadium 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.030
 come out of the bags and feed on 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.920
 the pine leaves weakening it and 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.260
 propitiating then the attack of other 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.149
 pests with the arrival of good weather 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.250
 spring the caterpillars go down the 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.870
 trunk and move in procession what 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.909
 that makes them unique and gives them the 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.949
 name for which they are known is 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.409
 so when they are very dangerous 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:02.170
 for people and animals especially in 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:04.659
 children and dogs since each caterpillar has 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:08.060
 500 thousand stinging hairs of effects that 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:10.430
 they can become very serious 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.200
 the traditional solutions are or upload 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.560
 to pine to manually remove the 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.240
 bags or fumigate all the pine leaves 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.399
 of being highly dangerous these 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.890
 actions so I'll show you a 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.630
 simple way by injections to 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.720
 that you can eliminate the processionary from 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.910
 your pin or easily 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.770
 although the plague is more dangerous in 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.600
 spring we must act in anticipation 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.880
 placing some injections in the tree 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.400
 easy to install between 15 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.160
 October and January 15, being the best 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.050
 early autumn season as well the 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.400
 phytosanitary product will penetrate into 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.380
 the vascular system of the pine 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.210
 distributing by the arriving also 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.090
 to caterpillars that eat their leaves 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.770
 poisoning them and killing 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.840
 with only one treatment per year 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.549
 enough to fight this plague that 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.740
 season should repeat a year 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.270
 next the treatment the product 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.280
 chemical that you must enter in 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.579
 Injections to apply to pine is 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.420
 18 percent abamectin 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.520
 marketed normally under the 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.590
 roumette team name in a dose of 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.160
 35 cubic centimeters per each 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.160
 injection 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.769
 The first step is to measure the perimeter of the 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.050
 Pine trunk to calculate the number 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.970
 of injections that we should place already 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.540
 that we should use an injection every 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.280
 20 25 centimeters of perimeter by 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.110
 example for this one meter pine 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.020
 perimeter we will use four 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.090
 injections 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.490
 Then we will pour the product 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.230
 chemist in a glass taking always 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.170
 We manipulate chemical products 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.540
 maximum precautions we use gloves 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.280
 we use filter mask and a 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.390
 clothing that fully protects us the 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.640
 body 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.860
 fill the dosing syringe 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.400
 disposable with the recommended dose of 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.800
 35 cubic centimeters of rome sting that 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.050
 is an insecticide and acaricide that goes 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.790
 to take care of eliminating the processionary of 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.310
 our pine 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.340
 after removing the cap we introduce the 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.829
 tip of the dosing syringe up 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.010
 the stop on the valve immediately 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:13.170
 we will observe how the product is filled 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.629
 that contains the device and only 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.930
 we have to push to introduce the 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:20.849
 phytosanitary product within it 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.099
 once the product has been introduced 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:27.379
 phytosanitary in the injection must be 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:30.420
 apply it to the pine before 72 hours 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:32.900
 we will repeat the process in each injection 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.900
 To place 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.540
 hello, I'm fernando de personal garden 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.940
 point shopper is and I want to invite you to 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.010
 visit my blog or if you're already in the one 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.260
 you encourage him to follow him so you can go 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.360
 comfortably receiving the new ones 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.240
 gardening tips that we go 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.400
 publishing 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.260
 with the ready injections we 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.180
 we headed to the pine to make the 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.690
 holes in the trunk at the height of 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.540
 chest with a 65 millimeter drill 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.120
 for wood or metal and lightly 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.820
 inclined down the holes 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.680
 they must have an approximate depth 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:12.160
 of 4 centimeters for a perimeter of 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.390
 lower trunk at 75 centimeters and 8 inches 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.320
 centimeters for upper perimeters 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.860
 you will find that it is a bit hard 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.810
 but entering and taking out the bit 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:25.540
 regularly to clean the hole not 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.550
 it will cost you a lot of effort 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.350
 you have to make the holes to 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.890
 different heights that do not match 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.630
 all on the same level for example 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:37.240
 down each hole about 10 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.520
 centimeters down 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.620
 we put the connector for its part more 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.660
 long in the hole and with the help of 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.780
 a hammer we make sure that it is 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.550
 fully embedded and we place the 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.680
 injection by pressing up on 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.720
 same time that we turn to thread mode 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.720
 until it is perfectly fitted 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.020
 repeating the same operation for each 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.020
 injection 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:17.349
 [Music] 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:19.509
 in such a way that they will be placed 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:22.029
 at different heights as we commented 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:24.659
 before and they will start to be absorbed 

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:24.659
 by the pine 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.840
 [Music] 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.659
 after three hours remove the 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.310
 injections and the connectors and leave the 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:36.229
 holes as they will be 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:38.390
 Healed by the tree shape 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:41.420
 natural 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.460
 to extract the connectors help yourself 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.470
 a pliers prying on some 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.900
 piece of metal for example simply 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:50.620
 the handle of a scissor since it costs a 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.620
 just take them out 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:58.110
 and you already have your pine vaccinated for 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.180
 fight the processionary 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.130
 if you liked the video you can support us 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.460
