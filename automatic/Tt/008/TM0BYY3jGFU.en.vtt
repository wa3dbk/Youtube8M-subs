exact reason why I hate this

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.089 
exact reason why I hate this
design<00:03:23.860> of<00:03:24.010> a<00:03:24.070> box

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.640 

so<00:03:29.640> here<00:03:29.879> you<00:03:29.999> have<00:03:30.030> your<00:03:30.409> adjustments<00:03:31.409> small

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
so here you have your adjustments small

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.050 
so here you have your adjustments small
medium<00:03:32.159> large<00:03:32.189> whatever<00:03:32.879> like<00:03:33.209> that<00:03:34.730> and<00:03:35.730> here

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
medium large whatever like that and here

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.580 
medium large whatever like that and here
you<00:03:36.209> have<00:03:36.480> your<00:03:36.989> manual<00:03:37.999> so<00:03:38.999> here<00:03:39.209> you<00:03:39.329> have

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
you have your manual so here you have

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.179 
you have your manual so here you have
what<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.829> actual<00:03:41.430> looks<00:03:41.790> like

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:43.189 
what the actual looks like

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:46.099 
what the actual looks like
pitchblack<00:03:44.189> this<00:03:44.790> part<00:03:45.090> goes<00:03:45.269> in<00:03:45.450> your<00:03:45.569> ear

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
pitchblack this part goes in your ear

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.289 
pitchblack this part goes in your ear
I<00:03:46.139> guess<00:03:47.069> this<00:03:47.280> part<00:03:47.489> goes<00:03:47.639> in<00:03:47.790> your<00:03:47.849> upper

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
I guess this part goes in your upper

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.170 
I guess this part goes in your upper
area<00:03:49.139> of<00:03:49.230> your<00:03:49.500> ear<00:03:49.859> it's<00:03:50.310> a<00:03:50.370> hole<00:03:50.549> hold<00:03:50.969> it<00:03:51.120> in

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
area of your ear it's a hole hold it in

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.050 
area of your ear it's a hole hold it in
place<00:03:51.329> and<00:03:51.859> that's<00:03:52.859> the<00:03:53.129> speaker<00:03:53.400> right<00:03:53.700> there

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
place and that's the speaker right there

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.780 
place and that's the speaker right there
so<00:03:54.540> it's<00:03:54.689> a<00:03:54.719> pretty<00:03:54.900> new<00:03:55.139> design<00:03:55.579> it<00:03:56.579> looks

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
so it's a pretty new design it looks

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:57.649 
so it's a pretty new design it looks
pretty<00:03:57.030> different

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 
pretty different

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:01.039 
pretty different
there's<00:03:58.469> the<00:03:58.709> Marshall<00:03:59.219> clip<00:03:59.749> wants<00:04:00.749> to<00:04:00.840> focus

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
there's the Marshall clip wants to focus

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.659 
there's the Marshall clip wants to focus
it<00:04:01.500> says<00:04:01.680> Marshall<00:04:02.069> right<00:04:02.189> there

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:02.669 
it says Marshall right there

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:05.569 
it says Marshall right there
there<00:04:03.030> we<00:04:03.120> go<00:04:03.540> and<00:04:03.629> then<00:04:04.500> here<00:04:04.739> is<00:04:04.889> the<00:04:05.069> input

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
there we go and then here is the input

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.390 
there we go and then here is the input
thing<00:04:06.209> I<00:04:06.480> like<00:04:07.439> the<00:04:07.469> way<00:04:07.709> they<00:04:07.980> made<00:04:08.189> it

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
thing I like the way they made it

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.030 
thing I like the way they made it
there's<00:04:09.060> a<00:04:09.150> coil<00:04:09.419> here<00:04:09.599> I<00:04:10.109> don't<00:04:10.260> know<00:04:10.439> why<00:04:10.680> I

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
there's a coil here I don't know why I

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.470 
there's a coil here I don't know why I
don't<00:04:11.219> know<00:04:11.280> what<00:04:11.400> that<00:04:11.489> does<00:04:11.730> to<00:04:11.790> protect<00:04:12.359> it

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
don't know what that does to protect it

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.839 
don't know what that does to protect it
I<00:04:12.569> guess<00:04:13.069> and<00:04:14.069> then<00:04:14.280> it<00:04:14.340> has<00:04:14.489> a<00:04:14.519> little<00:04:14.760> nice

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
I guess and then it has a little nice

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.930 
I guess and then it has a little nice
little<00:04:15.229> metal<00:04:16.229> feel<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.799> this<00:04:16.919> what<00:04:17.400> is<00:04:17.609> metal

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
little metal feel to this what is metal

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:23.180
