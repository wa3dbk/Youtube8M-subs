we've got that new air fork and it's

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.800 
we've got that new air fork and it's
definitely<00:01:07.680> moving<00:01:08.340> forward<00:01:08.880> it's<00:01:09.479> just<00:01:09.689> a

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
definitely moving forward it's just a

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.410 
definitely moving forward it's just a
matter<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:10.110> fine-tuning<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:12.680> it's<00:01:14.119> today<00:01:15.119> like

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
matter of fine-tuning it it's today like

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.410 
matter of fine-tuning it it's today like
two<00:01:15.780> top-10<00:01:16.200> finishes<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:17.090> flipped<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.210> off<00:01:18.299> the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
two top-10 finishes I flipped it off the

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.580 
two top-10 finishes I flipped it off the
start<00:01:18.750> which<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.200> kind<00:01:19.650> unusual<00:01:20.220> but<00:01:20.970> yeah<00:01:21.600> to

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
start which is kind unusual but yeah to

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.350 
start which is kind unusual but yeah to
finish<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.130> top<00:01:23.340> tens<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.790> guess<00:01:24.000> it's<00:01:24.210> better

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
finish to top tens I guess it's better

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.660 
finish to top tens I guess it's better
than<00:01:24.540> what<00:01:24.689> we<00:01:24.840> have<00:01:24.990> been<00:01:25.170> doing<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.680> we've

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
than what we have been doing and we've

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.270 
than what we have been doing and we've
got<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.790> lot<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.000> improve<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:28.009> with<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.130> back

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
got a lot to improve and with the back

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.340 
got a lot to improve and with the back
with<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.610> team<00:01:29.880> just<00:01:30.689> with<00:01:30.869> everything<00:01:30.990> in

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
with the team just with everything in

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.580 
with the team just with everything in
general<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.890> think<00:01:32.490> as<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.630> rounds<00:01:33.960> go<00:01:34.110> on<00:01:34.320> I

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
general I think as the rounds go on I

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.800 
general I think as the rounds go on I
think<00:01:35.340> that<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.880> big<00:01:36.270> break<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.659> we're

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
think that that big break that we're

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.660 
think that that big break that we're
going<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.020> have<00:01:37.170> will<00:01:37.320> be<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.770> really<00:01:38.549> good

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
going to have will be a really good

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.899 
going to have will be a really good

but<00:01:57.570> uh<00:01:57.630> salvage<00:01:58.590> as<00:01:58.710> much<00:01:58.740> points<00:01:59.220> as

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
but uh salvage as much points as

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.780 
but uh salvage as much points as
possible<00:01:59.400> and<00:01:59.970> just<00:02:00.470> I<00:02:01.470> think<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.310> was<00:02:02.460> not<00:02:02.610> too

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
possible and just I think it was not too

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.789 
possible and just I think it was not too
bad<00:02:04.159> second<00:02:05.159> moto<00:02:05.369> got<00:02:06.330> away<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.799> pretty

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
bad second moto got away to a pretty

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.380 
bad second moto got away to a pretty
average<00:02:07.979> start<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.759> work<00:02:08.910> my<00:02:09.090> way<00:02:09.119> up<00:02:09.270> to

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
average start and work my way up to

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.190 
average start and work my way up to
fourth<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.140> they<00:02:11.009> all<00:02:11.160> pass<00:02:11.400> about<00:02:11.730> halfway

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
fourth and they all pass about halfway
