00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
and rubbed it in all over the black

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.020 
and rubbed it in all over the black
suede<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.200> now<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.799> kind<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.189> dried<00:02:05.490> out<00:02:05.520> the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
suede and now it kind of dried out the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.779 
suede and now it kind of dried out the
suede<00:02:06.360> like<00:02:06.689> material<00:02:07.409> but<00:02:08.160> that's<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.700> know

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789

suede like material but that's you know
that's<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.090> good<00:02:09.270> thing<00:02:09.450> in<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:10.250> restored<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.430> to

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
that's a good thing in it restored it to

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.100 
that's a good thing in it restored it to
that

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
that

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.920 
that
jool<00:02:12.550> you<00:02:13.550> know<00:02:13.700> nice<00:02:13.970> dark<00:02:14.570> black<00:02:15.320> color<00:02:16.070> and

jool you know nice dark black color and

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.010 
jool you know nice dark black color and
when<00:02:17.930> it<00:02:18.050> came<00:02:18.260> to<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.920> toe<00:02:19.430> box<00:02:19.700> itself<00:02:20.300> there

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
when it came to the toe box itself there

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.770 
when it came to the toe box itself there
was<00:02:21.110> actually<00:02:21.560> a<00:02:21.590> hole<00:02:22.070> on<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.520> left<00:02:23.060> shoe

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
was actually a hole on the left shoe

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.720 
was actually a hole on the left shoe
there<00:02:23.960> were<00:02:24.050> two<00:02:24.320> holes<00:02:24.560> one<00:02:25.280> that<00:02:25.550> was

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
there were two holes one that was

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.630 
there were two holes one that was
actually<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:26.750> huge<00:02:27.560> hole<00:02:27.800> and<00:02:28.100> then<00:02:28.220> another

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
actually a huge hole and then another

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.510 
actually a huge hole and then another
hole<00:02:28.970> that<00:02:29.300> was<00:02:29.770> starting<00:02:30.770> that<00:02:30.950> had<00:02:31.130> quite

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
hole that was starting that had quite

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.260 
hole that was starting that had quite
gone<00:02:31.880> to<00:02:32.240> the<00:02:32.510> second<00:02:33.110> layer<00:02:33.320> but<00:02:34.070> I<00:02:34.340> remedied

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
gone to the second layer but I remedied

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.230 
gone to the second layer but I remedied
that<00:02:35.660> problem<00:02:36.290> by<00:02:36.500> finding<00:02:37.370> patches<00:02:38.000> that<00:02:38.209> I

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
that problem by finding patches that I

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.110 
that problem by finding patches that I
had<00:02:38.420> just<00:02:38.690> laying<00:02:38.959> around<00:02:39.520> they<00:02:40.520> were<00:02:40.580> closed

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
had just laying around they were closed

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.540 
had just laying around they were closed
patches<00:02:41.630> so<00:02:41.870> I<00:02:41.930> just<00:02:42.230> kind<00:02:43.070> of<00:02:43.190> drew<00:02:43.430> out<00:02:43.520> a

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
patches so I just kind of drew out a

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.330 
patches so I just kind of drew out a
design<00:02:43.910> and<00:02:44.600> then<00:02:45.170> cut<00:02:45.680> them<00:02:45.830> out<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:46.040> of

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
design and then cut them out and of

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.280 
design and then cut them out and of
course<00:02:46.580> if<00:02:46.760> I<00:02:46.820> did<00:02:47.030> it<00:02:47.150> to<00:02:47.270> one<00:02:47.450> shoe<00:02:47.780> I<00:02:47.810> had<00:02:48.110> to

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
course if I did it to one shoe I had to

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.880 
course if I did it to one shoe I had to
do<00:02:48.470> it<00:02:48.620> to<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:49.100> other<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.970> patch<00:02:50.209> was<00:02:50.510> blue<00:02:51.350> so

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
do it to the other the patch was blue so

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.400 
do it to the other the patch was blue so
I<00:02:51.950> had<00:02:52.100> to<00:02:52.370> just<00:02:52.670> paint<00:02:53.000> over<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:53.870> material

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
I had to just paint over the material

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.510 
I had to just paint over the material
with<00:02:55.040> my<00:02:56.030> same<00:02:56.360> black<00:02:56.930> paint<00:02:57.260> that<00:02:57.440> I<00:02:57.470> use<00:02:57.830> on

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
with my same black paint that I use on

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.140 
with my same black paint that I use on
the<00:02:58.970> midsole<00:02:59.450> um<00:03:00.140> I<00:03:00.800> just<00:03:01.550> wanted<00:03:01.820> to<00:03:01.970> make

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
the midsole um I just wanted to make

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.510 
the midsole um I just wanted to make
something<00:03:02.540> that<00:03:02.870> looked<00:03:03.250> you<00:03:04.250> know<00:03:04.370> that

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:04.520 
something that looked you know that

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.580 
something that looked you know that
wasn't<00:03:04.730> too<00:03:05.090> obvious<00:03:05.630> but<00:03:05.900> looks<00:03:06.140> somewhat

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
wasn't too obvious but looks somewhat

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.190 
wasn't too obvious but looks somewhat
cool<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:07.430> I've<00:03:07.610> seen<00:03:07.880> designs<00:03:08.480> like<00:03:08.750> this<00:03:08.989> on

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
cool and I've seen designs like this on

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.800 
cool and I've seen designs like this on
toe<00:03:09.530> caps<00:03:09.830> before<00:03:10.100> and<00:03:10.640> so<00:03:11.090> that's<00:03:11.300> what<00:03:11.540> kind

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
toe caps before and so that's what kind

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.470 
toe caps before and so that's what kind
of<00:03:11.930> gave<00:03:12.170> me<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.560> idea<00:03:12.680> an<00:03:13.640> inspiration<00:03:14.450> to

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
of gave me the idea an inspiration to

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.229 
of gave me the idea an inspiration to
kind<00:03:15.110> of<00:03:15.170> resolve<00:03:15.500> this<00:03:15.770> problem<00:03:16.370> that<00:03:17.000> way

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
kind of resolve this problem that way

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.070 
kind of resolve this problem that way
but<00:03:17.780> other<00:03:18.019> than<00:03:18.290> that<00:03:18.350> I<00:03:19.000> would<00:03:20.000> say<00:03:20.239> this<00:03:20.750> up

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
but other than that I would say this up

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.740 
but other than that I would say this up
this<00:03:21.799> was<00:03:22.040> a<00:03:22.070> pretty<00:03:22.459> nice<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:23.360> fun

that's<00:03:46.140> one<00:03:46.380> of<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:46.560> main<00:03:46.770> features<00:03:47.310> of<00:03:47.340> this

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 
that's one of the main features of this

that's one of the main features of this
shoe<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:49.080> but<00:03:49.410> when<00:03:49.560> it<00:03:49.680> comes<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.540> comfort

shoe and but when it comes to comfort

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.860 
shoe and but when it comes to comfort
and<00:03:51.990> sizing<00:03:52.650> I<00:03:52.800> would<00:03:52.980> say<00:03:53.250> definitely<00:03:53.690> go<00:03:54.690> at

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
and sizing I would say definitely go at

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.340 
and sizing I would say definitely go at
least<00:03:55.080> the<00:03:55.410> half-size<00:03:55.890> up<00:03:56.220> more<00:03:56.490> for<00:03:56.850> size

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
least the half-size up more for size

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.170 
least the half-size up more for size
because<00:03:58.350> I<00:03:58.560> have<00:03:58.740> these<00:03:58.950> in<00:03:59.340> my<00:03:59.370> size<00:03:59.790> and<00:04:00.120> I

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
because I have these in my size and I

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.320 
because I have these in my size and I
would<00:04:00.420> say<00:04:00.690> they've<00:04:01.290> is<00:04:01.530> a<00:04:01.740> little<00:04:02.190> bit<00:04:02.370> small

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
would say they've is a little bit small

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.830 
would say they've is a little bit small
because<00:04:03.900> they<00:04:04.290> fit<00:04:04.590> if<00:04:05.280> it's<00:04:05.580> snug<00:04:06.030> if<00:04:06.480> you<00:04:06.600> ask

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
because they fit if it's snug if you ask

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.760 
because they fit if it's snug if you ask
me<00:04:07.140> um<00:04:08.030> lengthwise<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.720> know<00:04:09.840> in<00:04:09.960> the<00:04:10.080> toes<00:04:10.380> it
