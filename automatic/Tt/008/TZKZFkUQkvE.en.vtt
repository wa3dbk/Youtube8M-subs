on this one I'm fully poseable you can
actually<00:03:42.130> put<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.690> these<00:03:43.690> sort<00:03:43.870> of<00:03:43.900> spines<00:03:44.200> up

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
actually put the these sort of spines up

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.380 
actually put the these sort of spines up
down<00:03:44.650> left<00:03:44.890> right
