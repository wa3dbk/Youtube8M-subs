remove that bill and then on the second

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.050 
remove that bill and then on the second
pulley<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.840> motor<00:01:22.340> there's<00:01:23.340> another<00:01:23.729> belt

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
pulley on the motor there's another belt

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.789 
pulley on the motor there's another belt
which<00:01:24.330> runs<00:01:24.570> back<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.350> transmission

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
which runs back to the transmission

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.840 
which runs back to the transmission
pulley<00:01:27.500> remove<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.710> belt<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.159> then<00:01:29.579> follow

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
pulley remove that belt and then follow

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.230 
pulley remove that belt and then follow
the<00:01:30.060> same<00:01:30.240> process<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:32.040> thicker<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.939> two

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
the same process the thicker of the two

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.460 
the same process the thicker of the two
belts<00:01:33.829> in<00:01:34.829> case<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.840> you<00:01:36.840> know<00:01:37.079> lose<00:01:37.320> your

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
belts in case you you know lose your

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.289 
belts in case you you know lose your
place<00:01:37.650> as<00:01:38.009> you're<00:01:38.159> going<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.850> thicker<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
place as you're going the thicker of the

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.149 
place as you're going the thicker of the
two<00:01:39.390> belts<00:01:39.720> will<00:01:39.960> run<00:01:40.140> on<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.409> top<00:01:40.590> pulley<00:01:41.040> of

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
two belts will run on the top pulley of

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:47.300 
two belts will run on the top pulley of
the<00:01:41.280> motor<00:01:43.579> to<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.610> transmission<00:01:46.130> and<00:01:47.130> it's

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
the motor to the transmission and it's

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.789 
the motor to the transmission and it's
easiest<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.119> put<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.390> on<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.600> motor<00:01:48.810> pulley

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
easiest to put it on the motor pulley

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.380 
easiest to put it on the motor pulley
first<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.670> then<00:01:50.790> spin<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.329> around<00:01:51.470> on<00:01:52.470> your

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
first and then spin it around on your

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.149 
first and then spin it around on your
transmission<00:01:54.390> pulley<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:55.560> thinner<00:01:55.829> belt

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
transmission pulley the thinner belt

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.090 
transmission pulley the thinner belt
will<00:01:57.060> run<00:01:57.329> from<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.869> bottom<00:01:58.530> pulley<00:01:58.770> on<00:01:58.979> the

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
will run from the bottom pulley on the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.260 
will run from the bottom pulley on the
motor<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.229> pull

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.719 

to<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.420> pump<00:02:06.630> pulley<00:02:06.960> just<00:02:07.500> spin<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.580> that

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
to the pump pulley just spin it and that

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.360 
to the pump pulley just spin it and that
should<00:02:08.910> get<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.270> on<00:02:09.450> there<00:02:09.660> just<00:02:09.899> fine<00:02:10.370> and

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
should get it on there just fine and

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.520 
should get it on there just fine and
they're<00:02:11.550> just<00:02:11.730> gonna<00:02:11.910> follow<00:02:12.600> the<00:02:12.870> same<00:02:13.080> from

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
they're just gonna follow the same from

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.700 
they're just gonna follow the same from
steps<00:02:13.830> putting<00:02:14.250> her<00:02:14.340> back<00:02:14.490> together
