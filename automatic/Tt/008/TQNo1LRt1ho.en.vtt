00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.360
 and I think I arrived and I arrived thanks 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.250
 for being here again on my channel and 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.059
 this day we are going to talk about how to stop 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.059
 be shy 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.830
 the shy one is a state of mind that 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.380
 affect personal relationships now 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.970
 it's bad to be shy or not in my case 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.140
 personal I am a very shy person 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.849
 but the fact that I'm doing 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.189
 youtube in front of a camera has 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.720
 helped a lot to break that shyness now 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.759
 when I was very young to me sometimes 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.650
 It was scary to be able to declare a girlfriend 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.480
 or a person tell him that I liked and 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.480
 I never knew if I really liked 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.760
 that person because fear rejection or 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.470
 something that you could tell me now is so much 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.870
 the first is that I have not already 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:47.050
 I have five children a greeting to michaels 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.850
 he and justin the ceo and lukas to come 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.100
 then as you see the team is a mere 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.809
 Rejection just as they will say then is something 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.460
 we have to fight against what we have to fight 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.620
 fight with our fears 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.450
 not the truth, that's a joke, not that 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.190
 kind of scary but must fight 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.379
 against your fears if you want to get to 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.750
 progress in your life how to make money or 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.729
 have a girlfriend or in any case be 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.800
 famous is why I'm not famous 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.930
 but I know it's hard to stop being 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.550
 shy I know that one experiences a 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.680
 anxiety when one speaks with a 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.670
 person who does not know hello how about how 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.549
 we're 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.079
 then your name is 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.079
 How are you doing and what are you waiting for? 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.270
 shyness is overcome with actions you must 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.190
 act you must develop the habit 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.650
 take a challenge to talk with new 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.840
 people will feel discomfort or nerves 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.910
 but without ever acting never overcome the 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.530
 shyness that is in a nutshell 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.540
 you have to break the ice 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.580
 you have to give yourself the eggs to be able to 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.470
 get out of that shyness to be able to tell 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.870
 to that woman that you like who wants to be 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.880
 your girlfriend or tell your boss the position that 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.770
 you deserve the best opportunities in 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.930
 life comes through people 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.970
 that we know but now tell me if I never 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.500
 they know new people how can we 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.260
 know if those people bring new 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.570
 opportunities for you and they will have toned 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.850
 net net as we apply this to the 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.920
 gamers this is like a video game and the 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.040
 time is about to end and you do not arrive 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.620
 to the goal you lose begins to act 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.960
 today before the time is up, win 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.300
 shyness I know it's easy to say and 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.370
 difficult to do but that's what it's about 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.170
 What is more expensive in life is what 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.240
 Ok, well, I 'm playing, I'm 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.280

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.900
