you're done but slowly one of the
snapshots<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.090> think<00:01:33.299> in<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.540> same<00:01:33.780> one

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
snapshots and I think in the same one

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.490 
snapshots and I think in the same one
maybe

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
maybe

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.410

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
since then for the nuggets and this

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.840

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
boost effect the same is the one that

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.200 
boost effect the same is the one that
was<00:01:48.729> in<00:01:48.760> that<00:01:48.970> command<00:01:49.270> block<00:01:50.940> now<00:01:51.940> it<00:01:52.090> gives

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
was in that command block now it gives

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.620 
was in that command block now it gives
this<00:01:52.479> absorption<00:01:53.290> effect<00:01:53.950> which<00:01:54.280> um<00:01:54.580> I<00:01:54.880> really

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
this absorption effect which um I really

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.630 
this absorption effect which um I really
don't<00:01:55.810> know<00:01:55.960> how<00:01:56.200> it<00:01:56.380> works<00:01:56.560> it's<00:01:56.860> like<00:01:56.950> it

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
don't know how it works it's like it

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.520 
don't know how it works it's like it
like<00:01:57.790> absorbs<00:01:58.330> the<00:01:58.540> damage<00:01:58.990> and<00:01:59.170> then<00:01:59.380> you

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
like absorbs the damage and then you

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.469 
like absorbs the damage and then you
like<00:01:59.740> regenerate<00:02:00.610> it<00:02:00.759> later<00:02:00.970> I<00:02:01.060> haven't

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
like regenerate it later I haven't

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:02.730 
like regenerate it later I haven't
messed<00:02:01.630> with<00:02:01.810> it<00:02:02.020> too<00:02:02.140> much<00:02:02.320> and<00:02:02.500> I've<00:02:02.560> only

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
messed with it too much and I've only

messed with it too much and I've only
seen<00:02:02.860> like<00:02:03.220> one<00:02:03.550> video<00:02:04.240> on<00:02:04.690> it<00:02:04.869> and<00:02:05.050> the<00:02:05.200> hearts

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
seen like one video on it and the hearts

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.270 
seen like one video on it and the hearts
are<00:02:05.560> gold<00:02:05.890> too<00:02:06.330> so<00:02:07.330> I<00:02:07.840> guess<00:02:08.020> that<00:02:08.440> signifies

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
are gold too so I guess that signifies

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.170 
are gold too so I guess that signifies
it's<00:02:10.000> different<00:02:11.580> gives<00:02:12.580> it<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.820> you<00:02:12.880> for<00:02:13.060> like

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
it's different gives it to you for like

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:24.120 
it's different gives it to you for like
a<00:02:13.209> minute<00:02:20.700> but<00:02:22.350> here's<00:02:23.350> something<00:02:23.650> that<00:02:23.980> would

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
a minute but here's something that would

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.740 
a minute but here's something that would
have<00:02:24.220> worked<00:02:24.459> a<00:02:24.670> lot<00:02:24.850> better<00:02:25.150> in<00:02:25.540> where

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
have worked a lot better in where

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.050 
have worked a lot better in where
earlier<00:02:26.140> snapshots<00:02:26.890> uh-oh<00:02:27.280> P<00:02:27.519> health<00:02:27.760> tank

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
earlier snapshots uh-oh P health tank

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.170 
earlier snapshots uh-oh P health tank
mode<00:02:28.300> what<00:02:28.900> this<00:02:29.080> is<00:02:29.320> is<00:02:29.560> health<00:02:30.280> boost<00:02:30.519> 100

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
mode what this is is health boost 100

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.650 
mode what this is is health boost 100
and<00:02:31.390> regeneration<00:02:32.489> 50<00:02:33.489> yeah<00:02:33.700> I<00:02:33.940> changed<00:02:34.330> it<00:02:34.660> oh

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
and regeneration 50 yeah I changed it oh

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.860 
and regeneration 50 yeah I changed it oh
yeah

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
yeah

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.340 
yeah
it<00:02:38.019> used<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.410> be<00:02:39.360> health<00:02:40.360> boost<00:02:40.570> 100<00:02:41.170> and

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
it used to be health boost 100 and

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.979 
it used to be health boost 100 and
regeneration<00:02:42.040> 100<00:02:42.549> so<00:02:42.760> you<00:02:42.820> get<00:02:43.269> a<00:02:43.480> bunch<00:02:43.810> of

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
regeneration 100 so you get a bunch of

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.900 
regeneration 100 so you get a bunch of
rows<00:02:44.170> of<00:02:44.320> hearts<00:02:44.500> and<00:02:44.799> regenerated<00:02:45.400> on<00:02:45.519> almost

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
rows of hearts and regenerated on almost

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.090 
rows of hearts and regenerated on almost
instantly

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.850 

finish<00:02:51.000> your<00:02:51.030> generating<00:02:51.540> but<00:02:51.990> um<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.620> gave

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
finish your generating but um it gave

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.160 
finish your generating but um it gave
you<00:02:53.070> up<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.400> 18<00:02:53.940> rows<00:02:54.180> of<00:02:54.360> parts<00:02:54.660> which<00:02:54.870> is<00:02:55.050> the

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
you up to 18 rows of parts which is the

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.780 
you up to 18 rows of parts which is the
top<00:02:55.380> of<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.590> screen<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:56.130> counting<00:02:56.520> all<00:02:56.640> that

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
top of the screen and counting all that

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.550 
top of the screen and counting all that
that<00:02:56.970> is<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.120> hundred<00:02:57.420> eighty<00:02:57.870> hearts<00:02:58.490> dang<00:03:00.560> but

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
that is a hundred eighty hearts dang but

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.470 
that is a hundred eighty hearts dang but
what<00:03:01.860> it<00:03:01.950> does<00:03:02.070> now<00:03:02.370> is<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.940> don't<00:03:03.000> like<00:03:03.210> it<00:03:03.420> if

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
much health least it likes crunches all

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.020 
much health least it likes crunches all
the<00:03:07.620> hearts<00:03:07.830> together<00:03:08.160> and<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:08.460> can't<00:03:08.700> see

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
the hearts together and you can't see

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.270 
the hearts together and you can't see
anything<00:03:09.300> I<00:03:09.780> really<00:03:10.260> don't<00:03:10.590> like<00:03:10.740> it<00:03:10.950> like<00:03:11.160> you

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
can't tell how many hearts you have

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.910 
can't tell how many hearts you have
unless<00:03:13.020> you<00:03:13.200> want<00:03:13.350> to<00:03:13.410> take<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.620> time<00:03:13.770> to

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
unless you want to take the time to

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.910 
unless you want to take the time to
count<00:03:14.130> them<00:03:14.370> but<00:03:15.060> um<00:03:15.270> I<00:03:15.570> still<00:03:16.290> kind<00:03:16.590> of<00:03:16.740> like

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
count them but um I still kind of like

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.740 
count them but um I still kind of like
the<00:03:17.100> way<00:03:17.220> it<00:03:17.280> works<00:03:17.520> like<00:03:17.880> I<00:03:18.060> just<00:03:18.120> did<00:03:18.570> it<00:03:18.690> a

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
the way it works like I just did it a

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.030 
the way it works like I just did it a
little<00:03:18.900> it's<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.820> booster<00:03:21.200> booster<00:03:22.200> 29<00:03:22.770> which

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
little it's a booster booster 29 which

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.490 
little it's a booster booster 29 which
rounds<00:03:23.340> it<00:03:23.430> up<00:03:23.550> to<00:03:23.700> 30<00:03:23.880> and<00:03:24.180> regen<00:03:24.720> 50<00:03:25.140> which<00:03:25.320> I

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
rounds it up to 30 and regen 50 which I

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.350 
rounds it up to 30 and regen 50 which I
saved<00:03:25.980> that<00:03:26.220> one<00:03:26.400> it's<00:03:26.550> almost<00:03:26.730> instantly<00:03:27.180> cuz

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
saved that one it's almost instantly cuz

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.120 
saved that one it's almost instantly cuz
we<00:03:27.480> have<00:03:27.570> way<00:03:27.750> less<00:03:27.780> hearts<00:03:28.260> as<00:03:28.709> you<00:03:28.770> can<00:03:29.010> see

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
we have way less hearts as you can see

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.340 
we have way less hearts as you can see
we<00:03:29.250> have<00:03:29.400> one<00:03:29.430> two<00:03:29.850> three<00:03:29.880> four<00:03:30.570> five<00:03:30.990> six

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350

we have one two three four five six
seven<00:03:31.770> rows<00:03:32.100> of<00:03:32.340> hearts<00:03:32.610> and<00:03:33.320> it<00:03:34.320> does<00:03:34.590> take<00:03:34.860> a

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
seven rows of hearts and it does take a

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.110 
seven rows of hearts and it does take a
fair<00:03:35.310> while<00:03:35.640> to<00:03:35.910> die<00:03:37.430> and<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.610> regeneration

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
fair while to die and the regeneration

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.050 
fair while to die and the regeneration
oh<00:03:41.810> well<00:03:42.810> I<00:03:43.110> forgot<00:03:43.470> to<00:03:43.650> change<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.100> region<00:03:44.430> to

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
oh well I forgot to change the region to

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.309 
oh well I forgot to change the region to
less<00:03:45.959> time

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:04:01.780 

see<00:03:58.780> like<00:03:59.780> 30<00:04:00.200> seconds<00:04:00.769> is<00:04:00.889> good<00:04:01.069> you<00:04:01.760> know

see like 30 seconds is good you know
that'll<00:04:02.120> make<00:04:02.299> this<00:04:02.450> a<00:04:02.510> lot<00:04:02.749> more<00:04:02.959> balanced

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
really had a lot of potential

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:25.270 
really had a lot of potential
I'd<00:04:24.140> really<00:04:24.320> wish<00:04:24.560> they'd<00:04:24.740> try<00:04:24.920> to<00:04:24.950> bend<00:04:25.160> this
