well Digimon racing has a lot fewer
tracks<00:02:46.340> but<00:02:46.760> what<00:02:46.939> it<00:02:47.060> does<00:02:47.239> is<00:02:47.450> you<00:02:47.689> know

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
tracks but what it does is you know

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:50.199 
tracks but what it does is you know
sometimes<00:02:48.470> put<00:02:48.709> certain<00:02:48.950> tracks<00:02:49.340> in<00:02:49.640> multiple

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
sometimes put certain tracks in multiple

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.119 
sometimes put certain tracks in multiple
cups<00:02:50.450> it's<00:02:51.049> like<00:02:51.200> you<00:02:51.590> know<00:02:51.680> this<00:02:51.860> snowy

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
cups it's like you know this snowy

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.339 
cups it's like you know this snowy
mountain<00:02:52.610> it's<00:02:52.970> in<00:02:53.150> the<00:02:53.239> frozen<00:02:53.659> Cup<00:02:53.900> it's

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
mountain it's in the frozen Cup it's

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.229 
mountain it's in the frozen Cup it's

also in the Mountain Cup now it's kind

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.449 
also in the Mountain Cup now it's kind
of<00:02:56.299> a<00:02:56.360> cheap<00:02:56.599> way<00:02:56.629> to<00:02:56.810> add<00:02:57.019> more<00:02:57.260> cups<00:02:57.560> but<00:02:57.890> it

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
of a cheap way to add more cups but it

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.819 
of a cheap way to add more cups but it
it<00:02:58.940> also<00:02:59.090> adds<00:02:59.510> more<00:02:59.720> cups<00:03:00.049> and<00:03:00.440> it's<00:03:00.620> cool

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
it also adds more cups and it's cool

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.740 
it also adds more cups and it's cool
it's<00:03:01.040> like<00:03:01.129> it's<00:03:01.640> like<00:03:01.700> grouping<00:03:02.209> horses

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
it's like it's like grouping horses

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.410 
it's like it's like grouping horses
based<00:03:03.019> on<00:03:03.200> similar<00:03:03.650> characteristics<00:03:04.159> so<00:03:05.060> even

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
based on similar characteristics so even

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.479 
based on similar characteristics so even
though<00:03:05.540> tracks<00:03:05.870> repeat<00:03:06.349> the<00:03:06.769> cups<00:03:07.010> do<00:03:07.280> have

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
though tracks repeat the cups do have

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.789 
though tracks repeat the cups do have
their<00:03:07.700> own<00:03:07.819> feel<00:03:08.120> but<00:03:09.019> you<00:03:09.109> know<00:03:09.200> one<00:03:09.500> area

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
their own feel but you know one area

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.619 
their own feel but you know one area
where<00:03:09.980> Mario<00:03:10.400> Kart<00:03:10.700> clones<00:03:10.970> always<00:03:11.390> seem<00:03:11.599> to

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
where Mario Kart clones always seem to

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.140 
where Mario Kart clones always seem to
fall<00:03:11.930> short<00:03:11.959> is<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:12.829> weapons<00:03:13.400> Digimon<00:03:14.120> racing
