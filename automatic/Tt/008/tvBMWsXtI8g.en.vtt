to<00:01:37.710> use<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.070> one<00:01:38.310> because<00:01:38.340> I<00:01:38.760> think<00:01:39.210> its

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
to use this one because I think its

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.180 
to use this one because I think its
closest<00:01:41.660> closest<00:01:42.660> to<00:01:42.900> a<00:01:42.930> teleport<00:01:43.710> location
