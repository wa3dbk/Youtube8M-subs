somewhat<00:07:04.020> the<00:07:04.140> look<00:07:04.290> I<00:07:04.380> was<00:07:04.530> going<00:07:04.620> for<00:07:04.860> I

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:05.070 
somewhat the look I was going for I

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.100

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.260 
think next time i'll use only the blue
ones<00:07:07.350> so<00:07:07.950> that<00:07:07.980> my<00:07:08.220> curls<00:07:08.580> will<00:07:08.700> be<00:07:08.880> smaller
