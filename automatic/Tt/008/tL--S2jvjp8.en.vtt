00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
hi welcome back to educator calm this is

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.990 
hi welcome back to educator calm this is
the<00:00:02.700> lesson<00:00:03.000> on<00:00:03.120> blood<00:00:03.419> vessels<00:00:04.759> so<00:00:05.759> we<00:00:05.850> look

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
the lesson on blood vessels so we look

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.190 
the lesson on blood vessels so we look
at<00:00:06.089> all<00:00:06.180> the<00:00:06.210> blood<00:00:06.390> vessels<00:00:06.779> in<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:06.930> human

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
at all the blood vessels in the human

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.009 
at all the blood vessels in the human
body<00:00:07.379> there<00:00:08.220> are<00:00:08.250> several<00:00:08.490> types<00:00:09.019> arteries

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
body there are several types arteries

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.540 
body there are several types arteries
are<00:00:10.290> all<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.500> blood<00:00:10.679> vessels<00:00:10.710> that<00:00:11.160> take

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
are all the blood vessels that take

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.730 
are all the blood vessels that take
blood<00:00:11.820> out<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.420> heart<00:00:12.450> they<00:00:13.320> tend<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:13.590> be

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
blood out of the heart they tend to be

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.650 
blood out of the heart they tend to be
thick<00:00:14.070> they<00:00:14.340> tend<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.549> be<00:00:14.639> very<00:00:14.849> strong<00:00:15.299> very

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
thick they tend to be very strong very

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.269 
thick they tend to be very strong very
tough<00:00:15.900> because<00:00:16.289> you<00:00:16.560> got<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.710> lot<00:00:16.890> of<00:00:16.980> blood

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
tough because you got a lot of blood

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.060 
tough because you got a lot of blood
shooting<00:00:17.640> through<00:00:17.910> them<00:00:18.090> so<00:00:18.240> they<00:00:18.330> need<00:00:18.480> to<00:00:18.510> be

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
shooting through them so they need to be

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.920 
shooting through them so they need to be
arterioles<00:00:20.070> are<00:00:20.340> like<00:00:20.640> mini<00:00:21.180> arteries<00:00:21.689> that

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
arterioles are like mini arteries that

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.650 
arterioles are like mini arteries that
branch<00:00:21.990> off<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:23.010> so<00:00:23.160> think<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.730> arteries<00:00:24.480> as

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
branch off of it so think of arteries as

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.620 
branch off of it so think of arteries as
like<00:00:24.869> freeways<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.430> then<00:00:26.970> arterioles<00:00:27.539> are

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
like freeways and then arterioles are

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.960 
like freeways and then arterioles are
kind<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:27.960> like<00:00:28.109> off<00:00:28.260> ramps<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.039> eventually

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
kind of like off ramps and eventually

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.939 
kind of like off ramps and eventually
you<00:00:30.390> get<00:00:30.539> into<00:00:30.779> tiny<00:00:31.019> little<00:00:31.230> residential

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
you get into tiny little residential

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.250 
you get into tiny little residential
streets<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.759> are<00:00:32.850> oftentimes<00:00:33.090> smaller<00:00:33.809> and

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
streets that are oftentimes smaller and

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.470 
streets that are oftentimes smaller and
and<00:00:34.890> take<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.489> all<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.730> specific<00:00:36.239> places

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
and take you to all the specific places

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.750 
and take you to all the specific places
in<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.809> neighborhood<00:00:37.489> capillaries<00:00:38.489> are<00:00:38.640> like

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
in a neighborhood capillaries are like

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.970 
in a neighborhood capillaries are like
that<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.629> smallest<00:00:40.079> blood<00:00:40.379> vessels<00:00:40.440> that

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
that the smallest blood vessels that

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.190 
that the smallest blood vessels that
come<00:00:41.190> off<00:00:41.399> from<00:00:41.610> arteries<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.239> physically

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
come off from arteries and physically

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.440 
come off from arteries and physically
take<00:00:43.469> blood<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.430> oxygen<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.000> nutrients

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
take blood and the oxygen and nutrients

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.479 
take blood and the oxygen and nutrients
inside<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.230> blood<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.100> cells<00:00:47.340> that

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
inside of the blood to the cells that

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.029 
inside of the blood to the cells that
need<00:00:47.670> them<00:00:47.910> all<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:49.170> those<00:00:49.289> capillaries

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
need them all of those capillaries

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.799 
need them all of those capillaries
eventually<00:00:50.789> come<00:00:51.750> together<00:00:52.550> to<00:00:53.550> form<00:00:53.820> venules

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
eventually come together to form venules

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.799 
eventually come together to form venules
so<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.739> venules<00:00:56.070> are<00:00:56.520> taking<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.570> d

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
so the venules are taking that d

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.990 
so the venules are taking that d
oxidated<00:00:58.350> blood<00:00:58.590> which<00:00:59.190> looks<00:00:59.489> kind<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.820> more

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
oxidated blood which looks kind of more

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.840 
oxidated blood which looks kind of more
blueish<00:01:00.600> purple-ish<00:01:01.140> because<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:02.070> hemoglobin

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
blueish purple-ish because of hemoglobin

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.310 
blueish purple-ish because of hemoglobin
changing<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.570> you'll<00:01:03.780> hear<00:01:03.899> more<00:01:04.019> about<00:01:04.080> that

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
changing and you'll hear more about that

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.620 
changing and you'll hear more about that
in<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.500> blood<00:01:04.710> lessons<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.790> venules<00:01:06.119> take

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
in the blood lessons the venules take

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.100 
in the blood lessons the venules take
all<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.049> blood<00:01:07.490> back<00:01:08.490> onto<00:01:08.820> freeways<00:01:09.630> you

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
all that blood back onto freeways you

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.530 
all that blood back onto freeways you
can<00:01:10.229> think<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.470> them<00:01:10.590> as<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:10.979> ramps<00:01:11.460> going<00:01:12.090> into

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
can think of them as on ramps going into

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.719 
can think of them as on ramps going into
the<00:01:13.049> veins<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.710> are<00:01:13.890> gonna<00:01:13.979> take<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.430> blood

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
the veins that are gonna take that blood

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.149 
the veins that are gonna take that blood
back<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.570> heart<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.170> veins<00:01:16.680> are<00:01:16.979> also

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
back to the heart and veins are also

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.820 
back to the heart and veins are also
very<00:01:17.850> large<00:01:18.119> but<00:01:18.840> structurally<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.409> bit

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
very large but structurally a bit

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.149 
very large but structurally a bit
different<00:01:20.189> from<00:01:20.280> arteries<00:01:21.860> when<00:01:22.860> we<00:01:22.950> look<00:01:23.070> at

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
different from arteries when we look at

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.200 
different from arteries when we look at
vessel<00:01:23.490> structure<00:01:24.619> arteries<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.890> veins<00:01:26.210> have

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
vessel structure arteries and veins have

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.679 
vessel structure arteries and veins have
these<00:01:27.509> layers<00:01:28.130> the<00:01:29.130> size<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.479> layers

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
these layers the size of the layers

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.539 
these layers the size of the layers
relative<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.290> each<00:01:31.380> other<00:01:31.470> are<00:01:31.770> different<00:01:32.460> in

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
relative to each other are different in

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.830 
relative to each other are different in
the<00:01:32.640> veins<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:32.970> arteries<00:01:33.119> but<00:01:33.390> let's<00:01:33.659> cover

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
the veins and arteries but let's cover

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.780 
the veins and arteries but let's cover
these<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:34.170> general<00:01:34.470> first<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.250> if<00:01:35.340> we<00:01:35.460> start

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
these in general first so if we start

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.270 
these in general first so if we start
from<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.150> most<00:01:36.409> superficial<00:01:37.409> part<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.130> these

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
from the most superficial part of these

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.410 
from the most superficial part of these
tubes<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:39.600> Tunica<00:01:40.049> externa<00:01:40.729> is<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:42.030> sheath

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
tubes the Tunica externa is that sheath

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.200 
tubes the Tunica externa is that sheath
around<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:43.020> outside<00:01:43.530> sometimes<00:01:44.460> it's<00:01:44.939> called

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
around the outside sometimes it's called

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.230 
around the outside sometimes it's called
the<00:01:45.810> tunica<00:01:46.500> adventitia<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.610> just<00:01:47.939> depends<00:01:48.210> on

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
the tunica adventitia it just depends on

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.870 
the tunica adventitia it just depends on
the<00:01:48.360> textbook<00:01:48.840> they<00:01:49.439> both<00:01:49.710> mean<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.549> outer

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
the textbook they both mean that outer

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.910 
the textbook they both mean that outer
sheath<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:52.350> going<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.530> be<00:01:52.649> mainly

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
sheath and it's going to be mainly

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.700 
sheath and it's going to be mainly
connective<00:01:53.820> tissue<00:01:54.110> and<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.229> connective

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
connective tissue and that connective

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.399 
connective tissue and that connective
tissue<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:56.250> very<00:01:56.490> tough<00:01:56.790> very<00:01:56.820> strong<00:01:57.570> you

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
tissue is very tough very strong you

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
is gonna be mainly smooth muscle so you

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.600 
is gonna be mainly smooth muscle so you
can<00:02:34.360> see<00:02:34.510> smooth<00:02:34.930> muscle<00:02:35.410> right<00:02:35.560> here<00:02:35.620> smooth

vessels<00:03:04.120> so<00:03:04.270> smooth<00:03:04.510> muscle<00:03:04.870> a<00:03:04.959> very

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
vessels so smooth muscle a very

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.020 
vessels so smooth muscle a very
important<00:03:05.560> part<00:03:05.770> of<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.130> tunica<00:03:06.490> media<00:03:06.610> and

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
important part of the tunica media and

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.940 
important part of the tunica media and
then<00:03:07.630> more<00:03:08.200> connective<00:03:08.560> tissue<00:03:08.680> fibers

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
then more connective tissue fibers

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.220 
then more connective tissue fibers

are<00:03:11.890> gonna<00:03:12.400> allow<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:14.020> size<00:03:14.320> of<00:03:14.530> it<00:03:14.680> to<00:03:15.100> adjust

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
are gonna allow the size of it to adjust

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.449 
are gonna allow the size of it to adjust
as<00:03:15.730> needed<00:03:16.000> and<00:03:16.440> then<00:03:17.440> finally<00:03:17.920> Tunica

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
as needed and then finally Tunica

changes based on how much the smooth

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.850 
changes based on how much the smooth
muscle<00:03:58.269> is<00:03:58.360> contracting<00:03:58.959> or<00:03:59.019> relaxing<00:03:59.410> the

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
muscle is contracting or relaxing the

lumen<00:04:00.250> is<00:04:00.370> the<00:04:00.519> name<00:04:00.730> for<00:04:01.330> the<00:04:02.080> internal<00:04:03.040> part

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
lumen is the name for the internal part

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.040 
lumen is the name for the internal part
where<00:04:04.150> blood<00:04:04.420> is<00:04:04.480> actually<00:04:04.690> moving<00:04:04.989> through

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
where blood is actually moving through

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.170 
where blood is actually moving through
so<00:04:05.350> the<00:04:05.470> hollow<00:04:05.709> region<00:04:06.250> within<00:04:07.000> the

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
so the hollow region within the

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.750 
so the hollow region within the
endothelium<00:04:07.720> layer<00:04:07.900> is<00:04:08.170> called<00:04:08.410> a<00:04:08.709> lumen<00:04:09.459> and

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
endothelium layer is called a lumen and

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.210 
endothelium layer is called a lumen and
actually<00:04:10.540> other<00:04:10.660> organs<00:04:11.049> of<00:04:11.140> the<00:04:11.170> body<00:04:11.410> that

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
actually other organs of the body that

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.280 
actually other organs of the body that
have<00:04:12.280> hollow<00:04:12.940> chambers<00:04:13.720> like<00:04:13.900> even<00:04:14.170> the

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
have hollow chambers like even the

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.479 
have hollow chambers like even the
stomach<00:04:14.620> you<00:04:14.709> could<00:04:14.830> say<00:04:14.950> the<00:04:15.070> lumen<00:04:15.370> of<00:04:15.430> the

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
stomach you could say the lumen of the

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.370 
stomach you could say the lumen of the
stomach<00:04:15.610> but<00:04:16.090> lumen<00:04:16.780> in<00:04:16.870> this<00:04:16.989> case<00:04:17.200> is

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
stomach but lumen in this case is

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.330 
stomach but lumen in this case is
referring<00:04:17.799> to<00:04:17.830> the<00:04:18.700> hollow<00:04:18.910> structure<00:04:19.419> in

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
referring to the hollow structure in

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.820 
referring to the hollow structure in
vessels
