00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:02.730
 in a company the beginning 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.730
 that you bought, I think that in 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.739
 it is an option is a possibility 

00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:09.919
 Turkey 

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:13.359
 the leader of a company will often need 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:16.359
 have couché tools to be able to 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:21.729
 handle your choloma work team well - it would not be the most logical 

00:00:21.729 --> 00:00:24.140
 all the companies that have led to that if their department 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.890
 throughout the continent 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.079
 efe hire a third party to make the service grow 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:33.199
 The Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State of Hidalgo Salvador 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:34.910
 jara warrior 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.180
 yes what we have to understand how couching 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.230
 which is an action that I accompany 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.720
 as a couch to an individual 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.210
 so that you can guide certain objectives in their achievement 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.340
 but he only accompanied him for a certain time and from 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.090
 then everyone is free to act according to their habitual behavior 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.130
 was going to improve optical is that the punctual objective of the inm of the couché 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.900
 but p when I'm going to refer a little when talking about the couché car 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.760
 yes you who are 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.220
 what can you change 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.220
 if you believe how it says that they are barbarians prayer 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.620
 expired because everything depends on you and how I'm going to do it 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.939
 then a car is going to help you go now and cut 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:26.940
 but who decides the way 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.190
 you are stagno and the company is not the clear cops but I listen to you and good sense 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.870
 estrado guru 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.570
 this is the ficci your problem as it raises to near the harp that of the 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.159
 guitar the brewer leaves him third in the last legislature will present 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.470
 Jerez de la Frontera Cádiz to the park 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.350
 I think I do not know if that happens but somehow attending is enough 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.940
 contract are cars to solve problems 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.000
 so you can also work with a car that is too fragrant to train 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.170
 the rays for prevention I run like a friend said 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.480
 who works as a fundraiser and I love working with health 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.410
 I do not think so 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.410
 things like enhancing both income that 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.469
 these resources what 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:11.069
 the work team since it has 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.829
 that may be a bit the line because of the very clear situation that if I let 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:15.269
 yes 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:16.820
 the resources are there 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.699
 but it's also interesting 

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:23.569
 that many times all this potential that we have we use it to how much we use 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.819
 really that which shapes us not 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.589
 many times its 

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:31.009
 30% to 40 percent then how to do 

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:34.989
 so that the good team person strengthens those resources can be 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.779
 deliver the best of himself 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:41.369
 I do not think that there is the work of the car and as he says, you are also 

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:44.679
 the answer is in the response team is in the person 

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:47.819
 he pulled one can not tell him what to do 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.719
 but here and there is also something interesting and what I think there is and with 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:56.109
 the question then born couching we could go back to the great 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:00.619
 philosophers and suddenly talking Socrates who told us about learning that no 

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:02.529
 can teach but it is one 

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:05.689
 the one who must learn from the experience in the ac 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:09.980
 which is one of the bases of the car or plate for example that also elías 

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:13.509
 spoke grandchild team of the first learning in action dialogue 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:18.069
 not the art question in the car in the powerful questions are those that 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.299
 they really do not shake 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.119
 really be aware of many things not 

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:27.369
 and then we would say suddenly be with the possibility of existing 

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:30.059
 we all have to be happy in life not 

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:32.999
 to open a little more the personal aspect 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:34.460
 Benitez before Peru 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.709
 let's say it's a bit that idea 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.139
 within sunset whole of a little what was just document those of today 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.349
 intentionally 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:45.399
 it was noticed next to dealing with cars and people started discovering for example 

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:47.800
 that is not what you want to do 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.319
 what do I do here 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.969
 Jesus is also owed money to enter Carlos Quijano 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:56.659
 is wrong for the businessman and that his ship and that is useful for the company 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:56.959
 bp 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.069
 what people do not stop by the way one point is that I've had to work 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.590
 Swedes and companies where we finally come to the topic that this person does not 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.739
 I wanted to treat the site better 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.180
 work an orderly exit of that person a review of the work 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.639
 what to fear a person with art 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.779
 because it's awesome because of 1-0 

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:17.239
 you can come into existence I do not want to once I was fighting for example 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.579
 people who sold 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:21.840
 both with 2 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.629
 cemetery spaces 

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:25.420
 I knew him and it was her 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.200
 because since I got here they would take me to the street on that occasion 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.840
 They were also killed and one of them went from October 20 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:37.789
 it was a very good experience some call the university something like that myself 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:41.189
 there were simply conditions that I was wearing it is something that always come out 

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:44.749
 forward and this space a possibility also of growth 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.870
 is what caught my attention 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.270
 say I had the potential to be able 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.189
 discovered a great seller 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:55.389
 in very particular Argentine conditions but that is a great seller 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.539
 the one who has the ability to help others 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.419
 jorge loring wide of a product and if you do not want the possibility that it 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:03.749
 feels satisfied good 

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:06.830
 it was the second game against the Xerez before not of course then 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.210
 when you are talking about all of us 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.870
 certain differentiating characteristics and it happens to me very often 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.700
 person that I'm interviewing who wants you to look for desperate employment 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:19.889
 because I've stayed on the street and what do I do and this is my resume with 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:23.580
 lots of masters with motor district arras idea tactics is a 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.580
 police reverence does not know where there is more title and they are very young people 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:28.559
 the question is 

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:31.900
 what is your differentiating characteristic 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.939
 this beautiful in quotation marks product that you are you offer yourself for the market 

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:40.089
 what is different from the rest if it has mastery these have studies 

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:43.520
 everyone has experience, all have a result that sets you apart 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.120
 and although it seems to lie there are people 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.349
 who do not have the capacity to respond 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.909
 and when someone happened to me 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:55.029
 that after 15 days he tells me roberto 

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:58.119
 I already know why I already know what is my distinguishing feature 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:02.729
 I am a person with fiat 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:05.499
 and where they say your mixed curriculum 

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:08.729
 kinshasa 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:12.550
 Since we do not sell cereso, others depend a lot on knowing you if you put it on 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.169
 your mail that would not look very good or not 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:18.560
 He explained that to the PSOE as to the PP that you are not going to put down a person 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.580
 theoretically reliable 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.289
 you have to prove 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:27.069
 qualys the confidence that you have achieved this way on the court 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:27.930
 snapshot 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.870
 I would like to return to that in which situations he sentenced with his shield 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:37.879
 they require credits the quota for that we are a pause and returning poplars
