00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
ahead and make some cuts we're going to

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.300 
ahead and make some cuts we're going to
make<00:01:39.170> say<00:01:39.500> five<00:01:40.159> or<00:01:40.579> four<00:01:41.090> cuts<00:01:41.479> across<00:01:42.310> which

twenty-five cubes

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.130 
twenty-five cubes
per<00:01:48.649> slice<00:01:49.159> I<00:01:50.439> think<00:01:51.439> here<00:01:51.920> we<00:01:51.950> did<00:01:53.140> five

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
per slice I think here we did five

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.669 
per slice I think here we did five
across<00:01:54.679> and<00:01:55.099> four<00:01:55.610> down<00:01:55.909> and<00:01:56.270> that<00:01:57.110> gave<00:01:57.439> us

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
across and four down and that gave us

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.839 
across and four down and that gave us
about<00:01:57.950> a<00:01:58.520> total<00:01:59.390> of<00:01:59.509> sixty<00:02:00.020> cubes<00:02:00.549> for<00:02:01.549> just

00:02:01.839 --> 00:02:01.849 
about a total of sixty cubes for just

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:04.990 
about a total of sixty cubes for just
these<00:02:02.060> three<00:02:02.509> slices<00:02:03.009> and<00:02:04.009> that's<00:02:04.789> going<00:02:04.939> to

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
these three slices and that's going to

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.770 
these three slices and that's going to
fit<00:02:05.270> into<00:02:05.450> a<00:02:05.629> quart<00:02:06.079> baggie<00:02:06.520> if<00:02:07.520> you<00:02:08.360> do<00:02:08.539> more

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
fit into a quart baggie if you do more

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.720 
fit into a quart baggie if you do more
slices<00:02:09.379> you<00:02:09.560> might<00:02:09.769> need<00:02:09.920> a<00:02:09.979> gallon<00:02:10.340> baggie

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
slices you might need a gallon baggie

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.199 
slices you might need a gallon baggie
okay<00:02:13.730> so<00:02:14.060> there<00:02:14.269> we<00:02:14.390> have<00:02:14.569> about<00:02:14.720> sixty<00:02:15.379> slices

sure<00:02:30.690> you<00:02:30.930> don't<00:02:31.110> put<00:02:31.560> too<00:02:31.590> much<00:02:31.860> in<00:02:33.110> so<00:02:34.110> we're

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
sure you don't put too much in so we're

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.470 
sure you don't put too much in so we're
going<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:34.680> have<00:02:35.040> better<00:02:35.310> control<00:02:35.580> by<00:02:36.180> just

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
going to have better control by just

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.960 
going to have better control by just
kind<00:02:36.720> of<00:02:36.780> sprinkling<00:02:37.320> it<00:02:37.470> on<00:02:37.620> in<00:02:37.980> while<00:02:38.760> it's

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
kind of sprinkling it on in while it's

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.160 
kind of sprinkling it on in while it's
all<00:02:39.150> in<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.420> pan<00:02:41.390> all<00:02:42.390> righty<00:02:42.690> now<00:02:42.780> we're

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
all in the pan all righty now we're

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.300 
all in the pan all righty now we're
going<00:02:43.290> to<00:02:43.410> put<00:02:43.950> in<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:45.150> cubes<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:46.040> you'll<00:02:47.040> see

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
going to put in the cubes and you'll see

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.090 
going to put in the cubes and you'll see
that<00:02:47.550> these<00:02:47.880> 60<00:02:48.450> pinions<00:02:48.870> very<00:02:49.110> nicely<00:02:49.440> we

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
that these 60 pinions very nicely we

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.550 
that these 60 pinions very nicely we
probably<00:02:50.790> could<00:02:51.600> have<00:02:51.630> put<00:02:51.930> in<00:02:52.080> more<00:02:52.380> than

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
probably could have put in more than

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.540 
probably could have put in more than
that<00:02:53.840> but<00:02:54.840> I<00:02:55.110> believe<00:02:55.140> 60<00:02:56.070> is<00:02:56.130> going<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.400> give

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
that but I believe 60 is going to give

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.330 
that but I believe 60 is going to give
us<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.790> couple<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.180> days<00:02:57.420> worth<00:02:57.750> of<00:02:57.900> coupons<00:02:58.340> for

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
us a couple of days worth of coupons for

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.920 
us a couple of days worth of coupons for
a<00:02:59.400> family<00:02:59.880> of<00:03:00.030> four<00:03:00.270> or<00:03:00.300> five<00:03:02.420> then<00:03:03.420> give<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:03.780> a

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
a family of four or five then give it a

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.480 
a family of four or five then give it a
good<00:03:04.110> shake<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:06.890> you'll<00:03:07.890> find<00:03:08.160> it<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.370> little

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
good shake and you'll find it a little

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.940 
good shake and you'll find it a little
difficult<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.210> get<00:03:09.480> it<00:03:09.630> all<00:03:09.950> distributed

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
difficult to get it all distributed

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.050 
difficult to get it all distributed
evenly<00:03:11.900> don't<00:03:12.900> worry<00:03:13.080> about<00:03:13.230> it<00:03:13.790> it's<00:03:14.790> better

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
evenly don't worry about it it's better

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.330 
evenly don't worry about it it's better
than<00:03:15.300> it<00:03:15.450> looks<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:16.350> then<00:03:16.710> you<00:03:16.830> let<00:03:17.010> it<00:03:17.130> rest

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
than it looks and then you let it rest

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.160 
than it looks and then you let it rest
for<00:03:17.490> about<00:03:17.760> 20<00:03:18.120> minutes<00:03:18.330> so<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.750> olive<00:03:18.870> oil

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
for about 20 minutes so the olive oil

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.670 
for about 20 minutes so the olive oil
gets<00:03:19.800> distributed<00:03:20.550> more<00:03:20.730> evenly<00:03:21.260> now<00:03:22.260> you<00:03:22.320> can

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
gets distributed more evenly now you can

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.440 
gets distributed more evenly now you can
go<00:03:22.950> ahead<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.280> put<00:03:23.490> a<00:03:23.760> couple<00:03:23.850> of<00:03:24.240> butter

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
go ahead and put a couple of butter

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.580 
go ahead and put a couple of butter
patties<00:03:24.810> in<00:03:25.170> here<00:03:25.410> as<00:03:25.530> well<00:03:25.740> and<00:03:26.960> that<00:03:27.960> kind<00:03:28.530> of

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
patties in here as well and that kind of

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.890 
patties in here as well and that kind of
helps<00:03:28.890> tell<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:29.580> how<00:03:29.760> hot<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.360> pan<00:03:30.600> is

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
helps tell you how hot the pan is

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.660 
helps tell you how hot the pan is
because<00:03:31.740> after<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.850> butter<00:03:33.630> stops<00:03:34.020> bubbling

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
because after the butter stops bubbling

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:42.500 
because after the butter stops bubbling
then<00:03:36.170> the<00:03:37.170> pan<00:03:37.410> is<00:03:37.590> ready<00:03:37.910> heat<00:03:38.910> wise<00:03:41.510> all

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
then the pan is ready heat wise all

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.180 
then the pan is ready heat wise all
right<00:03:42.750> so<00:03:43.020> you<00:03:43.110> give<00:03:43.320> it<00:03:43.440> a<00:03:43.470> good<00:03:43.650> shake<00:03:43.920> and

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
right so you give it a good shake and

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.710 
right so you give it a good shake and
let<00:03:44.370> it<00:03:44.490> sit<00:03:46.970> right<00:03:47.970> in<00:03:48.180> now

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
let it sit right in now

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.510 
let it sit right in now
and<00:03:51.720> if<00:03:51.870> you<00:03:51.990> want<00:03:52.230> you<00:03:52.440> can<00:03:52.590> spray<00:03:52.950> it<00:03:53.100> more

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
and if you want you can spray it more

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.500 
and if you want you can spray it more
with<00:03:53.990> the<00:03:54.990> sprayer<00:03:55.380> you<00:03:55.560> have<00:03:57.260> not<00:03:58.260> necessary

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
with the sprayer you have not necessary

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.500 
with the sprayer you have not necessary
and<00:04:01.100> cost<00:04:02.100> it<00:04:02.310> a<00:04:02.370> little<00:04:02.550> bit<00:04:02.790> once<00:04:03.060> in<00:04:03.210> a<00:04:03.300> while

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
and cost it a little bit once in a while

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.300 
and cost it a little bit once in a while
it's<00:04:04.080> going<00:04:04.200> to<00:04:04.320> be<00:04:04.410> about<00:04:04.650> eight<00:04:04.860> to<00:04:05.070> ten

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
it's going to be about eight to ten

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.720 
it's going to be about eight to ten
minutes<00:04:06.650> and<00:04:07.650> we'll<00:04:07.890> be<00:04:07.950> looking<00:04:08.400> for<00:04:08.610> that

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
minutes and we'll be looking for that

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.830 
minutes and we'll be looking for that
golden<00:04:09.210> brown<00:04:10.730> and<00:04:11.730> that's<00:04:12.060> getting<00:04:12.570> their

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
golden brown and that's getting their

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:20.410 
golden brown and that's getting their
lips<00:04:13.140> golden<00:04:13.590> brown<00:04:13.860> so<00:04:17.510> I<00:04:18.510> guess<00:04:18.930> it<00:04:19.590> already

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.420 
lips golden brown so I guess it already

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.820 
lips golden brown so I guess it already
we're<00:04:21.420> going<00:04:21.600> to<00:04:21.660> go<00:04:21.780> ahead<00:04:21.870> and<00:04:22.110> just<00:04:22.260> pour<00:04:22.740> it

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
we're going to go ahead and just pour it

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.730 
we're going to go ahead and just pour it
into<00:04:22.950> a<00:04:23.160> bowl<00:04:25.220> and<00:04:26.220> there<00:04:26.910> you<00:04:27.060> have<00:04:27.090> it

into a bowl and there you have it

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.590 
into a bowl and there you have it
croutons<00:04:28.740> at<00:04:29.190> home<00:04:29.460> they<00:04:29.820> taste<00:04:30.270> much<00:04:30.750> better
