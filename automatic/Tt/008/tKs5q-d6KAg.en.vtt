00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 we have with us the old version 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.049
 of the notebook and as you can see from the outside 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.940
 it is exactly the same as the previous one 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.269
 even many of its characteristics and 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:16.049
 functions are dubbed the novelties 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.510
 mainly two the first the price 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.910
 and we will highlight it because it certainly goes 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.949
 to make a lot of people who do not 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.840
 raises this portal and as an option 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.660
 because it cost a little more than the 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.000
 others now think about it has come down 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.510
 about a hundred euros then the model of 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.850
 six inches is parts of 929 euros and 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.040
 this is the 13.3 inches from 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.100
 thousand 29 you already know that according to the version its 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.340
 capacity as it rises a tad plus the other 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.980
 great novelty 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.870
 and a little bit of speed in their 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.970
 processors we're going to turn it on so that 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.500
 you see that good before is not that you 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.450
 it took much more speed because 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.180
 I was very fluid to know that the 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:00.320
 applications run very fast 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.730
 it turns on in seconds and even when 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.590
 we use many applications at once 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.590
 it does not hang but good you have added 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.950
 that extra plus for example I'm going to give you 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.240
 a few random applications for 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.210
 what do you see 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.320
 that spears 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.480
 Quick 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.909
 Tunisia 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:25.249
 payless photos 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.249
 this is going very fast 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.680
 and good it works is that it works very very 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.210
 well things that do not change for example the 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.030
 flash memory that is burning up the 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.710
 much much faster information is 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.869
 available 128 in 256 gb capacity 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.579
 does not change for example the webcam the 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.530
 hd facetime so that we can maintain 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.729
 video conferencing with great quality and 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.640
 also with very good sound quality 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.490
 because it has two microphones and neither 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.560
 with autonomy are 12 hours in use 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.640
 in this 13 - inch model and in the 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.890
 11,6 are 9 hours a little less comes 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.789
 for example with the suites of the works 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.429
 and also with ilife what we can do 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:11.280
 is to edit video audio photographs 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.739
 organize them create modify documents 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.360
 spreadsheets presentations and good 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.110
 they are free with the system 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.520
 operative the last detail 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.930
 the keyboard of the keyboard is 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.500
 backlit so we can 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.060
 use it when there is not much light 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.530
 environmental and also has a sensor 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.880
 light that what it does is that it suits 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.310
 automatically so that we do not have to 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.560
 be with the controls and good that 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.200
 I forgot the connections also 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.060
 keep 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.709
 on this side as you can see it has a 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:44.709
 sanders bolt and a usb 3.0 and here it has 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.230
 a second usb 3.0 the connector for the 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.730
 headphones and charger so 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.040
 nothing you think that this price drop 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.400
 will make many more interested in this 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.400
