00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
capture HD card right there and with

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.880 
capture HD card right there and with
this<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.180> comes<00:02:19.390> with<00:02:19.510> a<00:02:19.540> bunch<00:02:19.780> of<00:02:19.900> cables<00:02:20.080> so

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
this it comes with a bunch of cables so

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.240 
this it comes with a bunch of cables so
right<00:02:21.160> here<00:02:21.430> we<00:02:21.580> have<00:02:21.849> a<00:02:22.090> USB<00:02:22.480> cable<00:02:23.050> and<00:02:23.250> not

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
right here we have a USB cable and not

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.449 
right here we have a USB cable and not
USB<00:02:24.580> but<00:02:24.940> this<00:02:25.090> is<00:02:25.269> the<00:02:25.420> hdmi<00:02:26.110> cable<00:02:26.500> so<00:02:27.129> this

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
USB but this is the hdmi cable so this

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.420 
USB but this is the hdmi cable so this
one<00:02:27.700> can<00:02:27.910> be<00:02:28.030> used<00:02:28.239> for<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.750> 360<00:02:29.590> when<00:02:30.280> you're

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
one can be used for the 360 when you're

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.729 
one can be used for the 360 when you're
connecting<00:02:31.239> that<00:02:31.420> up<00:02:31.599> and<00:02:31.750> then<00:02:32.260> we<00:02:32.410> also<00:02:32.560> have

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
connecting that up and then we also have

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.070 
connecting that up and then we also have
this<00:02:33.099> cable<00:02:33.519> right<00:02:33.670> here<00:02:33.700> that<00:02:34.420> has<00:02:34.660> a<00:02:34.690> funny

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
this cable right here that has a funny

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.050 
this cable right here that has a funny
little<00:02:35.319> end<00:02:35.560> on<00:02:35.739> it<00:02:35.769> because<00:02:36.129> this<00:02:36.400> is<00:02:36.640> for<00:02:36.910> the

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
little end on it because this is for the

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.220 
little end on it because this is for the
ps3<00:02:37.360> so<00:02:38.319> with<00:02:39.010> with<00:02:39.640> that<00:02:39.670> it<00:02:40.480> basically<00:02:40.720> just

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
ps3 so with with that it basically just

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.390 
ps3 so with with that it basically just
kind<00:02:41.470> of<00:02:41.590> plugs<00:02:42.310> in<00:02:42.640> right<00:02:42.989> over<00:02:43.989> here<00:02:44.319> if<00:02:45.190> I

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
kind of plugs in right over here if I

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.059 
kind of plugs in right over here if I
can<00:02:45.579> line<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:45.819> up<00:02:46.060> correctly<00:02:46.380> so<00:02:47.380> plug<00:02:47.799> in

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
can line it up correctly so plug in

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.449 
can line it up correctly so plug in
there<00:02:48.310> then<00:02:49.030> you'd<00:02:49.209> plug<00:02:49.480> up<00:02:49.690> your<00:02:50.010> HDMI<00:02:51.010> cable

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
there then you'd plug up your HDMI cable

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.720 
there then you'd plug up your HDMI cable
to<00:02:51.610> that<00:02:51.790> and<00:02:52.150> I<00:02:53.190> unpackage<00:02:54.190> these<00:02:54.370> things<00:02:54.610> a

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
to that and I unpackage these things a

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.610 
to that and I unpackage these things a
little<00:02:54.849> bit<00:02:55.090> just<00:02:55.360> so<00:02:55.480> it<00:02:56.049> wouldn't<00:02:56.319> have<00:02:56.410> all

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
little bit just so it wouldn't have all

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.190 
little bit just so it wouldn't have all
that<00:02:56.799> plastic<00:02:57.370> sound<00:02:57.849> in<00:02:58.000> the<00:02:58.060> background<00:02:58.200> so

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
that plastic sound in the background so

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.520 
that plastic sound in the background so
then<00:02:59.440> it<00:02:59.590> also<00:02:59.739> comes<00:03:00.099> with<00:03:00.190> this<00:03:00.459> USB<00:03:01.530> cable

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
then it also comes with this USB cable

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.280 
then it also comes with this USB cable
right<00:03:02.680> here<00:03:02.709> so<00:03:03.610> it's<00:03:03.849> a<00:03:03.940> mini<00:03:04.150> USB<00:03:04.390> right<00:03:05.200> on

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
right here so it's a mini USB right on

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.680 
right here so it's a mini USB right on
this<00:03:05.410> side<00:03:05.680> and<00:03:05.950> then<00:03:06.610> the<00:03:06.640> regular<00:03:07.090> USB<00:03:07.390> on

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
this side and then the regular USB on

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.110 
this side and then the regular USB on
the<00:03:07.780> back<00:03:07.959> side<00:03:08.200> so<00:03:08.530> to<00:03:08.560> hook<00:03:08.980> that<00:03:09.010> up<00:03:09.220> you

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
the back side so to hook that up you

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.390 
the back side so to hook that up you
basically<00:03:10.329> just<00:03:10.739> plug<00:03:11.739> it<00:03:11.860> in<00:03:11.980> right<00:03:12.010> there

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
basically just plug it in right there

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.350 
basically just plug it in right there
and<00:03:12.640> then<00:03:13.299> the<00:03:13.480> hdmi<00:03:14.049> cable<00:03:14.760> this<00:03:15.760> would<00:03:16.000> be<00:03:16.030> on

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
and then the hdmi cable this would be on

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.020 
and then the hdmi cable this would be on
the<00:03:16.540> outside<00:03:17.049> as<00:03:17.709> you<00:03:17.889> guys<00:03:18.040> can<00:03:18.280> kind<00:03:18.639> of<00:03:18.790> see

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
the outside as you guys can kind of see

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.280 
the outside as you guys can kind of see
there<00:03:19.709> you<00:03:20.709> just<00:03:20.829> hook<00:03:21.010> up<00:03:21.220> the<00:03:21.690> hdmi<00:03:22.690> out<00:03:22.959> and

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
there you just hook up the hdmi out and

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.849 
there you just hook up the hdmi out and
then<00:03:23.889> this<00:03:24.160> the<00:03:24.700> hdmi<00:03:25.269> out<00:03:25.480> cable<00:03:25.959> that's<00:03:26.470> what

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
then this the hdmi out cable that's what

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:29.099 
then this the hdmi out cable that's what
would<00:03:27.040> run<00:03:27.220> to<00:03:27.340> your<00:03:27.400> TV<00:03:27.670> so<00:03:28.060> i<00:03:28.269> will<00:03:28.810> probably
