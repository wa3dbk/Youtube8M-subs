00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello everyone we meet today 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.220
 with a tired day but it's 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.140
 the purpose of this video how can I 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.300
 very scared when I am rather tired 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.670
 I start by applying printer for 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.540
 to leave my complexion and prepare the 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.219
 simply dyes 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.440
 then I want to come apply a background 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.199
 complexion that will serve me to unify the 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.430
 time on the whole of my face 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.140
 according to favorite picture of what they 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.580
 apply every day and xu who 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.760
 works really well right now for 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.760
 me 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.370
 gesture we can the material with paper 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:43.909
 toilet that will allow in the subway a 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.320
 excellent product 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:48.839
 then comes the hero of this makeup 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.820
 the concealer or concealer that goes 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:52.110
 to come first was a little puffy 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.789
 that I have in front of me but also 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.350
 bring light because the 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.519
 color is a little clearer so it's fine 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.070
 give a little visions of a complexion a 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:02.399
 little more awake a little bit more fit 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.220
 and I really love a lot we see 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.630
 already that it is already seen more pleasure 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.310
 I correct the few tasks of my 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.259
 village for the taste buds dimmed with 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.170
 the bottom only one so today of a 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:15.149
 small amount of corrector on 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.979
 small parts of my face I come 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.569
 then fix my concealer concealer 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.220
 with a translucent powder 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:22.020
 it's important to fix game product 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.179
 especially when it has a creamy texture or 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.470
 rather liquid like this one why 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:26.759
 do not you finish a moment of the 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.619
 day with small folds under the 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.390
 eyes it's not very beautiful and we continue 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.100
 with the eyebrows I think the 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.810
 sources they are part of thyme and 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.330
 face so that simply allows for 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.880
 structure your your look your 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.560
 face and I find that really really 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.770
 important pan prepares probably too 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.329
 think about redrawing his eyebrows for 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.399
 my eye makeup I do not do 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.109
 great thing I learned that in fact finally 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.210
 good simply unify the time of 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:54.289
 the eyelid and dig a little bit 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.289
 my eyelid crew 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.159
 you 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.320
 on the other hand, it's the world 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.110
 I will present the strap 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.319
 rather light and I continue with 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.239
 mascara to unite the eyelashes and 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.100
 allogeneic little bit but it helps 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.100
 still still have that pretty look 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.330
 my camera is unfortunately extinct 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.730
 but the only thing I did was 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.980
 to bring a black pencil stroke in 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.810
 my inner inner muse to have a 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.670
 look a little deeper and still 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.160
 with a little land mass and this is 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.780
 that I have I continue with the powder that 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.130
 will allow you to fix the rest of the 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.590
 makeup but also to continue to 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.500
 uniformly not and blush for a 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.300
 looks good looking for a little bit of east 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.480
 also because this one has small 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.800
 bright particles if we can use 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.230
 the euro the letter I had applied in 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.610
 this moment and the orange lipstick does not 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.410
 not just suppress my lips 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.450
 in my opinion but rather the whole of 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.220
 my face likes this color peps 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.989
 and a little gloss of the same color 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.440
 you get to bring this little something 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.270
 plus something that will remove you the 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.920
 lips and be nice to all round price 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.140
 here I already know better mood 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.910
 and many more awake and have 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.560
 content direction the stadium loop and 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.390
 skips where you will see the whole 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.860
 of maintained for but I want I had 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.200
 did a 13 the day before that I have facts 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.520
 the next morning and agains this bridge 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.190
 but it's not really at times 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.320
 I am afro blizzard is maintained 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.120
 comes mainly from h &amp; m I wear a 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.850
 combination that I like a lot 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.170
 with a leather jacket and sneakers 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.030
 because I did not have the France of 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.920
 wearing heels is a very outfit 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.989
 simple and very comfortable like my 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.200
 habit but I think you know it 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.670
 I do not like having too much on me and 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.040
 little things do the right things to 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.019
