00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.670
 if a fire breaks out, the fire brigade is up in no time 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:05.540
 the pavement 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.500
 more than a hundred volunteers work in almere in addition to one 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.679
 normal job 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:12.870
 but with the new plans, the volunteer becomes more of a semi-professional 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.159
 who during his service must wait at the fire station until the fire 

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:19.589
 and 85 percent of the volunteers fit for it instead of it 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:20.390
 current model 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.609
 thereby pointing 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:23.789
 of home care 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.499
 of course just sit at home one 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:28.630
 when rutte strange types goes and train then do odd job 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.619
 I'll be home in one or two hours 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.490
 that is going to change and that we will make it happen 24 hours or a part thereof 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.230
 in the weekends or during the week 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.230
 be present on the scene with three other people 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.860
 it is incomprehensible that there are very big changes about home front and there 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:46.990
 is nothing but full 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.350
 according to commandant sprout the so-called barracks is meant to be 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.220
 to keep the volunteers on board 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.210
 rather worker a different path 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.670
 and who can get a PhD at the church and chop and dive on the volunteers 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.580
 because you can check that out 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.380
 though i just have whole network experience this we can add some value 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.040
 and thus also the previous resident of almere greater mariekerke kg 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.510
 confess that I still understand 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.140
 so fortunately milks last chance 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.470
 but more is playing 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.320
 the volunteers had great difficulty with a test of not six but four people 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.260
 steer the fire truck on the road 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.410
 that is cheaper but according to the volunteers the safety can be in it 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.680
 It is a whole lot of situation of four men attached to it 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.610
 is 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.800
 but for that number of situations it is often that there are only one or two 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.910
 that your mission man just acts short concert then has a number of problems 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.850
 that you can simply leave people there cost both to the citizen and more 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.240
 leisurely driving for 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.640
 I've always been able to use it better 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.600
 the tanker i handed you here tonight the pkk press agency afp adv 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.970
 always along with fire alarms buildings bracke klipper crazy imagine belga on the 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.860
 knees then i think kyoto car cracking as the volunteers and bargain there together 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.560
 must be released early January a conversation is planned
