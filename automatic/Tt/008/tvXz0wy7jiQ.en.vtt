00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.980
 very good girls very good guys she 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.290
 and prieto welcome to the second part 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.420
 of the greatness special 85 in this 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.030
 occasion we will treat the characters 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.070
 the game is that during the demo 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.930
 unveiled many features about 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.210
 the characters as well as their relationship 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.310
 between them and the most important thing that 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.320
 we all want to know how it was detailed 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.689
 It will operate the system change 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.310
 character for what to be expect with 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.800
 three characters is an innovative system 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.380
 for the saga and we're going to talk about it 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.809
 therefore, while we are not in a 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.359
 mission we can jump from a character to 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.460
 another with the touch of a button 

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:39.379
 This mode will appear on the screen 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.570
 character selection wheel and 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.820
 we can choose between the two remaining 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.160
 by doing so the camera will move away from 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.809
 us and after a few brief seconds 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.090
 will focus on the location of the new 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.129
 character and will descend until you return to 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.559
 game for now as indicated 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.510
 rockstar these sequences are temporary 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.290
 that is to say that in the final game you can 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.530
 there are even no waiting times 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.390
 also good you have to say something 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.000
 quite important that the change of 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.970
 character can also occur because 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.290
 be it as a script of the game that is 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.020
 can change automatically by the 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.940
 script of the game even as I've already 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.710
 indicated before the voluntary changes 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.570
 be a very important facet in 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.010
 the game apart from this change of 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.410
 character is what to be too 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.660
 unveiled another important detail and that is 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.430
 the three protagonists consist will count 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.100
 with a list of general skills 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.410
 Nearly a dozen 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.500
 skills from shooting up 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:39.280
 driving that of course will be improving 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.380
 the more we practice good together 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.570
 these skills that have been wanted 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.670
 implement each one will have a 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.369
 unique ability that will be different 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.590
 of the other two and stability will have a 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.259
 limited use and will even have its own 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.350
 indicator bar next to health and 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.350
 bulletproof vest 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.240
 Well then it is quite innovative in this 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.060
 aspect since in large photo 4 then 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.860
 this aspect was ignored I do not know just 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.530
 we 're not just going to talk about 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.200
 franklin is with whom he started the demo 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.940
 for the demo that you already know that salt 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.340
 jumped started to Santander from a 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.350
 helicopter is the youngest of the three 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.270
 they do not have problems to work 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.819
 both sides of the law and you will know 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.610
 michael the leader of the band while 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.440
 works for simon 7 and attarian which is 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.440
 the boss of a car dealership 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.920
 Armenian luxury recover vehicles 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.690
 that people can not afford to fight 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.459
 for the order has been dragged to the 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.100
 war of bands that exist in the 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.920
 sides in the saints pardon 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.900
 franklin lives in the saints south and is a 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.600
 addicted to adrenaline so 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.690
 we will see practicing sports like 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.280
 base jump that he likes a lot and 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.340
 always put yourself on the front line when 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.670
 there is danger when the police arrive 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.319
 etcetera and you will have a dog shop that 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.269
 We all know him already by the famous 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.040
 poster and gestates 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.319
 rockstar forgiveness said what 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.540
 there will only be three controllable characters 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.240
 and that in principle I will not be a 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.730
 character that we can control 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:15.000
 He has also talked about the work that 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.710
 will frank franklin in the game and how 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.780
 he works in a dealership will be a 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.570
 specialist in the steering wheel there 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.820
 your special ability will arise 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.830
 slow down the time while driving 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.560
 a great speed what will allow 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.900
 execute very tight turns with extreme 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.020
 Simplicity and move like a fish in the water 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.660
 in a very dense traffic in a city 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.580
 crowded the truth is that franklin 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.870
 it looks very good now let's talk 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.530
 about trevor good rockstar what 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.500
 call 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.340
 demented resident and is a former sociopath 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.140
 Army pilot is a guy 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.850
 out of control that well then always 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.880
 is trying to get a good 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.950
 colophon is more has also been spoken that 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.990
 is an old friend of michael to whom 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.150
 he knows of multiple robberies before 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:06.970
 it will be removed and has a character 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.190
 unstable and good 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.190
 he is a psychotic to say it of some 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.740
 shape carries a tattoo on the neck that 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.630
 he says cut his skill here 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.359
 special will be action- oriented and 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.519
 will allow you to cause a lot of damage a lot 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.230
 less than the one that receives besides 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.450
 unlock melee attacks 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.850
 only ones that we assume will be 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:29.560
 impressive in true style by 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:32.230
 say it in some way sleeping dogs or 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.900
 be that we will be attentive 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.820
 and well we'll talk about mike now 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.250
 in the last character of the three is a 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.490
 bank robber retired 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:45.970
 where it has good has a mansion with 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:51.460
 pool tennis court good the truth 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:54.310
 It is that it is a rich man blooded let 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.639
 the truth is that to say it of some 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.800
 shape 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.199
 this character will have the ability 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.360
 special to slow down the time during 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.879
 the shootings in the purest style max 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:08.569
 payne 3 will be able to shoot shoot 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:10.759
 very accurate and quick to your enemies well 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:12.590
 how good is all the information that 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:14.930
 at the moment I do not want to do any 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.460
 spoiler of the story given that it could 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.930
 have done it 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.270
 and I think it's been pretty 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.740
 explained that the skill that each one 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.479
 of the characters will have a skill 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.639
 special is the most remarkable thing of all 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:28.130
 this each has its own history 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:31.970
 that will intertwine between the three at the most 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.259
 pure style hollywood movie and nothing 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.530
 I hope you liked all the 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:38.389
 information and you already know how to comment that 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.120
 it is very important for us and we 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:43.430
 we see in the special in chapter 3 and 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.960
 you already know like favorites and see you in
