00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.900
 Hello dear friends with you king 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:22.230
 peas and king peas 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.560
 gifts brought to you know guys that late 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.380
 but late is better than never so 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:33.750
 I beg to love and favor the assembly 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.790
 client and server 164 actually given 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.090
 moment 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:41.940
 server with this assembly can see 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:47.340
 an hour before your own eyes list of mods 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.970
 which is worth and what actually wanted 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.280
 would note 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.350
 so exactly what the assembly turned out 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.210
 hardcore race I tried everything 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.490
 configs settings for you to be 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:02.430
 Itâ€™s harder to play like this 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:05.220
 this time should have turned out 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.110
 I am especially good 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.930
 met a little bit what i mean 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.590
 arguments applied a little bit of this knowledge 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.980
 And as a result, in short, it seems 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:21.659
 we should not cry this assembly 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:24.330
 Here actually on it I this epic 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.040
 video finish wishing you good 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.409
 mood of a good day more 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.990
 smile and be sure to eat peas 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:35.970
 See you next video all bye 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.520

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.670
