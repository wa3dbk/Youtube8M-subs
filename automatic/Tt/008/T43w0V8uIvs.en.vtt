00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello how about friends what I'm going to 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.819
 show in this video is a super super 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.099
 super tweet for what is facebook already 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.440
 that will allow you since when you 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.809
 you give a message does not appear the 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.639
 sign that you already read it that you take off 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.230
 what is the option that you have to 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:21.140
 install forces what is the 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.140
 messenger and many many more things 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:31.029
 the tweet is called a loop and has a cost 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.820
 of a dollar with 99 cents and the truth 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.500
 is very little with what you do if you 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.900
 you want to buy is in the big repo 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.430
 box otherwise down here is you 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.170
 appearing some of the options that 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.080
 I have so you can prove it 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.460
 free fully configured is 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.110
 explained good statut I do not have to 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.760
 demonstrate all functions since 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.940
 it would literally end is boring 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.580
 because it has many good here we have 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.690
 three remember that what is facebook 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.720
 It has three types of applications 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.089
 facebook messenger and paper paper is a 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.530
 most American application 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.409
 I think it probably has not reached 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.060
 mexico or has not sought him good in the 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.850
 part of facebook that will allow us 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.390
 doing will allow us to participate in 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.280
 experiments that let what is 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.869
 activate factors that are not in 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.600
 facebook that is going to allow you to do 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.920
 things that nobody else will be able to do 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.720
 you can remove what is the messenger if 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.180
 facebook is still having him taught me 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.700
 installed is like that stuck with this 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.020
 tweet because I thought that they had already 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.150
 removed from the application and is more 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.600
 many people already said facebook was already 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.600
 removed 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.350
 the detour is a thing that says it gives you 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.030
 It is very much to the battery your desire 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.070
 voice over internet protocol or that 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.500
 I think they are the so-called truth 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.790
 I do not know about this but take a little bit of 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.070
 time and then look up speak 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.930
 Well here we will appear many 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.970
 but many more 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.170
 since you see that facebook has a 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.330
 restriction that only if it gives me 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.979
 six photos at a time with this you will be able to 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.050
 send all the photos you want like that 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.940
 as in websites more than if you want it in 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.340
 full screen if you want to put some 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.009
 configurations if you want a sermon 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.650
 what it is is that they will not be able to see 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.269
 when you are writing and also not 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.000
 they will be able to see your location so that 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:18.790
 have problems sending it and neither 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.620
 the break description will not know if 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.650
 you already laws from the message you're going to 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.769
 have a supreme advantage you will be able to 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.600
 strange stamp height bar the truth this 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.090
 video to play for those who have a 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.670
 unlimited mega plan no no no 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.769
 limited limited what they will be able to 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.360
 do with this tweet is that the videos 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.220
 they will not play automatically 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.730
 so 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.430
 yes 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.709
 data rate is going to be reduced 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.540
 with an internet jump in the same way 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.549
 that in the most inverted part the mode 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.590
 that I showed you that prevents what 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.019
 is that it is location that begins the 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.599
 tea pin pink notice that is not knowing that no 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.670
 know when you are writing the ruiz 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:01.450
 reception that they do not know either 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.670
 you read and many but many more things 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.349
 that you can already try good is 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.970
 Just as simple is what pro 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.410
 paper is a more American application 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.299
 so you probably do not have it and if 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.190
 you have it, you can increase it 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:15.370
 some features that the truth that they are 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.989
 very very good parents this is all for is 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.180
 what is this application since if this one 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.609
 you start to try step by step 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.470
 I pass the truth until here you would stop 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.810
 watch the video so I embarked you 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.160
 you lie good on the one hand that would be 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.650
 everything if you are not driving the tea 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.690
 I recommend you take a walk because I know 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.709
 that you're going to like the videos and me 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.709
 I have in the next video
