one<00:01:08.450> another<00:01:08.479> along<00:01:09.020> the<00:01:09.170> way<00:01:09.290> I<00:01:11.320> think<00:01:12.320> the

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
one another along the way I think the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.320 
one another along the way I think the
main<00:01:12.710> thing<00:01:12.740> that<00:01:13.040> the<00:01:13.280> house<00:01:13.369> provides<00:01:13.909> is<00:01:14.299> a

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
main thing that the house provides is a

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.530 
main thing that the house provides is a
sense<00:01:15.049> of<00:01:15.409> family<00:01:16.280> when<00:01:16.580> your<00:01:16.729> own<00:01:16.850> family<00:01:17.119> is

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
sense of family when your own family is

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:34.560 
sense of family when your own family is
separated

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.870 

studies<00:01:35.570> have<00:01:35.780> shown<00:01:36.050> that<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:37.370> children

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
studies have shown that the children

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.430 
studies have shown that the children
heal<00:01:38.150> better<00:01:38.420> when<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:38.810> families<00:01:39.230> together

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
heal better when the families together

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.220 
heal better when the families together
so<00:01:40.010> it's<00:01:40.400> not<00:01:40.610> just<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.420> children<00:01:41.630> it's<00:01:41.990> that

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.230 
so it's not just the children it's that

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.710 
so it's not just the children it's that
it's<00:01:42.380> the<00:01:42.500> whole<00:01:42.650> family<00:01:42.680> that<00:01:43.390> deals<00:01:44.390> with

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
it's the whole family that deals with

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.230 
it's the whole family that deals with
the<00:01:44.960> illness<00:01:45.290> in<00:01:45.950> a<00:01:46.100> more<00:01:46.280> effective<00:01:46.520> way<00:01:46.760> when

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
the illness in a more effective way when

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.670 
the illness in a more effective way when
they're<00:01:47.390> together<00:01:47.570> and<00:01:48.080> they<00:01:48.170> understand

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
they're together and they understand

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.050 
they're together and they understand
what's<00:01:48.860> going<00:01:49.100> on<00:01:49.280> and<00:01:49.580> they<00:01:49.670> have<00:01:49.850> that
