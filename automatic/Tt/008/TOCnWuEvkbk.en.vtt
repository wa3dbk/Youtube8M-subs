00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.820 
enough and then let's get this bad boy
cranked<00:02:39.770> up<00:02:40.930> since<00:02:41.930> we<00:02:42.020> don't<00:02:42.170> have<00:02:42.320> one<00:02:42.800> of

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
cranked up since we don't have one of

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.700 
cranked up since we don't have one of
these<00:02:43.420> Blendtec's<00:02:44.420> you<00:02:45.110> can<00:02:45.260> probably<00:02:45.470> get

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
these Blendtec's you can probably get

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.230 
these Blendtec's you can probably get
away<00:02:45.830> with<00:02:45.950> doing<00:02:46.400> something<00:02:46.790> like<00:02:46.820> this<00:02:47.030> on<00:02:47.210> a

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
away with doing something like this on a

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.800 
away with doing something like this on a
regular<00:02:47.600> blender<00:02:48.280> but<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:50.000> Blendtec<00:02:50.510> or<00:02:50.660> any

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
regular blender but the Blendtec or any

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.450 
regular blender but the Blendtec or any
of<00:02:51.080> this<00:02:51.200> kind<00:02:51.440> of<00:02:51.530> high<00:02:51.680> power<00:02:51.920> type<00:02:52.250> of

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
of this kind of high power type of

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.760 
of this kind of high power type of
blenders<00:02:53.030> are<00:02:53.690> really<00:02:53.990> good<00:02:54.200> is<00:02:54.350> it<00:02:54.500> really

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
blenders are really good is it really

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.200 
blenders are really good is it really
you<00:02:55.400> know<00:02:55.520> pulverizes<00:02:56.420> and<00:02:56.600> grinds<00:02:56.900> all<00:02:57.380> the

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
you know pulverizes and grinds all the

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.130 
you know pulverizes and grinds all the
ingredients<00:02:59.210> down<00:02:59.360> to<00:02:59.600> a<00:02:59.630> good<00:03:01.990> you<00:03:02.990> know

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
ingredients down to a good you know

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.170 
ingredients down to a good you know
consistency<00:03:04.130> in<00:03:04.280> terms<00:03:04.340> of<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.700> creaminess

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
consistency in terms of the creaminess

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.510 
consistency in terms of the creaminess
so<00:03:05.840> it's<00:03:06.380> kind<00:03:06.650> of<00:03:06.680> important<00:03:07.160> I<00:03:07.190> haven't

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
so it's kind of important I haven't

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.580 
so it's kind of important I haven't
really<00:03:07.700> tried<00:03:07.880> it<00:03:08.000> on<00:03:08.240> a<00:03:08.270> regular<00:03:08.540> blender<00:03:08.840> 1/2

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
really tried it on a regular blender 1/2

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.620 
really tried it on a regular blender 1/2
play<00:03:09.830> around<00:03:10.040> with<00:03:10.220> the<00:03:10.370> but<00:03:11.210> the<00:03:11.300> bullet<00:03:11.570> that

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
play around with the but the bullet that

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.540
