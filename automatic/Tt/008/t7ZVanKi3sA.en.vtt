00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.100
 to this day practically the whole world 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.899
 knows the video consoles in detail 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.000
 they surround us and what we can expect from 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.219
 them since the internet gives us all the 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.410
 information that we need instantly 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.419
 for good or for bad this can suppose 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.790
 the purchase or not of any of these 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:20.130
 machines depends on whether what we read 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.140
 motivates to have it or just turn off that 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.350
 interior fire that lights up every time 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.710
 that we hear or see something good relationship 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.570
 to say about this the reason why 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.060
 I do this video is to expand the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.070
 previous video information much 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.350
 people do not really know because life 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.720
 it's a failure I will focus today on 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.180
 other things, as you know in the video 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.920
 I only mentioned a few points as 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.750
 that the twine exclusives are not 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.510
 many and that many of their games are 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.700
 can play on desktop consoles 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.070
 here and a year later it will be explained from 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.899
 another form or better said of other points 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.510
 that influenced that ps vita not 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.980
 exceed 3ds 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.860
 the 3ds has this formula under its belt 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.979
 has exclusive catalog best price 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.110
 more accessible and the 3 of life in 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.810
 change has only better than 3ds the 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.360
 multimedia power graphics from there in 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.140
 more really does not have anything except extras 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.540
 how to connect to ps4 this is obvious the 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.640
 ps vita or any other portable console 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.610
 could surpass the nintendo monopoly 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.040
 but why check this piece of video 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.619
 very well now I can explain 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.800
 well if you think very very carefully 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:36.649
 everything was planned that they do not believe me 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.840
 I care little and nothing I base 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:42.940
 in statistics and you in your cock 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.940
 who wins then me culeros 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.140
 ok nintendo knew they are and would do what 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.329
 same again smartphones 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.670
 they would rise in price according to their graphs 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.439
 so he thought very very carefully a 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.659
 plan is very simple 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.549
 do we remove an expensive console 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.500
 fucking games and let the 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.810
 saunier trust together with the 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.729
 smartphones now we just have to wait 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.360
 we throw a bone to the nintenderos 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.580
 in e3 and to wait again ready are 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.470
 and it's sinking alone and the reasons 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.260
 you can see them in my ps vita video 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.840
 now you just have to lower the price of 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.870
 the 3ds and launch the typical games of 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.940
 always the best sellers and if 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.400
 believe that such a marketing way is 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.739
 and impossible fantasies are mine because 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.890
 I still know how the nintendo ds started 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:33.470
 those they remembered yes it was exactly 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.780
 that's how they are and entrusted again and nintendo 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.720
 I fuck him x auto see the plan 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.340
 nintendo was always selling it to 169 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.310
 dollars that's why the project 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.599
 ambassadors they knew that a console 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.230
 it is not driven by its capabilities 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.240
 techniques but only and exclusively eye 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.520
 I'm going to say the most secret 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.340
 of all the history a console sells 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.830
 for two things number one the price and 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.870
 number two the games if you have the 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.710
 option to buy a console 6000 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.390
 weights with games that you already had on the ps3 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.160
 screen that smartphones have and 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.700
 games that will be released on the year 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.130
 that enters 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.470
 sure you will make another decision that is 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.320
 the one of nintendo a console of 3000 pesos 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.500
 with augmented reality pokÃ©mon games 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:21.080
 mario cell metroid and even graphics 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.300
 in 3d that you will not see anywhere and for 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:26.180
 when it's matched in graphics and price 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.760
 there will be another console because I'm going 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.070
 the 3ds and sure the common public also 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.870
 well with this one I say goodbye 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.870
 a greeting fellow youtuber os 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.090
 as you have just seen a console is handled 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.650
 for two things his games and the price 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.260
 examples there are many like the gameboy that 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.420
 sold 60 million consoles although in 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.120
 the market had powerful consoles like 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.459
 the game gear 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.739
 and well after this I have left 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.870
 say that without a doubt nintendo what 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.750
 did that again for that life surpasses us 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.489
 to the nintendo 3ds after seeing what 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.799
 that are and was wrong or in what 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:06.129
 nintendo made perfect I do not have more 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:08.110
 to say goodbye to the video if it's a 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.180
 little strong in language but says the 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.040
 true so if you do not think so just 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:16.079
 comment with arguments or just give your 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.079
 point of view see you bye
