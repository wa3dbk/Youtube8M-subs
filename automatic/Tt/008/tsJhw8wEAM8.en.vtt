monitoring goes and monitoring is such a
huge<00:00:32.890> part<00:00:33.250> of<00:00:33.399> this<00:00:33.579> whole<00:00:33.730> equation<00:00:33.970> of

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
huge part of this whole equation of

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.470 
huge part of this whole equation of
producing<00:00:35.050> recording<00:00:35.620> mixing<00:00:36.220> music<00:00:36.480> you

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
producing recording mixing music you

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.760 
producing recording mixing music you
know<00:00:37.600> I<00:00:37.630> really<00:00:37.930> spent<00:00:38.110> some<00:00:38.140> time<00:00:38.440> and<00:00:38.680> effort

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
know I really spent some time and effort

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.260 
know I really spent some time and effort
and<00:00:39.190> some<00:00:39.370> dollars<00:00:39.550> getting<00:00:39.970> this<00:00:40.059> little

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
and some dollars getting this little

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.180 
and some dollars getting this little
zone<00:00:40.540> that<00:00:40.720> I<00:00:40.780> track<00:00:41.079> and<00:00:41.320> mix<00:00:41.500> in<00:00:41.679> here<00:00:41.710> tuned

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
zone that I track and mix in here tuned

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.220 
zone that I track and mix in here tuned
in<00:00:42.460> so<00:00:42.969> there's<00:00:43.149> no<00:00:43.210> weird<00:00:43.539> reflections<00:00:44.079> or

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
in so there's no weird reflections or

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.889 
in so there's no weird reflections or
anything<00:00:44.410> like<00:00:44.620> that<00:00:44.679> and<00:00:45.449> you<00:00:46.449> know<00:00:46.480> likewise

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
anything like that and you know likewise

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:48.630 
anything like that and you know likewise
that<00:00:47.440> monitor<00:00:47.829> speakers<00:00:48.190> are<00:00:48.309> just<00:00:48.460> so

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
that monitor speakers are just so

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.099 
that monitor speakers are just so
important<00:00:49.120> because<00:00:49.359> they're<00:00:49.600> the<00:00:49.629> final

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:50.109 
important because they're the final

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:51.660 
important because they're the final
filter<00:00:50.440> before<00:00:50.620> the<00:00:50.829> sound<00:00:51.070> hits<00:00:51.339> your<00:00:51.460> ears

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
filter before the sound hits your ears

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.819 
filter before the sound hits your ears
and<00:00:51.910> if<00:00:52.239> you<00:00:52.449> can't<00:00:52.690> monitor<00:00:53.230> accurately<00:00:53.800> I

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
and if you can't monitor accurately I

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:54.989 
and if you can't monitor accurately I
think<00:00:54.160> you're<00:00:54.249> up<00:00:54.339> the<00:00:54.460> creek<00:00:54.670> without<00:00:54.789> a

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:54.999 
think you're up the creek without a

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:56.639 
think you're up the creek without a
paddle<00:00:55.059> when<00:00:55.539> it<00:00:55.629> comes<00:00:55.809> to<00:00:55.960> producing<00:00:56.260> music

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
paddle when it comes to producing music

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:59.099 
paddle when it comes to producing music
so<00:00:57.010> it's<00:00:57.969> a<00:00:58.089> really<00:00:58.269> really<00:00:58.390> important<00:00:59.050> thing

00:00:59.099 --> 00:00:59.109 
so it's a really really important thing

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:01.259 
so it's a really really important thing
so<00:00:59.829> I<00:01:00.100> was<00:01:00.339> at<00:01:00.429> the<00:01:00.550> NAMM<00:01:00.699> show<00:01:00.730> this<00:01:01.059> past
