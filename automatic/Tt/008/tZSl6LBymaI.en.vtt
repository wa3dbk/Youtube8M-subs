steps are similar on Windows operating
system<00:00:16.379> as<00:00:16.590> well<00:00:17.300> basically<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:18.600> want<00:00:18.779> to

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
system as well basically you want to

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.080

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
PowerPoint file after doing so we're now

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.570 
PowerPoint file after doing so we're now
going<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:25.949> save<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.760> version<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.720> file<00:00:28.019> that
