00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.720
 when we were kids we used to read 

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.310
 comic cartoons that most 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.420
 of the cases involved a 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:12.090
 superhero as main character 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.270
 a human being that thanks to an accident 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.250
 or some bite of some weirdo 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:19.200
 they acquired superpowers and in that way 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.360
 transformed their lives and in many 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.400
 occasions dedicated to doing good and 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.550
 fight for justice 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.920
 but now that it's a big one, it's 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.860
 one tells that there are people who, although 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.120
 it's not with superpowers they possess qualities 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.090
 very extraordinary 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.489
 very extraordinary that easily what 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.440
 would make one think that they are like 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.550
 those superheroes of magazines that 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.760
 we read 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.489
 such is the case of the Lord more blood 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.160

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:09.330
 be hurt, did not feel anything 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.770
 according to scientists the reaction to 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.840
 electricity of each individual is 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.850
 different and the tests that are 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.040
 they did have great demonstrated that their 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.380
 resistance is eight times higher than 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.700
 average of humans 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.799

 say do not feel the low temperatures 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.560
 only compensate intensely in not feeling 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.320
 the tests have proven it since 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.520
 after submerging in frozen water 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.740

 weakling after years of feeling 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.980
