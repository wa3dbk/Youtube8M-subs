00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
Canadians is $30 a month I think for

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.510 
Canadians is $30 a month I think for
most<00:00:34.200> people<00:00:34.469> though<00:00:34.559> it's<00:00:34.680> about<00:00:34.739> 20<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.370> this

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
most people though it's about 20 so this

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.209 
most people though it's about 20 so this
is<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.969> very<00:00:36.809> cheap<00:00:37.140> alternative<00:00:37.710> if<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.040> are

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
is a very cheap alternative if you are

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.889 
is a very cheap alternative if you are
on<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.399> budget<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.940> get<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.180> shirt<00:00:39.540> every

honest with you guys it might just be

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:18.490 
honest with you guys it might just be
this<00:03:16.430> shirt<00:03:16.729> but<00:03:17.180> I<00:03:17.479> think<00:03:17.989> through<00:03:18.260> a<00:03:18.290> few

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
this shirt but I think through a few

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.589 
this shirt but I think through a few
washes<00:03:18.949> it<00:03:19.069> might<00:03:19.459> tear<00:03:19.790> rate<00:03:19.940> but<00:03:20.150> I<00:03:20.180> can't

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 
washes it might tear rate but I can't

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:22.930 
washes it might tear rate but I can't
say<00:03:20.780> that<00:03:20.959> for<00:03:20.989> certain<00:03:21.530> but<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.340> shirt<00:03:22.639> does

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
say that for certain but the shirt does

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.759 
say that for certain but the shirt does
feel<00:03:23.180> like<00:03:23.239> it's<00:03:23.540> really<00:03:23.780> good<00:03:23.930> quality<00:03:24.409> so<00:03:24.650> if

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
feel like it's really good quality so if

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.819 
feel like it's really good quality so if
you<00:03:24.889> are<00:03:25.069> into<00:03:25.579> that<00:03:26.229> definitely<00:03:27.229> a<00:03:27.319> decent

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
you are into that definitely a decent

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.250 
you are into that definitely a decent
shirt<00:03:28.040> and<00:03:28.310> I<00:03:28.790> do<00:03:28.849> really<00:03:29.299> like<00:03:29.540> the<00:03:29.720> design<00:03:30.019> it

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
shirt and I do really like the design it

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.020 
shirt and I do really like the design it
just<00:03:30.290> seems<00:03:30.620> like<00:03:30.709> Bhima<00:03:31.159> wasn't<00:03:31.549> the<00:03:31.669> best

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
just seems like Bhima wasn't the best

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.270 
just seems like Bhima wasn't the best
character<00:03:32.569> as<00:03:32.840> a<00:03:33.139> sidekick<00:03:33.799> character<00:03:33.949> you
