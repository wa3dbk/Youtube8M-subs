back<00:00:04.620> with<00:00:04.950> another<00:00:05.250> video<00:00:05.490> that<00:00:05.850> I've<00:00:05.940> always

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
back with another video that I've always

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.839 
back with another video that I've always
wanted<00:00:06.420> to<00:00:06.660> do<00:00:06.839> this<00:00:07.620> is<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:07.859> basically<00:00:08.790> a

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
wanted to do this is a basically a

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.870 
wanted to do this is a basically a
side-by-side<00:00:09.410> comparison<00:00:10.410> of<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:11.340> original

and<00:00:16.910> the<00:00:17.910> hughes<00:00:18.210> brand<00:00:18.539> wave<00:00:19.080> motion

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
and the hughes brand wave motion

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.650 
and the hughes brand wave motion
machines<00:00:19.800> formula<00:00:20.490> these<00:00:21.330> are<00:00:21.570> identical

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
machines formula these are identical

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.590 
machines formula these are identical
model<00:00:22.320> machine<00:00:22.800> similar<00:00:23.400> engage<00:00:23.760> they're

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
model machine similar engage they're

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.390 
model machine similar engage they're
both<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.930> purple<00:00:25.289> model<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:26.160> only

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
both the purple model the only

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.790 
both the purple model the only
difference<00:00:26.760> being<00:00:27.000> that<00:00:27.180> one<00:00:27.779> has<00:00:27.990> my<00:00:28.320> formula

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
difference being that one has my formula

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.200 
difference being that one has my formula
and<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:28.980> other<00:00:29.130> has<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.580> original<00:00:29.699> model

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
and the other has the original model

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.940 
and the other has the original model
formula<00:00:30.679> so<00:00:31.679> if<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.890> take<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.099> look<00:00:32.340> at<00:00:33.950> the

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
formula so if you take a look at the

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.700 
formula so if you take a look at the
bottom<00:00:35.910> half<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.570> fluids<00:00:36.960> passed<00:00:37.290> across

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
bottom half of the fluids passed across

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.139 
bottom half of the fluids passed across
the<00:00:37.890> middle<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.250> vessel<00:00:38.670> there's<00:00:38.969> no

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
the middle of the vessel there's no

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.569 
the middle of the vessel there's no
waves<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.899> what<00:00:40.079> I'm<00:00:40.200> talking<00:00:40.590> about<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:41.370> this

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
waves and what I'm talking about is this

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.810 
waves and what I'm talking about is this
area<00:00:41.879> here<00:00:42.890> you<00:00:43.890> don't<00:00:43.950> see<00:00:44.190> any<00:00:44.340> cresting

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
area here you don't see any cresting

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.850 
area here you don't see any cresting
waves<00:00:45.059> or<00:00:45.390> rolling<00:00:45.809> waves<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.379> fluid<00:00:46.739> just

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
waves or rolling waves the fluid just

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.619 
waves or rolling waves the fluid just
kind<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.129> slides<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.850> other<00:00:48.030> side<00:00:48.270> and

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
kind of slides to the other side and

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.750 
kind of slides to the other side and
collides<00:00:49.559> with<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.860> side<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.340> vessel<00:00:50.520> and

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
collides with the side of the vessel and

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.630 
collides with the side of the vessel and
makes<00:00:50.969> these<00:00:51.120> little<00:00:51.149> ripples<00:00:52.460> those<00:00:53.460> aren't

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
makes these little ripples those aren't

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.220 
makes these little ripples those aren't
waves<00:00:53.910> those<00:00:54.360> are<00:00:54.510> what<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:54.960> like<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.199> call

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
waves those are what I like to call

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.279 
waves those are what I like to call
ripples<00:00:55.879> if<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.000> take<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.239> look<00:00:57.510> at<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.050> huge

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
ripples if you take a look at the huge

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.529 
ripples if you take a look at the huge
wave<00:00:58.530> motion<00:00:58.980> machine<00:00:59.340> formula<00:00:59.940> we'll<00:01:00.300> see

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
wave motion machine formula we'll see

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.049 
wave motion machine formula we'll see
all<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.770> way<00:01:01.859> across<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.489> middle<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:02.879> see

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
all the way across the middle you see

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.640 
all the way across the middle you see
those<00:01:03.239> rolling<00:01:03.870> cresting<00:01:04.619> waves<00:01:06.110> so<00:01:07.110> relaxing

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
those rolling cresting waves so relaxing

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.289 
those rolling cresting waves so relaxing
to<00:01:07.799> watch

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
to watch

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.029 
to watch
that's<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.049> whole<00:01:10.140> purpose<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.859> wave

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:11.039 
that's the whole purpose of a wave

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:12.889 
that's the whole purpose of a wave

it's<00:01:13.259> supposed<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.740> be<00:01:13.859> therapeutic<00:01:14.579> in<00:01:15.149> a<00:01:15.240> way

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
it's supposed to be therapeutic in a way

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.980 
it's supposed to be therapeutic in a way
relaxing<00:01:17.149> and<00:01:18.149> that's<00:01:18.360> what<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.630> waves<00:01:18.810> are

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
relaxing and that's what the waves are

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.289 
relaxing and that's what the waves are
doing

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
doing

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.080 
doing
so<00:01:20.869> again
