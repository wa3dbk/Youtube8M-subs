00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.190
 more fax players and this time so 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.260
 special that is the resistance fax 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:23.689
 I bring you the biggest fan that I 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:26.260
 I know of the saga of Rousses but to me 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.260
 I do not even like it 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.120
 without and my way the mastermind behind 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.300
 of just like he was inspired by the game 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.920
 for nes released in 1989 called sweet 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.680
 home it was a haunted mansion 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.020
 besides being called the forerunner of 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.660
 survival horror at a time makes reference 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.370
 to a Japanese movie of the same name 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.650
 shinji mikami stated in an interview 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.570
 who did not want me to just from a nemesis 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.250
 taken number three because a lot 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.020
 people were going to believe that the continuation 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.850
 direct from freshly evil 2 with claire 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.370
 redfield looking for his brother crisis in 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.809
 europe although all the fans know that 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.860
 the direct continuation of just 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.860
 disclosed is code veronica 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.590
 in resident 3 when you finish the 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.750
 game is unlocked a mini game 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.770
 called the mercenaries where you could 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:19.960
 play with nicolai carlos and mik mik mik 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.960
 mik mijares mijhail 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.659
 in the PC version was already 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.950
 unlocked this mini game but 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.740
 you could only play with jill 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.109
 valentine although may cry started as a 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.270
 project for newly level 4 directed 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:39.250
 by hideki kamiya for playstation 2 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.259
 they decided that the character had to 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.060
 be almost invincible and with super strength 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.069
 human being which was justified in the 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.390
 history with biotechnology changed the 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:48.280
 camera system to make it more 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.109
 dynamic and suddenly they realized 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.789
 that they had already moved too far from 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:53.649
 what the freshly tibol series represents 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.840
 so stretcher and his team decided that 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.970
 well, it would be good to change the 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.079
 story completely and make a game 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.720
 right from the start 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:04.030
 and this hero is not going to call dante is 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.920
 was going to call tony lyon is the only 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.719
 main character of the story that 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.819
 you have never faced face to face and that 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:11.980
 Little is related to Western George 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.959
 a.romero better known as the king of 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.670
 zombie horror at some point wrote 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.280
 a script for the resident movie 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.750
 evil this movie was still a little bit more 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.000
 closely the original plot of the game 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.799
 although a small 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.079
 love story between chris and joe 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.940
 besides the fact that crist was not forming 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.889
 part of the team be at the end 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.300
 they decided to use the script better 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:33.460
 Paul Anderson 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.120
 but if they used Mr. Rosemary to 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:39.040
 a japanese commercial resident wood 2 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.569
 the exception was the character that 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.849
 had proposed as principal for the 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.980
 resentful beta but in the end it changed 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:48.599
 almost everything in the game and elsa was 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.599
 replaced by a very similar character 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.879
 and two support characters were robert 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.610
 going and jerry birkin this game is 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:59.769
 called by fans 1.5 although it does not form 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.790
 part of the canon of the creative saga 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.930
 arrow of the air force 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.819
 American for his part of 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.170
 commitment although in the recent 6 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.629
 we can see that he also has problems 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.519
 with other issues the first resident 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.590
 evil came with a marvel comic the 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.750
 which recounted the mission of the brave team 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.640
 in the mountains even though the first 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.769
 comic was published by this editorial 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.299
 the subsequent comics have nothing 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.010
 what to do with the story and they were 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:23.170
 published by well storm una 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.849
