00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
when you're around the net you don't

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.000 
when you're around the net you don't
have<00:00:35.600> a<00:00:35.629> lot<00:00:35.870> of<00:00:35.899> time<00:00:36.230> you<00:00:36.410> got<00:00:36.530> to<00:00:36.649> get<00:00:36.769> it<00:00:36.859> off

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
have a lot of time you got to get it off

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
at the net and hopefully you hit your

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.279 
at the net and hopefully you hit your
spot<00:00:43.010> it<00:00:43.969> really<00:00:44.420> depends<00:00:44.809> on<00:00:44.899> how<00:00:44.989> much<00:00:45.109> work

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
spot it really depends on how much work

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.049 
spot it really depends on how much work
you<00:00:45.350> put<00:00:45.649> into<00:00:45.829> it<00:00:45.920> I've<00:00:46.489> told<00:00:46.730> the<00:00:46.879> guys<00:00:47.030> that

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
you put into it I've told the guys that

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:48.399 
you put into it I've told the guys that
the<00:00:47.359> little<00:00:47.570> things<00:00:47.749> I've<00:00:47.899> working<00:00:48.079> on<00:00:48.260> your

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:48.409 
the little things I've working on your

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:50.049 
the little things I've working on your
shot<00:00:48.589> the<00:00:49.069> consistencies<00:00:49.670> of<00:00:49.819> when<00:00:49.940> you're

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
shot the consistencies of when you're

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.540 
shot the consistencies of when you're
under<00:00:50.239> pressure<00:00:50.559> what<00:00:51.559> to<00:00:51.710> look<00:00:51.859> for<00:00:52.190> you<00:00:52.460> know

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
under pressure what to look for you know

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.829 
under pressure what to look for you know
what<00:00:52.730> areas<00:00:52.999> you're<00:00:53.120> shooting<00:00:53.420> for<00:00:53.600> when<00:00:53.749> you

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:53.839 
what areas you're shooting for when you

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:56.950 
what areas you're shooting for when you
do<00:00:53.960> that<00:00:54.140> consistently<00:00:55.510> again<00:00:56.510> it<00:00:56.719> puts<00:00:56.839> you

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
do that consistently again it puts you

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.809 
do that consistently again it puts you
in<00:00:57.019> a<00:00:57.050> better<00:00:57.199> chance<00:00:57.440> to<00:00:57.559> be<00:00:57.649> successful<00:00:57.819> then

00:00:58.809 --> 00:00:58.819 
in a better chance to be successful then

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:00.790 
in a better chance to be successful then
you<00:00:58.909> have<00:00:59.059> the<00:00:59.210> half<00:00:59.530> it's<00:01:00.530> a<00:01:00.589> little

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
you have the half it's a little

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.559 
you have the half it's a little
snapshots<00:01:01.370> kind<00:01:01.609> of<00:01:01.670> a<00:01:01.729> half<00:01:01.879> a<00:01:02.030> long<00:01:02.149> time<00:01:02.420> but

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:02.569 
snapshots kind of a half a long time but

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:04.180 
snapshots kind of a half a long time but
it's<00:01:02.690> when<00:01:02.809> you're<00:01:02.960> around<00:01:03.109> the<00:01:03.289> net<00:01:03.499> you<00:01:04.159> have

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
it's when you're around the net you have

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.070 
it's when you're around the net you have
a<00:01:04.339> little<00:01:04.610> more<00:01:04.790> time<00:01:05.089> maybe<00:01:05.510> power<00:01:05.840> play

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
a little more time maybe power play

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:07.630 
a little more time maybe power play
different<00:01:06.440> situations<00:01:07.010> that<00:01:07.159> guys<00:01:07.310> elite

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
different situations that guys elite

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.969 
different situations that guys elite
left<00:01:07.909> you<00:01:08.060> in<00:01:08.180> front<00:01:08.390> of<00:01:08.479> the<00:01:08.540> net<00:01:08.689> so<00:01:08.869> it's<00:01:09.560> a

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
left you in front of the net so it's a

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:11.410 
left you in front of the net so it's a
real<00:01:10.159> short<00:01:10.369> one<00:01:10.640> time<00:01:10.880> we're<00:01:11.030> kind<00:01:11.149> of<00:01:11.240> from

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
real short one time we're kind of from

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.359 
real short one time we're kind of from
about<00:01:11.570> halfway<00:01:11.810> up<00:01:12.200> then<00:01:12.920> you<00:01:13.009> have<00:01:13.130> the<00:01:13.250> one

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
about halfway up then you have the one

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:14.740 
about halfway up then you have the one
timer<00:01:13.640> which<00:01:13.850> when<00:01:14.000> you<00:01:14.060> have<00:01:14.090> a<00:01:14.240> lot<00:01:14.420> of<00:01:14.450> time

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
timer which when you have a lot of time

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.480 
timer which when you have a lot of time
you<00:01:14.780> know<00:01:14.960> you're<00:01:15.259> open<00:01:15.590> probably<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:16.399> most

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
you know you're open probably the most

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.080 
you know you're open probably the most
powerful<00:01:16.729> shot<00:01:17.920> you<00:01:18.920> get<00:01:19.039> a<00:01:19.070> pass<00:01:19.340> from<00:01:19.579> from<00:01:19.969> a

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
powerful shot you get a pass from from a

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.600 
powerful shot you get a pass from from a
partner<00:01:20.840> a<00:01:20.869> player<00:01:21.170> and<00:01:21.500> you<00:01:22.189> have<00:01:22.310> all<00:01:22.460> the

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
partner a player and you have all the

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.889 
partner a player and you have all the
time<00:01:22.789> in<00:01:22.939> the<00:01:23.000> world<00:01:23.180> so<00:01:23.299> you<00:01:23.479> make<00:01:23.630> sure<00:01:23.659> the

00:01:23.889 --> 00:01:23.899 
time in the world so you make sure the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:25.539 
time in the world so you make sure the
time<00:01:24.110> he's<00:01:24.259> good<00:01:24.439> on<00:01:24.469> it<00:01:24.710> and<00:01:24.829> you<00:01:24.920> one-time<00:01:25.399> it

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
time he's good on it and you one-time it

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.789 
time he's good on it and you one-time it
which<00:01:25.960> probably<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.020> toughest<00:01:27.380> shot<00:01:27.530> to<00:01:27.680> do

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
which probably the toughest shot to do

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:29.859 
which probably the toughest shot to do
especially<00:01:27.979> when<00:01:28.340> you're<00:01:28.460> moving<00:01:28.579> now<00:01:29.570> some

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
especially when you're moving now some

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.749 
especially when you're moving now some
guys<00:01:29.990> are<00:01:30.200> really<00:01:30.320> good<00:01:30.530> at<00:01:30.680> it<00:01:30.799> and<00:01:31.579> then<00:01:31.729> you

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
guys are really good at it and then you

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:33.490 
guys are really good at it and then you
have<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:32.359> last<00:01:32.509> one<00:01:32.719> as<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:32.930> backhand<00:01:33.380> which

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
have the last one as the backhand which

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.990 
have the last one as the backhand which
you<00:01:33.619> use<00:01:33.770> in<00:01:33.920> a<00:01:33.979> lot<00:01:34.070> of<00:01:34.130> different<00:01:34.310> situations

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
you use in a lot of different situations

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.219 
you use in a lot of different situations
it<00:01:35.119> can<00:01:35.210> be<00:01:35.359> when<00:01:35.479> you're<00:01:35.539> coming<00:01:35.750> across<00:01:35.990> the

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
it can be when you're coming across the

it can be when you're coming across the
net<00:01:36.439> don't<00:01:36.979> have<00:01:37.189> time<00:01:37.460> to<00:01:37.609> go<00:01:37.759> to<00:01:37.789> your
