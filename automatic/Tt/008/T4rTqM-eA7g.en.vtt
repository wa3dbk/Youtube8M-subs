00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.600 
relation to a new program of work in our
repertoire<00:01:02.230> it's<00:01:03.230> always<00:01:03.500> a<00:01:03.530> risk<00:01:03.860> and<00:01:04.159> that's

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
repertoire it's always a risk and that's

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.399 
repertoire it's always a risk and that's
quite<00:01:04.850> exciting<00:01:05.449> one<00:01:05.659> of<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:05.869> special<00:01:06.350> things

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
quite exciting one of the special things

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.170 
quite exciting one of the special things
that<00:01:06.680> we<00:01:06.799> do<00:01:06.890> here<00:01:07.070> I<00:01:07.130> think<00:01:07.460> it's<00:01:07.580> that<00:01:07.670> we

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
that we do here I think it's that we

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.020 
that we do here I think it's that we
constantly<00:01:08.509> play<00:01:09.110> so<00:01:09.619> it's<00:01:09.830> a<00:01:09.890> very<00:01:10.030> strong

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
constantly play so it's a very strong

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.359 
constantly play so it's a very strong
participation<00:01:11.780> in<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.649> process<00:01:15.369> the

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
participation in the process the

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.430 
participation in the process the
choreographers<00:01:16.970> I<00:01:17.270> think<00:01:17.509> we<00:01:17.600> offer<00:01:17.720> really<00:01:18.170> a

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
choreographers I think we offer really a

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.109 
choreographers I think we offer really a
safe<00:01:18.860> place<00:01:19.100> to<00:01:19.159> come<00:01:19.430> and<00:01:19.460> try<00:01:19.759> things<00:01:19.820> out

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
safe place to come and try things out

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.510 
safe place to come and try things out
and<00:01:20.330> take<00:01:20.570> some<00:01:20.750> risks<00:01:21.140> it's<00:01:21.680> very<00:01:21.920> hard<00:01:22.159> to

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
and take some risks it's very hard to

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.190 
and take some risks it's very hard to
just<00:01:23.090> go<00:01:23.210> and<00:01:23.330> make<00:01:23.479> a<00:01:23.509> piece<00:01:23.750> of<00:01:23.780> work<00:01:23.990> on

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200
