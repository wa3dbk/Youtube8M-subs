it work so watch that then all you want
to<00:02:22.740> do<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.130> once<00:02:23.670> you're<00:02:23.760> on<00:02:23.819> that<00:02:23.880> lady<00:02:24.180> just

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
to do is once you're on that lady just

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.760 
to do is once you're on that lady just
wanna<00:02:24.599> as<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.050> can<00:02:25.200> see<00:02:25.319> why<00:02:25.470> they're<00:02:25.650> in<00:02:25.709> the

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
wanna as you can see why they're in the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.020 
wanna as you can see why they're in the
video<00:02:25.980> you're<00:02:26.310> just<00:02:26.459> basically<00:02:26.580> scribe

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
video you're just basically scribe

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.910 
video you're just basically scribe
jumping<00:02:27.390> boosting<00:02:27.840> pushing<00:02:28.170> forward<00:02:28.500> it's

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
jumping boosting pushing forward it's

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.500 
jumping boosting pushing forward it's
kind<00:02:29.130> of<00:02:29.160> easier<00:02:29.490> to<00:02:29.610> actually<00:02:29.700> get<00:02:30.000> on<00:02:30.150> top<00:02:30.360> of

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
kind of easier to actually get on top of

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.300 
kind of easier to actually get on top of
these<00:02:30.570> little<00:02:30.840> roof<00:02:31.140> here<00:02:31.410> then<00:02:32.040> actually

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
these little roof here then actually

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.230 
these little roof here then actually
getting<00:02:32.460> on<00:02:32.580> top<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:32.820> the<00:02:32.880> above

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
getting on top of the above

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.490 
getting on top of the above
to<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.510> left<00:02:33.690> that<00:02:33.900> they<00:02:33.990> too<00:02:34.050> are<00:02:34.200> getting<00:02:34.440> on

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
to the left that they too are getting on

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.080 
to the left that they too are getting on
top<00:02:34.650> of<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:34.860> a<00:02:34.920> few<00:02:35.100> times<00:02:35.160> i<00:02:35.490> failed<00:02:35.520> as<00:02:35.910> well

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
top of that a few times i failed as well

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.600 
top of that a few times i failed as well
so<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.720> is<00:02:36.840> quite<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.170> tricky<00:02:37.650> glitch<00:02:37.920> guys<00:02:38.190> but

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
so it is quite a tricky glitch guys but

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.980 
so it is quite a tricky glitch guys but
it's<00:02:38.760> very<00:02:39.030> very<00:02:39.270> worth<00:02:39.480> it<00:02:39.660> once<00:02:39.870> you

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
it's very very worth it once you

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.630 
it's very very worth it once you
actually<00:02:40.170> get<00:02:40.410> into<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:40.950> yet<00:02:41.100> should<00:02:41.280> get<00:02:41.400> onto

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
actually get into it yet should get onto

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.700 
actually get into it yet should get onto
it<00:02:41.670> but<00:02:42.240> it<00:02:42.480> does<00:02:42.750> take<00:02:43.020> quite<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.410> lot<00:02:43.620> of

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
it but it does take quite a lot of

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.770 
it but it does take quite a lot of
practice<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.610> like<00:02:44.820> I<00:02:44.850> said<00:02:45.150> guys<00:02:45.360> if<00:02:45.630> you<00:02:45.750> are

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
practice and like I said guys if you are

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.680 
practice and like I said guys if you are
actually<00:02:46.080> attempting<00:02:46.740> this<00:02:46.860> glitch<00:02:47.130> a<00:02:47.690> few

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
actually attempting this glitch a few

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.690 
actually attempting this glitch a few
words<00:02:48.990> of<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.380> voice<00:02:49.590> actually<00:02:50.040> which<00:02:50.490> I've

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
words of a voice actually which I've

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.330

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
you can see here I'll just jump and move

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.890 
you can see here I'll just jump and move
to<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.130> right<00:02:59.310> as<00:02:59.520> I'm<00:02:59.670> jumping<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.330> kind<00:03:00.840> of
