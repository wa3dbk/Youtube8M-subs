00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:12.059
 I have another video of the two themes 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.910
 that start with ever ravens model in you 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.310
 Someone who just stepped tea this model too 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.640
 never again data model decoy 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.439
 on he as the first ajax we later number 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.350
 involve your draw number 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.609
 two the y-axis here is the time and that 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.250
 time is a life here 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.650
 you see that for attacks that 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:36.480
 fluctuate you have good yes than the form 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:40.140
 hi like a hare snow hare a lot less 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.260
 good years like snow bunny and you see the 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.870
 deep water responds to it or the perlator 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:50.070
 the prey i talk music becomes forehead 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.350
 here to good years of prey 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.199
 we are of course also with links 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.410
 for example good morning again 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:02.969
 offspring rearing fact that 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.129
 5 that population of liberator after roy 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.640
 which had bad years really here 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:12.810
 also use the drop again at the water 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.000
 sees that such a kind to each other it is 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.280
 very important that you realize that 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.650
 the peak of detroit always before the peak 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.530
 from the pirate there and what lies in it 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.450
 model it's a model that's just that 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.220
 also in real life with real numbers such as 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.850
 see that again in 93 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.040
 t you see that back for you with 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.720
 obey the final exams are very demanding 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.729
 important if you need these charts 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.329
 signs that you actually makes good 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:42.479
 see to your examiner that you are prey 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.869
 Peak always comes before the pirate peak 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.229
 lie 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.390
 hi there we studied two 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.090
 let 's look at success success 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.340
 something very different but whatever 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:59.159
 I have to make a drawing or in one 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.830
 graphed again time in years 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.230
 I have here 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.660
 first x-axis idiomas drawn in the 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.970
 second x-axis i have no lion or stand up 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:11.560
 and make a few stitches what is session 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.700
 Well Success II is a bare sand flat that 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.050
 for example, reclaimed land here 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:20.210
 Netherlands reclaimed sand that 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.270
 is being colonized by the first 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:26.810
 plants and finally to 100 200 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:30.320
 year stands for good mail at that process 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.740
 from room sand plain to forest yes that 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.740
 do you know 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.240
 16 I have a try again 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.870
 give in a drawing 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.440
 you see someone sprinting graze grasses 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.530
 on the 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.740
 the short-lived short-lived reputation 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.200
 bushes and shrubbery here as they 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.880
 according to god's 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.230
 I want paper news presentation that 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.720
 find here at the beginning 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.660
 yes yes the pain that number climax 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.090
 results in you see that biomass 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.090
 is this black line that rising to 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:06.019
 somewhere in that climax reputation because that 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.810
 lady or plain and that it only goes 0 and 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.880
 so here in timax presentation there is 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.870
 recorded just as much by photosynthesis 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:19.850
 on one or that by that simulation 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:23.209
 more way comes to carbon dioxide 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.650
 so the idea that the tropical rain forest 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.680
 it all without the lungs of the 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.670
 earth his dear boss of this piece 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.769
 that graph 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.350
 incorrect to see that climax 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.180
 presentation no not in biomass and 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.980
 if it does not increase in biomass, then 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.120
 so I just can't get oxygen 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.650
 produce 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.630
 yes it is difficult to understand 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:46.489
 back to previous videos 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:49.130
 often video about energy theme yes fine 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.440
 yes for kilos of paper news presentation 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.050
 to do so therefore any successes 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.610
 other races called chances reynders like 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.830
 this went off 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.410
 yes we have to go back here 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.360
 whining just under half of that 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.670
 graph but that is never complete 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.450
 something always went wrong 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.690
 to be 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.690
 with which you 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.170
 reputation to the fire brigade 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.400
 grow and this is then secondary success 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.859
 goes much faster 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.959
 in the netherlands there are very bad 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.209
 try to do with your current one 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.760
 He fires off letting the grazing the 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.590
 sheep to ensure that your heart and that 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.840
 is measuring a stage between the juniac 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.270
 timax in that it stays there day 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.550
 in forest will have to pay attention 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.410
 Fight on some items that come with this 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.750
 have to do what am i going to ask about 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.280
 come in your final school exam 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.050
 think of abiotic factors that 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.340
 be different in ionic climax 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.860
 wave bags 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.350
 yes you do that vary a lot and here 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.000
 much more evenly yes 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.250
 amount of water becomes availability 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.250
 some keyless available here 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:56.039
 strongly varying and more even here 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.850
 plus a very raw type of yabai 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:59.280
 had to 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:02.310
 time drive climax presentation rounds 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:06.000
 in general, here's your own time 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:09.780
 here very small yes small numbers 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.669
 types and here very many species 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.349
 population magnification makes you large 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.110
 yes a few flat can grow in here 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:18.990
 the par organisms that you can exist 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.750
 they have a very large population and here 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.440
 a very small population and last 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.139
 still the 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.450
 food became complexity isio free 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:29.970
 simple and few species you have 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.919
 a little complex food web and here is 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.169
 it very complex 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:36.330
 yes see a few things about succession 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:38.940
 important for dutch here what me 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.280
 though not just for him said him too 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.770
 suspected closure that kind of thing 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:48.470
 well this was ecology two of you 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:48.470
 next more successful with biology
