was kind of checking cuz I really wanted

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.660 
was kind of checking cuz I really wanted
some<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.020> them<00:00:37.110> look<00:00:37.260> short<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.710> then<00:00:38.040> when

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
some of them look short and then when

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.069 
some of them look short and then when
you<00:00:38.760> braid<00:00:38.940> them<00:00:39.059> up<00:00:39.210> they're<00:00:39.390> not<00:00:39.420> as<00:00:39.690> long<00:00:39.930> as

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
you braid them up they're not as long as

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.040 
you braid them up they're not as long as
you<00:00:40.200> want<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:41.430> just<00:00:41.850> did<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.690> because<00:00:42.750> I

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
you want so I just did that because I

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.990 
you want so I just did that because I
really<00:00:43.410> wanted<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:44.250> longest<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.820> can

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
really wanted the longest that I can

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000 
really wanted the longest that I can
find<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.809> think<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.140> know<00:00:46.200> which<00:00:46.440> one<00:00:46.680> works

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
find and I think I know which one works

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.190 
find and I think I know which one works
really<00:00:47.100> well<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.640> it's<00:00:47.789> not<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.300> pricy<00:00:48.600> so

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
really well and it's not that pricy so

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.569 
really well and it's not that pricy so
hopefully<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.739> one<00:00:49.890> actually<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.309> can<00:00:50.550> find

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
hopefully the one actually you can find

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.180 
hopefully the one actually you can find
it<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.390> I'm<00:00:52.260> just<00:00:52.440> gonna<00:00:52.590> stop<00:00:52.829> running<00:00:52.980> my

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.670 
I open each of them the other hairs that
I<00:03:40.590> bought<00:03:40.920> came<00:03:41.520> more<00:03:42.150> like<00:03:42.560> together<00:03:43.560> like

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
I bought came more like together like

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.770 
I bought came more like together like

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
this so I those ones really needed

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.110 
this so I those ones really needed
opening<00:03:46.170> this<00:03:46.320> one<00:03:46.470> isn't<00:03:46.860> that<00:03:47.010> bad<00:03:47.250> cuz<00:03:47.940> it's

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
opening this one isn't that bad cuz it's

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.480 
opening this one isn't that bad cuz it's
pretty<00:03:48.330> stretched<00:03:48.630> out<00:03:48.840> already<00:03:49.350> so<00:03:49.500> I<00:03:49.980> don't

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
pretty stretched out already so I don't

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.130 
pretty stretched out already so I don't
just<00:03:50.610> stay<00:03:50.790> like<00:03:50.970> you<00:03:51.030> know<00:03:51.240> just<00:03:51.840> do<00:03:51.930> it<00:03:52.050> like

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
just stay like you know just do it like

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.170 
just stay like you know just do it like
this<00:03:52.350> and<00:03:53.100> then<00:03:53.220> that's<00:03:53.400> what<00:03:53.580> we<00:03:53.700> did<00:03:53.940> and

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
this and then that's what we did and

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.520 
this and then that's what we did and
then<00:03:54.300> she<00:03:54.330> twisted<00:03:54.870> it<00:03:55.020> and<00:03:55.140> that's<00:03:55.350> how<00:03:55.410> you

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
then she twisted it and that's how you

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.600 
then she twisted it and that's how you
got<00:03:55.770> these<00:03:55.920> little<00:03:56.160> big<00:03:56.520> juicy<00:03:56.940> twists<00:03:58.250> so<00:03:59.250> I

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
got these little big juicy twists so I

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.370 
got these little big juicy twists so I
really<00:04:00.240> like<00:04:00.450> these<00:04:00.630> and<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:00.990> reason<00:04:01.110> why<00:04:01.350> I

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
really like these and the reason why I

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.110 
really like these and the reason why I
chose<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.800> marley<00:04:02.130> twists<00:04:02.459> was<00:04:02.670> because

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
chose the marley twists was because

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.630 
chose the marley twists was because
since<00:04:04.050> my<00:04:04.110> hair<00:04:04.350> gets<00:04:04.620> really<00:04:04.860> old<00:04:05.070> and<00:04:05.370> this

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
since my hair gets really old and this

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
since my hair gets really old and this
looks<00:04:05.940> so<00:04:06.209> like<00:04:06.770> my<00:04:07.770> hair<00:04:08.160> like<00:04:08.430> natural<00:04:09.030> i<00:04:09.270> got

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
looks so like my hair like natural i got

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.390 
looks so like my hair like natural i got
this<00:04:09.780> because<00:04:09.900> once<00:04:10.410> my<00:04:10.500> hair<00:04:10.860> starts<00:04:11.160> getting

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
this because once my hair starts getting

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.240 
this because once my hair starts getting
older<00:04:11.820> it<00:04:12.510> would<00:04:12.720> like<00:04:13.020> it<00:04:13.290> won't<00:04:13.440> look<00:04:13.709> as<00:04:13.950> bad

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
older it would like it won't look as bad

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.729 
older it would like it won't look as bad
and<00:04:14.580> i<00:04:15.209> also<00:04:15.390> wanted<00:04:15.720> to<00:04:15.780> get<00:04:15.990> the<00:04:16.200> marley

were<00:04:36.540> wondering<00:04:36.570> why<00:04:37.140> my<00:04:37.440> edges<00:04:38.010> are<00:04:38.190> left<00:04:38.550> out

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
were wondering why my edges are left out

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.970 
were wondering why my edges are left out
is<00:04:39.030> because<00:04:39.240> since<00:04:39.930> they're<00:04:40.170> like<00:04:40.410> smaller

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
is because since they're like smaller

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.150 
is because since they're like smaller
hairs<00:04:41.850> I<00:04:42.180> didn't<00:04:42.690> want<00:04:42.900> them<00:04:43.170> to<00:04:43.440> break<00:04:43.980> off

hairs I didn't want them to break off

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.320 
hairs I didn't want them to break off
because<00:04:44.400> you<00:04:44.550> know<00:04:44.580> when<00:04:44.820> you<00:04:44.910> braid<00:04:45.120> your

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
because you know when you braid your

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.970 
because you know when you braid your
hair<00:04:45.360> and<00:04:45.630> they<00:04:45.720> take<00:04:46.020> a<00:04:46.050> dress<00:04:46.500> they<00:04:46.680> can<00:04:46.860> like

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980

I tie my hair so it can look a little

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.870 
I tie my hair so it can look a little
like<00:05:00.930> slicked<00:05:01.560> back<00:05:01.590> but<00:05:02.490> I<00:05:02.520> don't<00:05:02.790> really

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
like slicked back but I don't really

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.630 
like slicked back but I don't really
care<00:05:03.000> for<00:05:03.270> late<00:05:03.930> edges<00:05:04.410> I<00:05:04.590> just<00:05:04.890> read<00:05:05.340> 1/2

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
care for late edges I just read 1/2

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.050 
care for late edges I just read 1/2
edges<00:05:06.030> and<00:05:06.210> have<00:05:06.390> no<00:05:06.600> edges<00:05:07.020> so<00:05:07.260> yeah<00:05:08.070> this<00:05:08.880> is

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
edges and have no edges so yeah this is

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.790 
edges and have no edges so yeah this is
why<00:05:09.240> they're<00:05:09.600> not<00:05:09.750> rated<00:05:09.960> and<00:05:10.230> also<00:05:10.560> in<00:05:10.680> the

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
why they're not rated and also in the

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.400 
why they're not rated and also in the
back<00:05:13.070> in<00:05:14.070> the<00:05:14.130> back<00:05:14.669> I<00:05:14.940> have<00:05:15.210> here<00:05:15.870> right<00:05:16.110> here

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
back in the back I have here right here

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.220 
back in the back I have here right here
because<00:05:16.910> the<00:05:17.910> more<00:05:18.180> if<00:05:18.480> they're<00:05:18.840> like<00:05:18.990> in

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
because the more if they're like in

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.720 
because the more if they're like in
braids<00:05:19.530> they're<00:05:19.830> like<00:05:20.040> more<00:05:20.310> prone<00:05:20.580> to

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:20.730 
braids they're like more prone to

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.150 
braids they're like more prone to
breakage<00:05:21.090> so<00:05:21.270> I<00:05:21.300> just<00:05:21.630> oiled<00:05:21.960> them<00:05:22.140> down<00:05:22.500> every

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
breakage so I just oiled them down every
