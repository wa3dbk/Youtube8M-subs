lot<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.640> months<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.330> planning<00:01:18.540> and

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
lot of months of planning and

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.950 
lot of months of planning and
development<00:01:19.380> which<00:01:19.890> will<00:01:20.070> continue<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.960> 2013

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960
