00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hi youtuber friends i hope you know 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.560
 are having a great time with all their 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.109
 family 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.540
 Well, I decided to share a video of 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.179
 how to download a game called land 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.030
 of the dead for pc good let's start with 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.949
 the good video to start we're going to the 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.710
 download link that I have left in 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.380
 the description of the video once opened 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.240
 the link will be on the mega page that 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.600
 is where I have raised it point once 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.600
 inside 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:34.190
 we mark and accept the terms of 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.190
 download and now if we give in download 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.829
 once the file is downloaded we 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.539
 there will be a file like this 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.489
 we created a folder to put the 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.489
 file to have it more ordered 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.180
 once done that we proceed to open it 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.640
 now we will have to extract the file 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.040
 we click on it with the right button of the 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.040
 mouse and we give in extract here 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.170
 once the 100% extraction is finished 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.990
 will leave us a folder like this one where 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.600
 all the game files come what 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.810
 we open and as you can see they are all 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.810
 records 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.060
 well we continue with the process to open 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.980
 the game we have to open the setup for 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.410
 that is responsible for extracting all 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.340
 good game files we give you in 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.340
 where it says setup 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.450
 and as they will extract all 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.700
 game files we will have to wait 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:23.440
 a few minutes but it will be worth it 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.440
 because it 's a very good game 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.250
 and as I told you, it comes with multiplayer 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.600
 for all those vicious ones like me that 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.600
 we are all some gamers 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.060
 that we like to play online for 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.879
 throw a repeat with another person 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.670
 world whether it's Japanese Chinese 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:48.579
 who knows the joke is to pass it on 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.579
 well a little bit of real friends 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.219
 good as you see, the process of 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:35.469
 data extraction and the only thing missing 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:37.989
 is to look for the icon that will open the 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:40.629
 game and enjoy it and for that we 're going 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:43.629
 to the game folder we open it and 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:46.060
 we look for a folder called system and what 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:49.920
 we open and look for the icon of the game is 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.920
 the face of a zombie or something 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.829
 is this 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.020
 and create a shortcut to the desktop 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.569
 so that it's easier for them to open it, 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:05.239
 I'll leave so good we double click 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.510
 to run and we wait for it to 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.510
 open 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.530
 cargo load 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.980
 as my dear friends see if he opened it 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.380
 this means that if it works and everything 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.419
 now they have their little game and they will 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.669
 to play online to kill zombies of the 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.440
 world and as I told all those gamer 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:31.510
 who are addicted to online this game 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.510
 it comes with its multiplayer that works 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.530
 well first a profile is created then 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.530
 open the multiplayer 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.940
 and choose the server that is 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.060
 I will choose this good while opening 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.800
 this game I say goodbye to friends and I hope 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:17.930

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.610
