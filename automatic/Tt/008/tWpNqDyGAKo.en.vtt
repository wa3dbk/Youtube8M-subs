00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.680
 I'm carlos june from ap site carlo vrp 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.890
 and I come to bring you here today 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:32.240
 our first tutorial a way 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:35.210
 simple very simple even 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:39.500
 set up a playstation emulator the 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:42.980
 psp in a way that it does not look like 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:46.940
 is that it decreases a lot or ends 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:54.500
 fully with oleg well go here 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:57.980
 come here so far in the deadly game 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.660
 kombat I do not know about him here because with 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.670
 video recording he got a little 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:09.619
 slow really good 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:11.000
 the first thing you come here leap 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:16.130
 block 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:22.100
 if you leave a case it will not be good if 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:27.110
 You can put 12 here and leave 2 even 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:30.050
 frames and option marks to the 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:35.360
 justice seven screens and will mark the option 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:38.840
 also the first four here you 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.020
 see you will not be marking your four 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.020
 first 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:51.610
 the scale level is to disable the 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:55.350
 only supports the quality of curves 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.350
 up here to leave high 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:03.840
 Anisotropic filter 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:09.070
 enable texture filter and leave high 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:12.610
 since the team you score in the other 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:17.709
 You can leave it alone. 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:20.340
 now for fast memory system 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:27.280
 unstable and brand 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:29.230
 good I think it's just that and audio 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.709
 Here I have to do is actually 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.240
 because the audio will continue giving the 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.180
 LEDs in audio 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:42.550
 But if there's really no way you're going 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:44.380
 see that it has greatly improved performance 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.330
 of your games 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.660
 I got some mortal kombat I'm not going 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:53.050
 start here because with the program 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.120
 recording here it will not work 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:59.230
 Very well. 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:04.180

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.030

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.980
