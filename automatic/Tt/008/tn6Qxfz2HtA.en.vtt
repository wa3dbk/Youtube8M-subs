give it some chocolate flavor but if you

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.010 
give it some chocolate flavor but if you
don't<00:00:56.850> like<00:00:56.940> chocolate<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.629> know<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.780> could

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
leave it out if you wanted it's just

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
baking powder and the whole reason for

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.600 
baking powder and the whole reason for
adding<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.950> when<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.100> add<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.490> in

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
adding this is that when you add it in

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.370 
adding this is that when you add it in
it<00:01:08.850> will<00:01:08.939> actually<00:01:09.150> make<00:01:09.540> your<00:01:09.689> protein<00:01:10.140> cake

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
it will actually make your protein cake

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.090 
it will actually make your protein cake
rise<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.430> little<00:01:11.670> bit<00:01:11.790> fluffier<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.890> our<00:01:13.890> 1

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100

tablespoon<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.970> sweetener<00:01:15.450> today<00:01:16.020> I'm<00:01:16.229> using

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
tablespoon of sweetener today I'm using

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.710 
tablespoon of sweetener today I'm using
something<00:01:16.770> called<00:01:16.950> trivia<00:01:17.670> but<00:01:18.090> if<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.570> want

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
something called trivia but if you want

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.480 
something called trivia but if you want
to<00:01:18.780> use<00:01:18.930> any<00:01:19.320> other<00:01:19.470> kind<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:19.890> sweetener<00:01:20.280> maybe

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
to use any other kind of sweetener maybe

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.670 
to use any other kind of sweetener maybe
sugar<00:01:20.909> if<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.270> wanted<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.110> just<00:01:22.350> fit<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.590> in

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
to your macros feel free to do that and

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.660 
to your macros feel free to do that and
one<00:01:25.560> quick<00:01:25.830> thing<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.100> note<00:01:26.400> while<00:01:26.580> I'm

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
one quick thing to note while I'm

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.460 
one quick thing to note while I'm
stirring<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.119> up<00:01:27.299> here<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.290> may

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
stirring this up here is that you may

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.530 
stirring this up here is that you may
need<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.770> add<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.460> little<00:01:29.520> bit<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.299> water

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
need to add in a little bit of water

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.050 
need to add in a little bit of water
because<00:01:31.020> everyone's<00:01:31.710> protein<00:01:32.100> powder<00:01:32.280> really

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
because everyone's protein powder really

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.450 
because everyone's protein powder really
mixes<00:01:33.540> differently<00:01:33.990> for<00:01:34.200> my<00:01:34.290> experience<00:01:34.799> one

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
mixes differently for my experience one

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.980 
mixes differently for my experience one
protein<00:01:35.729> powder<00:01:36.030> might<00:01:36.270> be<00:01:36.420> really<00:01:36.720> thick

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
protein powder might be really thick

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.660 
protein powder might be really thick
when<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.320> mix<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.710> with<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:38.130> little<00:01:38.189> bit<00:01:38.579> of

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
when you mix it with a little bit of

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.420 
when you mix it with a little bit of
water<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.180> another<00:01:39.900> one<00:01:40.140> might<00:01:40.500> turn<00:01:40.799> into<00:01:41.009> a

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
water and another one might turn into a

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.700 
water and another one might turn into a
complete<00:01:41.820> soup<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.509> it's<00:01:43.020> really<00:01:43.350> just<00:01:43.500> a

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
complete soup so it's really just a

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.590 
complete soup so it's really just a
little<00:01:43.950> bit<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.399> trial<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.790> error<00:01:44.939> but<00:01:45.420> just

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
little bit of trial and error but just

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.359 
little bit of trial and error but just
keep<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:45.869> mind<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.350> may<00:01:46.560> need<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.770> add<00:01:46.979> in

got the perfect consistency after I

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.539

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
should be pretty thick like I said you

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.139 
should be pretty thick like I said you
don't<00:01:57.810> want<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.170> be<00:01:58.290> too<00:01:58.890> liquidy<00:01:59.490> so<00:01:59.969> now

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
don't want it to be too liquidy so now

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.969 
don't want it to be too liquidy so now
we're<00:02:00.360> going<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.630> do<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:01.020> actually<00:02:01.500> stick<00:02:01.770> this

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
we're going to do is actually stick this

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.310 
we're going to do is actually stick this
in<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.399> microwave<00:02:02.549> for<00:02:02.939> one<00:02:03.810> minute<00:02:03.840> and

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
in the microwave for one minute and

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.350 
in the microwave for one minute and
don't<00:02:05.159> microwave<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.700> for<00:02:05.729> any<00:02:05.969> longer

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
don't microwave it for any longer

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.869 
don't microwave it for any longer
because<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:07.200> longer<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.500> microwave<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.220> the

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
because the longer you microwave it the

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.330 
because the longer you microwave it the
more<00:02:09.090> turns<00:02:09.450> into<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.989> hockey<00:02:10.530> puck<00:02:10.830> trust<00:02:11.160> me

a lot as well so just start with one
minute<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.530> then<00:02:16.709> you<00:02:16.800> can<00:02:16.920> always<00:02:17.069> microwave

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670

it a little bit more later and there you

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.380 
it a little bit more later and there you
go<00:02:20.280> after<00:02:20.670> one<00:02:20.910> minute<00:02:21.030> in<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.360> microwave

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489

cake mine is still a little bit moist on
the<00:02:26.670> top<00:02:26.879> but<00:02:27.420> that's<00:02:27.510> just<00:02:27.750> how<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:27.959> like<00:02:28.230> it<00:02:28.260> so

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
the top but that's just how I like it so

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.619 
the top but that's just how I like it so
if<00:02:28.799> you<00:02:28.920> want<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.910> can<00:02:30.060> microwave<00:02:30.209> it<00:02:30.540> a

if you want to you can microwave it a
little<00:02:30.780> bit<00:02:30.930> longer<00:02:31.200> but<00:02:31.590> I<00:02:31.799> think<00:02:32.069> it<00:02:32.160> tastes

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
little bit longer but I think it tastes

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.880 
little bit longer but I think it tastes
better<00:02:32.549> when<00:02:33.000> it's<00:02:33.360> a<00:02:33.840> little<00:02:34.200> bit<00:02:34.349> gooey<00:02:34.590> but

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
better when it's a little bit gooey but

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.890 
better when it's a little bit gooey but
that's<00:02:35.010> just<00:02:35.129> me<00:02:35.340> personally<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:36.030> now<00:02:36.540> it's
