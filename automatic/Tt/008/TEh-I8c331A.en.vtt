just<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.710> synthesizer<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.789> is<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.570> drum<00:00:19.380> machine

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
just a synthesizer it is a drum machine

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.790 
just a synthesizer it is a drum machine
it's<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.699> sequencer<00:00:21.449> with<00:00:21.630> pattern<00:00:22.020> editor<00:00:22.230> and

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
it's a sequencer with pattern editor and

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.070 
it's a sequencer with pattern editor and
it's<00:00:23.160> also<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:23.519> mixer<00:00:24.000> with<00:00:24.449> full<00:00:24.720> on<00:00:24.840> board

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.019 
it's also a mixer with full on board
effects<00:00:25.439> so<00:00:25.830> you've<00:00:25.949> got<00:00:25.980> reverb<00:00:26.460> here<00:00:26.880> you've

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
effects so you've got reverb here you've

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.359 
effects so you've got reverb here you've
got<00:00:27.090> delay<00:00:27.539> types<00:00:27.869> you've<00:00:28.170> got<00:00:28.410> distortion

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
got delay types you've got distortion

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.220 
got delay types you've got distortion
with<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.699> little<00:00:29.880> valve<00:00:30.240> thing<00:00:30.660> going<00:00:30.990> on<00:00:31.050> as

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
with that little valve thing going on as

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.310 
with that little valve thing going on as
well<00:00:31.640> first<00:00:32.640> things<00:00:32.850> first<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.809> sound<00:00:34.170> of

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
well first things first the sound of

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.750 
well first things first the sound of
this<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.710> just<00:00:35.160> phenomenal<00:00:36.020> modif<00:00:37.020> onyx<00:00:37.290> synth

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
this is just phenomenal modif onyx synth

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.280 
this is just phenomenal modif onyx synth
real<00:00:38.760> classic<00:00:39.239> stuff<00:00:39.450> going<00:00:39.690> on<00:00:39.780> here<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.200> for

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
real classic stuff going on here so for

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.569 
real classic stuff going on here so for
example<00:00:40.410> you've<00:00:40.710> got<00:00:40.860> full<00:00:41.040> control<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
example you've got full control of the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.100 
example you've got full control of the
sound<00:00:41.850> so<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.090> can<00:00:42.210> edit<00:00:42.300> everything<00:00:42.690> from

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
sound so you can edit everything from

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.139 
sound so you can edit everything from
the<00:00:43.350> voltage<00:00:44.010> controlled<00:00:44.399> oscillators<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
the voltage controlled oscillators the

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.959 
the voltage controlled oscillators the
VCO<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.570> through<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.670> hallways<00:00:47.670> sine

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
VCO is through to the hallways sine

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.000 
VCO is through to the hallways sine
waves<00:00:48.180> all<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.480> stuff<00:00:48.780> fossil<00:00:49.500> ability<00:00:49.950> to

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
waves all that stuff fossil ability to

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.950 
waves all that stuff fossil ability to
change<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.309> filters<00:00:50.670> obviously<00:00:51.120> here<00:00:51.750> we<00:00:51.840> can

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
change the filters obviously here we can

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.380 
change the filters obviously here we can
draw<00:00:52.230> in<00:00:52.500> cables<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.670> we're<00:00:53.789> getting<00:00:53.910> proper

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
draw in cables so we're getting proper

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.119 
draw in cables so we're getting proper
back<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.780> old-skool<00:00:55.020> now<00:00:55.379> drawing<00:00:55.980> in

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
back to the old-skool now drawing in

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.680 
back to the old-skool now drawing in
cables<00:00:56.550> connecting<00:00:57.090> between<00:00:57.239> various

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
bunch of presets to get started so

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.770 
bunch of presets to get started so
you've<00:01:01.320> got<00:01:01.350> bass<00:01:01.649> sounds<00:01:02.219> lead<00:01:02.489> sounds<00:01:03.030> loads

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
you've got bass sounds lead sounds loads

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.600 
you've got bass sounds lead sounds loads
of<00:01:03.870> different<00:01:03.960> drum<00:01:04.290> sounds<00:01:04.680> as<00:01:04.769> well<00:01:04.979> because

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
of different drum sounds as well because

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.250 
of different drum sounds as well because
you<00:01:05.700> can<00:01:05.790> actually<00:01:05.880> use<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:06.780> as<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.020> sequence

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
you can actually use this as a sequence

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260 
you can actually use this as a sequence
they've<00:01:07.530> got<00:01:07.740> full<00:01:07.920> ability<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.460> control<00:01:09.150> the

drums the control technique here is very

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.000 
drums the control technique here is very
very<00:01:12.570> clever<00:01:12.900> we've<00:01:13.470> got<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.680> standard
