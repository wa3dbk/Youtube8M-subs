00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:15.750
 Let us now analyze a confrontation between 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:18.770
 fans against the center dominate the center 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:23.160
 it is extremely important 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:30.080
 usually dominate the center of the advantage 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:32.940
 then you need to know exactly how 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.989
 control the domain from the 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.850
 adversary 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:43.829
 if you do not control this domain 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:47.430
 certainly the center for being better 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:51.300
 will take advantage then look well let's go 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:57.660
 take as an example a game here that 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:01:03.469
 I played against laércio julian there we have 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.469
 here at the beginning here of Spanish 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:11.840
 usually here, but it seems 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:15.689
 played there and then made a change here 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.900
 like an Australian 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:24.450
 Let's continue here. 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:26.280
 there would be a normal continuation here to 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:33.840
 idea of ​​the australian 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:36.810
 but he did not change here and came to dominate 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.200
 here the whole central region 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.479
 so you need to be careful to be 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.610
 center do not stay we call suspense 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.020
 without support and whites need to take 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.729
 careful not to be too long 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:56.420
 Continuing strong tone of development 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.420
 of the match 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:07.560
 art at this time this bid would have a 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:11.760
 an exchange that an attack is that we are 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:16.500
 interesting but here begins a 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.129
 fan to engage center to attack this 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.890
 cent 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:23.400
 Come on, let's take a look at those three pieces. 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:27.769
 they are immobilized right now because 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.769
 There's a movement over there. 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.769
 be very careful to keep this 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:43.349
 here you need that three attacks 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:46.590
 here three defenses there so it is changed to 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:51.329
 back to gain a little time and 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:55.590
 start new development is coming 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:03:00.620
 an attack like that if he caught 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.959
 to bring this piece is totally 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:07.519
 vulnerable to attack 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.519
 So he switches here. 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:15.989
 maintaining the central domain and there begins the 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.980
 if the plan was born with that 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:23.280
 movement 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:25.310
 an attack to mark to leave this 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:30.510
 vulnerable piece 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:33.209
 those three remain 500 because here 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.129
 still with this bid 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:41.299
 we'll have all three attacks then 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:41.299
 law is still being mobilized and now 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:48.660
 wants to use it here he comes to defend this 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:53.280
 point because of this attack and he 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:56.159
 defends this point and now does all this 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:04.230
 central domain and now we start the 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:07.079
 process of attack and sits here and 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:10.650
 now we normal and development here 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:14.720
 to develop those parts that until 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:18.500
 now they have not left there they are late 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:22.310
 I do not have one right here as well. 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.590
 late at the time is born in the hand here 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.300
 but at the time thinking about developing 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:31.940
 here the initial hit an attack here is 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:35.230
 I prefer to play here and it's a mistake 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.190
 this is a loser and this center is going to 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.130
 to end 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:43.960
 I see the idea of ​​him playing here is that he 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:48.970
 was visualizing that after this exchange 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:53.900
 has a threat that now however he 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:56.750
 doing this here then recomposes that 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:01.790
 he is visualizing in this exchange he 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:06.020
 I was not seeing this bid is a bid 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:09.620
 I went to nav is a throw that starts a 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:12.380
 total involvement here in this position 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.040
 You can see now that you can not because of 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:20.770
 of s 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:26.060
 will capture and catch two and it's here 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:29.169
 Here you roll here can not because 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:33.169
 just attack, forced to leave there 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:37.160
 lady gets old touch can not 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:47.560
 here you can not then who's left here and 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:54.530
 there me here if he comes there play 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:59.780
 because when he plays and attacks the 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:03.800
 To recover the piece, just do it and there. 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:09.050
 There is no way to do anything else. 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:15.580
 in that position and there the lion played 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:19.460
 here now lets capture is threatening 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:22.569
 nef was now fully suspended 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:26.619
 totally debilitate subject this attack 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:29.979
 It's like it can not here because now it's going 

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:35.409
 attack there and it will filter and if it comes it comes 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:39.969
 come come then can not there they can not 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:40.919
 also because it has this one then it is 

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:44.889
 played 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:47.649
 there we give this time it can not 

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:53.229
 attack that she has attack gives this time 

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:58.509
 and is threatening not to force 

00:06:53.229 --> 00:07:02.259
 practically him to play there and after him 

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:03.869
 play or come up and is now 

00:07:02.259 --> 00:07:10.439
 throwing here 

00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:13.059
 then he played and there he played and if he 

00:07:10.439 --> 00:07:16.349
 abandoned was lost 

00:07:13.059 --> 00:07:21.249
 then see what's important in this 

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:26.529
 departure is to understand that this 

00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:32.039
 structure here if it has a part for 

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:35.740
 there you move to that is this attack 

00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:39.999
 she does not provide this structure is very 

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:42.689
 dangerous because she suffers this attack on 

00:07:39.999 --> 00:07:45.490
 as that is that piece and there 

00:07:42.689 --> 00:07:50.519
 gets very weak will lose the game 

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:50.519
 you have to be very careful to 

00:07:50.729 --> 00:07:55.829
 fight between us let's see more 

00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:55.829
 examples
