00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.860 
form it into the shape of the body the
car<00:03:30.630> okay

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
car okay

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.990 
car okay
next<00:03:32.200> we<00:03:32.319> can<00:03:32.470> cut<00:03:32.650> out<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:33.549> hole<00:03:33.760> in<00:03:33.940> the

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
next we can cut out the hole in the

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.850 
next we can cut out the hole in the
middle<00:03:34.120> where<00:03:34.390> he<00:03:34.450> sits<00:03:34.690> and<00:03:35.230> we<00:03:35.380> can<00:03:35.500> use<00:03:35.650> some

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
middle where he sits and we can use some
