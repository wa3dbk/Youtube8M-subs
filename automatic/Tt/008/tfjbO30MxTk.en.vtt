00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
working on the PS free safe transfer

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.490 
working on the PS free safe transfer
updates<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.809> when<00:00:54.930> I<00:00:54.960> figured<00:00:55.379> they

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
updates so this is when I figured they

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.810 
updates so this is when I figured they
did<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.680> while<00:00:55.890> ago<00:00:55.920> because<00:00:56.489> they<00:00:56.610> did<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
did a while ago because they did the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.700 
did a while ago because they did the
Xbox<00:00:57.120> 61<00:00:57.539> but<00:00:57.690> for<00:00:57.840> some<00:00:58.050> reason<00:00:58.320> looks<00:00:58.530> like

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
Xbox 61 but for some reason looks like

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.900 
Xbox 61 but for some reason looks like
they<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.190> ignored<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.579> maybe<00:00:59.789> they're

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
they just ignored it maybe they're

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.029 
they just ignored it maybe they're
expecting<00:01:00.420> less<00:01:00.570> sales<00:01:00.870> on<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.109> ps4<00:01:01.379> whatever

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
expecting less sales on the ps4 whatever

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.439 
expecting less sales on the ps4 whatever
but<00:01:02.190> yeah<00:01:02.280> they're<00:01:02.399> gonna<00:01:02.489> do<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:02.789> ps3<00:01:03.120> safe

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
but yeah they're gonna do this ps3 safe

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.880

was going on there and if you look for a

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.289 
was going on there and if you look for a
nether<00:01:55.530> portal<00:01:55.920> like<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.549> can't<00:01:56.820> see<00:01:57.030> water

through<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.049> like<00:01:58.259> turns<00:01:58.439> black<00:01:58.740> or

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
through it and it like turns black or

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.469 
through it and it like turns black or
something<00:01:59.340> although<00:01:59.880> they're<00:02:00.030> only<00:02:00.060> two

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
something although they're only two

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.969 
something although they're only two
visual<00:02:00.780> glitches<00:02:00.960> I've<00:02:01.320> noticed<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.860> there

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
visual glitches I've noticed and there

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.230 
visual glitches I've noticed and there
are<00:02:02.040> any<00:02:02.159> small<00:02:02.430> ones<00:02:02.579> like<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.880> doubt<00:02:03.030> he'll

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
are any small ones like I doubt he'll

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.789 
are any small ones like I doubt he'll
even<00:02:03.270> get<00:02:03.570> patched<00:02:03.840> because<00:02:04.200> they're<00:02:04.439> they're

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
even get patched because they're they're

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:05.780 
even get patched because they're they're
small<00:02:04.979> enough<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.219> they<00:02:05.399> won't<00:02:05.549> even<00:02:05.640> affect

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
small enough that they won't even affect

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.730 
small enough that they won't even affect
most<00:02:06.210> people<00:02:06.540> so<00:02:06.750> yeah<00:02:07.200> there<00:02:07.409> aren't<00:02:07.560> any

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
most people so yeah there aren't any

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.350 
most people so yeah there aren't any
real<00:02:08.069> major<00:02:08.369> glitches<00:02:08.729> but<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.179> looks<00:02:09.300> like

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
real major glitches but it looks like

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.150
