00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.449 
easily but if you're like me I would
rather<00:01:54.630> probably<00:01:55.169> take<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:55.859> off<00:01:56.009> anyway

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:56.459 
rather probably take that off anyway

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:59.179 
rather probably take that off anyway
maybe<00:01:57.419> duct<00:01:57.719> tape<00:01:57.899> or<00:01:58.079> something<00:01:58.409> give<00:01:59.009> it

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
maybe duct tape or something give it

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.550 
maybe duct tape or something give it
proper<00:01:59.789> like<00:02:00.029> a<00:02:00.060> post-apocalyptic<00:02:00.450> feel<00:02:01.319> it's

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
proper like a post-apocalyptic feel it's

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.370 
proper like a post-apocalyptic feel it's
got<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.799> black<00:02:02.130> coat<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.789> it<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.209> it<00:02:03.810> has<00:02:04.139> sort

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
got that black coat to it so it has sort

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.719 
got that black coat to it so it has sort
of<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:04.529> you<00:02:04.770> know<00:02:04.859> you<00:02:04.950> put<00:02:05.189> like<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.340> zombie

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
of that you know you put like a zombie

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.410 
of that you know you put like a zombie
green<00:02:06.799> paint<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.550> or<00:02:08.670> maybe<00:02:08.940> not<00:02:09.149> paint

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
green paint to it and or maybe not paint

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.890 
green paint to it and or maybe not paint
but<00:02:09.720> uh<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:10.410> know<00:02:11.360> tape<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.570> it<00:02:12.660> or<00:02:12.750> something

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
but uh you know tape to it or something

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.690 
but uh you know tape to it or something
that<00:02:13.110> would<00:02:13.170> probably<00:02:13.350> pretty<00:02:13.710> cool<00:02:14.300> easy

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
that would probably pretty cool easy

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.790 
that would probably pretty cool easy
very<00:02:16.060> easy<00:02:16.270> to<00:02:16.510> modify<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:17.290> I<00:02:17.530> think<00:02:17.709> that

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
very easy to modify and I think that

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.250 
very easy to modify and I think that
these<00:02:17.890> things<00:02:18.069> would<00:02:18.250> last<00:02:19.140> you<00:02:20.140> know

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
these things would last you know

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.070 
these things would last you know
hundreds<00:02:20.709> of<00:02:20.860> throws<00:02:21.160> easy<00:02:21.610> easy<00:02:22.540> as<00:02:22.870> long<00:02:23.050> as

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
hundreds of throws easy easy as long as

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.300 
hundreds of throws easy easy as long as
you<00:02:23.230> throw<00:02:23.500> it<00:02:23.560> right<00:02:23.739> you<00:02:23.920> know<00:02:24.010> half<00:02:24.190> the

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
you throw it right you know half the

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.670 
you throw it right you know half the
time<00:02:24.459> these<00:02:24.700> things<00:02:24.910> break<00:02:25.180> or<00:02:25.599> if<00:02:26.080> they<00:02:26.200> do<00:02:26.260> if

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
time these things break or if they do if

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.870 
time these things break or if they do if
they<00:02:26.860> do<00:02:26.980> fracture<00:02:27.340> a<00:02:27.370> lot<00:02:27.580> of<00:02:27.640> times<00:02:27.760> it's

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
they do fracture a lot of times it's

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.220 
they do fracture a lot of times it's
because<00:02:28.060> it<00:02:28.180> was<00:02:28.270> thrown<00:02:28.510> wrong<00:02:28.720> so<00:02:28.959> make<00:02:29.110> sure

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
because it was thrown wrong so make sure

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.449 
because it was thrown wrong so make sure

and you're throwing them properly and

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.270 
and you're throwing them properly and
whatever<00:02:32.260> stance

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280

whether it's with a rotation or without

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.150
