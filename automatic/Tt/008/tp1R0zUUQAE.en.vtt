00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
to what I'm talking about now the reason

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.440 
to what I'm talking about now the reason
that<00:01:04.199> this<00:01:04.320> works<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.979> because<00:01:05.250> in<00:01:05.820> Australia

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
that this works is because in Australia

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.899 
that this works is because in Australia
they<00:01:06.869> use<00:01:07.080> power<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:07.950> Australia<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.670> towel

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
they use power so Australia is towel

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.640 
they use power so Australia is towel
region<00:01:09.299> but<00:01:09.659> Australia<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.170> getting<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.530> game

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
region but Australia is getting the game

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.620 
region but Australia is getting the game
on<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.920> 20th<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.520> not<00:01:11.640> only<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.939> on<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.390> 20

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
on the 20th and not only that on the 20

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.929 
on the 20th and not only that on the 20
well<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.080> 20s<00:01:13.350> for<00:01:13.439> us<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.770> 21st<00:01:14.130> for<00:01:14.400> them<00:01:14.520> but

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939
