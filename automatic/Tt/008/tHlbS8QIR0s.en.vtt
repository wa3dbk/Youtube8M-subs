you buy one of these chain guys they

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.650 
you buy one of these chain guys they
come<00:00:22.949> assembled<00:00:23.430> like<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:23.789> you<00:00:24.420> just<00:00:24.570> need

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
come assembled like this you just need

come assembled like this you just need
to<00:00:24.840> loosen<00:00:25.140> them<00:00:25.760> so<00:00:27.890> not<00:00:28.890> quite<00:00:29.369> lined<00:00:29.730> up

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
to loosen them so not quite lined up

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.939 
to loosen them so not quite lined up
there<00:00:30.060> I<00:00:30.090> go<00:00:30.269> I'm<00:00:30.420> lined<00:00:30.660> up<00:00:30.840> pull<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.740> plastic

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
there I go I'm lined up pull the plastic

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.549 
there I go I'm lined up pull the plastic
so<00:00:32.340> I'm<00:00:32.430> out<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.700> way<00:00:33.739> and<00:00:34.739> now<00:00:36.320> torque<00:00:37.320> on

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
so I'm out of the way and now torque on

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:55.279 
so I'm out of the way and now torque on
a<00:00:38.190> crank<00:00:38.700> bolt<00:00:51.739> and<00:00:53.120> as<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.539> crank<00:00:54.870> starts<00:00:55.230> to

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
a crank bolt and as this crank starts to

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.869 
a crank bolt and as this crank starts to
get<00:00:55.440> more<00:00:55.559> seated<00:00:55.980> I'll<00:00:56.100> be<00:00:56.309> able<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.550> see<00:00:56.730> if

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
get more seated I'll be able to see if

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.450 
get more seated I'll be able to see if
the<00:00:57.059> spacing<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.949> correct<00:00:58.949> for<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.219> chain

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
the spacing is correct for the chain

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.360 
the spacing is correct for the chain
line<00:00:59.670> on<00:00:59.820> my<00:00:59.940> bike<00:01:00.710> what<00:01:01.710> we'll<00:01:01.859> want<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.190> look

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
line on my bike what we'll want to look

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.600 
line on my bike what we'll want to look
for<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.850> now<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.170> tight<00:01:04.610> we're

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
for is now that this is tight we're

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.170 
for is now that this is tight we're
going<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.850> want<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.119> look<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.360> see<00:01:06.570> if<00:01:06.900> the

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
going to want to look to see if the

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:15.160 
going to want to look to see if the
roller<00:01:09.180> here<00:01:09.740> lines<00:01:10.740> up<00:01:11.900> with<00:01:12.900> chainring<00:01:13.740> and

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
roller here lines up with chainring and

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.609 
roller here lines up with chainring and
lo<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.350> behold<00:01:17.360> it<00:01:18.360> looks<00:01:18.689> like<00:01:18.960> they<00:01:19.320> are<00:01:19.350> in

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
lo and behold it looks like they are in

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.670 
lo and behold it looks like they are in
the<00:01:19.740> same<00:01:19.920> plane<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.939> that's<00:01:21.119> good<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.630> got<00:01:22.560> my

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
the same plane so that's good I got my

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.429 
the same plane so that's good I got my
roller<00:01:22.920> I've<00:01:23.700> got<00:01:23.850> my<00:01:23.939> chain<00:01:24.180> ring<00:01:24.439> they're

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
roller I've got my chain ring they're

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.840 
roller I've got my chain ring they're
lined<00:01:25.650> up<00:01:25.799> together<00:01:27.950> my<00:01:28.950> chain<00:01:29.280> ring<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.549> also

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
lined up together my chain ring is also

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.429 
lined up together my chain ring is also
centered<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.689> middle<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.049> plastics

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
centered in the middle of the plastics

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.730 
centered in the middle of the plastics
here<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:33.000> means<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.869> got<00:01:34.320> my<00:01:34.439> spacing

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
here so that means that I got my spacing

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.030 
here so that means that I got my spacing
correct<00:01:35.960> so<00:01:36.960> now<00:01:37.140> I'm<00:01:37.380> just<00:01:37.740> going<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.340> finish

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
correct so now I'm just going to finish

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.160 
correct so now I'm just going to finish
by<00:01:41.040> running<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.060> chain<00:01:42.299> through<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.869> chain

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
by running the chain through the chain

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.600 
by running the chain through the chain
guide<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:44.030> in<00:01:45.500> no<00:01:46.500> time<00:01:46.710> flat<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:47.250> will<00:01:47.520> have

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
guide and in no time flat I will have

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.230 
guide and in no time flat I will have
installed<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.380> little<00:01:49.380> bit<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.560> peace<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.799> mind

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
installed a little bit of peace of mind

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.719 
installed a little bit of peace of mind
onto<00:01:51.240> my<00:01:51.420> downhill<00:01:51.720> bike<00:01:52.250> so<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.520> can

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
onto my downhill bike so that I can

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.209 
onto my downhill bike so that I can
pedal<00:01:54.509> this<00:01:54.630> thing<00:01:54.899> instead<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.350> just<00:01:55.500> Coast

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
pedal this thing instead of just Coast

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.729 
pedal this thing instead of just Coast
