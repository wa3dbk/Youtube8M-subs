00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.480
 when new games are announced 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.790
 graphic item is always placed in 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.460
 this game is one of the most 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.220
 important it ultimately enables the 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.220
 game emit life with the arrival of 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.380
 playstation 4 of xbox one the main 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.570
 index developers were small 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.119
 demonstrations of their new engines 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.760
 graphics each company focused on 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.679
 specific details and lights up in 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.510
 different applications 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.270
 today we will show the main 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.250
 news of these graphics engines and the 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.420
 that we are about to witness in the new 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.790
 video games 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.570
 get ready to drool in the most 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.570
 overturned 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.030
 the current version of amm and I understood already 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.220
 showed us his powers 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.040
 however the developer has a 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.470
 letter to the next generation in 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.660
 development in the last ten years to 1 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.830
 thousand in 2014 promises some improvements 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.850
 significant differences in one of the 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.860
 we can see the lighting effects 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.720
 very well applied 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.360
 introduction of infiltrating 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.350
 show perfect balance between shadows and 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.780
 lights 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.910
 the use of the vocal technique with tracy is the 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.910
 responsible for global lighting 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.770
 in the other tech demo the smoke with the volume 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.630
 particles in the air show that the new 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.979
 in is going to take care of everything in the minima 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.110
 Details 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.750
 The third axis is of course a 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.920
 notable in this second video but it does not 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.920
 it's exactly news 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.800
 the quest set Venus impressing from the 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.550
 first focus now falls on the customer 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.530
 in 3 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.990
 the company has been exploring games 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.250
 maximum and giving true demonstrations 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.290
 of realism 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.460
 we have already seen the power of the graphics engine in 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.960
 crises 3 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.330
 but it's worth recapitulating some 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.700
 features to create a world 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.550
 incredibly detailed on the croisette 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.290
 bet even in the shadows of the clouds in 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.240
 a mist with the volume that reacts 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.790
 according to the scenario in the selective 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.920
 for visitation and for animals in the 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.620
 volume of water that has changed when 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.300
 more or less objects inside it and in 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.300
 some camera effects 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.430
 capcom stayed for some years without working 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.910
 heavy on one on me but the ps4 the xbox 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.220
 one 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.680
 were good reasons to create something 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.320
 completely innovative in the demonstration 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.600
 from the developer showed the 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.920
 most impressive effects of fire that 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.890
 we already saw 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.230
 beyond that specific point the motor 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.160
 pantanal graphic law will make good use of tc 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.110
 lei chan 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.110
 notice the details of the dragon 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.349
 lighting effects are also 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.319
 very well applied and try to limit the 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:04.599
 maximum the reality the rendering of 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.090
 volumetric objects of an extra 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:10.540
 experience as in the case of columns and 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.000
 of the walls breaking the games of the 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.219
 square have always been incredibly beautiful 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.810
 and the next games of the company do not 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:19.239
 will be different 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.219
 while other developers focus on 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.680
 create features to enhance visuals 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:29.950
 the light is not focused on 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:32.200
 animations to choose has not stopped 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.060
 innovate and indy photo realism 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.609
 notable in environments 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.040
 the combination of lighting shadows of 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.560
 characters full of details leaves 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.079
 anyone gasping to focus on 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.389
 details such as dust, sparks and 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.219
 other elements we can see that this 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:52.560
 graphics engine is ready to 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:52.560
 deliver very well finished games 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.970
 in this case after impressing us 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.160
 with the graphics of metal gear solid 4 to 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.070
 delpo giba team decided to create a 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.080
 for metal gear solid 5 and 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.990
 other games of konami 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:21.130
 again the kojima team bet on the 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:23.260
 same graphics for cgi and gameplay as 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.690
 fox and novelties are also notable 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.000
 in the simulation of climate in the 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.790
 time that happen in real time 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.230
 the new engine accompanies the graphic jump 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.090
 from one generation to another 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.340
 but it does not intend to deliver 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.440
 advanced tess features and read and 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.280
 lighting effects such as those of other 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.440
 in jeans 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.340
 anyway she 'll look beautiful and 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.340
 many games 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:51.560
 investing in graphics is important but there are 

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:53.180
 other elements that are also 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.030
 indy dependent 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.879
 there sportnet his mother showing new 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.949
 visual but capricha in the animations and 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:04.250
 other important elements for games 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:06.199
 of sports ignatti tries to imitate the 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.659
 realistic movement of players 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:09.979
 working on the joints and the reaction 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:12.530
 two athletes 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:15.469
 In addition, the engine of the 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:18.050
 most convincing stadium environments 

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:21.069
 and the twisted ones are much more convincing 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.069
 thanks to ignited 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.699
 i while some companies are betting 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.560
 exclusively in the islands comes Yunit 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:36.069
 creating news for future games 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.599
 iphone 4 smartphone was refurbished 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:39.759
 in all senses 

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:41.949
 it can work with direct x 11 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:44.469
 offer amazing animations with 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:46.780
 system mechanism and provide visual 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:49.349
 with precise control of 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.349
 lighting 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:06:00.610
 while the majority of semester offers 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.159
 tools for complete modeling of the 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.949
 play a in light in focus in the treatment of 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:08.080
 lighting the dilma graphic engine 

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:09.699
 already applied in some games of the 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.189
 current generation but its true 

00:06:09.699 --> 00:06:15.189
 potential will be remarkable in Belo horizonte 

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:18.550
 4 star wars battlefront and other titles 

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:20.680
 of xbox one and ps4 that and 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.469
 photo realistic visuals and 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.360
 may even be used together with 

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:27.729
 the year is 4 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.099
 surely the games are much more 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:33.089
 with this illumination that mimics 

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:36.699
 perfectly the real world 

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:38.770
 good after so many in jeans we want 

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:40.509
 do some additional demonstrations 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.770
 for you to have another idea of ​​the future 

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:43.900
 of games 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:47.080
 It is first worth paying attention to what the 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:49.360
 NVIDIA has developed the pomegranate demo 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:51.610
 made the manufacturer of video cards 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.620
 showed incredible details that can 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:56.919
 be part of the gameplay of the next 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:59.740
 games another demo that impressed us is 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:01.659
 a fire strike afp marc caprichou na 

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.759
 current version of 3d mark 

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:06.400
 the result is an amazing scene 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:08.289
 loaded with details that only rotate the 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.900
 Graphics Cards Plus Tops 

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:13.000
 although this animation is very heavy 

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:15.909
 shows with the future of the games is 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.279
 incredibly beautiful probably not 

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:20.439
 we will have such beautiful games at the start of 

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:22.389
 eighth generation of consoles but with 

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:24.849
 over time we will see titles with 

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:27.449
 stunning visuals is our next 

00:07:24.849 --> 00:07:27.449
 video
