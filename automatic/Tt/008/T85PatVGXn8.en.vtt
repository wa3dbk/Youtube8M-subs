00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:16.260
 an excellent since created in June 2009 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.720
 even by this neighborhood 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.930
 who proposes the buyout of cell phones will play big profits from 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:22.759
 the association 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:23.880
 there is 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.090
 interviews with partners on international issues 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.640
 electronic waste management 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.760
 and in this context we found that in France only 3% of 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.930
 cell phones were recycled and 40% of these phones 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.620
 with tea store it in the drawers 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.250
 so we decided to find an innovative way 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.100
 one to allow people to remake also just makes their phone 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.710
 portable if possible in the evening a good action from where the idea of ​​master 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.720
 maxppp 415 in october 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.010
 my experience a second life 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.380
 it also allows you to finance the acquisition of your choice 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.680
 this home service from the inside of the device you choose 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.760
 the association 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.550
 it is not possible 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.510
 the arranged 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.070
 Gbagbo 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.090
 Guaranteed emotions 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.780
 among the solutions are already partners in the current 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.640
 and for these all have one thing in common is that the work in the evening the 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.590
 time humanity 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.800
 r in ecology and the environment 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.980
 in europe the social and solidarity economy or other 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.960
 our goal is to make tailor-made mobile phone 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.320
 we get mobile showing more offensive German French bought 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.320
 second-hand shops - directly via internet 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.120
 to bring in a second time to let all these phones will be 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.130
 also to be exported generally to emerging countries where there is a 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.050
 very high demand 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.050
 and all non-repairable phones 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.360
 or the state of the leaders can all 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.250
 an envoy to the ecosystem that today the recycling sector 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.940
 approved by the French state 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.050
 an excellent is an innovative e-commerce site resting on a concept 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.939
 we learn at the shops in the sense of riverstone 902 tons to reverse 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.969
 and the principle is to allow individuals to find a property 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:10.420
 used on the internet as easily as they get them 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.059
 eventually the internal dialogue is also 

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:16.529
 this innovation services relies only on innovative algorithms that we 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:19.999
 today allow two works to know the value benefiting well 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:20.799
 second hand 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.139
 I am happy the different markets and that's what allows us today 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:26.059
 to commit ourselves to redeem phones 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:27.979
 finally to benefit because session 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:32.369
 today employed a phone can halve for this 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:36.239
 a logical principle since it will extract - of materials 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.859
 first and foremost to precious metals such as gold, palladium and 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:41.409
 copper who wish to contribute 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:43.519
 on printed circuits has mainly 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.010
 a second level today the mobile phone as to what 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.250
 moment when they are not recycled or matches the recycle can 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:52.019
 having an impact on the environment will be important since 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.919
 many 

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:55.529
 we have to find ourselves 

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:58.579
 in the phones and especially at the battery road level we 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.989
 also work on them on the social dimension of the excellent because at 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.479
 beyond allowing associations to find funding 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:06.429
 additional 

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:09.339
 we also work with the social and solidarity economy 

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:13.509
 seemingly all to respond exclusively to all of 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:17.709
 phone treatments at institutions thirty employees have some 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.799
 workers with disabilities as an excellent areas is 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:21.689
 currently 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:25.079
 opposite football to finance its rapid development 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.239
 this is the sales comment of connected phones the goal of 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.239
 the state is to create just over 30% at the level of 

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:37.680
 it also acts the goal is to fund a hundred associations via 

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:39.849
 its service since today any association can 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.279
 afford what is excellent for raising money the socialists
