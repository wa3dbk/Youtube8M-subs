okay<00:00:01.319> so<00:00:01.380> this<00:00:01.709> tutorial<00:00:01.890> is<00:00:02.639> related<00:00:03.389> to

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
okay so this tutorial is related to

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.059 
okay so this tutorial is related to
hotkeys<00:00:04.410> for<00:00:05.310> example<00:00:05.790> here's<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.120> folder

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:07.069 
hotkeys for example here's the folder

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.820 
hotkeys for example here's the folder
Adobe<00:00:08.069> Reader<00:00:08.280> and<00:00:08.880> that's<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.830> executable

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
Adobe Reader and that's the executable

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.970 
Adobe Reader and that's the executable
and<00:00:11.099> if<00:00:11.880> I<00:00:12.059> simply<00:00:12.570> drag<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.139> file<00:00:13.469> with<00:00:13.830> the

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
and if I simply drag the file with the

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.450 
and if I simply drag the file with the
right<00:00:14.340> key<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:15.080> create<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.199> shortcut<00:00:17.660> then<00:00:18.660> I

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
right key and create a shortcut then I

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
right key and create a shortcut then I
can<00:00:20.460> add<00:00:20.789> a<00:00:21.330> dot<00:00:21.720> here<00:00:21.990> at<00:00:22.680> properties<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.640> can

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
can add a dot here at properties I can

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.230 
can add a dot here at properties I can
add<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.630> shortcut<00:00:25.260> key<00:00:25.590> here<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.369> is<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.820> shortcut

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
add a shortcut key here it is a shortcut

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
add a shortcut key here it is a shortcut
key<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.949> cursor<00:00:29.369> there<00:00:29.699> and<00:00:30.029> press<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:31.050> key

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
key is the cursor there and press a key

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.819 
key is the cursor there and press a key
combination<00:00:31.529> for<00:00:32.489> example<00:00:32.940> control<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.719> Alt<00:00:34.380> +

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
combination for example control a Alt +

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:41.260 
combination for example control a Alt +
E<00:00:35.780> which<00:00:36.780> control<00:00:37.440> out<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:39.680> key

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
E which control out and a key

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.229 
E which control out and a key
let's<00:00:42.270> close<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.750> with<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:42.960> ok<00:00:43.500> button<00:00:43.920> and

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
let's close it with the ok button and

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.130 
let's close it with the ok button and
now<00:00:45.239> if<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.660> pressing<00:00:46.350> ctrl<00:00:47.010> Alt<00:00:47.280> +<00:00:47.700> E<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
now if I pressing ctrl Alt + E on the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.350 
now if I pressing ctrl Alt + E on the
keyboard<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:50.070> program<00:00:50.550> automatically

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
keyboard the program automatically

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.729 
keyboard the program automatically
appears<00:00:52.129> so<00:00:53.129> that's<00:00:53.340> working<00:00:54.170> but<00:00:55.170> there<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.680> a

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
appears so that's working but there is a

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.189 
appears so that's working but there is a
problem<00:00:55.980> if<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.699> start<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.239> computer<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.020> this

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
problem if I start the computer and this

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.880 
problem if I start the computer and this
shortcut<00:00:58.739> won't<00:00:59.100> work<00:00:59.399> anymore<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.590> to<00:01:01.590> fix

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240 
that problem let's go to file explorer

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.539 
that problem let's go to file explorer
and<00:01:06.240> let's<00:01:07.049> go<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.439> C<00:01:07.680> Drive<00:01:07.710> where

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
and let's go to the C Drive where

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.250 
and let's go to the C Drive where
Windows<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.060> installed<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:10.729> program<00:01:11.729> data<00:01:12.260> if

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
Windows is installed and program data if

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.120 
Windows is installed and program data if

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
program data is not visible then go up

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.260 
program data is not visible then go up
here<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.460> view<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.960> menu<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.880> make<00:01:20.880> sure
