 as always, the best were Borisov 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.050

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.779
 first of April they showed absolutely 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.309

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.370
 those nuts of which the enemies just breaks on 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.370

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.930
 on the archivist lav so much that dies 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.320

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.370
 more calls announced new 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.670

 it's called yesterday front 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.700
 this is a robot transformer that is going to 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.150
 straight with the base 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.570
 Well, in general, you can see for yourself 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.570
 cheerful such uncle 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.230
 and now about serious developers from 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.850
 It was decided in Gims those who created the series 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.740
 Foam brother announced their 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.070
 the next project called he much 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.020
 it will also be a first-person city action 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.940
 which will occur 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.410
 eighteenth century 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.450
 I will not be afraid of this word 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.280
 want to wounds in their new project 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.690
 all that they could not realize on the eve 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.430
 rave 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.410
 make the game as scary as possible 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.480
 and atmospheric 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.570
 I already anticipate this horror in a good way 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.060
 the words 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.130
 some have become known 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.100
 details of the game just cause 2 the game will continue 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.270
 the story of the first part and again takes us 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.829
 into the dangerous jungle where armed 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.409
 militants and all sorts of scum that can and 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.580
 need to kill 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.670
 in the second part there will be just a big and st 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.980
 but this was to be expected 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.050
 The main character of the game Radko Rodriguez 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.020
 will learn to use hooks better and 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.230
 will be able to do even more incredible 

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:09.849
 stunt tricks 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.980
 the game will be more than a hundred modes of transport 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.349
 including cars trucks motorcycles 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.339
 boats airplanes and helicopters 

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:18.589
 and there will be 50 different mates 

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:20.699
 other tasks given that the first 

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:22.889
 parts just lacked diversity 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:26.170
 just cause 2 has good chances of success 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.900
 the game will be released this year for rental and xbox 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.900
 360 and playstation 3 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:35.489
 and you know what's what and other schools children and 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.099
 Andrea persistently ment improve vision and in 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.740
 features contrasting vision 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.300
 yes it's true if the players are sims and others 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.250
 quiet games of view practically not 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.610
 will improve and may even get worse 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:47.870
 if you play shooters from the first 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.610
 faces best lights stubbornly minfin 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.820
 then contrasting vision can improve 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:53.839
 by far 

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:56.449
 such a study conducted by scientists and the media 

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:58.369
 York University is shorter 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:00.449
 countries they recruited volunteers and 

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:03.199
 divided them into two groups one border with 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.549
 others were bombed as a result of the second group 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:07.789
 showed improvements in contrast vision 

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:11.579
 by 62 percent and the first by only 11 percent 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.479
 however scientists all the time repeat that 

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:16.209
 people played 2 hours a day if you play 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.029
 more then no improvement 

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:20.769
 will work or may even get worse 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.590
 so lovers now wants even 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.590
 useful for example he 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:28.689
 Crisis publishing 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:31.029
 experiencing also not the best times on 

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:32.719
 the last meeting of directors was 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:34.609
 Immediately proposed three si body 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.489
 this is its cable 3 which will appear in 2011 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.090
 reported as 4 and darksiders 2 in which 

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:43.609
 will also enter 2012 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.639
 cool the fact that all these games already 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:47.309
 is in development regardless 

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:49.539
 on the fact that I am pleased to inform Cyril and the dark side 

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:50.849
 entertainment out 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.339
 so live and glasses reminded 

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:54.819
 gathered there lobster package settlers 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.659
 arcana 40 thousand what will see the light in 2012 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:03:59.659
 some more projects 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:01.439
 develop controllable 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:04.199
 publishing studio and a total of geshke 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:06.150
 the south has at least six in development 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.809
 high budget keeper 

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:09.309
 I remind you once again that it can 

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:12.169
 40 thousand cameras will be needed all the same and 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:15.359
 it's great 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:19.049
 the head of the company ubisoft willows giymo told the magazine 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.419
 Kiev informer that until March next year 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.740
 the company is going to release such games 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.620
 as the remaining 32 splinter cell conviction rostel 2 is 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.370
 alternating their load brand tom clancy 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.669

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.689
 wins from until March next year 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:38.199
 by the way another project should come out 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.199
 athe besovstvo this beyond good industry was 2 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.650
 the game according to the developers will be 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.190
 more exciting and generally cooler than 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.130
 First part 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.700
 because in the original Igor 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.460
 the developers didn't do what 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.480
 wanted because of the weak technical 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.550
 characteristics position 2 basics consoles 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.240
 they all will see though clearly 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.240
 I will not play anyway 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.009
 interpol publishing house and 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:07.259
 whose rights to create on the brain 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:09.860
 flu fallout he finally remembered it 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.919
 as stated that the development will take 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:13.330
 Bulgarian independent studio 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.830
 studio masks 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.159
 Interboy will supply both money and 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:19.360
 in every way possible to help and in response to the developers 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.660
 share their other workings 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.780
 All the same, the experience of non-Hindu because 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.450
 preparing to exit his game of the genre foreign car 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.270
 r and strangely enough about 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.390
 postapocalyptic future of the earth 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.320
 she's called an actor trying and will come out already 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.180
 in the second half of this year 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.759
 But on the terms of the fallout online yet speak 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:40.490
 early 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.449
 in continuation of the topic she can package 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:44.419
 there was news that the studio is not the limit 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:46.039
 who is headed by a former employee 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:48.130
 Morse call, or rather chief designer 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.449
 it was impossible two attacks not django 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:51.110
 Maldini 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.090
 announced it can raise the angle that 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.689
 stands for Levin the author of the gate 

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:58.650
 or life after the war 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.059
 again the theme of the post apocalypse 

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:03.259
 as you can see nothing but concept art 

00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:05.409
 No, the game still passes as 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:07.129
 fiction and show it from all 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:09.369
 parties, the developers do not want yet 

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:12.009
 but the plot of the story at all tearing the brain 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:14.549
 two thousand three hundred fifty and a year 

00:06:14.549 --> 00:06:16.349
 humanity is returning to earth 

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:18.519
 after two hundred years of wandering in 

00:06:18.519 --> 00:06:19.479
 space 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:21.900
 they tried to escape from the nuclear 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.809
 the war that broke out early 

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:25.070
 twenty first century 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.430
 so they fly in and see people on 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:29.780
 the earth did not die but everything was mutated 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.610
 cast which is called technics in general 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.389
 there will be two walkie-talkies of 3 classes in each 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:38.080
 wars that rubayi ax name than wasp 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.159
 cis specialist bow and dagger and export 

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:43.300
 something like a sorcerer who can heal 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.249
 others call him a robot from the earth 

00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:47.639
 promise aircraft cars and the 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:49.960
 similar transport and more 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.120
 No, but really guys live when robots 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.919
 and the machines they rubaii with axes and bows 1 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:57.970
 I know exactly what they thought but it will be 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:00.970
 something and not at all in a good way 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:05.149
 and without you showed the first teaser of the game 

00:07:05.149 --> 00:07:07.389
 assassins creed 2 in which virtually nothing 

00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:09.039
 no I told some 

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:10.020
 the details 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.080
 the game will take us almost not ashamed 100 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.740
 century on the territory of ancient Italy plot 

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:16.680
 will be twisted around the invention and 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.069
 Leonardo da Vinci research 

00:07:18.069 --> 00:07:20.159
 who experimented with 

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:22.419
 human body and the church wants 

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:24.210
 destroy and prosecution 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.030
 to us in the person of the protagonist named Kiev 

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.229
 will have to defend themselves from the attack of the church 

00:07:29.229 --> 00:07:31.919
 search and save precious drawings and 

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:32.919
 documents 

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:35.020
 we can make according to the drawings 

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.740
 various devices such as 

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.620
 Blade retractable from the sleeve something 

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.629
 like klimenko altair 

00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:43.279
 heroes finally learn how to swim 

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:45.239
 because a large amount of time we 

00:07:45.239 --> 00:07:47.839
 spend in a city like Venice 

00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:49.729
 also we can change clothes 

00:07:49.729 --> 00:07:50.909
 escape from the pursuers 

00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:53.769
 The exact release date is not yet but there is 

00:07:53.769 --> 00:07:56.769
 the promise that the game will be released this year 

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:59.020
 that's all for today 

00:07:59.020 --> 00:07:59.590
 to new meetings
