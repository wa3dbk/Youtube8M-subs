00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
do have a rollout launch which basically

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.440 
do have a rollout launch which basically
means<00:03:06.800> we<00:03:07.099> launched<00:03:07.370> it<00:03:07.550> we<00:03:08.000> always<00:03:08.239> launch

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
means we launched it we always launch

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.720 
means we launched it we always launch
first<00:03:08.720> in<00:03:08.959> Taiwan<00:03:09.379> and<00:03:09.620> after<00:03:10.220> it<00:03:10.280> launches<00:03:10.580> in

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
first in Taiwan and after it launches in

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.270 
first in Taiwan and after it launches in
Taiwan<00:03:11.120> we<00:03:11.360> will<00:03:11.629> launch<00:03:11.840> it<00:03:12.110> in<00:03:12.620> other

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
Taiwan we will launch it in other

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.270 
Taiwan we will launch it in other
regions<00:03:13.519> as<00:03:13.849> well<00:03:14.080> for<00:03:15.080> example<00:03:15.170> this<00:03:15.769> is<00:03:16.069> the

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
regions as well for example this is the

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.150 
regions as well for example this is the
x3<00:03:16.819> plus<00:03:17.660> we'll<00:03:18.140> probably<00:03:18.410> launched<00:03:18.739> this<00:03:18.980> in

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
x3 plus we'll probably launched this in

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.490 
x3 plus we'll probably launched this in
Taiwan<00:03:19.549> and<00:03:19.700> the<00:03:19.790> x3<00:03:20.209> will<00:03:20.390> launch<00:03:20.629> in

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
Taiwan and the x3 will launch in

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.979 
Taiwan and the x3 will launch in
Australia<00:03:22.040> next<00:03:22.250> and<00:03:23.120> after<00:03:23.299> it<00:03:23.540> launches<00:03:23.840> in

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
Australia next and after it launches in

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:25.570 
Australia next and after it launches in
Australia<00:03:24.440> and<00:03:24.620> maybe<00:03:24.830> give<00:03:25.069> it<00:03:25.160> a<00:03:25.280> couple<00:03:25.459> of

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
Australia and maybe give it a couple of

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.830 
Australia and maybe give it a couple of
weeks<00:03:25.760> and<00:03:25.940> then<00:03:26.060> they<00:03:26.150> will<00:03:26.269> watch<00:03:26.540> in<00:03:26.810> the

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
weeks and then they will watch in the

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.199 
weeks and then they will watch in the
next<00:03:27.140> country<00:03:27.530> so<00:03:28.190> that's<00:03:28.459> how<00:03:28.610> we<00:03:28.640> do<00:03:28.940> all<00:03:29.180> of

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
next country so that's how we do all of

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.900 
next country so that's how we do all of
our<00:03:29.390> launches<00:03:29.840> for<00:03:29.989> the<00:03:30.110> oars<00:03:30.700> another<00:03:31.700> thing

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
our launches for the oars another thing

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.640 
our launches for the oars another thing

have<00:04:22.470> something<00:04:22.770> new<00:04:23.550> here<00:04:23.850> now<00:04:24.060> a<00:04:24.860> lot<00:04:25.860> of

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
have something new here now a lot of

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.340 
have something new here now a lot of
people<00:04:26.010> are<00:04:26.490> requested<00:04:27.060> this<00:04:27.210> so<00:04:27.960> we<00:04:28.140> have

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
people are requested this so we have

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.800 
people are requested this so we have
this<00:04:28.530> called<00:04:29.190> recalling<00:04:29.910> and<00:04:30.060> run<00:04:30.300> app<00:04:30.510> at<00:04:30.720> the

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
this called recalling and run app at the

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:31.850 
this called recalling and run app at the
moment<00:04:31.110> as<00:04:31.200> you<00:04:31.290> can<00:04:31.410> see<00:04:31.530> on<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:31.740> screen

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
moment as you can see on the screen

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.340 
moment as you can see on the screen
there<00:04:32.220> it<00:04:32.940> might<00:04:33.270> change<00:04:33.630> when<00:04:33.960> this<00:04:34.110> goes

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
there it might change when this goes

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.670 
there it might change when this goes
into<00:04:35.210> production<00:04:36.210> so<00:04:36.900> you<00:04:36.960> can<00:04:37.140> actually<00:04:37.260> put

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
into production so you can actually put

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.130 
into production so you can actually put
different<00:04:38.430> programs<00:04:38.880> now<00:04:39.120> up<00:04:39.750> to<00:04:39.990> eight

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
different programs now up to eight

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.200 
different programs now up to eight
different<00:04:40.440> programs<00:04:41.040> you<00:04:41.190> can<00:04:41.310> execute<00:04:41.669> from

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
different programs you can execute from

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.170 
different programs you can execute from
your<00:04:42.419> G<00:04:42.780> key<00:04:43.160> so<00:04:44.160> let's<00:04:44.340> say<00:04:44.460> someone<00:04:44.729> like<00:04:44.850> you

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
your G key so let's say someone like you

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.210 
your G key so let's say someone like you
is<00:04:45.240> using<00:04:45.690> Photoshop<00:04:46.410> and<00:04:46.560> illustrator<00:04:46.710> and

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
is using Photoshop and illustrator and

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.950 
is using Photoshop and illustrator and
they<00:04:47.340> have<00:04:47.460> to<00:04:47.580> run<00:04:47.760> that<00:04:47.940> they<00:04:48.750> want<00:04:48.900> to

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
they have to run that they want to

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.420 
they have to run that they want to
switch<00:04:49.140> in<00:04:49.290> between<00:04:49.320> so<00:04:49.830> you<00:04:49.919> could<00:04:50.070> just<00:04:50.310> hit

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
switch in between so you could just hit

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.150 
switch in between so you could just hit
g1<00:04:50.970> and<00:04:51.930> then<00:04:52.169> g2<00:04:52.590> and<00:04:52.770> then<00:04:52.860> they<00:04:52.950> were<00:04:53.010> to

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
g1 and then g2 and then they were to

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.620 
g1 and then g2 and then they were to
bring<00:04:53.400> up<00:04:53.520> your<00:04:53.639> illustrator<00:04:54.090> and<00:04:54.300> bring<00:04:54.540> up

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
bring up your illustrator and bring up

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.420 
bring up your illustrator and bring up
your<00:04:54.780> photoshop<00:04:55.410> so<00:04:55.620> that<00:04:55.770> is<00:04:55.890> something<00:04:56.040> we

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
your photoshop so that is something we

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.719 
your photoshop so that is something we
have<00:04:56.460> tried<00:04:57.000> to<00:04:57.150> incorporate<00:04:57.390> in<00:04:58.140> this<00:04:58.729> under

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
have tried to incorporate in this under

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.430 
have tried to incorporate in this under
the<00:04:59.850> macro<00:05:00.150> engine

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
the macro engine

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.190 
the macro engine
and<00:05:02.830> this<00:05:03.280> is<00:05:03.490> pretty<00:05:03.730> much<00:05:03.820> it<00:05:03.970> I<00:05:04.270> almost

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
and this is pretty much it I almost

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.840 
and this is pretty much it I almost
forget<00:05:05.500> people<00:05:06.070> always<00:05:06.160> ask<00:05:06.280> us<00:05:06.580> about<00:05:06.670> the

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
forget people always ask us about the

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.540 
forget people always ask us about the
battery<00:05:07.180> the<00:05:07.720> battery<00:05:07.840> is<00:05:08.140> 73<00:05:08.740> watch<00:05:09.340> our

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
battery the battery is 73 watch our

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.790 
battery the battery is 73 watch our
battery<00:05:10.000> so<00:05:10.780> it<00:05:10.810> really<00:05:11.200> depends<00:05:11.470> on<00:05:11.590> how<00:05:11.650> you

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
battery so it really depends on how you

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.940 
battery so it really depends on how you
use<00:05:12.010> your<00:05:12.370> machine<00:05:12.780> we<00:05:13.780> usually<00:05:14.020> try<00:05:14.560> not<00:05:14.620> to

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:14.950 
use your machine we usually try not to

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.280 
use your machine we usually try not to
test<00:05:15.730> the<00:05:15.850> battery<00:05:16.030> life<00:05:16.330> because<00:05:16.690> it<00:05:16.900> really

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
test the battery life because it really

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.290 
test the battery life because it really
depends<00:05:17.680> on<00:05:17.770> usage<00:05:17.950> and<00:05:18.370> the<00:05:18.430> way<00:05:18.940> you<00:05:19.000> use

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
depends on usage and the way you use

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.110 
depends on usage and the way you use
your<00:05:19.510> laptop<00:05:19.720> so<00:05:20.290> most<00:05:20.920> reviews<00:05:21.400> we<00:05:21.580> usually

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
your laptop so most reviews we usually

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.180 
your laptop so most reviews we usually
let<00:05:22.270> them<00:05:22.480> review<00:05:22.720> it<00:05:22.960> and<00:05:23.200> they<00:05:23.710> have<00:05:23.920> the

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:24.190 
let them review it and they have the

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.130 
let them review it and they have the
different<00:05:24.610> ways<00:05:24.790> of<00:05:25.000> testing<00:05:25.240> a<00:05:25.720> battery

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140 
different ways of testing a battery

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.800 
different ways of testing a battery
battery<00:05:26.740> life<00:05:26.950> on<00:05:27.070> the<00:05:27.160> machine<00:05:27.540> so<00:05:28.540> let's

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
battery life on the machine so let's

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.800 
battery life on the machine so let's
hope<00:05:29.020> that<00:05:29.740> the<00:05:29.950> battery<00:05:30.220> life<00:05:30.370> will<00:05:30.790> be<00:05:30.940> again

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
hope that the battery life will be again

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.110 
hope that the battery life will be again
like<00:05:32.080> how<00:05:32.290> you<00:05:32.350> use<00:05:32.650> it<00:05:32.680> it<00:05:33.100> could<00:05:33.460> be<00:05:33.610> up<00:05:33.880> or

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
like how you use it it could be up or

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.620 
like how you use it it could be up or
down<00:05:34.980> so<00:05:35.980> as<00:05:36.070> you<00:05:36.190> can<00:05:36.280> see<00:05:36.430> the<00:05:36.550> x3<00:05:36.940> comes<00:05:37.180> in<00:05:37.480> a

down so as you can see the x3 comes in a

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.540 
down so as you can see the x3 comes in a
