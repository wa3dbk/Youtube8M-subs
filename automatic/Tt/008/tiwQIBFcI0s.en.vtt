00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello dear friends today we are with 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.810
 you talk about the next on the same frame 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.730
 was provided for review Novosibirsk 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.210
 knife shop blade and will this knife 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:16.740
 Juice Suits Production Company 10 Mini 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.480
 the juice is so small 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.460
 prehistory I have a few 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.470
 warm attitude to this knife arose 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.699
 right away when I'm not even really on him 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.519
 looked for the reason that it 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.090
 a smaller version of this knife juice 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.070
 so auto 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.929
 Well, so its one of its variations so 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.800
 let's say these knives here in the amount 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.450
 companies juice this knife actually we put 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.579
 the beginning of my acquaintance with the store 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.870
 the blade of this and our close enough 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.430
 cooperation because i have them 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.100
 purchased this knife and after about 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.690
 literally define it there broke 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.520
 springs and guys on this pretty quickly 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.289
 when responded about this there is 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.660
 A separate video has an overview of this knife on 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.850
 powerful yet when i drew 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.820
 attention that there is such a showcase 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.379
 smaller version I decided that he would 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.520
 not bad removal such a separate review 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.290
 so let's take a closer look at her 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.460
 traditionally for this series knives handle 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.770
 made of aluminum aviation here 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:16.259
 this one has hidden itself 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.450
 burn and that skin like here here is a knife 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.979
 the clip is very lightweight 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:27.540
 pocket it will look like this 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:29.549
 Something about Gray itself is all very 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.409
 cool very comfortable at all here this one 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.299
 saudi tiles that are on the series 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.460
 so auto she is on the whole series of these knives 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.439
 I personally think this is just 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.920
 masterpiece the crown clip of creation so 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.570
 perhaps say the only thing that can 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.549
 somehow a few well let's say 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.380
 annoy some user acquired 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.000
 that with the active use of the inscription on 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.880
 clip here and so is applied on my 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.659
 the pressure here is clear , nothing else is needed 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.750
 there is no such thing on both sides 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.850
 made different such hats for 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.799
 the whole node as you can see they are different in 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.180
 size spins the sides there such 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.320
 This is how to say 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.119
 round shape such a few turns 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.850
 the spring that actually pushes 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.870
 This knife is the knife of this case 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.390
 semi-automatic there is such a button 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.430
 the button is by the way not protected by itself 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.470
 yourself about accidental pressing that is how would 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.230
 she sticks out as you can see far enough 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.760
 Oh, but on this knife as well as on all 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.650
 the series is so generally very simple 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.390
 work well protect that is there 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.120
 at least for the periscope will bring nothing 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.459
 while it is very easy to extract 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.050
 really just quite the case 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.820
 such a slight movement of the finger shifts 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.320
 it's pretty easy to open the knife 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.580
 and actually this version of the knife to us 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.470
 will present here such a blade with 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.209
 concave descents well, I think something 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.330
 who better to call God and yet 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.300
 most likely on closer to her is on 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.860
 such a wedge is very cool very 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.660
 wonderful cuts completely aus-8 on 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.830
 the blade 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:02.610
 traditionally for most of ours 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:04.709
 Juice companies look like this soft 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:09.810
 so a mini car like that 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:11.489
 the very feet held must say that 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.549
 the knife so comfortable enough lies in 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:17.940
 In other words, it’s also comfortable 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.320
 wearing and working and it is often associated 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.519
 Systems that he has pretty 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.890
 light weight, that is, you can see the weight 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.260
 a knife 70 grams i.e. a larger one 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.110
 for example versions so that he doesn't pick around 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.150
 Other reviews weigh 100 grams that is for 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.610
 Odessa Knights Vestov and enough 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.590
 comfortable and that's actually 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.910
 probably need to move smoothly to my 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.950
 somehow own impressions about 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.019
 this knife left my impression 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.280
 Here are those who watched my review on the cache 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:49.739
 skyline probably on the example of this knife 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.329
 can see what i mean by that 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.370
 that baby must be somehow 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:55.230
 cute can be like him 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.320
 lose it its functionality though 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.269
 here I must say that the knife for his 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.430
 size is not such a small blade 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:05.160
 I will now try so in the frame just 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.940
 show without manufacturers data on . 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.440
 If you show something like this, there is 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.630
 it turns out that the blade is about eight 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.700
 centimeters will be so well yes it is 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.359
 I thought that I was 8 centimeters 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.040
 That is how it is not that 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.750
 very little nose at all 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.360
 certainly closer to the category of kids 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.710
 he is in this case here but 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.150
 not less here understand how here 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.040
 it turns out such a thing perfectly 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.960
 It is obvious that this knife is not 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.360
 not intended for some 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.060
 it is difficult to some hard work here and 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.889
 designed specifically for use in 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.389
 city ​​for some such small puzzles 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.919
 where do you need some kind of knife and 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:43.110
 understand here so that he 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.400
 turned out this knife did interesting well 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.810
 Firstly it is a semi-automatic with 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.400
 fuse tatar would that 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.669
 cool in and of itself is enough 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.110
 comfortably opens works well 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:53.729
 a little bit adapting it perfectly 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.610
 it is easy to close the prize with one hand 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:58.110
 well , would there be such pleasant moments 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.100
 really just exploiting it 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.080
 aluminum handle 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.570
 I know that I am not the only one to handle 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.060
 like a little weight with him 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.070
 so I would say so to speak 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.050
 somewhat aggressive this kind of stock 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.270
 would make it a cool knife for many 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.710
 even beginners there folding 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.070
 knives that is because how would such 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.830
 some 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:19.700
 pseudo armory especially the company name 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:24.030
 the juice is still like playing here too 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:27.060
 so let's say it pours water on the note of the same mill 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.710
 so let's say that the knife is such a type up 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.630
 gunsmiths would have it in general to very many 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.280
 people like in such a constant on 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.690
 carrying such a knife is some kind of your own 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.639
 funny though to understand that as a weapon 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.320
 it is absolutely impossible to use 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:39.350
 have it cause such a mass 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.780
 positive very pleasant emotions 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:45.539
 here its owner is concave here 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.160
 The slopes are very cool out of the box for. 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:49.770
 that is, I ask you to note that in 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.960
 the difference is nothing or most knives 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.610
 spyderco which came across to me 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.500
 gas. out of the box at least 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.260
 looks very cool and believe that 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.880
 she cuts very well sava aus-8 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.410
 which they use on all knives 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.360
 how much I am here exactly the same 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.950
 heat-treated quite well 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.750
 show yourself in tests well at 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.760
 least for steel aus-8 as far as 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.360
 I know in tests even on hard yuzu 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.590
 that is, if you suddenly 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.000
 need to even sort of 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.500
 some slivers there or something 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.240
 do in general you can without fear 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.370
 apply this knife here because nothing 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.750
 with him does not happen this case the 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.090
 last resort you will have it later 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.500
 a little fix after such work 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.180
 unity that I did not like sharply in 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.190
 this knife 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:31.090
 this here this notch because she 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.530
 acute i mean i must say here 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:35.509
 Company engineers juice I would have grown up and 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.560
 played in their tact here at all 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:38.419
 have played. 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.009
 this is a notch which suggests work 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:41.690
 only a glove that is still on the face 

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:43.940
 court put extremely unpleasant even 

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.070
 touching is unpleasant even when you close 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.229
 knife and you can touch this place this 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.360
 not very good on the skin like 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:53.180
 this so here you try to stop 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:56.449
 less i want to say that here is this knife 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:07:00.289
 is one of the examples of what 

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:02.240
 ready to go user that just 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:03.710
 need a knife because he just wants 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:05.150
 have a knife with you or because he 

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.889
 wants them to perform some kind of difficult 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:08.750
 works to raise manholes 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:11.750
 squeeze the doors there and so on so on 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:12.410
 just a little cute cool 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.349
 semi-automatic 

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:17.240
 from the company juice to me personally he is very 

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:19.250
 like so it seemed a nice little knife 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.990
 In general, I recommend the turn such love 

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.940
 I recommend these kids to draw on 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:24.740
 his attention on her that you had 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:27.160
 interesting thank you very much for watching 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.160
 until
