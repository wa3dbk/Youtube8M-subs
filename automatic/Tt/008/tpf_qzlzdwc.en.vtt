00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 the damn nerds need to be 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.770
 informed by that now maximum this 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.269
 brings all the news from the world of 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.040
 technology and video games butters 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.080
 against the paranoia andrew house 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.119
 president of sony commented about the 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.949
 growing fears that circulate about 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.869
 the property of video games saying 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.460
 that the philosophy of playstation is yes 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.310
 you bought a game of your own games 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.660
 so they could not get it out of context 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.710
 cause this clearly means that a 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.720
 time the game is in our 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.800
 possession we can lend what 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.170
 sell it without any kind of 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.270
 consequences not only that if lukic house 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.739
 admits that sharing games is 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.660
 the best way to approach new 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.489
 players towards playstation can that 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.020
 this is a fact or perhaps a speech 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.239
 of sales but without a doubt 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.390
 reassures a little to the paranoia that 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.579
 comes with the next generation the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.260
 killer factory in an interview to 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.140
 yves guillemot president of ubisoft 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.550
 during the 2013 e3 conference the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.199
 director announced that the franchise 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.840
 Assassin's Creed has at this moment 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.210
 three titles in a state of development without 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.430
 provide names or numbers presumably 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.480
 one of these titles could be the 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.520
 has not released 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.930
 write 4 black flag while 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.640
 following the trend of launching a 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.460
 game per year the other two could be 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.560
 assassin's creed 5 and 6 or maybe some 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.510
 alternative for portable consoles or 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.340
 mobile devices although these 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.470
 We believe that this rhythm of 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.060
 work employed by ubisoft is possible 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.640
 thanks to an organization that works 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.110
 around the world constantly in 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.030
 the different offices of the 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.890
 developer in this way when a 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.780
 study ends the workday of the 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.910
 another side of the globe another study just 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.710
 and so begins the work never 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.600
 stop even though this sounds like production 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.030
 en masse and lemos assured that the priority 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.710
 number one use is innovation for 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.200
 that fans always discover something 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.060
 new meanwhile assassin's creed 4 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.040
 black flag will go on sale next 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.130
 first of November for consoles of 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.350
 current and new generation 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.149
 superman fever sometimes the 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.159
 marketing does not let us breathe but from 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.840
 every now and then it is usually right in some 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.340
 of your decisions for this and thanks to 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.659
 the emotion that created the return of the 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.039
 man of steel to the new movies 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.950
 contained in the universe of superman 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:09.289
 will be added to the game and justice gods 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.330
 among us the classic villain show 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.190
 cinematic of superman may be 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.840
 downloaded in the next few weeks ideal 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.610
 to compete with scorpion that does 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.880
 just 15 days is part of the grid 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.709
 of a game that does not stop expanding to 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.480
 Tony is stopped after the great 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.390
 sony presentation on the first day of 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.000
 the 2013 e3 conference with the announcement of 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.040
 its political exclusivities and perhaps what 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.720
 that we were more worried about his price andrew 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.190
 house announced that it is very likely that 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.870
 let's experience a shortage of play 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.120
 station 4 in its first months of life 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.099
 the saying of the sony president can 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.599
 that is a fact but not a surprise in 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.180
 previous generations the same thing happened 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.459
 with xbox 360 for example or even with 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.079
 nintendo wii house meanwhile announced 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.849
 that will try to cover the demand but the 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:52.280
 presales and positive reception of the 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.780
 people make them think that they will not be able to 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.400
 this is a reality or just one 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.900
 way to provoke us to microsoft 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.220
 year - end 'll find out when the 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.730
 console go on sale 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.860
 of the holidays the cell discharge is 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.780
 an unprecedented fact that in its 27 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.340
 years of life nintendo would be looking 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.170
 the way to incorporate content 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.970
 downloadable to the next titles of 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.950
 the saga the legend of zelda that 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.960
 would launch from this year being the 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.290
 first the legend of zelda a link 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.430
 between world eiji aonuma producer 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.110
 the series commented in an interview 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.910
 during the three-party conference that the 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.470
 intention of this popular mechanics 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.150
 in other companies would be the 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.100
 enrich the experience of zelda 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.170
 adding new places to go and 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.910
 contents that due to various factors 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.440
 can be part of the discs or 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.110
 3ds cartridges 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.790
 according to the question, the challenge lies 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.590
 of these contents something truly 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.240
 interesting since without any kind of 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.130
 doubts nintendo will charge for the 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.600
 themselves the debate now goes through the fact 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.070
 of whether it really is necessary to expand 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.900
 the games of the series since always 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.610
 They were strong and they knew stand by 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.010
 themselves without any assistance 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.900
 to a luma says that the attempt still 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.890
 remains in the balance but the most 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.740
 It is probable that the DLcs have 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.569
 paddock taquito and gambeta following 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.190
 close the passion of Argentine crowds 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.500
 but in fishing format the latest 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.270
 news of pro evolution soccer '2014 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.190
 they show us that beyond realism and 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.410
 artificial intelligence the title 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.330
 will point to the 'pretty jogo' moving 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.160
 all the classic pirouettes and tricks 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.109
 of each player of the franchises for 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.030

 the conference of three brought between his 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.440
 surprises the reappearance of the 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.390
 franchise killer instinct in the world 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.280
 of video games and apparently there 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.050
 Thanked by someone in particular 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.180
 Dabul Felix developer of the new 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.980
 game told that before the possibility of 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.050
 reborn this saga did not hesitate two 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.640
 times but the propeller the main 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.290
 interested in returning this classic of 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.390
 the fighting games to the consoles was 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.340
 magicians or who instigated 2013 does not have 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.320
 defined launch date and it will be 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.660
 free but with limitations the 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.190
 exclusive then of xbox one may be 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.960
 downloaded without costs but only 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.940
 we will have two characters and if he said 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.880
 we will have to pay them separately 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.100
 one of lime and one of sand 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.840
 who has seen you and who sees you oculus 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.730
 gray the virtual reality device 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.740
 increased developed from a 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:13.260
 kickstarter campaign he managed to gather 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.210
 2 million 400 thousand dollars continues 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.980
 improving its prototype and every time 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.200
 closer to reaching the state that 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.420
 let it go on sale 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.100
 basically oculus ruiz puts in front of 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.170
 our eyes two cell phone screens 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.820
 that reproduce a video game allowing 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:28.680
 increase the feeling of first person 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.670
 as if we were ourselves 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.260
 inside the game 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.240
 also represented with titles like 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.100
 Skyring show that the capabilities 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.480
 of this prototype are incredible but 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.940
 as much as it worked perfectly 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:41.040
 the image still looked a bit dirty or 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.810
 granulated by luck in the framework of 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.330
 of 3 2013 we learned that the 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.550
 device could be operated leading to 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.260
 your screens to support a resolution 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.580
 1080p at the moment is not 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.650
 confirmed that the first devices 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.420
 in being marketed contain this 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.270
 new improvement but it's definitely a 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:06:00.750
 great step that allows the team to 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:02.490
 obviate reaching your market 3 in numbers 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.050
 last week we could see what it was 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.080
 one of the best electronic 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.030
 entertainment expo in years on 3 2013 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.310

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.110
 people between journalists and visitors 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.300
 from more than 120 countries 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.820
 different to witness the games and 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.460
 products from more than 230 exhibitors is 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.230
 for this resounding success that 3 2014 already 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.910
 has a date and will open its doors once 

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.520
 more in the convention center of the

 be there to tell you all the 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:34.530
 news more data as always in www
