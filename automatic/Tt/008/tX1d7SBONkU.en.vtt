00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:20.929
 After the success of the first one that is not what we aim for 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:24.929
 Uniqueness of the first game build but this time on one 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:26.089
 larger area 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.929
 the priorities was to offer variety in all parts of the game 

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:33.819
 We are here Benedict at the end of the 15th century

 a new era in time and a new hero Lúcio Auditore di Firenze he is 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.820
 on a vendetta on the way but more on that later 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.070
 As you can see here you can use the environment 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.850
 to kill his opponent you just have to wait for the right moment around him 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.510
 ready go on 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.210
 The crowd still has special attention in Assassin's 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.140
 Creed 2 and of course we have the look and feel of the Italian 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.559
 Renaissance adapted 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.049
 The Danish carnival is something we absolutely wanted to do 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.850
 Now I'm going to the top of the cathedral where our friend Leonardo da Vinci 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.330
 Certainly something embarrassing 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.320

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.630

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.770
 Mader as he has just mentioned are newts everywhere 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:39.690
 possible 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.690
 we want to make it possible in every situation and in every environment

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.560
 see famous San Marco square 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.640
 So that's the surprise that Leonardo da Vinci left for me 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.640
 Has 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.550
 this new sequence shows how we play with what was in the epoch 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.639
 if this and that happened 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:15.849
 and predict what people's reaction would have been if we were there 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.219
 Vinci's flying machine really works would have been one thing we did 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:22.219
