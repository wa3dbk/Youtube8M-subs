gigabyte they also do they do make an 80
gigabyte<00:05:18.319> to<00:05:18.620> but<00:05:18.830> that's<00:05:19.039> also<00:05:19.250> gonna<00:05:19.520> be<00:05:19.729> a

00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 
gigabyte to but that's also gonna be a

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:25.600 
gigabyte to but that's also gonna be a
lot<00:05:20.259> wider<00:05:21.259> it's<00:05:21.800> gonna<00:05:21.949> be<00:05:22.129> fatter<00:05:24.279> so<00:05:25.279> that

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
lot wider it's gonna be fatter so that

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.149 
lot wider it's gonna be fatter so that
pretty<00:05:25.819> much<00:05:25.909> wraps<00:05:26.060> it<00:05:26.509> up<00:05:26.599> I<00:05:26.900> would<00:05:27.439> say<00:05:27.620> that

00:05:28.149 --> 00:05:28.159 
pretty much wraps it up I would say that

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:32.680 
pretty much wraps it up I would say that
I<00:05:28.960> think<00:05:29.960> this<00:05:30.139> is<00:05:30.289> like<00:05:30.409> 249<00:05:31.389> it's<00:05:32.389> really

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
I think this is like 249 it's really

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.149 
I think this is like 249 it's really
good<00:05:32.930> if<00:05:33.139> you're<00:05:33.319> gonna<00:05:33.440> use<00:05:33.710> it<00:05:33.770> if<00:05:34.009> you're

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:36.259 
gonna use all the space it's really

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:39.550 
gonna use all the space it's really
worth<00:05:36.469> it<00:05:37.210> well<00:05:38.210> that's<00:05:38.389> it<00:05:38.659> for<00:05:39.020> the<00:05:39.139> iPod
