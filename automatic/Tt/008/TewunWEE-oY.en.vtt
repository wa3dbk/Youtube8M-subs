has<00:01:59.750> been<00:02:00.050> thought<00:02:00.320> about<00:02:00.380> to<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:01.369> enth

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
has been thought about to the enth

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.910 
has been thought about to the enth
degree<00:02:01.760> and<00:02:02.450> it<00:02:02.540> shows<00:02:02.840> in<00:02:03.020> its<00:02:03.170> design<00:02:03.350> it

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.890 
degree and it shows in its design it
shows<00:02:04.369> in<00:02:04.520> its<00:02:04.640> functionality<00:02:05.450> and<00:02:05.600> it<00:02:05.720> just

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
shows in its functionality and it just

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.850 
shows in its functionality and it just
shows<00:02:05.960> with<00:02:06.290> how<00:02:06.380> efficiently<00:02:06.979> it<00:02:07.460> works
