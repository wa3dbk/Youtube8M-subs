welcome to the tutorial on erotic motion
for<00:00:09.660> Imaginary<00:00:10.260> gears<00:00:10.620> this<00:00:11.100> will<00:00:11.309> probably

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
for Imaginary gears this will probably

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.140 
for Imaginary gears this will probably
be<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:12.830> smallest<00:00:13.830> tutorial<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.849> entire

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
be the smallest tutorial of the entire

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.440 
be the smallest tutorial of the entire
group<00:00:16.250> imaginary<00:00:17.250> gears<00:00:17.580> are<00:00:17.849> completely

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.450 
group imaginary gears are completely

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.340 
group imaginary gears are completely
useless<00:00:19.279> absolutely<00:00:20.279> as<00:00:20.369> useless<00:00:20.609> as<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:21.000> cat

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
useless absolutely as useless as a cat

useless absolutely as useless as a cat
the<00:00:22.350> only<00:00:22.680> reason<00:00:22.890> that<00:00:23.190> they<00:00:23.310> exist<00:00:23.670> in<00:00:23.820> the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
the only reason that they exist in the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.029 
the only reason that they exist in the
program<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.570> they<00:00:24.840> are<00:00:24.930> also<00:00:25.109> artistic

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
program is that they are also artistic

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.300 
program is that they are also artistic
and<00:00:26.300> our<00:00:27.300> great<00:00:27.630> for<00:00:27.810> kinematic<00:00:28.320> art<00:00:28.529> they

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
and our great for kinematic art they

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.910 
and our great for kinematic art they
generate<00:00:29.730> gears<00:00:30.140> which<00:00:31.140> are<00:00:31.410> randomly

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
generate gears which are randomly

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.729 
generate gears which are randomly
varying<00:00:32.099> pressure<00:00:32.820> angles<00:00:33.390> which<00:00:34.320> makes<00:00:34.590> the

varying pressure angles which makes the

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.620 
varying pressure angles which makes the
uninitiated<00:00:35.070> look<00:00:35.580> at<00:00:35.730> them<00:00:35.910> and<00:00:36.180> thinking

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
uninitiated look at them and thinking

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.090 
uninitiated look at them and thinking
there<00:00:37.020> ain't<00:00:37.170> no<00:00:37.290> way<00:00:37.469> those<00:00:37.710> are<00:00:37.739> going<00:00:38.040> to

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
there ain't no way those are going to

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.639 
there ain't no way those are going to
work<00:00:38.690> and<00:00:39.690> that's<00:00:39.809> always<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.170> good<00:00:40.350> thing<00:00:40.410> for

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
work and that's always a good thing for

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.400 
work and that's always a good thing for
somebody<00:00:41.160> doing<00:00:41.340> an<00:00:41.520> artistic<00:00:42.090> piece<00:00:42.410> when

somebody doing an artistic piece when

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.979 
somebody doing an artistic piece when
you<00:00:43.500> open<00:00:43.770> up<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.390> imaginary<00:00:45.390> gears<00:00:45.719> you'll

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
you open up the imaginary gears you'll

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.680 
you open up the imaginary gears you'll
find<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.440> same<00:00:46.649> controls<00:00:47.160> as<00:00:47.520> in<00:00:47.969> all<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.510> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
difference of slave order and you're

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.250 
difference of slave order and you're
only<00:00:58.559> having<00:00:58.800> one<00:00:59.250> here<00:00:59.460> on<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.670> screen<00:01:00.260> let

only having one here on the screen let

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.560 
only having one here on the screen let
me<00:01:01.320> go<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.500> generate<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.010> slave<00:01:02.370> we<00:01:03.239> pick<00:01:03.449> an

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
me go to generate a slave we pick an

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.469 
me go to generate a slave we pick an
order<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.050> say<00:01:04.259> how<00:01:04.470> big<00:01:04.500> will<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.479> second

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
order to say how big will that second

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.810 
order to say how big will that second
gear<00:01:06.720> big<00:01:06.990> be<00:01:07.619> as<00:01:07.890> compared<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.549> first

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
gear big be as compared to the first

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.640 
gear big be as compared to the first
gear<00:01:09.210> if<00:01:09.390> they're<00:01:10.049> going<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.260> be<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.439> same

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
gear if they're going to be the same

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.800 
gear if they're going to be the same
size<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.979> slave<00:01:11.790> order<00:01:12.090> one<00:01:12.390> means<00:01:12.659> a

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
size a slave order one means a

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.080 
size a slave order one means a
one-to-one<00:01:13.260> ratio<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.830> size<00:01:14.100> if<00:01:14.460> we<00:01:14.610> pick<00:01:14.820> two

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
one-to-one ratio of size if we pick two

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.320 
one-to-one ratio of size if we pick two
and<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.510> I'll<00:01:15.570> do<00:01:15.780> here<00:01:16.020> for<00:01:16.229> example<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:17.330> say

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
and so I'll do here for example and say

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.620 
and so I'll do here for example and say
generate<00:01:18.840> slave<00:01:19.850> it<00:01:20.850> takes<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.240> couple<00:01:21.360> moments

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
generate slave it takes a couple moments

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.390 
generate slave it takes a couple moments
to<00:01:21.960> generate<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.530> slave<00:01:22.830> there's<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.220> lot<00:01:23.369> of

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
to generate the slave there's a lot of

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.100 
to generate the slave there's a lot of
calculations<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:24.390> do<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.750> you'll<00:01:24.869> see<00:01:25.080> a

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
calculations to do and you'll see a

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.660 
calculations to do and you'll see a
progress<00:01:25.409> bar<00:01:25.590> at<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.009> top<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.460> screen

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
progress bar at the top of the screen

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.020 
progress bar at the top of the screen
swivel<00:01:27.390> across<00:01:27.720> as<00:01:28.130> it<00:01:29.130> generates<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.759> slave

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
swivel across as it generates the slave

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.200 
swivel across as it generates the slave
I<00:01:30.330> also<00:01:31.320> have<00:01:31.740> some<00:01:32.070> video<00:01:32.340> productions<00:01:32.970> going

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
I also have some video productions going

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.550 
I also have some video productions going
on<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.509> background<00:01:33.689> which<00:01:34.110> slows<00:01:34.350> me<00:01:34.530> down

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
on in the background which slows me down

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.100 
on in the background which slows me down
a<00:01:34.710> little<00:01:34.920> bit<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.280> slave<00:01:35.670> will<00:01:36.110> generally

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
a little bit that slave will generally

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.890 
a little bit that slave will generally
be<00:01:37.140> generated<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.770> bit<00:01:37.920> quicker<00:01:38.130> than<00:01:38.310> this

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
be generated a bit quicker than this

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.690 
be generated a bit quicker than this
once<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:40.020> generate<00:01:40.200> these<00:01:40.680> two<00:01:40.979> gears<00:01:41.250> only

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
once you generate these two gears only

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.359 
once you generate these two gears only
these<00:01:41.880> two<00:01:41.939> gears<00:01:42.420> can<00:01:42.630> be<00:01:42.810> meshed<00:01:42.960> together

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
these two gears can be meshed together

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.890 
these two gears can be meshed together
you<00:01:44.369> wouldn't<00:01:44.610> be<00:01:44.700> able<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:45.090> regenerate<00:01:45.600> a

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
you wouldn't be able to regenerate a

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.469 
you wouldn't be able to regenerate a
different<00:01:47.869> slave<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.700> master<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.090> hope<00:01:51.240> them

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
different slave and master and hope them

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.420 
different slave and master and hope them
and<00:01:51.780> hope<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.470> they<00:01:52.590> will<00:01:52.710> mesh<00:01:52.950> with<00:01:53.220> the

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
and hope that they will mesh with the

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.490 
and hope that they will mesh with the
current<00:01:53.670> slave<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.420> master<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:55.350> could

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
current slave and master you could

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.600 
current slave and master you could
however<00:01:55.740> take<00:01:56.280> generate<00:01:57.119> several<00:01:57.390> slaves<00:01:57.960> to

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
however take generate several slaves to

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.030 
however take generate several slaves to
rotate<00:01:59.610> off<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.939> one<00:02:00.060> master<00:02:00.770> you'll<00:02:01.770> get<00:02:01.890> the

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
rotate off of one master you'll get the

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.310 
rotate off of one master you'll get the
idea<00:02:02.070> as<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:02.729> work<00:02:02.909> with<00:02:03.119> them<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.869> as<00:02:04.200> you

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
idea as you work with them and as you

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.789 
idea as you work with them and as you
can<00:02:04.469> see<00:02:04.500> now<00:02:04.860> we<00:02:04.920> have<00:02:05.340> our<00:02:06.350> slave<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.680> our

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799

master<00:02:09.769> you<00:02:10.769> have<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.100> be<00:02:11.220> very<00:02:11.400> careful<00:02:11.700> and

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
master you have to be very careful and

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.670 
master you have to be very careful and
watch<00:02:12.569> your<00:02:12.950> gears<00:02:13.950> go<00:02:14.160> around<00:02:14.489> because<00:02:14.819> it<00:02:14.879> is

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
watch your gears go around because it is

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.550 
watch your gears go around because it is
possible<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.189> generate<00:02:17.170> imaginary<00:02:18.170> gears

would say eighty percent of the time
when<00:02:28.519> you<00:02:28.609> generate<00:02:28.790> them<00:02:29.239> they're<00:02:29.390> going<00:02:29.540> to

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
when you generate them they're going to

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.099 
when you generate them they're going to
be<00:02:29.719> fine<00:02:29.989> and<00:02:30.530> in<00:02:31.489> this<00:02:31.609> case<00:02:31.879> if<00:02:32.359> you<00:02:32.719> just

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.109 
be fine and in this case if you just

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:35.890 
be fine and in this case if you just
watch<00:02:33.290> them<00:02:33.530> rotate<00:02:33.950> through<00:02:34.189> a<00:02:34.250> cycle<00:02:34.900> use

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
watch them rotate through a cycle use

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.420 
watch them rotate through a cycle use
some<00:02:36.109> intuition<00:02:36.500> you'll<00:02:36.859> be<00:02:37.010> able<00:02:37.099> to<00:02:37.219> tell

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
some intuition you'll be able to tell

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.860 
some intuition you'll be able to tell
whether<00:02:37.609> everything's<00:02:38.090> fine<00:02:38.329> and<00:02:38.599> it<00:02:38.689> looks

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
whether everything's fine and it looks

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.170 
whether everything's fine and it looks
like<00:02:39.019> these<00:02:39.200> gears<00:02:39.590> are<00:02:39.709> going<00:02:39.829> to<00:02:39.889> mesh<00:02:40.280> great

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
like these gears are going to mesh great

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.170 
like these gears are going to mesh great
I<00:02:42.040> don't<00:02:43.040> think<00:02:43.250> that<00:02:43.310> you'd<00:02:43.519> have<00:02:43.579> much<00:02:43.939> of<00:02:44.000> a

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
I don't think that you'd have much of a

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.970 
I don't think that you'd have much of a
problem<00:02:44.450> rotating<00:02:45.200> them<00:02:45.349> although<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:45.769> tooth

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
problem rotating them although the tooth

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.059 
problem rotating them although the tooth
that<00:02:46.189> just<00:02:46.400> went<00:02:46.609> by<00:02:47.260> it<00:02:48.260> may<00:02:48.590> have<00:02:48.769> some

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
that just went by it may have some

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.509 
that just went by it may have some
trouble<00:02:49.099> so<00:02:50.680> again<00:02:51.680> look<00:02:52.010> at<00:02:52.099> them<00:02:52.280> very

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
trouble so again look at them very

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.699 
trouble so again look at them very
carefully<00:02:52.760> just<00:02:53.269> to<00:02:53.359> make<00:02:53.510> sure<00:02:53.540> that<00:02:54.079> they

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
carefully just to make sure that they

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.559 
carefully just to make sure that they
are<00:02:54.739> what<00:02:55.069> you're<00:02:55.220> looking<00:02:55.489> for<00:02:55.730> you<00:02:56.299> can't

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
are what you're looking for you can't

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.629 
are what you're looking for you can't
spoke<00:02:56.930> them<00:02:57.230> or<00:02:57.439> decorate<00:02:57.950> them<00:02:58.159> my<00:02:58.370> thought

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:58.639 
spoke them or decorate them my thought

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.360 
spoke them or decorate them my thought
is<00:02:58.939> that<00:02:58.989> since<00:02:59.989> they're<00:03:00.200> an<00:03:00.290> artistic<00:03:00.829> gear<00:03:01.189> I

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
is that since they're an artistic gear I

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.949 
is that since they're an artistic gear I
suspect<00:03:02.180> anybody<00:03:02.450> who<00:03:02.750> wishes<00:03:02.959> to<00:03:03.169> use<00:03:03.530> them

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
suspect anybody who wishes to use them

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.509 
suspect anybody who wishes to use them
probably<00:03:05.959> has<00:03:06.260> some<00:03:06.530> idea<00:03:06.859> of<00:03:07.010> how<00:03:07.159> they<00:03:07.340> want

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
probably has some idea of how they want

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.039 
probably has some idea of how they want
to<00:03:07.609> decorate<00:03:07.790> the<00:03:08.180> center<00:03:08.510> whether<00:03:08.689> they<00:03:08.870> want

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
to decorate the center whether they want

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:10.449 
to decorate the center whether they want
to<00:03:09.109> chop<00:03:09.349> them<00:03:09.590> all<00:03:09.739> the<00:03:09.829> way<00:03:09.950> out<00:03:09.980> and<00:03:10.159> just

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
to chop them all the way out and just

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.500 
to chop them all the way out and just
leap<00:03:10.669> a<00:03:10.819> single<00:03:11.180> spoke<00:03:11.510> or<00:03:12.609> or<00:03:13.609> if<00:03:14.150> they<00:03:14.299> want

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
leap a single spoke or or if they want

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.649 
leap a single spoke or or if they want
to<00:03:14.569> engrave<00:03:15.609> various<00:03:16.609> drawings<00:03:16.909> into<00:03:17.450> the

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:17.659 
to engrave various drawings into the

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:19.689 
to engrave various drawings into the
center<00:03:18.349> of<00:03:18.379> them<00:03:18.560> so<00:03:18.769> that<00:03:18.799> they<00:03:19.040> line<00:03:19.310> up<00:03:19.489> at<00:03:19.639> a

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:19.699 
center of them so that they line up at a

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:23.189 
center of them so that they line up at a
particular<00:03:20.000> spot<00:03:20.510> whatever<00:03:21.470> your<00:03:21.739> choice<00:03:21.769> is

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:23.199 
particular spot whatever your choice is

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:26.860 
particular spot whatever your choice is
this<00:03:24.199> is<00:03:24.409> the<00:03:24.530> only<00:03:24.879> way<00:03:25.879> to<00:03:25.940> get<00:03:26.269> imaginary

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
this is the only way to get imaginary

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.369 
this is the only way to get imaginary
gears<00:03:27.290> is<00:03:27.590> to<00:03:27.859> randomly<00:03:28.310> generate<00:03:28.879> them<00:03:29.090> and<00:03:29.379> I

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379 
gears is to randomly generate them and I

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:31.390 
gears is to randomly generate them and I
think<00:03:30.620> that<00:03:30.739> you'll<00:03:30.859> find<00:03:31.129> that<00:03:31.250> you'll

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
think that you'll find that you'll

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.099 
think that you'll find that you'll
probably<00:03:31.609> only<00:03:31.849> end<00:03:32.090> up<00:03:32.299> cutting<00:03:32.540> one<00:03:32.840> or<00:03:32.959> two

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
probably only end up cutting one or two

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.979 
probably only end up cutting one or two
if<00:03:33.319> ever<00:03:33.879> but<00:03:34.879> they're<00:03:35.180> there<00:03:35.389> because<00:03:35.540> they

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
if ever but they're there because they

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.899 
if ever but they're there because they
are<00:03:36.109> handy<00:03:36.500> to<00:03:36.620> have<00:03:36.650> in<00:03:37.069> the<00:03:37.159> context<00:03:37.760> of

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
are handy to have in the context of

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:40.990 
are handy to have in the context of
artistic<00:03:38.599> type<00:03:38.810> of<00:03:38.959> work<00:03:39.430> let's<00:03:40.430> just<00:03:40.519> add<00:03:40.819> the

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
artistic type of work let's just add the

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.039 
artistic type of work let's just add the
mass<00:03:41.209> the<00:03:41.479> slave<00:03:42.139> and<00:03:43.479> we'll<00:03:44.479> see<00:03:44.659> how<00:03:44.810> things

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
mass the slave and we'll see how things

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:46.839 
mass the slave and we'll see how things
look<00:03:45.290> on<00:03:45.439> the<00:03:45.560> screen<00:03:45.680> since<00:03:46.220> this<00:03:46.340> is<00:03:46.549> a<00:03:46.579> very

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
look on the screen since this is a very

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.300 
look on the screen since this is a very
short<00:03:47.000> video<00:03:47.569> and<00:03:48.019> in<00:03:48.560> fact<00:03:48.799> let<00:03:49.009> me<00:03:49.040> show<00:03:49.280> you

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
short video and in fact let me show you

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.569 
short video and in fact let me show you
that<00:03:49.639> you<00:03:49.790> could<00:03:50.060> take<00:03:50.650> more<00:03:51.650> masters<00:03:52.220> as<00:03:52.430> long

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
that you could take more masters as long

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:54.999 
that you could take more masters as long
as<00:03:52.729> we<00:03:52.849> don't<00:03:52.970> regenerate<00:03:53.540> the<00:03:53.930> master<00:03:54.379> it<00:03:54.620> is

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:55.009 
as we don't regenerate the master it is

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:58.360 
as we don't regenerate the master it is
possible<00:03:55.759> to<00:03:55.819> put<00:03:56.150> more<00:03:56.389> gears<00:03:56.840> and<00:03:57.189> roll<00:03:58.189> them

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
possible to put more gears and roll them

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.819 
possible to put more gears and roll them
around<00:03:58.489> to<00:03:58.939> the<00:03:59.060> point<00:03:59.329> that<00:03:59.599> we<00:03:59.659> have<00:04:00.229> a<00:04:00.500> bit

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
around to the point that we have a bit

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:05.559 
around to the point that we have a bit
of<00:04:00.979> a<00:04:02.859> bit<00:04:03.859> of<00:04:03.979> an<00:04:04.099> artistic<00:04:04.729> looking<00:04:05.329> thing

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
of a bit of an artistic looking thing

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.780 
of a bit of an artistic looking thing
going<00:04:05.930> on<00:04:07.449> there<00:04:08.449> we<00:04:08.599> go<00:04:08.720> and<00:04:09.400> let's<00:04:10.400> turn<00:04:10.669> on

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
going on there we go and let's turn on

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.890 
going on there we go and let's turn on
our<00:04:10.970> simulation<00:04:13.120> so<00:04:14.120> as<00:04:14.269> you<00:04:14.359> can<00:04:14.540> see<00:04:14.750> they

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
our simulation so as you can see they

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.839 
our simulation so as you can see they
look<00:04:15.079> a<00:04:15.169> little<00:04:15.319> non-intuitive<00:04:16.009> in<00:04:16.430> terms<00:04:16.699> of

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:16.849 
look a little non-intuitive in terms of

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:21.189 
look a little non-intuitive in terms of
would<00:04:17.060> they<00:04:17.209> work<00:04:17.419> as<00:04:17.659> a<00:04:17.690> gear<00:04:19.870> but<00:04:20.870> they<00:04:21.019> have

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 
would they work as a gear but they have

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.740 
would they work as a gear but they have
kind<00:04:21.470> of<00:04:21.650> a<00:04:21.829> nice<00:04:22.729> look<00:04:23.000> to<00:04:23.030> them<00:04:23.300> for<00:04:23.330> certain

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
kind of a nice look to them for certain

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.110 
kind of a nice look to them for certain
types<00:04:23.930> of<00:04:24.080> projects<00:04:24.580> well<00:04:25.580> I<00:04:25.639> hope<00:04:25.760> you<00:04:25.909> enjoy

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
types of projects well I hope you enjoy

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.180 
types of projects well I hope you enjoy
playing<00:04:26.389> with<00:04:26.630> them<00:04:26.810> and<00:04:27.620> that's<00:04:27.770> it<00:04:27.950> for<00:04:28.099> the

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
playing with them and that's it for the

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.590 
playing with them and that's it for the
imaginary<00:04:28.729> gears

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
imaginary gears

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.660 
imaginary gears
