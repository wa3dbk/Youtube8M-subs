 I loaded 1 but finally arrived 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.170

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.639
 you have done in this time and I have chosen 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.410
 the best as usual 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.850

 generations was one of the first 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.110
 started to read and mix between 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.820
 those who most loved the first part 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.700
 of the world or in that in which naruto

 I just replied the new I think the 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.700
 story of naruto is very beautiful 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.320
 at the beginning which then goes slightly 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.240
 diminishing, however, we say that around the 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.440
 final a bit in my opinion has recovered 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.180
 naro 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.790

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.530
 so yes his death has me a little 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.290
 shocked, however, I remained very much 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.690
 happy that is not always me 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.910

 ask yourself in the special of 100 videos if 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.430
 I would not have shown various designs that 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.100
 elsewhere you will copy the Polet PC 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.140
 enrico marià if he copied them 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.700
 look at them as workers marked a piece 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.630
 then look and so on 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.470
 no casino then I did various various 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.720
 some designs are taken directly 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.250
 from the pages of the type manga some 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.930
 drawing now I don't remember which proof 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.660
 someone and it was so I opened the 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.480
 page up front and stood before him 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.750
 me so that I looked at how we believe it 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.340
 on the page and drew others instead 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.290
 he saw the computer as a product you know 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.140

 success is true it is already doing it 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.459
 a lot and I believe it will continue on this 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.920
 road because in any case historical is a 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.150
 involving manga takes that me 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.459

 to the elementary I drew particularly 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.580
 dinosaurs and dragons then towards the end 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.530

 political everything better 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.700
 thomas lazio and asks me but the questions 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.040
 that you put in the rectangle at the bottom a 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:49.520
 right are the most important ones 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.190
 no practically if you put yours in 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.660
 low right here it would come out 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.850
 because too long 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.050
 so those long denied half that 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:00.919
 shorter on the net in the lower right corner 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:03.620
