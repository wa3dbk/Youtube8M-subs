00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.719
 game over thanks yes i'm listening to you 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:18.270
 there already habitually began to play all-in, we 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:21.769
 ask again but i first i 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.019
 I will ask how much you have in the bank 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.369
 25 i remind 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:29.849
 public that now we can talk 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.250
 just about leaving this 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.540
 six later in the club 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.420
 i.e. this casino casino right against 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.570
 not viewers but casinos against connoisseurs 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:45.930
 but 25,000 for a casino of course the price is very 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.559
 I have a little counter to you 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.930
 I offer you a risk to you 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.629
 sentence 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:01:00.780
 if you put at stake an additional 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:05.460
 round 3 of your red jackets along with 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.040
 immortal titles then I'll play with 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.890
 You are asking for a principled round 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:25.310
 red jackets if you agree they are to you 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:25.310
 no longer belong this 1 this is 2 friends 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:38.780
 I have not taken off the red jacket and it symbolizes 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.220
 title of immortal member elite 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.630
 club what where when 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:47.510
 if you remember we have such a title and 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.850
 in defeat these three people might 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:53.480
 stay in the club and recruit a new one 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.900
 six now they did an act 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:02:00.470
 they stripped themselves of this title title 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.520
 put it on the table and now they are equal 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.970
 and among equals 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:08.960
 if they lose now they will leave 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.810
 us from the club as ordinary members 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.820
 our club 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.320
 clear situation show me on the table 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.320
 please 3 red jackets 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:26.000
 yes perhaps the demand for the table we are on them 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:31.790
 play your immortal titles and so 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.770
 alone against connoisseurs yes yes reach 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.770
 remove the run and do not remove your 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.770
 only time passes quickly 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.770
 thank 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.640
 even without attention gathered very 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:51.090
 carefully friends if in doubt 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:55.090
 you want to become no i have no doubt 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:03:02.620
 upper attention issue extra 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:12.569
 round without a top viewers are not here 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:21.669
 play plays dealer casino against 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:23.620
 six Alexey pancakes attention brid le 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:26.590
 barber himself 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:34.329
 if the barber himself shaves everyone who does not 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:38.099
 shaving time itself is green 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.099
 researched greatly harm everyone 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.840
 this circle is eternal here you cannot say either 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:45.840
 yes no no 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:04:04.100
 this is not a barber 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:36.660
 the moment is this man who with other a 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:39.840
 man to myself again I will repeat 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.540
 the question is whether he shaves himself from the barber 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.810
 if the barber himself shaves everyone who is not 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:50.930
 shave himself no barber himself not 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:54.020
 shaving is your answer and now attention 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.020
 correct answer 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:06.170
 as Fedor Dvinyatin said this is famous 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:10.520
 logical paradox of bertrand russell 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:15.230
 not having a solution if you said that 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:19.520
 no decision you would have won this 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:23.540
 paradox has no solution is difficult 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:28.930
 there was a question and you lost an extra 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.930
 round and unfortunately everyone leaves the club 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.740
 thank you and you play is over
