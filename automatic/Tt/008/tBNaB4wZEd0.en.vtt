also<00:02:17.049> do<00:02:17.290> is<00:02:17.439> that<00:02:17.590> they<00:02:17.709> may<00:02:17.920> lay<00:02:17.980> out<00:02:18.129> the

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
also do is that they may lay out the

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.649 
also do is that they may lay out the
action<00:02:19.079> so<00:02:20.079> the<00:02:20.260> contact<00:02:21.239> with<00:02:22.239> the<00:02:22.359> stock

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:22.659 
action so the contact with the stock

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:24.479 
action so the contact with the stock
underneath<00:02:23.079> the<00:02:23.349> front<00:02:23.590> so<00:02:24.219> there's<00:02:24.400> actually

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
underneath the front so there's actually

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.449 
underneath the front so there's actually
no<00:02:24.700> contact<00:02:25.390> between<00:02:25.420> the<00:02:25.780> action<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:26.459> the

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
no contact between the action and the

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.000 
no contact between the action and the
and<00:02:27.909> the<00:02:28.030> stock<00:02:28.329> apart<00:02:29.230> from<00:02:29.379> the<00:02:29.500> very<00:02:29.709> first

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
part of the breech block what this does

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.949 
part of the breech block what this does
is<00:02:32.680> allows<00:02:32.980> for<00:02:33.250> expansion<00:02:33.639> on<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.120> cylinder

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
is allows for expansion on the cylinder

and no change of zero you've got various

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.920

to on this BB to they've gone to a side
lever<00:02:47.700> action<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:49.409> you<00:02:50.409> know<00:02:50.760> that's<00:02:51.760> a<00:02:51.879> very

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
lever action and you know that's a very

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.520 
lever action and you know that's a very
neat<00:02:52.359> arrangement<00:02:52.900> you<00:02:52.959> pull<00:02:53.169> that<00:02:53.290> back

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
neat arrangement you pull that back

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.059 
neat arrangement you pull that back
you've<00:02:53.950> got<00:02:53.980> direct<00:02:54.340> feed<00:02:54.879> into<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.299> bow<00:02:56.069> and

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
you've got direct feed into the bow and

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.129 
you've got direct feed into the bow and
then<00:02:57.639> you<00:02:57.760> feel<00:02:57.909> target<00:02:58.329> shooting<00:02:58.599> those<00:02:58.810> this

00:02:59.129 --> 00:02:59.139 
then you feel target shooting those this

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:02.280 
then you feel target shooting those this
is<00:02:59.169> the<00:02:59.319> the<00:02:59.950> main<00:03:00.669> way<00:03:00.909> to<00:03:00.969> load<00:03:01.299> a<00:03:01.329> rifle<00:03:01.840> what

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
is the the main way to load a rifle what

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.440 
is the the main way to load a rifle what
it's<00:03:02.439> doing<00:03:02.709> is<00:03:02.829> giving<00:03:02.859> you<00:03:03.219> total

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
it's doing is giving you total

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.909 
it's doing is giving you total
sensitivity<00:03:04.450> on<00:03:04.689> the<00:03:05.109> the<00:03:05.409> way<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.620> pellet

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:05.919 
sensitivity on the the way the pellet

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:07.709 
sensitivity on the the way the pellet
goes<00:03:06.310> into<00:03:06.579> the<00:03:06.669> barrel<00:03:06.849> so<00:03:07.540> you<00:03:07.629> can

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:07.719 
goes into the barrel so you can

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:11.729 
goes into the barrel so you can
basically<00:03:07.870> call<00:03:08.260> a<00:03:08.500> bad<00:03:08.769> pellet<00:03:10.739> to

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
basically call a bad pellet to

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.500 
basically call a bad pellet to
articulate<00:03:12.250> your<00:03:12.280> breech<00:03:12.609> arrangement<00:03:13.239> there

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
articulate your breech arrangement there

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.860 
articulate your breech arrangement there
and<00:03:16.709> you've<00:03:17.709> also<00:03:17.889> got<00:03:18.190> a<00:03:18.430> match<00:03:18.790> trigger<00:03:19.120> I'll

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
or it's sort of virtually waterproofed

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.080 
or it's sort of virtually waterproofed
and<00:04:39.889> coming<00:04:40.130> up<00:04:40.220> to<00:04:40.370> the<00:04:40.460> front<00:04:40.580> you've<00:04:40.850> got

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
and coming up to the front you've got

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.540 
and coming up to the front you've got
the<00:04:41.600> muzzle<00:04:41.900> break<00:04:42.080> or<00:04:42.889> I've<00:04:43.010> actually<00:04:43.160> had

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
the muzzle break or I've actually had

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.550 
the muzzle break or I've actually had
this<00:04:43.730> free<00:04:44.060> floated<00:04:44.660> so<00:04:45.020> there's<00:04:45.200> actually<00:04:45.440> no

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
this free floated so there's actually no

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.960 
this free floated so there's actually no
contact<00:04:46.130> between<00:04:46.160> the<00:04:46.520> barrel<00:04:46.790> and<00:04:46.850> the

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
contact between the barrel and the

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.930 
contact between the barrel and the
cylinder<00:04:47.440> as<00:04:48.440> standard<00:04:49.070> they<00:04:49.190> come<00:04:49.460> with<00:04:49.700> its

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
cylinder as standard they come with its

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.670 
cylinder as standard they come with its
this<00:04:50.120> flexibility<00:04:50.810> within<00:04:50.990> the<00:04:51.200> muzzle<00:04:51.500> break

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
this flexibility within the muzzle break

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.940 
this flexibility within the muzzle break
but<00:04:54.340> the<00:04:55.340> theory<00:04:55.760> is<00:04:55.880> that<00:04:56.180> you<00:04:56.870> can<00:04:57.860> be

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
but the theory is that you can be

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.620 
but the theory is that you can be
beneficial<00:04:58.310> to<00:04:58.460> completely<00:04:59.030> free<00:04:59.389> up<00:04:59.510> the

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
beneficial to completely free up the

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:05.260 
beneficial to completely free up the
bowel<00:05:03.310> charging<00:05:04.310> wires<00:05:04.520> he's<00:05:04.790> done<00:05:05.000> via<00:05:05.240> the

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
bowel charging wires he's done via the

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.219 
bowel charging wires he's done via the
the<00:05:06.110> latest<00:05:07.150> safety<00:05:08.150> valve<00:05:08.540> from<00:05:08.810> air<00:05:08.960> arms

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229 
the latest safety valve from air arms

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:11.980 
the latest safety valve from air arms
which<00:05:09.410> is<00:05:09.620> um<00:05:10.419> there's<00:05:11.419> a<00:05:11.510> little<00:05:11.750> sort<00:05:11.960> of

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
which is um there's a little sort of

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:13.780 
which is um there's a little sort of
stirrup<00:05:12.860> arrangement<00:05:13.310> on<00:05:13.370> the<00:05:13.400> front<00:05:13.639> there

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:13.790 
stirrup arrangement on the front there

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.420 
stirrup arrangement on the front there
that<00:05:13.940> actually<00:05:14.210> locks<00:05:14.419> into<00:05:14.750> your<00:05:16.479> air<00:05:17.479> valve

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
that actually locks into your air valve

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.710 
that actually locks into your air valve
on<00:05:19.430> your<00:05:19.639> bottle<00:05:19.940> or<00:05:20.030> your<00:05:20.120> palm<00:05:20.360> connects

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
on your bottle or your palm connects

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.060 
on your bottle or your palm connects
that<00:05:20.990> makes<00:05:21.229> it<00:05:21.380> very<00:05:21.530> very<00:05:21.770> safe<00:05:21.979> and<00:05:24.070> I'll

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
that makes it very very safe and I'll

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.400 
that makes it very very safe and I'll
say<00:05:25.250> finally<00:05:25.700> with<00:05:25.820> these<00:05:26.000> rifles<00:05:26.570> air<00:05:27.110> arms

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
say finally with these rifles air arms

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.680 
say finally with these rifles air arms
have<00:05:27.500> gone<00:05:27.680> for<00:05:27.889> the<00:05:27.950> sort<00:05:28.160> of<00:05:28.690> complete
