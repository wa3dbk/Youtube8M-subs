two-sided tape that's mounted to our
converter<00:01:34.380> box<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.890> find<00:01:35.490> an<00:01:35.610> area<00:01:35.790> just

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:35.940 
converter box and find an area just

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.030 
converter box and find an area just
inside<00:01:36.510> this<00:01:36.720> interior<00:01:37.020> panel<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.710> mount<00:01:37.890> it
