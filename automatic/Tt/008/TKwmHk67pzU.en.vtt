offline<00:02:08.550> usage<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.690> can't<00:02:09.959> do<00:02:10.110> that<00:02:10.229> in<00:02:10.410> every

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
offline usage you can't do that in every

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.830 
offline usage you can't do that in every
region<00:02:11.039> but<00:02:11.730> with<00:02:11.849> this<00:02:12.060> tweak<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.510> allows<00:02:12.720> you

to<00:02:12.959> do<00:02:13.110> so

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
to do so

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.560 
to do so
so<00:02:13.890> I<00:02:13.920> just<00:02:14.190> type<00:02:14.370> ok<00:02:14.760> maps<00:02:15.030> in<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.330> little

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
so I just type ok maps in the little

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.630 
so I just type ok maps in the little
search<00:02:15.750> bar<00:02:16.020> there<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.530> then<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.220> can<00:02:17.340> zoom

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
search bar there and then you can zoom

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.400 
search bar there and then you can zoom
in<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.120> eventually<00:02:18.660> you'll<00:02:18.810> be<00:02:18.960> able<00:02:18.990> to<00:02:19.200> save

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.250 
in and eventually you'll be able to save
the<00:02:19.620> map<00:02:19.880> offline<00:02:20.880> once<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.630> have<00:02:21.810> an<00:02:21.960> area

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
the map offline once you have an area

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.350 
the map offline once you have an area
that<00:02:22.290> isn't<00:02:22.770> too<00:02:22.860> large<00:02:23.100> so<00:02:23.250> there<00:02:23.940> you<00:02:24.060> go<00:02:24.210> so

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
that isn't too large so there you go so

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.780 
that isn't too large so there you go so
save<00:02:24.930> this<00:02:25.110> map<00:02:25.320> save<00:02:25.740> it<00:02:25.890> give<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.400> name<00:02:26.550> and

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
save this map save it give it a name and

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.090 
save this map save it give it a name and
you<00:02:27.270> say<00:02:27.450> before<00:02:27.600> offline<00:02:28.020> usage<00:02:28.440> in<00:02:28.620> some

you say before offline usage in some

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.500 
you say before offline usage in some
areas<00:02:29.460> apparently<00:02:29.940> that's<00:02:30.120> not<00:02:30.360> available

areas apparently that's not available

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.080 
areas apparently that's not available
this<00:02:31.200> unlocks<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.800> for<00:02:31.950> everywhere<00:02:32.310> so<00:02:32.610> that

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
this unlocks it for everywhere so that

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.570 
this unlocks it for everywhere so that
is<00:02:33.210> another<00:02:33.420> benefit<00:02:33.990> to<00:02:34.200> Makoto<00:02:34.950> it<00:02:35.340> allows

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.240 
to nine digits yeah it shuts me down I
can't<00:04:57.449> type<00:04:57.810> anything<00:04:58.020> else<00:04:58.380> well<00:04:58.680> you<00:04:59.040> can<00:04:59.160> go

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
can't type anything else well you can go

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.100 
can't type anything else well you can go
into<00:04:59.430> the<00:04:59.610> calculator<00:05:00.060> section<00:05:00.210> in<00:05:00.450> Makoto<00:05:00.870> a

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
into the calculator section in Makoto a

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.250 
into the calculator section in Makoto a
select<00:05:01.740> unlimited<00:05:02.250> input<00:05:02.610> tap<00:05:03.120> apply<00:05:03.419> reopen

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
select unlimited input tap apply reopen

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.540 
select unlimited input tap apply reopen
calculator<00:05:04.710> it<00:05:04.889> automatically<00:05:05.370> will

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
calculator it automatically will

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.430 
calculator it automatically will
relaunch<00:05:05.940> and<00:05:06.150> reload<00:05:06.479> and<00:05:06.780> now<00:05:06.990> you<00:05:07.169> can<00:05:07.320> see

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
relaunch and reload and now you can see

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.780 
relaunch and reload and now you can see
I'm<00:05:07.620> typing<00:05:07.889> all<00:05:07.979> these<00:05:08.130> knives<00:05:08.310> and<00:05:08.580> then<00:05:08.669> it

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
I'm typing all these knives and then it

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.480 
I'm typing all these knives and then it
gives<00:05:09.300> me<00:05:09.450> exponential<00:05:10.139> results<00:05:10.590> as<00:05:11.220> I

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
gives me exponential results as I

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.730 
gives me exponential results as I
continue<00:05:11.880> to<00:05:12.030> put<00:05:12.240> in<00:05:12.360> different<00:05:13.080> digits<00:05:13.620> and

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
continue to put in different digits and

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.170 
continue to put in different digits and
things<00:05:13.919> like<00:05:14.040> that<00:05:14.100> so<00:05:14.460> it<00:05:14.580> allows<00:05:14.760> me<00:05:14.970> to<00:05:15.060> have

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
things like that so it allows me to have

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.390 
things like that so it allows me to have
a<00:05:15.240> infinite<00:05:16.020> amount<00:05:16.560> of<00:05:16.650> digits<00:05:17.040> to<00:05:17.130> put<00:05:17.280> in

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
a infinite amount of digits to put in

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.850 
a infinite amount of digits to put in
there<00:05:17.669> at<00:05:17.820> the<00:05:18.000> in<00:05:18.150> theory<00:05:18.539> and<00:05:18.720> then<00:05:19.229> lastly

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
there at the in theory and then lastly

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.860 
there at the in theory and then lastly
you<00:05:20.190> have<00:05:20.220> trillion<00:05:20.729> and<00:05:20.970> then<00:05:21.060> campus<00:05:21.479> portal

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
you have trillion and then campus portal

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.750 
you have trillion and then campus portal
trillion<00:05:22.350> allows<00:05:22.740> you<00:05:22.860> to<00:05:22.950> get<00:05:23.100> rid<00:05:23.430> of<00:05:23.460> ads

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
trillion allows you to get rid of ads

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.010 
trillion allows you to get rid of ads
and<00:05:24.030> then<00:05:24.120> campus<00:05:24.419> portal<00:05:24.690> does<00:05:24.870> some<00:05:24.990> things

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
and then campus portal does some things

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.500 
and then campus portal does some things
as<00:05:25.289> well<00:05:25.470> those<00:05:26.010> are<00:05:26.220> more<00:05:26.370> especially<00:05:27.060> campus

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
as well those are more especially campus

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.110 
as well those are more especially campus
portal<00:05:27.840> will<00:05:28.169> be<00:05:28.289> a<00:05:28.320> more<00:05:28.650> niche<00:05:28.889> area<00:05:29.760> that

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
portal will be a more niche area that

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.330 
portal will be a more niche area that
most<00:05:30.510> people<00:05:30.840> won't<00:05:30.960> be<00:05:31.139> using<00:05:31.500> but<00:05:32.010> you<00:05:32.220> can

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
most people won't be using but you can

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.100 
most people won't be using but you can
see<00:05:32.490> Makoto<00:05:32.940> is<00:05:33.240> a<00:05:33.510> grab-bag

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
see Makoto is a grab-bag

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.230 
see Makoto is a grab-bag
