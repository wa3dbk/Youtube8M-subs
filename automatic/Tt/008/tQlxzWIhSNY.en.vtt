possibly can you'll want to use the spin

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.889 
possibly can you'll want to use the spin
technique<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:59.459> great<00:01:59.729> effect<00:01:59.849> like<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.690> did

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
technique to great effect like I did

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.430 
technique to great effect like I did
right<00:02:01.110> there<00:02:02.000> because<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.450> keeps<00:02:03.660> Mario<00:02:04.200> in

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
right there because it keeps Mario in

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.369 
right there because it keeps Mario in
air<00:02:04.709> or<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.670> don't<00:02:06.119> know<00:02:06.179> about<00:02:06.360> an<00:02:06.690> extra<00:02:07.110> half

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:07.379 
air or I don't know about an extra half

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:10.639 
air or I don't know about an extra half
second<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:08.879> gives<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.179> more<00:02:09.479> time<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:10.140> jump

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
second so it gives you more time to jump

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:19.910 
second so it gives you more time to jump
on<00:02:10.920> top<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.520> enemies

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.289 

here<00:02:20.920> we<00:02:21.069> have<00:02:21.190> a<00:02:21.220> whole<00:02:21.489> bunch<00:02:21.909> of<00:02:22.120> enemies

here we have a whole bunch of enemies

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:27.089 
here we have a whole bunch of enemies
which<00:02:22.720> we<00:02:22.900> can<00:02:23.049> jump<00:02:23.290> upon<00:02:25.799> you<00:02:26.799> can<00:02:26.950> also

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
which we can jump upon you can also

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.270 
which we can jump upon you can also
destroy<00:02:27.670> that<00:02:27.909> ?<00:02:28.450> block<00:02:28.959> or<00:02:29.260> five<00:02:29.769> golden

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
destroy that ? block or five golden

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:38.610 
destroy that ? block or five golden
coins<00:02:36.269> of<00:02:37.269> course<00:02:37.540> it's<00:02:37.750> difficult<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.379> jump

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620
