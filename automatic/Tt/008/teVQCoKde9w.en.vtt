Aries special heavy attack this is

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.530 
Aries special heavy attack this is
because<00:02:36.930> it<00:02:37.260> plume<00:02:37.709> of<00:02:37.920> fire<00:02:38.300> radiates<00:02:39.300> from

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
because it plume of fire radiates from

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.350 
because it plume of fire radiates from
the<00:02:39.840> tip<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.230> your<00:02:40.320> blade<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:41.250> this<00:02:41.910> enables

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
the tip of your blade and this enables

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.670 
the tip of your blade and this enables
you<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.480> hit<00:02:42.720> anyone<00:02:43.020> who's<00:02:43.170> slightly<00:02:43.560> out

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
you to hit anyone who's slightly out

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.420 
you to hit anyone who's slightly out
with<00:02:43.800> your<00:02:43.920> range

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
with your range

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.760 
with your range
this<00:02:44.790> attack<00:02:45.209> is<00:02:45.390> quite<00:02:45.720> strong<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.230> on<00:02:46.530> top

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
this attack is quite strong and on top

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.110 
this attack is quite strong and on top
of<00:02:46.920> that<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.340> can't<00:02:47.640> be<00:02:47.790> blocked

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
of that it can't be blocked

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.390 
of that it can't be blocked
unfortunately<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:49.260> can<00:02:49.620> be<00:02:49.830> dodged<00:02:50.070> and

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
unfortunately it can be dodged and

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.060 
unfortunately it can be dodged and
because<00:02:51.270> the<00:02:51.390> special<00:02:51.630> heavy<00:02:51.959> attack<00:02:52.320> needs<00:02:52.920> a

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
because the special heavy attack needs a

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.010 
because the special heavy attack needs a
little<00:02:53.370> charge<00:02:53.910> up<00:02:54.090> time<00:02:54.360> means<00:02:54.930> that

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
little charge up time means that

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.930 
little charge up time means that
opponents<00:02:55.620> can<00:02:55.830> interrupt<00:02:56.130> you<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.550> stop<00:02:56.790> you

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
best used against opponents who like to

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.140 
best used against opponents who like to

who are slightly out of your tack range

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.090 
who are slightly out of your tack range
now<00:03:08.730> lastly<00:03:09.239> because<00:03:09.600> the<00:03:10.230> blade<00:03:10.470> of<00:03:10.620> Aries<00:03:10.890> is
