breaking Cody across the globe today we

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.669 
breaking Cody across the globe today we
take<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:09.179> slightly<00:00:09.510> different<00:00:09.690> path<00:00:10.440> why

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
take a slightly different path why

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:11.900 
take a slightly different path why

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
because it's socially and

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.150 
because it's socially and
environmentally<00:00:12.570> responsible<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.740> it<00:00:13.950> looks

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
environmentally responsible and it looks

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.129 
environmentally responsible and it looks
