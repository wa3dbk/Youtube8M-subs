00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:24.820
 the friend speaks the second line, there's nothing 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.820
 I do well to change starting 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:37.580
 My name is Maria Ligia Ferreira and 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:39.830
 I'm not 29 years old, the nutritionist 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.700
 when I was young I always liked 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.450
 Cook 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.000
 so I went by that side I like 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.110
 much of the production area so I opted 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.660
 Why did not you have to work? 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.790
 really industrial since the 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.890
 I already wanted the initial one already 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.090
 I have already worked in another location in 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.699
 same area 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.620
 and then she had nine months experience 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.830
 when I was hired here in the final 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.180
 I entered in 2009 three units right now 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.300
 We have in the city of Penapolis 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.550
 also then so over 1500 meals 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.890
 Human three units 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.810
 so it was a great challenge first 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.020
 We have to meet pressure, right? 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.280
 provide carbohydrates proteins 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.930
 the fibers according to the invention. 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.610
 worker need 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.920
 according to pat program 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.320
 of the worker and also 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.990
 cut the acceptability of the vowel né 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.299
 so here we have an audience that is 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.189
 the personal industry of the field staff 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.810
 then these people require a need 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.219
 greater energy 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.320
 so we have to do this 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:41.619
 menu for this audience 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.500
 there is a light menu that is the 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:47.840
 menu that is programmed before only the 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.049
 people eat this early light dish 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.250
 are people fixed or doing a certain 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.280
 treatment 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.119
 So this guy is different, is he? 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.369
 good 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.240
 they speak some do not speak but if they are 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.400
 bad 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.070
 he said much more 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.970
 is but mainly the pev and each step 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.410
 then it came back cold then that 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.970
 kind of thing we have to stay in 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.970
 Top not to let happen. 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.620
 in the production area we work with 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.240
 menu and is based on this 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.580
 menu, we do all the planning 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.709
 So the first thing we have to do is 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.350
 plan if we do not plan 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:38.050
 It all comes up, everything goes wrong and then 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.990
 come the production there come accompany hand of 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.510
 work is doing it right, right? 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.940
 the way we are instructing 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.520
 then so is the day to day is well run 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.430
 here we have three deaf lunch 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.010
 dinner and supper so it is if not 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.230
 there is no such plan before 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.280
 sure has to be well planned and has 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.560
 a good team 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.820
 here each has its function is not of 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.950
 according to the scale 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.769
 So is the team that stays alone in the 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.260
 Here's the stove that stands alone in the salad 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:11.260
 team that is just smiling 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.690
 the team that stays alone in china then each 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.330
 one has its function is that way 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.820
 I found the best way to succeed 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.160
 have to like brother in the hand in the mass 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.500
 and there are times you will need 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.290
 literally put their hands dirty and 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.850
 have lots of patience a lot of flexibility 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.790
 because working with people is very 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.260
 difficult to deal with food is also 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.950
 very difficult and each one has a taste 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.760
 So you have to have a lot of patience and good 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.980
 will 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.980
 Who has a job well? 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.470
 compromising even has responsibility 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.200
 because it is any fault can even 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:51.780
 to compromise this is the field industry 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.780
 to the administrative sector all areas 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:05.510

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:28.340
