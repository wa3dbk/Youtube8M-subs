 hair surface protective film 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.609
 which envelops 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.830
 and filling and smoothing out all the bumps in 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.049
 their structure gives this coating 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.210

 hair or who's spoiled too 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.710
 frequent staining 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.200
 and exposure to high temperatures is worth 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.259
 consider that lamination is not medical 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.210
 the procedure is not a panacea but effective 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.670

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.970
 re-dried appropriately first 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.280
 carry out medical rehabilitation 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.619
 procedure and only then resort to 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.540
 lamination now we do the first 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.579
 we restore the stage of our procedure 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.020
 damaged hair makeup which we 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.240
 applied consists of two components 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.399
 the first is artificially created 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.570
 keratin which restores 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.280
 directly the hair structure itself 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.420
 second component specifically for 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.549
 dyed hair 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.060
 this procedure is also good to do right away 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.060
 after dyeing 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.900
 after hair restoration with keratin 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.570
 lightly dried hair is applied 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.060
 composition which is a gel 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.250
 colorless and odor free 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.380
 preservatives in its composition are 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.110
 wheat protein which has 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.450
 moisturizing and nourishing effects and 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.380
 also extracts of roman chamomile and 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.130
 yarrow hops which have 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.740
 anti-inflammatory and therapeutic 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.860
 exposure stimulates hair growth 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.210
 no particular contraindications 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.150
 the procedure does not have a set of amino acids 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.190
 contained in the product is 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.410
 friendly and kindred hair 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.810
 component because the tool is not 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.390
 contains preservatives and aggressive 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.290
 substances like hydrogen peroxide or 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.330
 ammonia 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.850
 lamination is useful to do after 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.459

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.910
 our hair dries just like 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.570
 Sun is a correspondent of salt water the winter 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.860
 living price is the best condition 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.560
 protective film helps to avoid 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.530
 pollution from the environment and 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.810
 any harmful factors after full 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.580
 applying the drug leaves at 30 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.070
 minutes during which is held 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.620
 heating through plastic wrap 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.140
 the climazon device and on the final 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.540
 stage composition is washed off using 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.610
 special balsams after i 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.060
 wash off with stakes him two

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.300
 lamination allows you to save longer 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.819
 styling even with adverse 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.489
 weather conditions because thanks 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:50.099
 protective film does not absorb hair 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.660
 moisture besides laminated stripes 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:53.790
 don't electrify 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.340
 this is especially true during the cold period 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.440
 when our clothes contain more 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.080

 must wait at least 24 hours 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.580
 until the protein is fully entrenched in 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.430
 hair should take into account that in the future 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:14.040
 ironing temperature when laying should not 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.380
 exceed 120 degrees however after 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.079
 lamination using iron like 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.269
 the rule is not required hair and so lie 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.400
 heavier than a dense layer while respecting 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.500
