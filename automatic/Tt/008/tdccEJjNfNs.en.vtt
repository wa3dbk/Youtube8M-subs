heart rate is at 63 right now and then
if<00:03:58.640> you're<00:03:59.209> starting<00:03:59.569> a<00:03:59.900> workout<00:04:01.090> you<00:04:02.090> could

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
if you're starting a workout you could

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.270 
if you're starting a workout you could
let's<00:04:04.580> see<00:04:05.170> press<00:04:06.170> the<00:04:06.350> middle<00:04:06.470> button<00:04:06.620> again

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
let's see press the middle button again

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.479 
let's see press the middle button again
it's<00:04:07.640> gonna<00:04:07.850> say<00:04:08.120> started<00:04:08.780> and<00:04:09.170> then<00:04:09.739> your

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
it's gonna say started and then your

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.180 
it's gonna say started and then your
heart<00:04:10.700> rate<00:04:10.970> is<00:04:11.180> gonna<00:04:11.420> be<00:04:11.660> really<00:04:12.470> big<00:04:12.860> on<00:04:13.070> the

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
heart rate is gonna be really big on the

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:19.210 
heart rate is gonna be really big on the
watch<00:04:13.510> so<00:04:16.030> it's<00:04:17.030> gonna<00:04:17.299> have<00:04:17.510> a<00:04:17.570> big<00:04:17.690> 82<00:04:18.470> so

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
watch so it's gonna have a big 82 so

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:28.659 
watch so it's gonna have a big 82 so
that<00:04:19.400> is<00:04:19.519> my<00:04:19.700> heart<00:04:19.940> rate<00:04:20.120> right<00:04:20.359> now<00:04:27.100> and<00:04:28.100> then

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:28.669 
that is my heart rate right now and then

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.129 
that is my heart rate right now and then
you<00:04:28.880> could<00:04:29.060> actually<00:04:29.270> see<00:04:30.520> if<00:04:31.520> you're<00:04:32.360> in<00:04:32.540> your

you could actually see if you're in your

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.460 
you could actually see if you're in your
training<00:04:33.710> zone<00:04:34.280> so<00:04:35.270> if<00:04:35.390> you<00:04:35.600> press<00:04:35.840> this<00:04:36.050> above

there you could go back to the heart

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:08.610 
there you could go back to the heart
rate<00:05:00.560> and<00:05:04.810> then

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:14.800

polar heart rate monitor I'm gonna
actually<00:05:22.880> go<00:05:23.120> do<00:05:23.479> an<00:05:23.870> insanity<00:05:24.500> workout

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
wearing this so we'll see how high my

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.309 
wearing this so we'll see how high my
heart<00:05:28.130> actually<00:05:28.430> gets<00:05:28.970> while<00:05:29.660> I'm<00:05:29.720> doing<00:05:30.050> an

and<00:05:35.780> then<00:05:35.930> extremely<00:05:36.500> low<00:05:36.710> because<00:05:37.280> it<00:05:37.639> is<00:05:37.849> an

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180

training workout and that's why this
heart<00:05:43.849> rate<00:05:44.090> monitor<00:05:44.569> is<00:05:44.780> great<00:05:45.139> because<00:05:45.590> you

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
heart rate monitor is great because you

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.980 
heart rate monitor is great because you
could<00:05:45.949> do<00:05:46.099> hit<00:05:46.370> workouts<00:05:46.819> on<00:05:47.120> your<00:05:47.150> own<00:05:47.569> and

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:53.170 
get your heart rate in your training
zone<00:05:50.810> and<00:05:51.080> then<00:05:51.560> get<00:05:51.800> it<00:05:51.949> back<00:05:52.190> down<00:05:52.460> low<00:05:52.880> and
