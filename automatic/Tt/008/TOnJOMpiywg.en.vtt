today we're gonna take a look at Sony's
2012<00:00:08.370> edition<00:00:08.760> of<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:08.940> vol<00:00:09.540> series<00:00:09.990> all<00:00:10.200> in<00:00:10.230> one

2012 edition of a vol series all in one
now<00:00:11.309> suddenly<00:00:11.519> is<00:00:11.700> trying<00:00:11.910> some<00:00:12.030> interesting

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
now suddenly is trying some interesting

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.299 
now suddenly is trying some interesting
things<00:00:12.599> with<00:00:12.750> this<00:00:12.840> PC<00:00:13.259> but<00:00:13.469> overall<00:00:13.950> some<00:00:14.219> of

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
things with this PC but overall some of

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.010 
things with this PC but overall some of
the<00:00:14.370> highlights<00:00:14.730> fall<00:00:14.969> flat<00:00:15.269> which<00:00:15.599> makes<00:00:15.870> it

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
the highlights fall flat which makes it

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.570 
the highlights fall flat which makes it
hard<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.320> justify<00:00:16.710> paying<00:00:17.070> more<00:00:17.340> for<00:00:17.369> those

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
hard to justify paying more for those

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.519 
hard to justify paying more for those
parts<00:00:17.940> particularly<00:00:18.750> when<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:18.960> don't<00:00:19.260> have

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
parts particularly when you don't have

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.170 
parts particularly when you don't have
as<00:00:19.680> much<00:00:19.859> computing<00:00:20.430> power<00:00:20.490> as<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:20.820> might<00:00:21.029> get

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
as much computing power as you might get

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.519 
as much computing power as you might get
from<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.420> similar<00:00:21.689> all-in-one<00:00:22.140> from<00:00:22.320> another

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
from a similar all-in-one from another

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.400 
from a similar all-in-one from another
vendor<00:00:22.880> so<00:00:23.880> this<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.180> 24<00:00:24.720> inch<00:00:24.840> on<00:00:25.050> one<00:00:25.080> with

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
vendor so this is a 24 inch on one with

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.439 
vendor so this is a 24 inch on one with
a<00:00:25.439> touchscreen<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.250> gesture<00:00:26.699> control<00:00:27.060> system

an<00:00:39.570> interesting<00:00:39.780> system<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:41.129> starting<00:00:41.460> with<00:00:41.520> a

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
an interesting system so starting with a

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.920 
an interesting system so starting with a
good<00:00:41.820> there<00:00:41.969> are<00:00:42.059> some<00:00:42.270> things<00:00:42.480> we<00:00:42.600> like<00:00:42.780> about

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
good there are some things we like about

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.479 
good there are some things we like about
this<00:00:43.170> system<00:00:43.350> it's<00:00:44.040> like<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.190> lot<00:00:44.370> of

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
this system it's like a lot of

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.470 
this system it's like a lot of
all-in-ones<00:00:44.850> there's<00:00:45.059> different<00:00:45.360> ways<00:00:45.420> you

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
all-in-ones there's different ways you

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.389 
all-in-ones there's different ways you
can<00:00:45.690> send<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.079> signal<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.710> display<00:00:47.160> you

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
can send a signal to this display you

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.369 
can send a signal to this display you
can<00:00:47.430> run<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.789> off<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.030> PC<00:00:48.450> off<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.750> HDMI<00:00:49.350> input

about<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.239> system<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.629> Sony<00:00:54.930> has<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.170> nice

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
about the system is that Sony has a nice

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.350 
about the system is that Sony has a nice
menu<00:00:55.710> feature<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.640> let<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.879> control<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
menu feature to let you control the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.119 
menu feature to let you control the
display<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.960> audio<00:00:58.230> setup<00:00:58.559> for<00:00:58.800> each<00:00:58.949> of

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
display and the audio setup for each of

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.889 
display and the audio setup for each of
those<00:00:59.219> different<00:00:59.430> modes<00:00:59.820> so<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.600> means<00:01:00.809> if

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
those different modes so that means if

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.180 
those different modes so that means if
you<00:01:01.020> have<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.170> certain<00:01:01.410> preference<00:01:01.890> for<00:01:02.070> how

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
you have a certain preference for how

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.439 
you have a certain preference for how
you<00:01:02.250> want<00:01:02.430> your<00:01:02.489> PC<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.000> look<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.270> can<00:01:03.329> change

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
you want your PC to look you can change

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.390 
you want your PC to look you can change
that<00:01:03.840> when<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.080> get<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.350> TV<00:01:04.559> mode<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.339> make

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
that when you get to the TV mode to make

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.460 
that when you get to the TV mode to make
it<00:01:05.549> look<00:01:05.700> entirely<00:01:05.970> different<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:07.170> Sony's

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
it look entirely different so Sony's

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.810 
it look entirely different so Sony's
tried<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.710> push<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.040> idea<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.280> using<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.640> as

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
tried to push the idea of using this as

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.460 
tried to push the idea of using this as
a<00:01:08.850> home<00:01:09.119> entertainment<00:01:09.330> system<00:01:10.020> even<00:01:10.229> further

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
a home entertainment system even further

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.859 
a home entertainment system even further

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
video the problem though is that that

chip really doesn't benefit windows
video<00:01:18.600> more<00:01:18.810> than<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:19.080> would<00:01:19.229> get<00:01:19.320> from<00:01:19.380> say<00:01:19.710> a

standard<00:01:19.979> graphics<00:01:20.520> card<00:01:20.729> but<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.180> doesn't<00:01:21.479> do

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
standard graphics card but it doesn't do

if<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.060> connect<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.450> TV<00:01:27.750> tuner<00:01:27.930> but<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
if you connect the TV tuner but the

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.050 
if you connect the TV tuner but the
problem<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.159> video<00:01:29.430> signal<00:01:29.670> really

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
problem is the video signal really

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.429 
problem is the video signal really
doesn't<00:01:30.360> look<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.509> much<00:01:30.659> better<00:01:31.020> compared

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
doesn't look that much better compared

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.170 
doesn't look that much better compared
to<00:01:31.500> another<00:01:31.619> on<00:01:32.009> one<00:01:32.250> with<00:01:32.490> just<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.820> standard

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
to another on one with just a standard

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.270 
to another on one with just a standard
video<00:01:33.329> processor<00:01:33.990> in<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:35.009> means<00:01:35.159> you're

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
video processor in it that means you're

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.649 
video processor in it that means you're
not<00:01:35.310> really<00:01:35.520> getting<00:01:35.700> much<00:01:35.970> from<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.180> TV<00:01:36.390> chip

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
not really getting much from the TV chip

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.480 
not really getting much from the TV chip
but<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.900> are<00:01:37.079> losing<00:01:37.320> 3d<00:01:37.710> processing<00:01:38.189> power

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
but you are losing 3d processing power

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.920 
but you are losing 3d processing power
so<00:01:38.579> if<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.880> want<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.060> use<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:39.329> as<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> gaming

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
so if you want to use this as a gaming

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.749 
so if you want to use this as a gaming
system<00:01:40.170> as<00:01:40.470> well<00:01:40.740> as<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.950> home<00:01:41.130> video<00:01:41.430> player

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
system as well as a home video player

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.480 
system as well as a home video player
it's<00:01:42.360> really<00:01:42.689> not<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.960> best<00:01:42.990> option<00:01:43.490> another

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
it's really not the best option another

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.770 
it's really not the best option another
feature<00:01:44.759> that's<00:01:44.850> disappointing<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.630> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
feature that's disappointing is the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.960 
feature that's disappointing is the
gesture<00:01:46.110> control<00:01:46.500> system<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.040> simply<00:01:47.640> doesn't

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
gesture control system it simply doesn't

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.090 
gesture control system it simply doesn't
work<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:49.110> can<00:01:49.259> open<00:01:49.680> up<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.890> software

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
work you can open up the software

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.069 
work you can open up the software
settings<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.820> play<00:01:51.030> around<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.450> sensitivity

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
settings and play around the sensitivity

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.990 
settings and play around the sensitivity
it<00:01:52.170> gives<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.439> basic<00:01:52.920> tutorial<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.520> what's

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
it gives you a basic tutorial of what's

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.670 
it gives you a basic tutorial of what's
supposed<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.390> happen<00:01:54.479> but<00:01:55.350> then<00:01:55.470> when<00:01:55.590> you

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
supposed to happen but then when you

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.139 
supposed to happen but then when you
actually<00:01:55.770> try<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.070> use<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.340> gesture<00:01:56.790> control<00:01:57.090> in

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
actually try to use a gesture control in

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.639 
actually try to use a gesture control in
applications<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.869> really<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.290> not<00:01:58.439> that

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
applications it really is not that

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.679 
applications it really is not that
responsive<00:01:59.159> if<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.460> works<00:01:59.640> at<00:01:59.790> all<00:01:59.909> now<00:02:00.659> you

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
responsive if it works at all now you

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.149 
responsive if it works at all now you
don't<00:02:00.869> really<00:02:00.960> lose<00:02:01.229> anything<00:02:01.469> with<00:02:01.740> this<00:02:01.829> PC

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
don't really lose anything with this PC

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.770 
don't really lose anything with this PC
because<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.549> has<00:02:02.729> gesture<00:02:03.090> control<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.570> runs

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
because it has gesture control it runs

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.149 
because it has gesture control it runs
through<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.020> webcam<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:04.649> there's<00:02:04.829> no<00:02:04.950> extra

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
through the webcam so there's no extra

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.130 
through the webcam so there's no extra
hardware<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.729> need<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:05.969> purchase<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.659> it's

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
hardware you need to purchase and it's

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.690 
hardware you need to purchase and it's
kind<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.469> nice<00:02:07.649> idea<00:02:07.770> we<00:02:08.129> appreciate<00:02:08.520> that

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
kind of a nice idea we appreciate that

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.070 
kind of a nice idea we appreciate that
something<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:09.000> experimenting<00:02:09.690> but<00:02:09.899> it's

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
something is experimenting but it's

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.420 
something is experimenting but it's
definitely<00:02:10.530> frustrating<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.160> doesn't

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
definitely frustrating that it doesn't

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.400 
definitely frustrating that it doesn't

so<00:02:39.090> overall<00:02:39.360> sony<00:02:39.690> is<00:02:39.900> trying<00:02:40.170> some

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
so overall sony is trying some

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.630 
so overall sony is trying some
interesting<00:02:40.650> things<00:02:40.770> with<00:02:40.980> this<00:02:41.070> system<00:02:41.310> the

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
interesting things with this system the

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.400 
interesting things with this system the
problem<00:02:42.120> is<00:02:42.360> that<00:02:42.510> because<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.930> TV<00:02:43.110> chip

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
problem is that because the TV chip

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.780 
problem is that because the TV chip
doesn't<00:02:43.650> provide<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:43.980> lot<00:02:44.160> of<00:02:44.190> value<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.730> the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
doesn't provide a lot of value and the

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.310 
doesn't provide a lot of value and the
gesture<00:02:45.180> control<00:02:45.480> falls<00:02:45.750> flat

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
gesture control falls flat

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.900 
gesture control falls flat
it<00:02:46.740> doesn't<00:02:47.100> really<00:02:47.190> deliver<00:02:47.490> on<00:02:47.700> its

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
it doesn't really deliver on its
