00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
series cards now what's cool about this

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.420 
series cards now what's cool about this
is<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:18.000> it's<00:00:18.300> free<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.810> be<00:00:19.320> nvidia<00:00:20.010> cards<00:00:20.340> are

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
is a it's free and be nvidia cards are

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.859 
is a it's free and be nvidia cards are
already<00:00:20.640> designed<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.000> be<00:00:21.090> optimized<00:00:21.510> for<00:00:21.630> it

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
already designed to be optimized for it

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.200 
already designed to be optimized for it
and<00:00:22.020> make<00:00:22.439> use<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.650> onboard<00:00:23.189> resources<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.000> as

and make use of onboard resources and as

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.550 
and make use of onboard resources and as
a<00:00:24.269> result<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.900> impact<00:00:25.230> on<00:00:25.320> performance

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
a result the impact on performance

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.560 
a result the impact on performance
should<00:00:26.160> be<00:00:26.369> minimal<00:00:26.789> so<00:00:27.180> let's<00:00:27.300> go<00:00:27.390> ahead<00:00:27.420> and

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
should be minimal so let's go ahead and

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:39.430 
should be minimal so let's go ahead and
take<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.750> look<00:00:27.960> at<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.109> right<00:00:28.410> now

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
set up right now we have it set to 5

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.999 
set up right now we have it set to 5
minutes<00:01:15.600> but<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.320> can<00:01:16.440> go<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.649> the<00:01:16.740> setting

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
minutes but you can go to the setting

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.380 
minutes but you can go to the setting
right<00:01:17.100> here<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.670> change<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.030> anywhere

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
right here and change it to anywhere

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.880 
right here and change it to anywhere
you'd<00:01:18.509> like<00:01:18.570> between<00:01:19.020> one<00:01:19.320> minute<00:01:19.560> or<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
you'd like between one minute or the

you'd like between one minute or the
full<00:01:20.070> 20<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.789> it's<00:01:20.909> great<00:01:21.000> about<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.420> you

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
full 20 so it's great about this is you

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.059 
full 20 so it's great about this is you
can<00:01:21.659> always<00:01:21.960> record<00:01:22.319> those<00:01:22.590> great<00:01:22.890> moments

00:01:23.059 --> 00:01:23.069 
can always record those great moments

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:24.290 
can always record those great moments
that<00:01:23.369> happen<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:23.640> games<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.179> weren't

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
that happen in games that you weren't

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.669 
that happen in games that you weren't
planning<00:01:24.509> on<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.289> didn't<00:01:25.440> have<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.590> be

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:25.679 
planning on so you didn't have to be

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:27.320 
planning on so you didn't have to be
recording<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.250> advance<00:01:26.610> now<00:01:27.060> there<00:01:27.179> are<00:01:27.300> a

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
recording in advance now there are a

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.790 
recording in advance now there are a
couple<00:01:27.569> other<00:01:27.780> options<00:01:28.229> as<00:01:28.350> well<00:01:28.470> including

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
couple other options as well including

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.830 
couple other options as well including
being<00:01:29.190> able<00:01:29.399> to<00:01:29.490> record<00:01:29.729> audio<00:01:29.940> or<00:01:30.390> just<00:01:30.630> mute

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
being able to record audio or just mute

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.960 
being able to record audio or just mute
it<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.140> it's<00:01:31.289> video<00:01:31.440> alone<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.819> can

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
it so it's video alone and you can

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
frames per second whereas when we were

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.400

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
running shadow play it only went down to

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.839 
running shadow play it only went down to
ninety<00:03:03.709> two<00:03:03.830> and<00:03:03.980> a<00:03:04.040> half<00:03:04.220> which<00:03:04.550> is<00:03:04.670> really

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
ninety two and a half which is really

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:06.490 
ninety two and a half which is really
only<00:03:05.030> about<00:03:05.300> a<00:03:05.360> six<00:03:05.599> percent<00:03:05.900> decrease<00:03:06.230> which

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
only about a six percent decrease which

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.440 
only about a six percent decrease which
is<00:03:06.620> really<00:03:06.890> good<00:03:07.099> considering<00:03:07.580> now<00:03:08.150> of<00:03:08.269> course

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450
