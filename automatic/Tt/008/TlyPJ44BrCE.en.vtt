cover<00:02:04.330> them<00:02:04.540> just<00:02:04.750> a<00:02:04.840> little<00:02:04.870> bit<00:02:05.200> so<00:02:05.350> the

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
cover them just a little bit so the

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.650 
cover them just a little bit so the
edges<00:02:05.890> are<00:02:06.040> covered<00:02:06.250> and<00:02:06.610> it's<00:02:07.090> not<00:02:07.270> just<00:02:07.540> all

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
edges are covered and it's not just all

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.570 
edges are covered and it's not just all
of<00:02:07.780> a<00:02:07.840> sudden<00:02:08.140> flat<00:02:08.470> and<00:02:08.770> then<00:02:09.220> I'm<00:02:09.369> gonna

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
of a sudden flat and then I'm gonna

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.150 
of a sudden flat and then I'm gonna
leave<00:02:09.790> it<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:10.119> just<00:02:10.540> sit<00:02:10.780> here<00:02:10.810> and<00:02:11.350> cure<00:02:11.860> and

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
leave it to just sit here and cure and

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.690 
leave it to just sit here and cure and
it<00:02:12.310> takes<00:02:12.670> about<00:02:14.190> 25<00:02:15.190> minutes<00:02:15.610> so<00:02:17.490> once<00:02:18.490> that's

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
it takes about 25 minutes so once that's

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.090 
it takes about 25 minutes so once that's
cured<00:02:19.330> I<00:02:19.510> will<00:02:19.840> unmold<00:02:20.380> it<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:20.590> we<00:02:20.770> can<00:02:20.920> see
