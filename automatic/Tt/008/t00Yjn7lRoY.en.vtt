00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.000
 Of course we want to cook 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.630

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.869
 mozzarella in many small pieces and 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.590

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.210

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.920
 and serving we can see is that 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.520
 whole really easy to imitate and 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.259

 We also immediately on the main course 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.940

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.769
 Let's just take one 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.640

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:17.160

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.489
 rub in 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.760
 is this going on let's take a few 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.470
 bacon strips to hand gradually 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.239
 let's develop the chicken meat 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.930
 and make a nice one 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.930
 bacon coat 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.960
 then we give it all in one 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.400
 pan with a little oil and kicked it short 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.400
 something from both sides 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.360
 Immediately afterwards we give the chickens 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.430
 sticks in a baking form and game them for 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.550
 ten minutes at 300 degrees in the 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.550
 oven 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.129
 meanwhile, we take a lot of each other 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.099
 make vegetables and cut so 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:18.200
 spring onions zucchini and also one 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.200
 a few chillies in bite-sized snacks 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.049
 We will put everything together in one 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:27.420
 salt the pan with a little oil and pepper 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.109
 the whole and then always stir 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.109
 hardworking around 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.819
 combination of fresh crunchy 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:46.349
 vegetables and juicy chicken sticks is 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:46.349
 simply indescribably delicious 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.320
 Now we can get ready for the dessert 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.420
 fall where we almost clean today at the 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.540
 you can really eat everything from 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.890
 content to the bowl with the 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.080
 We want to prepare the bowl 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.360
 We'll start immediately 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.850
 a white cook chocolate and chop 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.190
 this little fine pieces in parallel 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.650
 let's prepare the water bath for 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.540
 We take the chocolate to the chocolate 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.310
 Give us some water at the cooking pot 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.739
 Add and bring this to less 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.299
 flame to the mind and after a few 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.959
 minutes, the whole thing is really nice 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.959
 molten 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.180
 with this beautiful liquid consistency 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.520
 we can paper on a bug and 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.380
 make circles 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.740
 These then serve as the bottom of the 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.740
 key 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.200
 then we take one 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.030
 Balloon and also enjoy to over 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.470
 the middle in the chocolate mass and 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.570
 then put him out on the circle 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.460
 The chocolate bowl must now be for 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.410
 some time to be cold with it 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.240
 the chocolate can evaluate 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.070
 In the meantime we can look around 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.480
 Take care of the filling of the bowl 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.910
 Now we take dark ones 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:59.620
 bitter chocolate and may drift of 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:01.720
 two small pieces in fine raspe the 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.700
 We'll give you the remaining chocolate pieces 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.600
 back in a water bath and bring that 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.600
 whole to melt 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.070
 We now have to take the liquid mass for 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.390
 make some time cold with it 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:24.980
 chocolate is just more hand warm 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:28.300
 meanwhile we separate from two things 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.300
 white and yellow 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.889
 to egg white we now go a tablespoon 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:45.599
 to be able to butter so much the whole 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:45.599
 we rise with a stirrer 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.620
 if the whole then stuff enough 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:06:05.620
 we can then become with ours 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:08.259
 extreme testing where do we take ourselves 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.830
 100 milliliters cream and beat as well 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:10.830
 this tax 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:18.220
 The egg yolk we give now also about 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:21.750
 add a tablespoon of butter sugar and 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.750
 also a knife-tip cinnamon 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:26.949
 then neither will grab us that 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:29.080
 hand mixer and stir the whole thing 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:31.650
 long until a nice creamy mass 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.650
 created 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.150
 Now is the moment where we have the 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:47.389
 give all ingredients together for first 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:49.699
 We hand warm chocolate egg yolk 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:53.270
 To add mass, we stir then 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:54.979
 a whisk to the equation as 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:07:00.680
 Next we go fast and 

00:06:54.979 --> 00:07:02.870
 stir this too last but not least 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:06.289
 Follow the cream and the fine 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.880
 Feeling and thinking viol can also 

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:09.710
 this again nice and good 

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.320
 so that is also the mousse au 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:13.820
 chocolat already finished this we go 

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.500
 now for some time in the 

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.570
 fridge making it a typical 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.280
 can maintain consistency when the 

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:21.020
 chocolate or chocolate bowls 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.789
 cured you can this again 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:26.259
 to take a hand and with a knife the 

00:07:22.789 --> 00:07:26.259
 to make the balloon burst 

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.569
 this will take you away 

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:35.379
 the bowl and now gives the pattern 

00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:35.379
 add chocolate 

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:45.910
 as a coronation could now even some white 

00:07:43.659 --> 00:07:47.380
 resting chocolate up 

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:49.090
 I wish you good luck 

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:51.010
