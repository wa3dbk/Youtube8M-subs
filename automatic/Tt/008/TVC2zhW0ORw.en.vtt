00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello now i will show you how 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.080
 to cook 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.940
 catchy floating nozzle for this 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.950
 we will need foam plastic foam 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.730
 can be any size 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.540
 any color it will all depend on 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.160
 fishing conditions 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.550
 I have one at the moment 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:24.119
 foam for this we still need 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.000
 semolina so on this nozzle like the whole 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.560
 peaceful fish successfully caught especially 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.560
 successfully caught carp crucian bream 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:37.649
 so for this we need it now 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:42.239
 now we will prepare the dough out 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:44.730
 proportions 1 tablespoon of water and one 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.500
 the dining room is incomplete so are they from the hill 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:52.079
 tablespoon monkey 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:55.160
 so let's start showing how it's done 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:01.609
 logically i poured 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.609
 tablespoon of water and boil 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:11.880
 all the water boiled here pour pour pour 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.009
 little by little 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:21.509
 mommy and begin to knead the best 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:26.190
 turn on the gas carefully knead the spoon 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.190
 because the hot consistency of us 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.690
 first we wash the spoon and then take the holy 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.690
 we will knead 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.690
 by hand 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:48.110
 knead the dough well into 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.390
 This stage can be flavored. 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.299
 add flavor and you can 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.560
 had to do when we were preparing our 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.560
 dough still in the ladle 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.960
 Next, open the small pieces from 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:08.459
 of our test we form such a cake 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.619
 and roll there foam larger than 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.200
 foam is correspondingly larger than ours 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.850
 nozzle smaller foam less our 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:20.120
 nozzle in qatar foam in the dough and 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.120
 we put on 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.430
 needle that is, we do not have. 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:31.049
 difficult red folded in half possible 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.739
 any thread so formed to 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:39.269
 the sock was 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:41.730
 round nozzle ready in the right for us 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:45.150
 quantity it may be several 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.760
 garlands of forest are not made for the future and 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.670
 doing that was enough for one fishing so 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.470
 as I add all sorts of flavors 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.010
 vegetable oils additives on, etc. and 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.500
 etc. 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.250
 and there is a danger that they 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.109
 spoil 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.109
 do as it were a day before fishing 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.560
 the distance between us to be on the 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:09.510
 such a 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:10.970
 so when we cut the string we could 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.510
 free 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:19.160
 tie our nozzle on 2 3 knots 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.160
 Now I will show how it looks 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.040
 tied a knot on three knots approximately 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.870
 this is how it will look 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.549
 the advantage of floating nozzles is that 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.970
 it can be successfully caught among 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:35.430
 obstacles such as stones when strong 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.670
 declared bottom let's say on herbal 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.700
 carpet and in general will have a nozzle 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.400
 a number of its advantages 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.080
 every fisherman himself will understand and find the right 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.129
 place and time for applying this 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.220
 thank you everyone thank you watch my videos
