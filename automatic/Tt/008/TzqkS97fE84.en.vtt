00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.410 
anymore they just a solid bone with
screws<00:03:08.409> in<00:03:08.560> there<00:03:08.709> so<00:03:09.489> freestyle<00:03:10.180> was<00:03:10.390> a

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
screws in there so freestyle was a

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.880 
screws in there so freestyle was a
little<00:03:10.659> bit<00:03:10.780> to<00:03:10.930> punishing<00:03:11.290> for<00:03:11.560> my<00:03:11.650> foot

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
little bit to punishing for my foot

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.210 
little bit to punishing for my foot
after<00:03:12.760> that<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:13.330> I<00:03:13.510> decided<00:03:13.900> that<00:03:14.099> seeing<00:03:15.099> as

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
after that and I decided that seeing as

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.009 
after that and I decided that seeing as
slalom<00:03:15.640> was<00:03:15.760> having<00:03:15.970> a<00:03:16.030> big<00:03:16.209> resurgence<00:03:16.540> and

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
slalom was having a big resurgence and

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.309 
slalom was having a big resurgence and
now<00:03:17.560> there's<00:03:17.830> no<00:03:17.980> Supercross<00:03:18.549> any<00:03:18.760> more

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
now there's no Supercross any more

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.720 
now there's no Supercross any more
slalom<00:03:20.319> was<00:03:20.560> probably<00:03:20.799> a<00:03:20.860> good<00:03:20.890> way<00:03:21.129> to<00:03:21.189> go<00:03:21.430> so

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
slalom was probably a good way to go so

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.869 
slalom was probably a good way to go so
last<00:03:22.150> year<00:03:22.330> I<00:03:22.629> came<00:03:22.750> 15th<00:03:23.409> on<00:03:23.620> the<00:03:23.709> tour<00:03:23.920> not<00:03:24.849> a

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
last year I came 15th on the tour not a

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.089 
last year I came 15th on the tour not a
bad<00:03:25.150> start<00:03:25.450> for<00:03:25.599> my<00:03:25.810> first<00:03:26.080> year<00:03:26.409> on<00:03:26.470> slalom

00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:27.099 
bad start for my first year on slalom

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:28.860 
bad start for my first year on slalom
and<00:03:27.250> the<00:03:27.610> first<00:03:27.879> year<00:03:28.090> back<00:03:28.209> from<00:03:28.480> two<00:03:28.720> years

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
and the first year back from two years

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.660 
and the first year back from two years
of<00:03:29.080> injury<00:03:29.379> but<00:03:30.040> this<00:03:30.280> year<00:03:30.519> I've<00:03:30.640> been

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
of injury but this year I've been

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.339 
of injury but this year I've been
training<00:03:31.090> hard<00:03:31.420> and<00:03:31.599> we've<00:03:31.750> been<00:03:31.870> working<00:03:32.049> on

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
training hard and we've been working on

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.410 
training hard and we've been working on
the<00:03:32.470> new<00:03:32.620> boards<00:03:33.040> and<00:03:33.250> new<00:03:33.790> fins<00:03:34.090> and<00:03:34.299> we've

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
the new boards and new fins and we've

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.240 
the new boards and new fins and we've
got<00:03:34.569> two<00:03:34.720> new<00:03:34.870> sales<00:03:35.080> too<00:03:35.379> so<00:03:35.650> I<00:03:35.860> think

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
got two new sales too so I think

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.619 
got two new sales too so I think
everything's<00:03:36.670> looking<00:03:36.849> good<00:03:37.150> for<00:03:37.360> me<00:03:37.420> to<00:03:37.510> give

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 
everything's looking good for me to give

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:38.910 
everything's looking good for me to give
it<00:03:37.720> a<00:03:37.750> good<00:03:37.870> push<00:03:38.140> this<00:03:38.319> year<00:03:38.590> and<00:03:38.769> hopefully

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
it a good push this year and hopefully

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.440 
it a good push this year and hopefully
get<00:03:39.189> into<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.489> top<00:03:39.670> ten<00:03:39.879> or<00:03:40.060> maybe<00:03:40.209> even<00:03:40.269> the

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
get into the top ten or maybe even the

00:03:40.450 --> 00:04:12.790 
get into the top ten or maybe even the
top<00:03:40.629> five

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.890 

bye
