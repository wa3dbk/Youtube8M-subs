 if you like one of the designs and do it to me 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.260
 know in the comments and we started with 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.199
 the video for the first design we are going to 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.780
 need a white enamel and see 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.270
 only and lie down protective in your 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.399
 protective shine and as the first step 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.530
 you will always apply a base 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.119
 protective this helps us protect the 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.830
 nail enamel that we are going to put 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.380
 above and also so that we are not 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.810
 they put yellow 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:15.500
 then you will paint your nails with a 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.470
 white shelf and I like to put on 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.479
 a cardboard we are going to put the enamel 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.970
 that I will be using and with the pointer 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.789
 of Georgia scribble remember that if not 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.549
 you have a pointer you can use a pin 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:30.770
 for my middle and middle finger thumb 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.090
 I wanted to put some letters that mean 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.880

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.710
