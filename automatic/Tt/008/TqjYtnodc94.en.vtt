to clarify right now is dedicated

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.510 
to clarify right now is dedicated
servers<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.240> not<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:40.020> magic<00:01:40.380> bullet<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:41.189> fix

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520

latency problems please understand that

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.889 
latency problems please understand that
just<00:01:44.640> because<00:01:44.700> they're<00:01:45.060> putting<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.329> late<00:01:45.540> or

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
going to put it in certain locations

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.610 
going to put it in certain locations
because<00:02:18.239> they're<00:02:18.450> extremely<00:02:18.930> expensive<00:02:19.379> to

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
because they're extremely expensive to

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.550 
because they're extremely expensive to
put<00:02:19.920> in<00:02:20.329> by<00:02:21.329> using<00:02:21.599> the<00:02:21.840> cloud<00:02:22.079> servers

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
put in by using the cloud servers

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.380 
put in by using the cloud servers
through<00:02:22.709> Microsoft<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.519> by<00:02:23.609> using<00:02:23.849> the

PlayStation Network it definitely

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:29.089 
PlayStation Network it definitely
alleviates<00:02:28.349> a<00:02:28.470> lot<00:02:28.500> of<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:28.799> trouble<00:02:29.040> of

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
alleviates a lot of the trouble of

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.039 
alleviates a lot of the trouble of
having<00:02:29.189> to<00:02:29.370> do<00:02:29.519> that<00:02:29.760> through<00:02:29.939> because<00:02:30.930> they

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
having to do that through because they

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.119 
having to do that through because they
don't<00:02:31.230> have<00:02:31.260> to<00:02:31.470> build<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.799> data<00:02:31.950> center

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
don't have to build the data center

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.309 
don't have to build the data center
themselves<00:02:32.730> but<00:02:33.150> they<00:02:33.329> still<00:02:33.569> have<00:02:33.629> them<00:02:34.140> in

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
themselves but they still have them in

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.110 
themselves but they still have them in
select<00:02:34.799> locations<00:02:34.829> or<00:02:35.370> not<00:02:35.489> in<00:02:35.640> every<00:02:35.849> city

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
select locations or not in every city

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.759 
select locations or not in every city
it's<00:02:36.329> just<00:02:36.510> not<00:02:36.629> the<00:02:36.720> way<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:36.930> works<00:02:36.959> so

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
it's just not the way it works so

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.289 
it's just not the way it works so
something<00:02:38.099> else<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.340> want<00:02:38.549> to<00:02:38.579> explain<00:02:39.060> real

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
something else I want to explain real

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.119 
something else I want to explain real
quick<00:02:39.510> is<00:02:39.659> how<00:02:40.260> your<00:02:40.620> internet<00:02:40.980> speed

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
quick is how your internet speed

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.610 
quick is how your internet speed
actually<00:02:41.939> works<00:02:42.180> too<00:02:42.780> when<00:02:42.900> people<00:02:42.930> have<00:02:43.349> no

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
actually works too when people have no

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.890 
actually works too when people have no
clue<00:02:43.889> what<00:02:44.069> they're<00:02:44.159> in<00:02:44.280> at<00:02:44.430> speed<00:02:44.549> is<00:02:45.060> your

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
clue what they're in at speed is your

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.589 
clue what they're in at speed is your
bandwidth<00:02:46.700> which<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:47.909> your<00:02:48.120> upload<00:02:48.420> and

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
bandwidth which is your upload and

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.960 
bandwidth which is your upload and
download<00:02:48.689> is<00:02:49.079> not<00:02:49.950> your<00:02:50.250> internet<00:02:50.549> speed<00:02:50.669> at

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
download is not your internet speed at

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.229 
download is not your internet speed at
all<00:02:51.120> think<00:02:51.959> about<00:02:52.139> it<00:02:52.260> like<00:02:52.349> a<00:02:52.409> conveyor<00:02:52.889> belt

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
all think about it like a conveyor belt

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.809 
all think about it like a conveyor belt
the<00:02:54.239> boxes<00:02:54.810> on<00:02:55.049> the<00:02:55.349> conveyor<00:02:55.680> belt<00:02:55.950> is<00:02:56.189> your

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
the boxes on the conveyor belt is your

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.089 
the boxes on the conveyor belt is your
bandwidth<00:02:57.299> that<00:02:57.510> is<00:02:57.689> how<00:02:57.870> much<00:02:58.260> can<00:02:58.680> travel<00:02:58.919> at

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
bandwidth that is how much can travel at

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.429 
bandwidth that is how much can travel at
one<00:02:59.220> time<00:02:59.400> whether<00:02:59.700> it's<00:02:59.939> 10<00:03:00.569> mega<00:03:00.840> bets<00:03:01.109> down

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:01.439 
one time whether it's 10 mega bets down

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:04.460 
one time whether it's 10 mega bets down
a<00:03:01.859> hundred<00:03:02.280> megabits<00:03:02.909> down<00:03:03.150> whatever<00:03:04.019> that's

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
a hundred megabits down whatever that's

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.339 
a hundred megabits down whatever that's
your<00:03:04.709> bandwidth<00:03:05.189> the<00:03:05.609> speed<00:03:06.030> is<00:03:06.269> the<00:03:06.689> actual

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
your bandwidth the speed is the actual

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.170 
your bandwidth the speed is the actual
speed<00:03:08.220> at<00:03:08.370> which<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.549> conveyor<00:03:08.849> belt<00:03:09.060> is

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
speed at which the conveyor belt is

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.390 
speed at which the conveyor belt is
moving<00:03:09.329> or<00:03:09.780> your<00:03:10.049> latency<00:03:10.409> measured<00:03:10.950> in<00:03:11.069> pink

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
moving or your latency measured in pink

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.610 
moving or your latency measured in pink
so<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.120> could<00:03:12.359> have<00:03:12.389> a<00:03:12.569> fiber<00:03:13.470> optic

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
so you could have a fiber optic

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.069 
so you could have a fiber optic
connection<00:03:14.400> running<00:03:14.970> a<00:03:15.030> hundred<00:03:15.329> up<00:03:15.450> 100<00:03:15.900> down

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
bandwidth does not affect your speed at

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.530 
bandwidth does not affect your speed at
all<00:03:25.799> so<00:03:26.519> it<00:03:26.639> doesn't<00:03:26.879> matter<00:03:27.030> how<00:03:27.180> much<00:03:27.359> you're

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
all so it doesn't matter how much you're

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.420 
all so it doesn't matter how much you're
spending<00:03:27.629> per<00:03:28.049> month<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:28.709> try<00:03:28.949> and<00:03:29.069> have<00:03:29.250> this

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
spending per month to try and have this

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.129 
spending per month to try and have this
super<00:03:29.699> upload<00:03:30.269> and<00:03:30.419> download<00:03:30.540> it's<00:03:30.930> not

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
super upload and download it's not

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.530

changing<00:03:31.530> at<00:03:31.650> all<00:03:31.739> and<00:03:32.669> also<00:03:32.849> with<00:03:33.120> that<00:03:33.299> goes

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
changing at all and also with that goes

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.899 
changing at all and also with that goes
into<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:34.019> fact<00:03:34.260> that<00:03:34.379> if<00:03:34.680> you've<00:03:35.280> got<00:03:35.519> really

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
into the fact that if you've got really

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.780 
into the fact that if you've got really

nat<00:03:43.650> routing<00:03:44.069> on<00:03:44.220> it<00:03:44.370> so<00:03:44.549> that<00:03:44.579> you<00:03:44.760> always

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
have a moderate NAT it doesn't matter

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
you're still going to have a little bit

you're still going to have a little bit

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
of lag it doesn't matter that's just the

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.390

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:25.409 
their actual connection speeds so that

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.710 
their actual connection speeds so that
everyone

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
everyone

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.590 
everyone
matched<00:04:26.050> up<00:04:26.230> equally<00:04:26.650> now<00:04:27.550> what<00:04:28.120> dedicated

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
matched up equally now what dedicated

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
servers will do is that will eliminate

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.580 
servers will do is that will eliminate
that<00:04:30.880> host<00:04:31.270> advantage<00:04:32.020> and<00:04:32.230> it<00:04:32.440> will

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
that host advantage and it will

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.710 
that host advantage and it will
eliminate<00:04:32.830> host<00:04:33.400> migration<00:04:33.730> because<00:04:34.360> there's

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
eliminate host migration because there's

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.390 
eliminate host migration because there's
nobody<00:04:34.900> hosting<00:04:35.500> a<00:04:35.590> dedicated<00:04:35.950> server<00:04:36.130> isn't

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
nobody hosting a dedicated server isn't

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.910 
nobody hosting a dedicated server isn't

running an instance of the game like a

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.010 
running an instance of the game like a
listen<00:04:39.820> server<00:04:39.970> in<00:04:40.150> your<00:04:40.360> xbox<00:04:40.540> it's<00:04:40.870> not

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
listen server in your xbox it's not

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.050 
listen server in your xbox it's not
running<00:04:41.260> a<00:04:41.440> copy<00:04:41.650> of<00:04:41.770> the<00:04:41.890> game<00:04:42.040> with<00:04:42.280> it<00:04:42.460> it's

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
running a copy of the game with it it's

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.520 
running a copy of the game with it it's
just<00:04:43.360> running<00:04:43.660> the<00:04:43.690> data<00:04:43.990> and<00:04:44.170> passing<00:04:44.470> it

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
just running the data and passing it

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.260 
just running the data and passing it
back<00:04:44.710> and<00:04:44.860> forth<00:04:45.100> so<00:04:45.520> it<00:04:45.610> doesn't<00:04:45.880> have<00:04:46.000> to<00:04:46.090> try

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
back and forth so it doesn't have to try

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.480 
back and forth so it doesn't have to try
and<00:04:46.390> handle<00:04:46.570> all<00:04:46.870> the<00:04:47.140> load<00:04:47.380> that<00:04:47.740> a<00:04:48.100> listen

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
and handle all the load that a listen

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.650 
and handle all the load that a listen
server<00:04:48.670> does<00:04:49.710> so<00:04:50.710> basically<00:04:51.010> to<00:04:51.250> reiterate

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660

people I having hacked it because then

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:22.740 
people I having hacked it because then
it<00:06:21.490> doesn't<00:06:21.610> matter<00:06:21.700> if<00:06:21.880> they<00:06:22.030> run<00:06:22.180> a<00:06:22.210> jtagged
