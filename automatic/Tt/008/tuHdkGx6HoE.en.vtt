wrapping<00:02:21.530> your<00:02:21.620> dubbing<00:02:21.950> line<00:02:22.100> and<00:02:22.930> then<00:02:23.930> I'm

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
wrapping your dubbing line and then I'm

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.680 
wrapping your dubbing line and then I'm
going<00:02:24.140> to<00:02:24.200> work<00:02:24.410> back<00:02:24.650> to<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:24.920> back<00:02:25.690> one

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
going to work back to the back one

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.510 
going to work back to the back one
technique<00:02:27.230> on<00:02:27.470> this<00:02:27.740> that<00:02:27.980> I<00:02:28.010> found<00:02:28.340> that

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
technique on this that I found that

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.250 
technique on this that I found that
works<00:02:28.730> really<00:02:28.850> well<00:02:29.090> when<00:02:29.420> I<00:02:29.450> first<00:02:29.840> started

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
works really well when I first started

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.700 
works really well when I first started
tying<00:02:30.530> it<00:02:30.800> I<00:02:31.010> didn't

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
tying it I didn't

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.420 
tying it I didn't
to<00:02:31.920> tie<00:02:32.100> it<00:02:32.160> with<00:02:32.370> a<00:02:32.430> dubbing<00:02:32.880> loop<00:02:32.960> now<00:02:33.960> I<00:02:33.990> tie

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
to tie it with a dubbing loop now I tie

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.890 
to tie it with a dubbing loop now I tie

pretty<00:02:54.480> simple<00:02:58.040> we're<00:02:59.040> gonna<00:02:59.330> use<00:03:00.330> your<00:03:00.480> tool

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
pretty simple we're gonna use your tool

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.220 
pretty simple we're gonna use your tool
you're<00:03:01.050> gonna<00:03:01.170> make<00:03:01.440> a<00:03:01.470> loop<00:03:02.570> and<00:03:03.570> try<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:03.870> get

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
you're gonna make a loop and try to get

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.200 
you're gonna make a loop and try to get
this<00:03:04.350> at<00:03:04.560> a<00:03:04.620> good<00:03:04.800> camera<00:03:05.190> angle<00:03:05.280> here<00:03:05.580> you're

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
this at a good camera angle here you're

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.300 
this at a good camera angle here you're
gonna<00:03:06.360> make<00:03:06.480> a<00:03:06.510> couple<00:03:06.930> loops<00:03:07.620> around<00:03:07.950> there

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
gonna make a couple loops around there

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.470 
gonna make a couple loops around there
tie<00:03:08.970> that<00:03:09.150> down<00:03:09.210> sing<00:03:09.780> say<00:03:10.320> you<00:03:10.380> have<00:03:10.590> a<00:03:10.620> nice

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
tie that down sing say you have a nice

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.630 
tie that down sing say you have a nice
and<00:03:12.480> have<00:03:12.630> a<00:03:12.660> nice<00:03:12.900> loop<00:03:13.170> here<00:03:13.380> that's<00:03:13.640> dubbed

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
and have a nice loop here that's dubbed

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.270 
and have a nice loop here that's dubbed
your<00:03:14.910> dubbing<00:03:15.360> into<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:15.900> then<00:03:16.890> when<00:03:17.070> your

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
your dubbing into and then when your

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.520 
your dubbing into and then when your
thread<00:03:17.460> to<00:03:17.490> the<00:03:17.670> end<00:03:17.820> and<00:03:18.060> then<00:03:18.930> I'm<00:03:19.050> gonna<00:03:19.200> put

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
thread to the end and then I'm gonna put

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.490 
thread to the end and then I'm gonna put
my<00:03:19.740> dubbing<00:03:20.160> in<00:03:20.550> between<00:03:21.180> this<00:03:21.480> loop<00:03:21.780> I'm

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
my dubbing in between this loop I'm

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.820 
my dubbing in between this loop I'm
going<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.710> spread<00:03:23.010> it<00:03:23.070> out<00:03:23.310> here<00:03:23.870> you<00:03:24.870> can<00:03:25.020> use

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
going to spread it out here you can use

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:26.900 
going to spread it out here you can use
it<00:03:25.920> at<00:03:26.040> your<00:03:26.070> hand<00:03:26.310> or<00:03:26.400> gonna<00:03:26.520> stop<00:03:26.730> talking

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
it at your hand or gonna stop talking

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:38.839 
it at your hand or gonna stop talking
here<00:03:27.180> for<00:03:27.330> a<00:03:27.360> second<00:03:27.630> so

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.849 

okay<00:03:39.599> you're<00:03:39.870> going<00:03:39.989> to<00:03:40.140> get<00:03:40.290> your<00:03:40.439> dubbing<00:03:40.739> in

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
okay you're going to get your dubbing in

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:42.110 
okay you're going to get your dubbing in
between<00:03:41.219> the<00:03:41.340> loop<00:03:41.489> like<00:03:41.640> that<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:42.030> all

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
between the loop like that and all

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.379 
between the loop like that and all
you're<00:03:42.329> gonna<00:03:42.450> do<00:03:42.689> is<00:03:42.719> twist<00:03:43.260> it<00:03:43.849> by<00:03:44.849> twisting

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
you're gonna do is twist it by twisting

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.080 
you're gonna do is twist it by twisting
it<00:03:45.510> like<00:03:45.540> this<00:03:45.900> it<00:03:46.650> turns<00:03:47.249> the<00:03:47.459> dubbing<00:03:47.790> into

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
it like this it turns the dubbing into

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.690 
it like this it turns the dubbing into
like<00:03:48.299> a<00:03:48.329> rope<00:03:48.749> and<00:03:49.129> it<00:03:50.129> makes<00:03:50.280> it<00:03:50.430> a<00:03:50.489> lot

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
like a rope and it makes it a lot

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.330 
like a rope and it makes it a lot
stronger<00:03:51.090> if<00:03:51.569> you<00:03:51.749> do<00:03:52.139> not<00:03:52.409> twist<00:03:52.769> it<00:03:53.010> up<00:03:53.099> like

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
stronger if you do not twist it up like

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.910 
stronger if you do not twist it up like
this<00:03:53.579> your<00:03:54.420> fly<00:03:54.719> won't<00:03:54.959> last<00:03:55.230> as<00:03:55.530> long<00:03:55.709> you'll

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
this your fly won't last as long you'll

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.759 
this your fly won't last as long you'll
catch<00:03:56.129> a<00:03:56.250> lot<00:03:56.280> more<00:03:56.609> fish<00:03:57.090> if<00:03:57.389> you<00:03:58.109> twist<00:03:58.530> it

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
catch a lot more fish if you twist it

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.890 
catch a lot more fish if you twist it
into<00:03:58.950> this<00:03:59.189> dubbing<00:03:59.579> loop<00:03:59.609> your<00:04:00.389> fly<00:04:00.659> will

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
into this dubbing loop your fly will

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.789 
into this dubbing loop your fly will
last<00:04:01.139> a<00:04:01.349> lot<00:04:01.500> longer<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:04.200> dubbing<00:04:04.560> won't

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
last a lot longer and the dubbing won't

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.800 
last a lot longer and the dubbing won't
come<00:04:05.010> off<00:04:05.040> of<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.579> off<00:04:06.209> of<00:04:06.419> the<00:04:06.480> hook<00:04:06.629> as

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
come off of the off of the hook as

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.649 
come off of the off of the hook as
easily

00:04:08.649 --> 00:04:08.659 
easily

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:11.390 
easily
okay<00:04:09.689> you<00:04:10.109> still<00:04:10.319> got<00:04:10.469> to<00:04:10.560> dub<00:04:10.859> it<00:04:10.889> just<00:04:11.280> a

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
okay you still got to dub it just a

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.949 
okay you still got to dub it just a
little<00:04:11.700> bit<00:04:11.849> you<00:04:12.000> can<00:04:12.120> twist<00:04:12.389> it<00:04:12.540> on<00:04:12.719> there

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
little bit you can twist it on there

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.089 
little bit you can twist it on there
make<00:04:13.889> it<00:04:13.919> a<00:04:14.040> little<00:04:14.280> bit<00:04:14.519> tighter<00:04:14.790> on<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.060> hook

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:16.099 
make it a little bit tighter on the hook

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:18.219 
make it a little bit tighter on the hook
and<00:04:17.099> then<00:04:17.250> once<00:04:17.459> you<00:04:17.579> have<00:04:17.699> your<00:04:17.759> dubbing<00:04:18.180> loop

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
and then once you have your dubbing loop

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.930 
and then once you have your dubbing loop
all<00:04:19.229> you<00:04:19.470> do<00:04:19.650> is<00:04:19.949> start<00:04:20.310> wrapping<00:04:20.759> that<00:04:20.880> around

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
all you do is start wrapping that around

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.800 
all you do is start wrapping that around
the<00:04:21.329> hook<00:04:23.060> wrapping<00:04:24.060> it<00:04:24.150> from<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.449> front<00:04:24.690> to

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
the hook wrapping it from the front to

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.070 
the hook wrapping it from the front to
the<00:04:24.870> back<00:04:26.330> and<00:04:27.330> this<00:04:28.139> is<00:04:28.199> imitating<00:04:29.190> a<00:04:29.280> larva

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
the back and this is imitating a larva

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.719 
the back and this is imitating a larva
it's<00:04:31.080> not<00:04:31.289> a<00:04:31.320> really<00:04:31.680> thick<00:04:31.919> larva

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
it's not a really thick larva

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:34.820 
it's not a really thick larva
so<00:04:33.509> you<00:04:33.599> don't<00:04:33.810> want<00:04:33.990> to<00:04:34.080> wrap<00:04:34.229> it<00:04:34.259> on<00:04:34.500> real

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
so you don't want to wrap it on real

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.589 
so you don't want to wrap it on real
thick<00:04:35.099> just<00:04:35.880> side<00:04:36.180> by<00:04:36.389> side<00:04:36.660> the<00:04:37.110> whole<00:04:37.320> way<00:04:37.349> up

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:38.599 
thick just side by side the whole way up

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:42.469 
thick just side by side the whole way up
not<00:04:39.599> really<00:04:39.780> ever<00:04:40.080> lapping<00:04:40.940> but<00:04:41.940> you<00:04:42.060> see<00:04:42.240> also

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
not really ever lapping but you see also

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.450 
not really ever lapping but you see also
with<00:04:42.810> this<00:04:42.990> dubbing<00:04:43.409> loop<00:04:43.440> that's<00:04:44.220> gonna

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
with this dubbing loop that's gonna

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.610 
with this dubbing loop that's gonna
create<00:04:44.729> a<00:04:44.849> lot<00:04:45.120> of<00:04:45.360> like<00:04:45.599> a<00:04:45.630> hairy<00:04:46.020> look<00:04:46.320> here

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
create a lot of like a hairy look here

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.490 
create a lot of like a hairy look here
you<00:04:46.919> want<00:04:47.130> to<00:04:47.220> keep<00:04:47.400> that<00:04:47.580> hairy<00:04:47.909> look<00:04:48.180> I<00:04:48.500> found

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
you want to keep that hairy look I found

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.040 
you want to keep that hairy look I found
that<00:04:49.680> really<00:04:50.310> really<00:04:50.520> works<00:04:50.849> like<00:04:51.570> I<00:04:51.599> said<00:04:51.870> it

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
that really really works like I said it

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.550 
that really really works like I said it
also<00:04:52.320> imitates<00:04:52.949> ass<00:04:53.130> cut<00:04:53.400> pattern<00:04:53.639> and<00:04:54.560> this

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
also imitates ass cut pattern and this

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.170 
also imitates ass cut pattern and this
guide<00:04:55.860> have<00:04:56.070> a<00:04:56.099> lot<00:04:56.370> of<00:04:56.400> legs<00:04:56.669> on<00:04:56.909> the<00:04:57.030> bottom

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
guide have a lot of legs on the bottom

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.260 
guide have a lot of legs on the bottom
so<00:04:58.080> all<00:04:58.650> that<00:04:58.889> hair<00:04:59.130> sticking<00:04:59.430> out<00:04:59.669> just<00:05:00.120> kind

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
so all that hair sticking out just kind

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.480 
so all that hair sticking out just kind
of<00:05:00.479> represents<00:05:01.289> the<00:05:01.440> legs<00:05:01.650> on<00:05:01.919> the<00:05:01.949> on<00:05:02.340> the

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
of represents the legs on the on the

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.399 
of represents the legs on the on the
scud<00:05:02.729> pattern<00:05:04.130> also<00:05:05.130> I<00:05:05.400> use<00:05:05.789> this<00:05:06.409> early

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:07.409 
scud pattern also I use this early

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:09.890 
scud pattern also I use this early
season<00:05:07.620> like<00:05:08.039> on<00:05:08.250> the<00:05:08.370> stock<00:05:08.639> trout<00:05:08.940> just<00:05:09.330> kind

hold it up make a couple of loops around

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:45.439 
hold it up make a couple of loops around
their<00:05:39.979> cup<00:05:40.979> with<00:05:41.129> tight<00:05:41.310> loops<00:05:43.460> and<00:05:44.460> then
