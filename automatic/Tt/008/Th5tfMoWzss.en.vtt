stop it and then we can get back ok so
that's<00:02:40.000> one<00:02:40.150> way<00:02:40.299> you<00:02:40.359> can<00:02:40.510> deal<00:02:40.720> with<00:02:40.750> time

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
that's one way you can deal with time

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.530 
that's one way you can deal with time
the<00:02:41.890> bank<00:02:42.040> swinging<00:02:42.400> toward<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:42.819> use<00:02:43.329> it

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
the bank swinging toward you use it

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.270 
the bank swinging toward you use it
envisioned<00:02:44.170> as<00:02:44.290> opponent<00:02:44.680> attacking<00:02:45.069> you<00:02:45.159> and

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
envisioned as opponent attacking you and

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.220 
envisioned as opponent attacking you and
drop<00:02:45.909> them<00:02:46.060> with<00:02:46.209> that<00:02:46.359> cross<00:02:46.599> very<00:02:46.900> powerful

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
punch and again it's more powerful

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.360 
punch and again it's more powerful
because<00:02:48.879> they're<00:02:49.650> walking<00:02:50.650> into<00:02:50.769> it<00:02:50.980> and<00:02:51.129> your
