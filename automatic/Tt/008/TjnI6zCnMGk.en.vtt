00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.170
 Hello guys with you as usual dorik and 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.599
 today I will show you some more 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.400
 little mods for minecraft like you 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.379
 understood from the name of this video is a mini 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.150
 Fashion is an unusual review of mods where I 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.920
 I review one normal so big 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.869
 mod and release that I dedicate 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.029
 a few small mods 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.010
 let's start the first mod adds a lot 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.960
 new items but they have the same essence 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.630
 these are just buttons with different 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.030
 textures in 200 gold buttons and buttons 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.280
 of mud and buttons of lapis lazuli and 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.320
 of the world of ice even from coal there is a button from 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.270
 iron diamond brick button up 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.579
 brick button and button from redstone 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.739
 now wait a minute, I will install the resource pack 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.539
 and you will see that these buttons are compatible with 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.850
 different textures and here it is my favorite 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.950
 texture pack installed you can see 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.199
 that all textures were also transferred to 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.480
 these buttons for me so it will be useful 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.559
 for those who build different maps where 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.960
 will need to hide some 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.180
 a button and the player will have this button 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.219
 find currently craft recipes 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.500
 these buttons do not have but soon they 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.270
 appear as promised by the author of this mod well 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.549
 well we proceed to the next me 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.280
 mods 2 mods that I would like for you 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.930
 show this is just a horse search engine up 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.210
 there are such situations when you suddenly 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.580
 it took a horse and you want to find it 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.530
 but you do not know how to find it, and where the 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.479
 more so this mod adds one 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.640
 useless writing on the screen if you 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.009
 press the f9 button now this inscription 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.900
 says that there are no horses nearby 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.060
 let me sleep a horse somewhere 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.520
 and see how this label changes 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.320

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.579

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.280

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.160
