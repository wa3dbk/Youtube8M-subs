rocking<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.160> little<00:00:17.190> bit<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.520> gameplay<00:00:17.760> demo

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
rocking a little bit of gameplay demo

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.150 
rocking a little bit of gameplay demo
here<00:00:18.240> so<00:00:18.869> let's<00:00:19.470> get<00:00:19.590> into<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.859> game<00:00:19.980> if<00:00:20.130> we

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
here so let's get into the game if we

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.230 
here so let's get into the game if we
can<00:00:20.340> get<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.550> popped<00:00:20.730> up<00:00:20.880> on<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.060> big<00:00:21.210> screen
