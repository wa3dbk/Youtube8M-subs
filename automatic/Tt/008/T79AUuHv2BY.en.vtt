real<00:02:02.500> problem<00:02:02.890> sanitation<00:02:03.790> system<00:02:04.240> this<00:02:04.720> is

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
real problem sanitation system this is

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.190 
real problem sanitation system this is
the<00:02:05.050> hose<00:02:05.230> for<00:02:05.530> you<00:02:06.120> shields<00:02:07.120> also<00:02:07.450> offers<00:02:07.930> a

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
the hose for you shields also offers a

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.670 
the hose for you shields also offers a
series<00:02:08.619> of<00:02:09.539> fittings<00:02:10.539> which<00:02:11.140> are<00:02:11.290> designed

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
series of fittings which are designed

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.450 
series of fittings which are designed
primarily<00:02:11.920> for<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:12.760> plastic<00:02:13.240> hose<00:02:13.480> where

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
primarily for the plastic hose where

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.420 
primarily for the plastic hose where
this<00:02:15.030> hose<00:02:15.270> does<00:02:15.630> not<00:02:15.780> have<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.320> lot<00:02:16.500> of<00:02:16.530> give<00:02:17.220> in

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
this hose does not have a lot of give in

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.540 
this hose does not have a lot of give in
it<00:02:17.840> so<00:02:18.840> it's<00:02:19.050> difficult<00:02:19.290> to<00:02:19.680> get<00:02:19.860> many<00:02:20.130> barbed

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
it so it's difficult to get many barbed

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.190 
it so it's difficult to get many barbed
fittings<00:02:20.910> in<00:02:21.120> these<00:02:21.450> fittings<00:02:21.900> are<00:02:22.020> not

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
fittings in these fittings are not

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.710 
fittings in these fittings are not
barbed<00:02:22.710> you<00:02:23.280> put<00:02:23.520> them<00:02:23.730> in<00:02:23.940> you<00:02:24.330> might<00:02:24.480> want<00:02:24.690> to

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
barbed you put them in you might want to

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.230 
barbed you put them in you might want to
put<00:02:24.900> some<00:02:24.930> adhesive<00:02:25.170> on<00:02:25.710> it<00:02:25.740> some<00:02:26.520> PVC<00:02:26.880> cement

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
put some adhesive on it some PVC cement

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.870 
put some adhesive on it some PVC cement
on<00:02:27.600> it<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.900> make<00:02:28.050> sure<00:02:28.080> it<00:02:28.380> stays<00:02:28.650> there<00:02:29.010> but

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
on it to make sure it stays there but

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.110 
on it to make sure it stays there but
that<00:02:30.480> these<00:02:30.780> hoses<00:02:31.730> because<00:02:32.730> they're<00:02:32.910> less

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
that these hoses because they're less

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.210 
that these hoses because they're less
flexible<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:33.990> harder<00:02:34.410> to<00:02:34.530> get<00:02:34.680> a<00:02:34.710> fitting<00:02:35.070> in

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
flexible and harder to get a fitting in

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.690 
flexible and harder to get a fitting in
you<00:02:36.150> want<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.450> specify<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:37.380> shield<00:02:37.890> sanitation

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
you want to specify a shield sanitation

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.490 
you want to specify a shield sanitation
fitting<00:02:39.090> for<00:02:40.080> your<00:02:40.590> installation
