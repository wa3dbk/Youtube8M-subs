leather one I wanted the black suede one

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.869 
leather one I wanted the black suede one
so<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.320> decided<00:00:55.799> to<00:00:56.070> go<00:00:56.190> with<00:00:56.339> the<00:00:56.460> big<00:00:56.640> lita

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
so I decided to go with the big lita

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.359 
so I decided to go with the big lita
because<00:00:57.360> basically<00:00:57.960> they're<00:00:58.769> the<00:00:58.920> same<00:00:59.070> shoe

00:00:59.359 --> 00:00:59.369 
because basically they're the same shoe

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:01.039 
because basically they're the same shoe
I<00:00:59.400> don't<00:00:59.670> know<00:00:59.760> if<00:00:59.909> Jeffrey<00:01:00.239> Campbell<00:01:00.420> knock

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:01.049 
I don't know if Jeffrey Campbell knock

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:03.229 
I don't know if Jeffrey Campbell knock
them<00:01:01.470> off<00:01:01.710> or<00:01:02.040> who<00:01:02.250> came<00:01:02.460> up<00:01:02.670> with<00:01:02.850> them<00:01:02.970> first

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
them off or who came up with them first

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.320 
them off or who came up with them first
but<00:01:03.629> they<00:01:04.350> are<00:01:05.100> pretty<00:01:05.339> much<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.610> same<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.119> just

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
but they are pretty much the same I just

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.210 
but they are pretty much the same I just
think<00:01:06.450> these<00:01:06.659> are<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> little<00:01:06.990> bit<00:01:07.229> slimmer<00:01:07.590> but

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
think these are a little bit slimmer but

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.240 
think these are a little bit slimmer but
they<00:01:08.580> have<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.820> massive<00:01:09.560> platform<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
they have a massive platform in the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.550 
they have a massive platform in the
front<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.820> then<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.150> heel<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.690> massive<00:01:13.260> to

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
front and then the heel is massive to

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.090 
front and then the heel is massive to
let<00:01:14.490> me<00:01:14.580> measure<00:01:14.730> for<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.440> so<00:01:16.440> the<00:01:16.560> platform

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
let me measure for you so the platform

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.490 
let me measure for you so the platform
is<00:01:17.310> about<00:01:17.520> three<00:01:17.910> inches<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:19.020> heel<00:01:19.260> is
