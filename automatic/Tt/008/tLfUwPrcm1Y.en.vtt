immediately sound after a couple of

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.029 
immediately sound after a couple of
strides<00:00:31.330> there<00:00:32.140> been<00:00:32.289> any<00:00:32.410> problem<00:00:32.770> the<00:00:32.829> judge

strides there been any problem the judge

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:34.260 
strides there been any problem the judge
