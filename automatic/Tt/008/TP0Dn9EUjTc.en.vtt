00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
hi I'm Mike with plx devices up here to

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.700 
hi I'm Mike with plx devices up here to
actually<00:00:02.790> demonstrate<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.570> DM<00:00:03.810> 100<00:00:04.259> and<00:00:04.529> the

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
actually demonstrate the DM 100 and the

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.140 
actually demonstrate the DM 100 and the
DM<00:00:04.890> 200<00:00:05.430> in<00:00:06.140> 2004<00:00:07.140> Honda<00:00:07.560> s2000

follow<00:00:10.809> me

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:14.469 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.990 

now<00:00:15.469> here<00:00:15.679> you<00:00:15.830> can<00:00:15.950> see<00:00:16.010> an<00:00:16.189> array<00:00:16.430> of<00:00:16.460> gauges

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
now here you can see an array of gauges

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.800 
now here you can see an array of gauges
all<00:00:17.150> right<00:00:17.300> first<00:00:17.599> off<00:00:18.130> we<00:00:19.130> have<00:00:19.160> the<00:00:19.340> DM<00:00:20.270> 100

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:20.810 
all right first off we have the DM 100

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.839 
all right first off we have the DM 100
now<00:00:21.289> obviously<00:00:21.770> you<00:00:21.890> can<00:00:22.009> see<00:00:22.039> it<00:00:22.340> matches<00:00:22.520> the

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:22.849 
now obviously you can see it matches the

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.870 
now obviously you can see it matches the
dash<00:00:23.060> on<00:00:23.270> the<00:00:23.360> car<00:00:23.599> here<00:00:24.259> we<00:00:24.439> have<00:00:24.680> our<00:00:25.400> 60

this key fob controls every gauge in

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.400 
this key fob controls every gauge in
this<00:00:40.850> vehicle<00:00:41.030> right<00:00:41.330> now<00:00:41.390> and<00:00:42.019> you<00:00:42.199> can<00:00:42.320> do

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
this vehicle right now and you can do

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.009 
this vehicle right now and you can do
this<00:00:42.589> you<00:00:42.680> can<00:00:42.739> have<00:00:42.920> up<00:00:43.129> to<00:00:43.480> 16<00:00:44.480> gauges

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:45.019 
this you can have up to 16 gauges

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:47.619 
this you can have up to 16 gauges

control with one key fob basically it

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.539 
control with one key fob basically it
works<00:00:47.780> as<00:00:48.049> one's<00:00:48.470> a<00:00:48.589> master<00:00:48.920> the<00:00:49.190> others<00:00:49.400> are

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:49.549 
works as one's a master the others are

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:52.000 
works as one's a master the others are
slaves<00:00:50.049> let<00:00:51.049> me<00:00:51.140> fire<00:00:51.320> up<00:00:51.350> the<00:00:51.530> vehicle<00:00:51.860> for

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
slaves let me fire up the vehicle for

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.410 
slaves let me fire up the vehicle for
you<00:00:52.129> real<00:00:52.280> quick

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.420 

now<00:00:56.420> we're<00:00:56.570> getting<00:00:56.809> on<00:00:57.229> our<00:00:57.290> centre<00:00:58.220> gauge

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
now we're getting on our centre gauge

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.640 
now we're getting on our centre gauge
there<00:00:58.670> which<00:00:58.820> is<00:00:58.939> a<00:00:58.970> 60<00:00:59.449> millimeter<00:00:59.839> damn<00:01:00.199> 200

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 
there which is a 60 millimeter damn 200

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.289 
there which is a 60 millimeter damn 200
we're<00:01:01.129> getting<00:01:01.339> the<00:01:01.430> air<00:01:01.519> fuel<00:01:01.699> ratio<00:01:01.790> right

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:02.299 
we're getting the air fuel ratio right

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:03.849 
we're getting the air fuel ratio right
now

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:03.859 
now

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:06.010 
now
we<00:01:04.430> can<00:01:04.580> change<00:01:04.850> these<00:01:05.570> are<00:01:05.720> our<00:01:05.840> standard

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
we can change these are our standard

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.929 
we can change these are our standard
agents<00:01:06.560> that<00:01:06.680> come<00:01:06.830> in<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.009> DM<00:01:07.220> 200<00:01:07.640> we<00:01:07.820> can

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
agents that come in the DM 200 we can

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:09.880 
agents that come in the DM 200 we can
change<00:01:08.149> them<00:01:08.330> from<00:01:08.710> different<00:01:09.710> type<00:01:09.860> of

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
change them from different type of

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.389 
change them from different type of
gauges<00:01:10.899> the<00:01:11.899> here<00:01:12.080> is<00:01:12.170> our<00:01:12.290> four<00:01:12.530> parameter<00:01:13.130> we

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:13.399 
gauges the here is our four parameter we

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:15.460 
gauges the here is our four parameter we
can<00:01:13.549> read<00:01:13.700> for<00:01:14.149> different<00:01:14.720> sensor<00:01:15.080> modules

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
can read for different sensor modules

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.830 
can read for different sensor modules
connected<00:01:15.770> to<00:01:16.009> this<00:01:16.159> one<00:01:16.369> gauge<00:01:16.670> at<00:01:17.360> one<00:01:17.570> time

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
connected to this one gauge at one time

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.170 
connected to this one gauge at one time
so<00:01:18.229> you<00:01:18.320> can<00:01:18.439> keep<00:01:18.560> an<00:01:18.649> eye<00:01:18.799> on<00:01:18.939> four<00:01:19.939> of<00:01:20.060> your

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
so you can keep an eye on four of your

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.389 
so you can keep an eye on four of your
sensor<00:01:20.450> modules<00:01:20.840> you<00:01:21.289> can<00:01:21.320> have<00:01:21.530> up<00:01:21.740> to<00:01:21.770> 32

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
sensor modules you can have up to 32

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:24.969 
sensor modules you can have up to 32
sensor<00:01:22.939> modules<00:01:23.299> per<00:01:23.720> gauge<00:01:24.110> a<00:01:24.439> lot<00:01:24.680> of<00:01:24.770> people

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
sensor modules per gauge a lot of people

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:25.679 
sensor modules per gauge a lot of people
don't<00:01:25.070> know<00:01:25.280> that

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:25.689 
don't know that

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:28.179 
don't know that
here's<00:01:26.689> your<00:01:26.840> custom<00:01:27.170> gauge<00:01:27.380> you<00:01:27.920> can<00:01:28.070> design

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
here's your custom gauge you can design

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.219 
here's your custom gauge you can design
it<00:01:28.340> yourself<00:01:28.460> design<00:01:29.390> to<00:01:29.509> match<00:01:29.630> your<00:01:29.840> own<00:01:29.960> car

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
it yourself design to match your own car

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.560 
it yourself design to match your own car
if<00:01:30.320> you<00:01:30.409> like<00:01:31.630> this<00:01:32.630> is<00:01:32.810> our<00:01:32.929> new<00:01:33.080> updated<00:01:33.530> menu

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.990 

and<00:01:39.930> again<00:01:40.530> like<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.040> said<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.280> could<00:01:41.460> still

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
and again like I said you could still

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.030 
and again like I said you could still
run<00:01:42.420> every<00:01:42.930> single<00:01:43.080> gauge<00:01:43.380> from<00:01:43.590> one<00:01:43.800> gauge

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
run every single gauge from one gauge

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.929 
run every single gauge from one gauge
and<00:01:44.310> one<00:01:44.880> key<00:01:45.600> fob

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.679 

and<00:01:48.390> we<00:01:48.600> also<00:01:48.780> have<00:01:49.140> our<00:01:49.380> dm5<00:01:50.009> line<00:01:50.479> which<00:01:51.479> is

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
and we also have our dm5 line which is

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.050 
and we also have our dm5 line which is
right<00:01:52.259> here<00:01:52.289> this<00:01:52.950> one<00:01:53.159> happens<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.429> be<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.579> Fr
