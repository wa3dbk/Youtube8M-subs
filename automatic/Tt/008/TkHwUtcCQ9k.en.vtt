usually in these bluegrass tunes you're
going<00:02:54.290> to<00:02:54.349> be<00:02:54.470> able<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.709> find<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.040> notes<00:02:55.250> right

right<00:02:55.819> in<00:02:55.939> those<00:02:56.090> first<00:02:56.299> five<00:02:56.659> frets<00:02:56.989> okay<00:02:57.950> so

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
right in those first five frets okay so

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:04.330 
right in those first five frets okay so
this<00:02:59.299> goes<00:02:59.629> right<00:02:59.840> into<00:03:00.049> the<00:03:00.349> chord<00:03:00.799> of<00:03:00.920> C<00:03:03.340> and

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
this goes right into the chord of C and

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.860 
this goes right into the chord of C and
that's<00:03:04.489> basically<00:03:04.819> the<00:03:05.060> way<00:03:05.239> that<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.599> song

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
that's basically the way that the song

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.080 
that's basically the way that the song
started<00:03:06.349> out<00:03:06.530> and<00:03:06.829> this<00:03:06.980> is<00:03:07.129> pretty<00:03:07.340> much<00:03:07.609> this

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
started out and this is pretty much this

after<00:03:29.510> you<00:03:29.810> get<00:03:30.019> those<00:03:30.200> notes<00:03:31.420> what<00:03:32.420> you<00:03:32.599> want

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
after you get those notes what you want

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.660 
after you get those notes what you want
to<00:03:32.900> do<00:03:33.019> is<00:03:33.290> try<00:03:33.500> to<00:03:33.590> fit<00:03:33.920> the<00:03:34.099> roles<00:03:34.340> of<00:03:34.609> the

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
to do is try to fit the roles of the

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.280 
to do is try to fit the roles of the
right<00:03:34.909> hand<00:03:35.319> around<00:03:36.319> the<00:03:36.500> melody<00:03:36.889> notes<00:03:37.129> and

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
right hand around the melody notes and

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.319 
right hand around the melody notes and
again<00:03:39.290> the<00:03:39.799> basic<00:03:40.010> role<00:03:40.370> is<00:03:40.609> the<00:03:40.700> forward<00:03:41.000> roll

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
again the basic role is the forward roll

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.660 
again the basic role is the forward roll
the<00:03:41.569> backward<00:03:41.989> roll<00:03:42.170> the<00:03:42.650> forward<00:03:43.250> backward

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
the backward roll the forward backward

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.789 
the backward roll the forward backward
roll<00:03:43.879> and<00:03:44.500> pinches<00:03:45.500> and<00:03:46.180> you<00:03:47.180> can<00:03:47.620> you<00:03:48.620> can

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
roll and pinches and you can you can

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:50.800 
roll and pinches and you can you can
experiment<00:03:49.280> on<00:03:49.519> your<00:03:49.730> own<00:03:49.790> once<00:03:50.239> you<00:03:50.359> find<00:03:50.660> the

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
experiment on your own once you find the

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.080 
experiment on your own once you find the
melody<00:03:51.169> notes<00:03:51.379> to<00:03:51.680> to<00:03:52.220> any<00:03:52.400> song<00:03:52.730> that<00:03:52.760> you're

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
melody notes to to any song that you're

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.300 
melody notes to to any song that you're
trying<00:03:53.329> to<00:03:53.419> play<00:03:53.569> and<00:03:54.049> then<00:03:54.500> just<00:03:54.769> try<00:03:54.949> to<00:03:55.010> fit

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
trying to play and then just try to fit

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.240 
trying to play and then just try to fit
the<00:03:55.489> rolls<00:03:55.730> around<00:03:55.940> them<00:03:56.859> let's<00:03:57.859> start<00:03:58.129> it

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
the rolls around them let's start it

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.760 
the rolls around them let's start it
just<00:03:58.730> started<00:03:59.090> off

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.140 

so<00:04:03.460> you<00:04:03.520> can<00:04:04.000> see<00:04:04.210> here's<00:04:04.510> the<00:04:04.570> melody<00:04:04.960> notes

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
so you can see here's the melody notes

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.010 
so you can see here's the melody notes
and<00:04:07.150> now<00:04:07.300> we're<00:04:07.480> just<00:04:07.510> going<00:04:07.660> to<00:04:07.780> put<00:04:07.990> a

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 
and now we're just going to put a

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:14.490 
and now we're just going to put a
forward<00:04:08.410> roll<00:04:08.440> after<00:04:08.980> it

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.410 

and<00:04:14.800> actually<00:04:15.340> that<00:04:15.640> was<00:04:15.790> a<00:04:15.820> forward<00:04:16.269> backward

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
and actually that was a forward backward

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.120 
and actually that was a forward backward
roll<00:04:16.840> at<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.049> end<00:04:17.260> to<00:04:17.440> come<00:04:17.620> around<00:04:17.799> to<00:04:17.980> this

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
roll at the end to come around to this

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:33.139 
roll at the end to come around to this
node

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:33.149 

00:04:33.149 --> 00:04:36.689 

now<00:04:34.149> this<00:04:34.300> is<00:04:34.509> an<00:04:34.659> interesting<00:04:35.219> that<00:04:36.219> Geno

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 
now this is an interesting that Geno

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:40.439 
now this is an interesting that Geno
right<00:04:36.969> there<00:04:37.300> in<00:04:37.739> the<00:04:38.739> scrub<00:04:39.669> style<00:04:40.029> we<00:04:40.269> can

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449 
right there in the scrub style we can

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:46.529 
right there in the scrub style we can
hit<00:04:40.629> that<00:04:40.659> note<00:04:43.469> well<00:04:44.759> the<00:04:45.759> middle<00:04:46.059> strangled

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
hit that note well the middle strangled

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.379 
hit that note well the middle strangled
but<00:04:47.169> when<00:04:47.919> we<00:04:48.039> Fred<00:04:48.279> it<00:04:48.399> up<00:04:48.519> here<00:04:48.759> that'd<00:04:48.969> be<00:04:49.179> no

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
but when we Fred it up here that'd be no

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.719 
but when we Fred it up here that'd be no
to<00:04:49.449> catch<00:04:49.839> our<00:04:50.139> melody<00:04:50.529> note<00:04:50.800> we<00:04:51.279> can<00:04:51.459> hit<00:04:51.580> it

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
to catch our melody note we can hit it

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:56.820 
to catch our melody note we can hit it
here<00:04:51.999> open<00:04:53.399> or<00:04:54.399> hit<00:04:54.429> it<00:04:54.729> here<00:04:55.349> at<00:04:56.349> the<00:04:56.499> fourth

here open or hit it here at the fourth
the<00:04:57.279> fourth<00:04:57.519> fret<00:04:57.819> and<00:04:58.300> that's<00:04:58.509> pretty

00:04:58.709 --> 00:04:58.719 
the fourth fret and that's pretty

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:00.600 
the fourth fret and that's pretty
important<00:04:59.319> when<00:04:59.499> when<00:05:00.099> you're<00:05:00.249> incorporating

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610

some of these some of these licks and

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:11.759 
some of these some of these licks and
rolls<00:05:03.789> like<00:05:04.059> with<00:05:04.269> the<00:05:04.360> slide<00:05:10.469> so<00:05:11.469> I<00:05:11.499> see<00:05:11.740> I

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:11.769 
rolls like with the slide so I see I

00:05:11.769 --> 00:05:14.129 
rolls like with the slide so I see I
come<00:05:12.009> up<00:05:12.159> with<00:05:12.189> this<00:05:12.509> come<00:05:13.509> up<00:05:13.629> to<00:05:13.779> the<00:05:13.809> 4th

come up with this come up to the 4th

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:16.559 
come up with this come up to the 4th
string<00:05:14.499> instead<00:05:15.219> of<00:05:15.369> going<00:05:15.639> up<00:05:15.789> or<00:05:15.999> come<00:05:16.330> up<00:05:16.360> to

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:16.569

the 3rd string with that slide instead

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:25.670 
the 3rd string with that slide instead
of<00:05:18.819> just<00:05:18.969> going<00:05:19.149> to<00:05:19.719> the<00:05:19.809> second<00:05:20.199> string<00:05:20.379> open
