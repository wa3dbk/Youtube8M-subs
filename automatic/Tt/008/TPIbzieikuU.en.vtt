combat ELC you could probably rack up

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.730 
combat ELC you could probably rack up
around<00:00:15.660> 80<00:00:16.490> thousand<00:00:18.320> experience<00:00:19.320> per<00:00:19.590> hour

fighting system thing that they

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.830 
fighting system thing that they
implemented<00:00:26.640> into<00:00:26.939> runescape<00:00:27.500> you<00:00:28.500> can<00:00:28.710> get<00:00:29.840> I

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
implemented into runescape you can get I

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.520 
implemented into runescape you can get I
honestly<00:00:31.800> would<00:00:32.009> say<00:00:32.719> double<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.870> because

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
honestly would say double it because

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.430 
honestly would say double it because
with<00:00:35.219> all<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.730> area<00:00:36.090> effects<00:00:36.480> moves<00:00:36.809> that

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
with all of the area effects moves that

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.260 
with all of the area effects moves that
you<00:00:37.559> have<00:00:38.780> in<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.170> evolution<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.710> combat<00:00:41.270> you

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
you have in the evolution of combat you

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.040 
you have in the evolution of combat you
could<00:00:42.750> take<00:00:42.960> down<00:00:43.820> like<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:45.120> group<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.780> four

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
could take down like a group of four

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.389 
could take down like a group of four
these<00:00:46.320> guys<00:00:46.530> with<00:00:47.280> two<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:48.930> abilities<00:00:49.399> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
these guys with two of the abilities the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.180 
these guys with two of the abilities the
first<00:00:50.670> ability<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:51.239> want<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.539> do<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.949> gonna<00:00:52.949> be

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
first ability you want to do is gonna be

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.520 
first ability you want to do is gonna be
earthquake<00:00:53.690> or<00:00:54.690> quake<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.110> think<00:00:55.289> it's<00:00:55.410> just

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
earthquake or quake I think it's just

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.380 
earthquake or quake I think it's just
called<00:00:55.680> quaint<00:00:56.629> but<00:00:57.629> you'll<00:00:57.780> see<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:59.300> what<00:01:00.300> it

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
called quaint but you'll see it what it

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.689 
called quaint but you'll see it what it
does<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.870> hits<00:01:01.350> it's<00:01:01.680> an<00:01:01.859> area<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.219> effect<00:01:02.340> it

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
does it hits it's an area of effect it

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.329 
does it hits it's an area of effect it
hits<00:01:02.879> people<00:01:03.180> adjacent<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:05.010> front

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
hits people adjacent to you so front

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.630 
hits people adjacent to you so front
back<00:01:05.580> left<00:01:05.970> right<00:01:06.680> and<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.799> think<00:01:07.860> diagonally

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
back left right and I think diagonally

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.130 
back left right and I think diagonally
I'm<00:01:08.820> not<00:01:09.030> sure<00:01:09.240> though<00:01:10.640> and<00:01:11.640> if<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.659> hits<00:01:12.869> them

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
I'm not sure though and if it hits them

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.499 
I'm not sure though and if it hits them
their<00:01:13.860> defense<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.400> also<00:01:14.760> lowered<00:01:14.970> by<00:01:15.180> ninety

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
their defense is also lowered by ninety

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.649 
their defense is also lowered by ninety
percent<00:01:16.640> that's<00:01:17.640> where<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.000> want<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.360> have

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
percent that's where you want to have

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.950 
percent that's where you want to have
your<00:01:19.650> hurricane<00:01:20.330> hurricane<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.720> another

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
your hurricane hurricane is another

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.280 
your hurricane hurricane is another
annually<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:23.189> does<00:01:23.340> about<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:24.170> think<00:01:25.170> a

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
annually and it does about I think a

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.070 
annually and it does about I think a
hundred<00:01:25.439> percent<00:01:25.710> damage<00:01:26.540> the<00:01:27.540> video<00:01:27.840> will

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
hundred percent damage the video will

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.030 
hundred percent damage the video will
say<00:01:28.350> it<00:01:28.530> I'll<00:01:28.829> hover<00:01:29.400> over<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.000> abilities<00:01:31.040> and

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
say it I'll hover over the abilities and

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.179 
say it I'll hover over the abilities and
yeah<00:01:32.850> that's<00:01:33.150> that's<00:01:33.509> about<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:34.020> um<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:35.070> course

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
reason I use these foods right here is

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.710 
reason I use these foods right here is
because<00:02:19.590> they're<00:02:20.520> only<00:02:20.670> eight<00:02:21.030> hundred<00:02:21.570> and

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
because they're only eight hundred and

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.770 
because they're only eight hundred and
they<00:02:22.470> don't<00:02:22.650> reduce<00:02:23.040> your<00:02:23.310> adrenaline<00:02:24.000> low

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
they don't reduce your adrenaline low

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.440 
they don't reduce your adrenaline low
