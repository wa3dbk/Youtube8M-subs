00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:10.910
 Well, here's the principle of cones 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:13.769
 2 shops paying attention to the market 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:22.200
 a little trim if cho 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:25.410
 also need to 28 factory 4 he took 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:34.010
 the usual took bolts cut equally here 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:37.879
 it turned out and here for mine there are 33 4 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:44.399
 ball 35 did put in a drill and 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:49.559
 once capto what's up on 34 here are the balls 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:53.429
 the cry of three other stand eager to get 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.999
 on the first one and started doing something but part 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:59.600
 We could redo the report 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:04.980
 basically it turned out fine 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.450
 only falling wider make type 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.090
 So 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:14.140
 to get less clogged and clogged 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:18.450
 chips chiral starts ceased 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.450
 whet that is periodically to visit 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:26.829
 just about 2 3 4 place won even chips 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:32.740
 left to score all get lost fast 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:37.990
 very much i think about doing wider and 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.789
 I was not with 4 what did I get 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.189
 so this is basically normal. 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:49.599
 ok here these weapons we will make 32 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:52.750
 33 34 35 be sure it will be easier that is 

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:59.289
 30 to 34 all the same a lot of 4 millimeters 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:01.649
 removed once once on so here is my 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:01.649
 device
