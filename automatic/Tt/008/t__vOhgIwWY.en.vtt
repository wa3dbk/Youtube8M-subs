get<00:00:12.540> snowfall<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.200> that's<00:00:13.380> why<00:00:13.530> it<00:00:13.590> comes

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
get snowfall and that's why it comes

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.499 
get snowfall and that's why it comes

Slidell and actually Biloxi saw 70s for

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.790 
Slidell and actually Biloxi saw 70s for
today<00:02:20.130> so<00:02:20.790> what<00:02:21.030> is<00:02:21.180> happening<00:02:21.780> well<00:02:22.230> we<00:02:22.590> have

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
today so what is happening well we have

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.340 
today so what is happening well we have
a<00:02:23.100> southwesterly<00:02:24.090> flow<00:02:24.210> in<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.810> mid<00:02:24.990> levels

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
a southwesterly flow in the mid levels

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.560 
a southwesterly flow in the mid levels
of<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.560> atmosphere<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:26.520> upper<00:02:27.150> level<00:02:27.540> jet

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
of the atmosphere the upper level jet

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.770 
of the atmosphere the upper level jet
stream<00:02:28.100> bringing<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.370> divides<00:02:29.700> cold<00:02:30.270> arctic

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
stream bringing the divides cold arctic

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.230 
stream bringing the divides cold arctic
air<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.110> warm<00:02:31.320> tropical<00:02:31.710> air<00:02:32.190> is<00:02:32.460> generally

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
air and warm tropical air is generally

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.270 
air and warm tropical air is generally
shifting<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.840> more<00:02:34.110> donal<00:02:34.710> flow<00:02:34.980> so<00:02:35.040> we're

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
shifting to a more donal flow so we're

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.370 
shifting to a more donal flow so we're
getting<00:02:35.460> cloud<00:02:35.820> cover<00:02:36.210> coming<00:02:36.540> in<00:02:36.810> but<00:02:37.260> we're

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
getting cloud cover coming in but we're

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.950 
getting cloud cover coming in but we're
not<00:02:37.500> getting<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:37.920> cold<00:02:38.190> air<00:02:38.640> we<00:02:39.300> also<00:02:39.690> at<00:02:39.840> the

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
not getting the cold air we also at the

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.690 
not getting the cold air we also at the
surface<00:02:40.470> have<00:02:40.620> had<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:40.830> high<00:02:41.070> pressure<00:02:41.400> that's

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
surface have had a high pressure that's

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.130 
surface have had a high pressure that's
bringing<00:02:41.970> in<00:02:42.150> that<00:02:42.300> return<00:02:42.660> flow<00:02:42.870> from<00:02:43.050> the

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
bringing in that return flow from the

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.780 
bringing in that return flow from the
Gulf<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.440> can<00:02:43.560> see<00:02:43.830> those<00:02:44.040> low-level<00:02:44.580> clouds

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
Gulf you can see those low-level clouds

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.760 
Gulf you can see those low-level clouds
coming<00:02:45.330> in<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.750> that's<00:02:46.140> just<00:02:46.440> brought<00:02:46.620> the

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
coming in and that's just brought the

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.350 
coming in and that's just brought the
moisture<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.280> that's<00:02:47.430> why<00:02:47.580> our<00:02:47.610> dew<00:02:47.940> points

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
moisture and that's why our dew points

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.760 
moisture and that's why our dew points
are<00:02:48.480> up<00:02:48.570> and<00:02:48.750> this<00:02:48.870> picture<00:02:49.260> shows<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.680> with

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
are up and this picture shows it with

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.050 
are up and this picture shows it with
the<00:02:49.860> arrows<00:02:50.190> coming<00:02:50.430> generally<00:02:50.940> in<00:02:51.000> a

the arrows coming generally in a
southeasterly<00:02:51.690> direction<00:02:52.230> we<00:02:52.560> do<00:02:52.740> have<00:02:52.860> a

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
southeasterly direction we do have a

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.250 
southeasterly direction we do have a
front<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.490> the<00:02:53.520> north<00:02:53.640> of<00:02:54.090> us<00:02:54.240> but<00:02:54.780> that<00:02:54.900> front

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
front to the north of us but that front

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.980 
front to the north of us but that front
and<00:02:55.590> this<00:02:56.010> cold<00:02:56.400> air<00:02:56.640> is<00:02:57.000> not<00:02:57.510> going<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.780> make

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
and this cold air is not going to make

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.360 
and this cold air is not going to make
it<00:02:58.110> to<00:02:58.230> our<00:02:58.350> region<00:02:58.680> we<00:02:58.770> actually<00:02:59.010> have<00:02:59.130> high

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
it to our region we actually have high

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.350 
it to our region we actually have high
pressure<00:02:59.640> over<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.000> Gulf

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
pressure over the Gulf

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.120 
pressure over the Gulf
that's<00:03:00.600> gonna<00:03:00.780> block<00:03:01.260> all<00:03:01.560> this<00:03:01.770> cold<00:03:02.010> air

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
that's gonna block all this cold air

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.890 
that's gonna block all this cold air
look<00:03:02.460> at<00:03:02.610> this<00:03:02.820> though<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.450> middle<00:03:03.690> part<00:03:03.870> of

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
look at this though the middle part of

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.540 
look at this though the middle part of
the<00:03:04.020> country<00:03:04.170> seeing<00:03:04.710> some<00:03:04.890> of<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.040> coldest

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
the country seeing some of the coldest

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.330 
the country seeing some of the coldest
air<00:03:05.670> of<00:03:06.120> this<00:03:06.570> season<00:03:07.140> it's<00:03:07.290> minus<00:03:07.860> 12<00:03:08.130> degrees

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
air of this season it's minus 12 degrees

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.760 
air of this season it's minus 12 degrees
in<00:03:08.880> Rapid<00:03:09.240> City<00:03:09.270> minus<00:03:09.840> 15<00:03:10.230> in<00:03:10.380> Denver

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
in Rapid City minus 15 in Denver

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.590 
in Rapid City minus 15 in Denver
Colorado<00:03:10.950> so<00:03:11.490> look<00:03:11.670> at<00:03:11.760> all<00:03:11.880> this<00:03:12.090> cold<00:03:12.420> air

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
Colorado so look at all this cold air

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.690 
Colorado so look at all this cold air
and<00:03:12.900> then<00:03:13.260> we<00:03:13.350> were<00:03:13.500> in<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.740> 70s<00:03:14.010> today<00:03:14.490> it's

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700
