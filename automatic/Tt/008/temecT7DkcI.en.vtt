00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello everyone how are you in this morning 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.109
 I bring you a basic exercise for 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.320
 fingering our fingers to go 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.929
 letting go and becoming independent 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.480
 fingers then what we 're going to do is the 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.980
 first it is a very simple exercise and 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.350
 the second and we would have little of these 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.220
 they are very simple exercises when 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.199
 is starting then 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.970
 we go first with one hand and then the 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.970
 another two together then 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.820
 how many times approximately should 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.870
 be 10 but obviously they will not be 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.030
 at the beginning the best will be 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:47.800
 counting later the important thing is that what 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.650
 are doing would be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:55.680
 10 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:01:04.230
 and we're going to do it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:06.500
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:12.140
 8 9 is 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:16.150
 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and achieve 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.150
 six seven eight nine days 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:26.750
 and then they do it with the other hand 1 2 3 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.750
 4 5 6 7 8 9 264 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.700
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.130
 this talk will try 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.259
 and then since they have each one for 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.280
 already have already practiced 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.280
 now yes with both 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.549
 they are set to go all at the same time 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:53.979
 you can start slowly take it 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.130
 but nothing more chic in that the fingers 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.229
 go so we are going to do these five 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.690
 four three this way not our 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.830
 fingers 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.570
 why 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.930
 that's how they're going to be playing channel 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.930
 secrecy 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.909
 and later 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.870
 obviously they are counting 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.220
 that simple would be that first 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.910
 exercise 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:41.120
 now the second exercise and sometime 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.640
 that we have this exercise dominated 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.550
 is 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.120
 It would be the same but give a little bit of 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.120
 Faster 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.010
 with both hands it will cost a little 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.010
 a little bit 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.640
 what 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.250
 especially what are these fingers what 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.250
 which are finger 4 of 25 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:23.530
 usually those fingers tend to be 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.600
 more like more rebels at the beginning 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.100
 when we are playing and after 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.880
 later with practice it gets better 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.880
 all that 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.810
 just check that they go 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.130
 then what we are in the sixth 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.260
 so I 'm doing it like that but 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.970
 it should be a little more lifted up for 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.590
 that they can see it better but when 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.060
 you are touching try to lift 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.710
 a little hand 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.470
 for example 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.240
 in this way and make sure that each one 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.319
 of these fingers go corresponding to the 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.999
 key 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.370
 that is, he has no loses, he is putting the 

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:22.330
 hand I feel ssc from 1 to 5 us 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:24.939
 it would be without skipping keys 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:29.309
 and then put in this case I would have to 

00:04:24.939 --> 00:04:32.240
 go from 13 to 14 

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:34.950
 fifteen 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.660
 14 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:39.440
 13 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.440
 12 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.400
 Now what is it you and me this 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:01.680
 well look for example once and 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.680
 apologize has been keyboard image 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.990
 for example let's go we're touching 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.230
 songs 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:13.580
 it's something simple that way they fix 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:16.870
 touching 1 and 5 with the left hand 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.870
 but if I want to appeal 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:30.259
 they would fix would have to do this in what 

00:05:27.929 --> 00:05:30.259
 what am i doing 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:36.500
 and good to do this and at our hand 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:40.020
 is getting used to doing this more 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:41.430
 forward we will be able to do this 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:46.100
 what 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:49.080
 up here with some practice and very 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.700
 technique we can get to the other and 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:55.980
 it also depends on how long your 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:57.600
 fingers but like for all the trick not 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.330
 would necessarily have to go is not already 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.760
 use to get to this one if he could not 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:06.000
 touching it here in my truth comes to me in 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.790
 try to go further or touch a 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.220
 chord here and I put the omni here 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.780
 so then it would be the 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:17.550
 exercise 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:18.810
 practicing it simple, this is like 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.970
 be doing the fingering in the 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:24.000
 guitar that we go with each fret 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:26.810
 or the same thing on the keyboard basically 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.810
 fixed in the same structure 

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.520
 Well, I hope it served you 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.520
 we see the next
