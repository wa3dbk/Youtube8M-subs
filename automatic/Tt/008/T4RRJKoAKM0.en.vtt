00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
as a scientist began this is where I

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.340 
as a scientist began this is where I
first<00:01:15.030> lived<00:01:15.590> you<00:01:16.590> know<00:01:16.710> it's<00:01:17.190> kind<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.610> weird

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
time becoming a scientist seem like this

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.170 
time becoming a scientist seem like this
insurmountable<00:02:31.560> task<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:32.459> many<00:02:32.550> unknowns

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
insurmountable task of so many unknowns

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.100 
insurmountable task of so many unknowns
so<00:02:33.750> many<00:02:33.959> so<00:02:34.500> many<00:02:34.620> variables<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:35.900> soon<00:02:36.900> the

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
so many so many variables and soon the

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.869 
so many so many variables and soon the
environment<00:02:37.830> began<00:02:38.069> to<00:02:38.250> set<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.489> dreams<00:02:38.730> for

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
environment began to set the dreams for

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.699 
environment began to set the dreams for
me<00:02:39.060> again<00:02:39.330> but<00:02:39.720> my<00:02:39.870> wife<00:02:40.080> she<00:02:40.290> stepped<00:02:40.530> in

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
me again but my wife she stepped in

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.850 
me again but my wife she stepped in
quickly<00:02:40.739> and<00:02:41.190> responded<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:42.450> know<00:02:42.569> that<00:02:42.860> she

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
quickly and responded you know that she

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.470 
quickly and responded you know that she
says<00:02:44.069> I<00:02:44.099> I<00:02:44.310> don't<00:02:44.580> know<00:02:44.790> what<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.090> path<00:02:45.300> to

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
says I I don't know what the path to

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.050 
says I I don't know what the path to
becoming<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.900> scientist<00:02:46.319> is<00:02:46.530> either<00:02:46.940> but<00:02:47.940> I<00:02:47.970> do

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
becoming a scientist is either but I do

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.729 
becoming a scientist is either but I do
know<00:02:48.270> what<00:02:48.390> that<00:02:48.420> first<00:02:48.780> step<00:02:48.959> is<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:49.410> so

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
know what that first step is and so

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.740 
know what that first step is and so
taking<00:02:50.550> that<00:02:50.580> leap<00:02:50.910> of<00:02:51.090> confidence<00:02:51.660> in

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
taking that leap of confidence in

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.180 
taking that leap of confidence in
ourselves<00:02:51.810> we<00:02:52.170> took<00:02:52.379> that<00:02:52.560> first<00:02:52.860> step

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
ourselves we took that first step

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.339 
ourselves we took that first step
beginning<00:02:54.060> in<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.269> small<00:02:54.720> lab<00:02:54.989> as<00:02:55.260> an
