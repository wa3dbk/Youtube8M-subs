00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.290
 willingness to write a play with the 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.230
 characters from the cartoonist angeli 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.829
 I've been a fan of him since forever. 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.350
 already theodore son is drawing and he 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.360
 For me it was always the guy that the country 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.870
 to enjoy the work of 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.820
 search for you to develop the script 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.829
 looks are still being crazy is the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.520
 first woman in the basic world of 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.820
 angelis was reading all the comics 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.710
 but I 'm no longer centered on the lip 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.010
 No 68 in the cast 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.590
 isp and in marking the 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.600
 history of instructors and also with 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.369
 angelim crisis we do not forget to 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.229
 part with most of the show 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.330
 told me dedicating but I will not let 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.720
 to take a spin on the other characters 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.520
 Why did you decide to use the projection? 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.860
 how it can enrich the 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.350
 show the function of projection as 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.060
 scenarios to the environments he wants 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.079
 we give life to the characters a 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.090
 exaggerated characteristic is 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:38.579
 alice in our universe of 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.920
 panels where the trace of my 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.750
 lawyer I remember is a clown I 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.240
 I'm making this connection then. 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.880
 spirit half the quilombo that people 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.060
 do what he does is think it's footprint 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.610
 to arrive at the only one to intervene 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.409
 to criticize politically socially everything 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.719
 what bothers us 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:01.409
 Look, it's going to be a challenge. We have 22 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.840
 years of an intense coexistence with 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.609
 people play together 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.369
 when the play of the eye but the 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:09.849
 The challenge of making it so obvious is how 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.379

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:15.800
 nervous companion 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:17.209
 I think I 'm close to tse risk 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.190
 I think the thing with a band does not 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.840
 the old age of a 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.489
 very cool way that art is not 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.519
 old musician I think we have 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:29.110
 rainy long festival with certainty 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.110
