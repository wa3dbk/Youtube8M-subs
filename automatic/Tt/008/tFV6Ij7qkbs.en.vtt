00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
nails and kind of cut them in a square

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.970 
nails and kind of cut them in a square
shape<00:01:01.300> so<00:01:02.300> instead<00:01:02.900> of<00:01:02.960> this<00:01:03.440> one<00:01:03.680> kind<00:01:03.890> of

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
shape so instead of this one kind of

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.310 
shape so instead of this one kind of
broke<00:01:04.159> off<00:01:04.369> so<00:01:04.699> that's<00:01:05.360> a<00:01:05.540> good<00:01:05.750> example<00:01:06.049> but

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
broke off so that's a good example but

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.940 
broke off so that's a good example but
this<00:01:06.530> one<00:01:07.570> as<00:01:08.570> you<00:01:08.810> can<00:01:08.990> see<00:01:09.200> I<00:01:09.229> kind<00:01:09.500> of<00:01:09.619> cut<00:01:09.829> it

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
this one as you can see I kind of cut it

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.100 
this one as you can see I kind of cut it
flat<00:01:10.430> along<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:10.970> top<00:01:11.180> and<00:01:11.420> then<00:01:11.540> rounded<00:01:12.020> the

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
flat along the top and then rounded the

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.440 
flat along the top and then rounded the
edges<00:01:12.140> out<00:01:12.649> and<00:01:13.009> this<00:01:13.790> shape<00:01:14.030> is<00:01:14.240> more

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
edges out and this shape is more

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.679 
edges out and this shape is more
reminiscent<00:01:14.930> of<00:01:15.460> fake<00:01:16.460> nails<00:01:16.880> that<00:01:17.329> you<00:01:17.390> get

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
reminiscent of fake nails that you get

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.499 
reminiscent of fake nails that you get
at<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:17.930> salon<00:01:18.320> so<00:01:18.939> what<00:01:19.939> you<00:01:20.060> want<00:01:20.210> to<00:01:20.240> do<00:01:20.359> is

at the salon so what you want to do is

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:26.080 
at the salon so what you want to do is
just<00:01:20.719> kind<00:01:20.929> of<00:01:21.670> cut<00:01:22.670> off<00:01:22.700> the<00:01:23.179> edges<00:01:23.359> and<00:01:25.090> kind

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
just kind of cut off the edges and kind

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.749 
just kind of cut off the edges and kind
of<00:01:26.179> round<00:01:27.049> the<00:01:27.229> edges<00:01:27.429> but<00:01:28.429> when<00:01:28.609> you're

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
of round the edges but when you're

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.399 
of round the edges but when you're
cutting<00:01:28.969> here<00:01:29.829> do<00:01:30.829> it<00:01:30.859> straight<00:01:31.549> across<00:01:32.409> you

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
cutting here do it straight across you

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.099 
cutting here do it straight across you
could<00:01:33.590> always<00:01:34.009> file<00:01:34.909> your<00:01:35.090> nails<00:01:35.420> into<00:01:35.840> that

could always file your nails into that

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:38.080 
could always file your nails into that
shape<00:01:36.380> but<00:01:36.740> I<00:01:36.770> find<00:01:37.100> when<00:01:37.310> I<00:01:37.340> file<00:01:37.759> my<00:01:38.060> nails

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
shape but I find when I file my nails

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.109 
shape but I find when I file my nails
too<00:01:38.689> much<00:01:38.929> they<00:01:39.709> get<00:01:39.889> really<00:01:40.280> brittle<00:01:40.670> and

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
too much they get really brittle and

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.749 
too much they get really brittle and
they<00:01:41.959> break<00:01:42.170> off<00:01:42.409> so<00:01:42.859> once<00:01:43.100> you're<00:01:43.279> done<00:01:43.310> that

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759

called first kiss and it's by aurélie
and<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:36.430> can<00:02:36.580> really<00:02:36.850> choose<00:02:37.090> any<00:02:37.360> kind<00:02:37.720> of

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
and you can really choose any kind of

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.510 
and you can really choose any kind of
flesh<00:02:38.290> tone<00:02:38.620> or<00:02:38.980> your<00:02:39.220> skin<00:02:39.580> but<00:02:39.820> better<00:02:40.120> color

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
flesh tone or your skin but better color

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.160 
flesh tone or your skin but better color
but<00:02:42.520> I<00:02:42.550> really<00:02:42.850> like<00:02:43.000> this<00:02:43.150> one<00:02:43.390> because<00:02:43.660> it's

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
but I really like this one because it's

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.770 
but I really like this one because it's
got<00:02:44.470> a<00:02:44.500> sort<00:02:44.830> of<00:02:44.920> peach<00:02:45.670> undertone<00:02:46.000> rather

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
got a sort of peach undertone rather

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.900 
got a sort of peach undertone rather
than<00:02:47.110> a<00:02:47.140> more<00:02:47.530> pinky<00:02:47.980> undertone<00:02:48.490> but<00:02:48.520> that's

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
than a more pinky undertone but that's

00:02:48.910 --> 00:03:04.200 
than a more pinky undertone but that's
just<00:02:49.120> my<00:02:49.330> personal<00:02:49.390> preference

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:33.390 

you

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.360 

so<00:03:33.970> you<00:03:34.060> can<00:03:34.360> see<00:03:34.569> that<00:03:34.780> it's<00:03:34.959> a<00:03:35.080> really

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
so you can see that it's a really

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.789 
so you can see that it's a really
translucent<00:03:36.370> nail<00:03:37.180> polish<00:03:37.659> so<00:03:38.019> you'll<00:03:38.650> want

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
do end up using this generously because

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.369 
do end up using this generously because
I<00:05:59.249> just<00:05:59.429> love<00:05:59.699> how<00:05:59.969> it<00:05:59.999> makes<00:06:00.299> my<00:06:00.779> nails<00:06:00.839> look

00:06:01.369 --> 00:06:01.379 
I just love how it makes my nails look

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:47.900 
I just love how it makes my nails look

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:47.910 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.450 

so<00:06:48.450> as<00:06:48.660> you<00:06:48.840> can<00:06:48.990> see<00:06:49.050> after<00:06:49.380> the<00:06:49.680> topcoat<00:06:50.190> has

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460 
so as you can see after the topcoat has

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.640 
so as you can see after the topcoat has
been<00:06:50.610> put<00:06:50.820> on<00:06:50.850> it<00:06:51.600> kind<00:06:51.870> of<00:06:51.960> gives<00:06:52.170> it<00:06:52.320> like<00:06:52.500> a

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
been put on it kind of gives it like a

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:56.360 
been put on it kind of gives it like a
thicker<00:06:53.630> fake<00:06:54.630> nail<00:06:55.020> effect<00:06:55.710> and<00:06:56.010> I<00:06:56.130> think

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.370 
thicker fake nail effect and I think

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.160 
thicker fake nail effect and I think
that's<00:06:56.520> because<00:06:56.910> there's<00:06:57.150> about<00:06:57.390> four<00:06:57.870> layers

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.170 
that's because there's about four layers

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.190 
that's because there's about four layers
of<00:06:58.410> nail<00:06:58.740> polish<00:06:59.160> on<00:06:59.340> my<00:06:59.370> nails<00:06:59.490> there<00:07:00.090> most<00:07:00.990> of

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:01.200 
of nail polish on my nails there most of

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.610 
of nail polish on my nails there most of
them<00:07:01.380> are<00:07:01.500> thin<00:07:01.740> except<00:07:02.100> for<00:07:02.250> the<00:07:02.340> top<00:07:02.550> coat

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:03.620 
them are thin except for the top coat

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.140 
them are thin except for the top coat
but<00:07:04.620> there's<00:07:04.800> four<00:07:05.010> layers<00:07:05.310> so<00:07:05.700> it<00:07:05.850> kind<00:07:06.090> of

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:06.150 
but there's four layers so it kind of

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:07.790 
but there's four layers so it kind of
gives<00:07:06.420> your<00:07:06.600> nails<00:07:06.810> a<00:07:07.020> little<00:07:07.170> bit<00:07:07.410> of<00:07:07.650> a

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 
gives your nails a little bit of a

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.340 
gives your nails a little bit of a
thicker<00:07:08.100> look<00:07:08.460> and<00:07:08.760> I<00:07:09.720> think<00:07:09.750> that's<00:07:10.140> what

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:10.350 
thicker look and I think that's what

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:12.740 
thicker look and I think that's what
kind<00:07:10.560> of<00:07:10.650> gives<00:07:10.890> it<00:07:11.070> that<00:07:11.100> fake<00:07:11.550> nail<00:07:12.030> look<00:07:12.420> so

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:12.750 
kind of gives it that fake nail look so

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.510 
kind of gives it that fake nail look so
I<00:07:12.780> hope<00:07:13.200> that<00:07:13.410> this<00:07:13.590> helped<00:07:13.950> you<00:07:14.160> and<00:07:14.430> I<00:07:14.490> hope
