this is a video called the first look at
your<00:00:05.009> chart<00:00:05.490> I<00:00:05.970> have<00:00:06.390> been<00:00:06.810> inspired<00:00:07.379> because

your chart I have been inspired because

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.950 
your chart I have been inspired because
I<00:00:08.670> have<00:00:09.240> had<00:00:10.139> a<00:00:10.590> person<00:00:11.580> contact<00:00:12.240> me<00:00:12.450> an<00:00:12.599> old

something<00:00:19.340> it<00:00:20.340> occurred<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.730> me<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.630> just

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
something it occurred to me that just

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.700 
something it occurred to me that just
the<00:00:22.500> very<00:00:22.740> basic<00:00:23.490> mechanics<00:00:24.420> just<00:00:25.350> as<00:00:25.560> an

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
the very basic mechanics just as an

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.060 
the very basic mechanics just as an
overview<00:00:26.310> would<00:00:26.670> help<00:00:26.970> her<00:00:27.240> out<00:00:27.740> the<00:00:28.740> human

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
overview would help her out the human

overview would help her out the human
design<00:00:29.429> system<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.570> saying<00:00:31.080> that<00:00:31.590> we<00:00:31.980> have

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
design system is saying that we have

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.490 
design system is saying that we have
auras<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.180> in<00:00:33.660> these<00:00:33.899> auras<00:00:34.649> we<00:00:35.040> each<00:00:35.250> carry<00:00:35.610> a

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
auras and in these auras we each carry a

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.940 
auras and in these auras we each carry a
magnetic<00:00:37.500> imprint<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:39.600> coming<00:00:40.230> from<00:00:40.440> the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
magnetic imprint that is coming from the

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.389 
magnetic imprint that is coming from the
planetary<00:00:41.579> birth<00:00:42.260> constellation<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.649> this

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
planetary birth constellation and this

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.190 
planetary birth constellation and this
is<00:00:45.500> determining<00:00:46.500> how<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:47.390> nine<00:00:48.390> centers

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
is determining how the nine centers

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.590 
is determining how the nine centers
based<00:00:49.739> on<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.190> seven<00:00:50.550> chakras<00:00:50.789> plus<00:00:51.420> two

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
based on the seven chakras plus two

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.619 
based on the seven chakras plus two
additional<00:00:51.750> ones<00:00:52.410> based<00:00:53.399> on<00:00:53.730> how<00:00:54.120> these<00:00:54.300> nine

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
additional ones based on how these nine

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.529 
additional ones based on how these nine
centers<00:00:55.289> end<00:00:55.680> up<00:00:55.980> getting<00:00:56.520> what's<00:00:57.329> called

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
centers end up getting what's called

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.310 
centers end up getting what's called
defined<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:59.000> what<00:01:00.000> happens<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.660> planetary

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
defined and what happens is planetary

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.109 
defined and what happens is planetary
activations<00:01:02.309> activate<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.270> half<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.500> channel

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
activations activate a half of a channel

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.750 
activations activate a half of a channel
channels<00:01:06.119> connect<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.780> centers<00:01:07.320> together<00:01:07.760> so

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
channels connect to centers together so

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.289 
channels connect to centers together so
when<00:01:09.180> two<00:01:09.990> activations<00:01:10.920> meet<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.000> the

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
when two activations meet and so the

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.210 
when two activations meet and so the
whole<00:01:12.479> channel<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.140> colored<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.799> centers

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
whole channel is colored the centers

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.580 
whole channel is colored the centers
that<00:01:14.369> are<00:01:14.460> connected<00:01:15.060> by<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.540> channel<00:01:16.049> also

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
that are connected by that channel also

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
that are connected by that channel also
are<00:01:16.860> colored<00:01:18.080> once<00:01:19.080> we<00:01:19.320> see<00:01:19.650> definition<00:01:20.460> in

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
are colored once we see definition in

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.050 
are colored once we see definition in
the<00:01:20.729> chart<00:01:21.060> we<00:01:21.810> know<00:01:22.140> what<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.799> stable<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.759> that

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
the chart we know what is stable in that

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.740 
the chart we know what is stable in that
person's<00:01:24.750> nature<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:26.100> where<00:01:26.759> we<00:01:26.939> see<00:01:27.240> that

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
person's nature and where we see that

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.380 
person's nature and where we see that
something<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.530> not<00:01:28.979> defined<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:29.729> therefore<00:01:30.299> it

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
something is not defined so therefore it

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.149 
something is not defined so therefore it
remains<00:01:30.780> white<00:01:31.200> because<00:01:31.770> there<00:01:32.130> were<00:01:32.310> no<00:01:32.610> two

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159 
remains white because there were no two

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.429 
remains white because there were no two
connectors<00:01:35.270> causing<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.360> definition<00:01:37.140> that

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
connectors causing a definition that

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.340 
connectors causing a definition that

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
different things in our charts giving us

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.010 
different things in our charts giving us
definition<00:04:22.700> where<00:04:22.880> we<00:04:23.030> think<00:04:23.330> okay<00:04:23.720> now<00:04:23.900> I

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
definition where we think okay now I

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.080 
definition where we think okay now I
have<00:04:24.410> fixed<00:04:24.710> that

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
have fixed that

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.809 
have fixed that
and<00:04:26.300> then<00:04:26.870> the<00:04:27.050> transit<00:04:27.560> leaves<00:04:27.830> it's<00:04:28.340> very

00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:28.819 
and then the transit leaves it's very

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:32.200 
and then the transit leaves it's very
upsetting<00:04:29.620> sometimes<00:04:30.620> because<00:04:31.340> oh<00:04:31.610> my<00:04:31.910> god<00:04:32.180> I

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
upsetting sometimes because oh my god I

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.629 
upsetting sometimes because oh my god I
thought<00:04:32.599> I<00:04:32.660> had<00:04:32.990> it<00:04:33.020> fixed<00:04:33.500> and<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:35.210> the<00:04:35.630> main

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639

there is something wrong they're open

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.189 
there is something wrong they're open
and<00:04:47.979> being<00:04:48.979> open<00:04:49.580> is<00:04:49.880> really<00:04:50.389> the<00:04:50.569> advanced
