00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
how this bar was attached there's a

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.700 
how this bar was attached there's a
couple<00:01:50.240> Allen<00:01:50.630> heads<00:01:50.840> little<00:01:51.260> set<00:01:51.440> screws

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
couple Allen heads little set screws

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.500 
couple Allen heads little set screws
that<00:01:51.890> are<00:01:51.950> recessed<00:01:52.250> in<00:01:52.430> there<00:01:52.610> so<00:01:53.240> this<00:01:53.390> ever

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
that are recessed in there so this ever

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.450 
that are recessed in there so this ever
gets<00:01:53.720> loose<00:01:53.900> on<00:01:54.020> you<00:01:54.140> guys<00:01:54.290> take<00:01:55.070> that<00:01:55.220> sticker

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
gets loose on you guys take that sticker

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.460 
gets loose on you guys take that sticker
off<00:01:55.670> and<00:01:55.940> tighten<00:01:56.180> those<00:01:56.240> up<00:01:56.300> so<00:01:56.630> that's<00:01:57.320> how

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
off and tighten those up so that's how

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.910 
off and tighten those up so that's how
that<00:01:57.590> works

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
that works

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.660 
that works
but<00:01:58.460> uh<00:01:59.140> tars<00:02:00.140> put<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.380> line<00:02:00.560> in<00:02:00.590> there<00:02:00.890> go<00:02:01.610> to

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
but uh tars put the line in there go to

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.280 
but uh tars put the line in there go to
the<00:02:01.880> loop<00:02:02.030> side<00:02:02.270> here<00:02:02.600> I'm<00:02:02.750> just<00:02:03.080> using<00:02:03.200> a

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
the loop side here I'm just using a

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.170 
the loop side here I'm just using a
piece<00:02:03.410> of<00:02:03.530> rope<00:02:03.650> so<00:02:03.680> you<00:02:03.770> guys<00:02:03.890> can<00:02:04.070> see<00:02:04.220> and<00:02:05.060> go

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
piece of rope so you guys can see and go

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.660 
piece of rope so you guys can see and go
underneath<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.660> loops<00:02:05.869> and<00:02:06.520> you're<00:02:07.520> in

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
underneath the loops and you're in

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.160 
underneath the loops and you're in
that's<00:02:08.209> the<00:02:08.270> real<00:02:08.479> easy<00:02:08.630> to<00:02:08.720> do<00:02:08.840> I'll<00:02:09.050> do<00:02:09.110> it

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
that's the real easy to do I'll do it

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.720 
that's the real easy to do I'll do it
one<00:02:09.259> more<00:02:09.380> time<00:02:10.720> one<00:02:11.720> of<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:11.930> loops<00:02:12.610> slide<00:02:13.610> it

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
one more time one of the loops slide it

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.540 
one more time one of the loops slide it
up<00:02:13.850> okay<00:02:14.810> I<00:02:15.020> want<00:02:15.920> this<00:02:16.010> is<00:02:16.160> on<00:02:16.280> your<00:02:16.400> line

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
up okay I want this is on your line

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
like a 30 foot I'm going to be putting a

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.680 
like a 30 foot I'm going to be putting a
dog<00:02:37.190> leash<00:02:37.400> on<00:02:37.550> here<00:02:37.820> cuz<00:02:37.970> this<00:02:38.090> ropes<00:02:38.390> already

dog leash on here cuz this ropes already

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:39.910 
dog leash on here cuz this ropes already
getting<00:02:38.870> knotted<00:02:39.110> up<00:02:39.200> it's<00:02:39.440> already<00:02:39.680> being<00:02:39.830> a

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
getting knotted up it's already being a

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.650 
getting knotted up it's already being a
pain<00:02:40.130> but<00:02:40.730> like<00:02:40.880> I<00:02:40.910> said<00:02:41.060> that<00:02:41.120> we<00:02:41.270> can<00:02:41.450> go<00:02:41.600> as

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
pain but like I said that we can go as

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.300 
pain but like I said that we can go as
deep<00:02:41.750> as<00:02:42.020> you<00:02:42.050> want<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.410> go<00:02:42.560> that's<00:02:43.130> the

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
deep as you want to go that's the

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.030 
deep as you want to go that's the
benefit<00:02:43.670> of<00:02:43.730> having<00:02:43.940> one<00:02:44.300> like<00:02:44.480> this<00:02:44.920> you<00:02:45.920> can

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
benefit of having one like this you can

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.190 
benefit of having one like this you can
also<00:02:46.190> use<00:02:46.370> in<00:02:46.519> shallow<00:02:46.760> water<00:02:47.000> as<00:02:47.180> well<00:02:47.390> but<00:02:48.140> I

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
also use in shallow water as well but I

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.560 
also use in shallow water as well but I
think<00:02:48.650> it's<00:02:48.739> nice<00:02:48.830> to<00:02:49.010> have<00:02:49.040> both<00:02:49.280> types

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
think it's nice to have both types

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.550 
think it's nice to have both types
depending<00:02:50.570> on<00:02:50.780> your<00:02:50.870> situation

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
depending on your situation

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.770 
depending on your situation
