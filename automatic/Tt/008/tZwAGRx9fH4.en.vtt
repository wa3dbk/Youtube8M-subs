00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
proportioned plant this one was beaten

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.119 
proportioned plant this one was beaten
by<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.239> wind<00:02:24.569> it's<00:02:24.780> 60<00:02:25.200> mile<00:02:25.379> per<00:02:25.410> hour<00:02:25.680> wind

against<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.790> pine<00:02:27.000> tree<00:02:27.330> so<00:02:27.629> that's<00:02:28.230> why<00:02:28.440> I

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
against the pine tree so that's why I

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.199 
against the pine tree so that's why I
kind<00:02:28.680> of<00:02:28.800> looks<00:02:28.980> lopsided<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:29.700> waiting<00:02:30.000> for

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
kind of looks lopsided and waiting for

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.640 
kind of looks lopsided and waiting for
it<00:02:30.269> to<00:02:30.300> come<00:02:30.540> back<00:02:30.599> a<00:02:30.810> little<00:02:31.110> bit<00:02:31.260> before<00:02:31.620> I

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
it to come back a little bit before I

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.759 
it to come back a little bit before I
really<00:02:32.040> do<00:02:32.190> some<00:02:32.400> trimming<00:02:32.640> onto<00:02:33.090> it

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
really do some trimming onto it

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.660 
really do some trimming onto it
another<00:02:34.769> thing<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.069> do<00:02:35.220> is<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.489> look<00:02:35.610> for

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
another thing to do is you look for

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.100 
another thing to do is you look for
branches<00:02:36.630> that<00:02:36.780> are<00:02:36.840> wilted<00:02:37.940> pockmark<00:02:39.110> like

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
branches that are wilted pockmark like

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.710 
branches that are wilted pockmark like
this<00:02:40.290> one<00:02:40.470> right<00:02:40.590> here<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.239> like<00:02:42.239> I<00:02:42.390> said<00:02:42.450> you

this one right here and like I said you
always<00:02:43.170> go<00:02:43.349> right<00:02:43.799> to<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.160> base<00:02:45.290> put<00:02:46.290> it<00:02:46.470> up

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
always go right to the base put it up

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.190 
always go right to the base put it up
right<00:02:46.769> at<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.160> base<00:02:47.310> now<00:02:47.970> these<00:02:48.209> things<00:02:48.959> that

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
right at the base now these things that

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.660 
right at the base now these things that
I'm<00:02:49.319> trimming<00:02:49.680> off<00:02:49.799> right<00:02:50.069> now<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:50.280> can

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
I'm trimming off right now you can

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.150 
I'm trimming off right now you can
actually<00:02:50.700> use<00:02:51.269> them<00:02:51.450> as<00:02:51.569> cuttings<00:02:51.959> okay<00:02:52.799> I'll

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
actually use them as cuttings okay I'll

actually use them as cuttings okay I'll
show<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:53.489> that<00:02:53.760> here<00:02:53.970> in<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.120> second<00:02:56.660> okay

big tomato cage as you can see it's a

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.970 
big tomato cage as you can see it's a
pretty<00:03:05.579> big<00:03:05.849> sized<00:03:06.090> plant<00:03:06.420> but<00:03:07.079> I<00:03:07.319> just<00:03:07.680> got<00:03:07.950> it

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
some of the dead branches what I usually

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.800 
some of the dead branches what I usually
do<00:03:13.140> is<00:03:13.290> when<00:03:13.440> I<00:03:13.530> get<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.709> plant<00:03:14.040> I'll<00:03:14.280> plant<00:03:14.579> it

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
do is when I get a plant I'll plant it

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.750 
do is when I get a plant I'll plant it
wait<00:03:15.810> about<00:03:15.930> all<00:03:16.410> at<00:03:16.680> least<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.099> month<00:03:17.370> that<00:03:17.610> way

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
everything fills out and I can see what

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.979 
everything fills out and I can see what
you<00:03:20.130> need<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.519> cut<00:03:20.760> now<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.329> cuttings<00:03:21.900> that

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
planted as long as you give them about

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.580 
planted as long as you give them about
anywhere<00:03:30.180> between<00:03:30.239> five<00:03:30.780> to<00:03:30.810> seven<00:03:31.350> days<00:03:31.560> to

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
anywhere between five to seven days to

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.949 
anywhere between five to seven days to
heal<00:03:32.220> you<00:03:32.940> can<00:03:33.120> use<00:03:33.269> them<00:03:33.420> as<00:03:33.510> cuttings<00:03:33.870> and

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
heal you can use them as cuttings and

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.990 
heal you can use them as cuttings and
they're<00:03:34.139> actually<00:03:34.620> very<00:03:34.650> excellent<00:03:35.489> cuttings

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
they're actually very excellent cuttings

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.720 
they're actually very excellent cuttings
because<00:03:36.389> they<00:03:36.540> want<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:37.049> root<00:03:37.230> immediately<00:03:38.010> so

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
because they want to root immediately so

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.610 
because they want to root immediately so
what<00:03:38.880> you<00:03:39.000> want<00:03:39.180> to<00:03:39.269> do<00:03:41.870> is<00:03:42.870> look<00:03:43.139> for<00:03:43.170> a<00:03:43.380> piece

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
what you want to do is look for a piece

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.160 
what you want to do is look for a piece
to<00:03:43.799> tend<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.130> dried<00:03:44.430> out<00:03:44.670> not<00:03:45.510> doing<00:03:45.930> anything

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
to tend to dried out not doing anything

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.710 
to tend to dried out not doing anything
okay<00:03:47.930> and<00:03:48.930> then<00:03:49.260> you<00:03:49.350> slip<00:03:49.620> it<00:03:49.769> off<00:03:49.920> like<00:03:50.160> I<00:03:50.280> did

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
okay and then you slip it off like I did

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.979 
okay and then you slip it off like I did
right<00:03:52.220> close<00:03:53.299> now<00:03:54.299> whenever<00:03:54.540> you<00:03:54.780> take<00:03:54.930> a
