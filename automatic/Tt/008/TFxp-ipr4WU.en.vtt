hi guys welcome to another blog
spotlight<00:00:08.800> and<00:00:09.160> today<00:00:09.940> we're<00:00:10.180> going<00:00:10.270> to<00:00:10.360> be

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:10.420 
spotlight and today we're going to be

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.750 
spotlight and today we're going to be
taking<00:00:10.840> a<00:00:10.990> look<00:00:11.139> at<00:00:11.469> another<00:00:12.040> extra<00:00:12.550> B's

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:12.760 
taking a look at another extra B's

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.670 
taking a look at another extra B's
machine<00:00:13.209> this<00:00:13.990> time<00:00:14.230> we're<00:00:14.350> gonna<00:00:14.410> have<00:00:14.650> a

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:14.680 
machine this time we're gonna have a

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.220 
machine this time we're gonna have a
look<00:00:14.799> at<00:00:14.950> the<00:00:15.070> gene<00:00:15.309> pool<00:00:15.639> and<00:00:15.910> the<00:00:16.780> gene<00:00:16.990> pool

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
look at the gene pool and the gene pool

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.050 
look at the gene pool and the gene pool
is<00:00:17.500> the<00:00:18.600> first<00:00:19.600> step<00:00:19.990> in<00:00:20.260> in<00:00:20.560> some<00:00:20.860> of<00:00:20.980> the<00:00:21.190> more

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
is the first step in in some of the more

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.380 
is the first step in in some of the more
advanced<00:00:22.750> extra<00:00:23.110> B's<00:00:23.260> processes<00:00:24.240> there<00:00:25.240> are

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:25.390 
advanced extra B's processes there are

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.470 
advanced extra B's processes there are
other<00:00:25.650> more<00:00:26.650> advanced<00:00:27.070> machines<00:00:27.430> and<00:00:27.790> they

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480 
other more advanced machines and they

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.540 
other more advanced machines and they
kind<00:00:28.750> of<00:00:28.810> build<00:00:29.050> on<00:00:29.230> what<00:00:29.530> this<00:00:29.800> gene<00:00:30.310> pool

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
kind of build on what this gene pool

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.900 
kind of build on what this gene pool
does<00:00:30.880> for<00:00:31.180> you<00:00:31.300> and<00:00:32.190> what<00:00:33.190> it<00:00:33.280> will<00:00:33.399> do<00:00:33.550> for<00:00:33.790> you

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
does for you and what it will do for you

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.049 
does for you and what it will do for you
is<00:00:34.090> it<00:00:34.270> will<00:00:34.420> break<00:00:34.840> down<00:00:35.280> all<00:00:36.280> your<00:00:36.520> surface

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
is it will break down all your surface

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.790 
is it will break down all your surface

storage<00:00:57.100> cars<00:00:57.460> things<00:00:57.880> like<00:00:58.120> that<00:00:58.410> now<00:00:59.790> we

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
storage cars things like that now we

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.360 
storage cars things like that now we
have<00:01:00.940> a<00:01:00.970> look<00:01:01.149> at<00:01:01.270> the<00:01:01.329> interface<00:01:02.070> as<00:01:03.070> you<00:01:03.130> can

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
have a look at the interface as you can

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.310 
have a look at the interface as you can
see<00:01:03.550> it<00:01:03.760> looks<00:01:04.089> a<00:01:04.299> little<00:01:04.390> bit<00:01:04.629> different<00:01:05.049> to

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
see it looks a little bit different to

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.649 
see it looks a little bit different to
probably<00:01:05.950> most<00:01:06.219> other<00:01:06.520> machines<00:01:07.030> and<00:01:07.360> that<00:01:07.509> it

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
probably most other machines and that it

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.660 
probably most other machines and that it
incorporates<00:01:08.229> itself<00:01:08.920> with<00:01:09.190> your<00:01:09.400> inventory

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
incorporates itself with your inventory

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.480 
incorporates itself with your inventory
why<00:01:12.670> does<00:01:12.940> that<00:01:12.970> I'm<00:01:13.240> not<00:01:13.420> entirely<00:01:13.690> sure<00:01:13.840> but

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
why does that I'm not entirely sure but

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.430 
why does that I'm not entirely sure but
this<00:01:15.490> bar<00:01:15.850> on<00:01:16.060> the<00:01:16.150> left<00:01:16.360> hand<00:01:16.540> side<00:01:16.810> is<00:01:17.140> your

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
this bar on the left hand side is your

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.860 
this bar on the left hand side is your
power<00:01:17.680> bar<00:01:17.979> and<00:01:18.700> it<00:01:18.850> takes<00:01:19.060> bill<00:01:19.299> craft<00:01:19.600> power

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:19.870 
power bar and it takes bill craft power

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.810 
power bar and it takes bill craft power
so<00:01:20.200> you're<00:01:20.350> gonna<00:01:20.470> need<00:01:21.630> one<00:01:22.630> of<00:01:22.659> the<00:01:22.810> engines

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
so you're gonna need one of the engines

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.359 
so you're gonna need one of the engines
or<00:01:24.820> some<00:01:25.240> of<00:01:25.330> the<00:01:25.420> engines<00:01:25.780> to<00:01:25.960> power<00:01:26.170> it<00:01:26.409> with

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
or some of the engines to power it with

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:28.950 
or some of the engines to power it with
the<00:01:27.430> exception<00:01:27.940> of<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.180> redstone<00:01:28.600> engine

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
the exception of the redstone engine

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.539 
the exception of the redstone engine
which<00:01:29.110> won't<00:01:29.440> be<00:01:29.530> strong<00:01:29.830> enough<00:01:29.890> you've<00:01:30.340> got

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:30.549 
which won't be strong enough you've got

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.170 
which won't be strong enough you've got
the<00:01:30.670> Stirling<00:01:31.060> engine<00:01:31.180> combustion<00:01:32.020> 'he's<00:01:33.180> the

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
the Stirling engine combustion 'he's the

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.060 
the Stirling engine combustion 'he's the
railcraft<00:01:34.570> engine<00:01:35.110> so<00:01:35.260> we've<00:01:35.409> got<00:01:35.619> installed

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
railcraft engine so we've got installed

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.940 
railcraft engine so we've got installed
and<00:01:36.400> the<00:01:36.520> red<00:01:36.760> power<00:01:37.030> one<00:01:37.330> same<00:01:38.170> expansion

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
and the red power one same expansion

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.350 
and the red power one same expansion
forestry<00:01:39.939> they<00:01:40.840> will<00:01:41.049> all<00:01:41.200> do<00:01:41.409> the<00:01:41.530> job<00:01:41.799> and<00:01:42.360> if

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
forestry they will all do the job and if

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.910 
forestry they will all do the job and if
you<00:01:43.540> also<00:01:43.689> look<00:01:43.930> at<00:01:44.049> the<00:01:44.110> tooltip<00:01:44.500> it<00:01:44.680> says

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
you also look at the tooltip it says

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.399 
you also look at the tooltip it says
that<00:01:45.100> it's<00:01:45.250> going<00:01:45.400> to<00:01:45.460> use<00:01:45.790> five<00:01:46.180> MJ<00:01:47.049> a<00:01:47.080> tick

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
that it's going to use five MJ a tick

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.450 
that it's going to use five MJ a tick
and<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:48.490> maximum<00:01:48.729> input<00:01:48.970> is<00:01:49.330> seven<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.860> that

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
and the maximum input is seven so that

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.340 
and the maximum input is seven so that
gives<00:01:51.640> you<00:01:51.759> an<00:01:51.880> idea<00:01:52.060> of<00:01:52.330> how<00:01:52.659> much<00:01:52.840> power<00:01:53.200> it's

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
gives you an idea of how much power it's

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.249 
gives you an idea of how much power it's
going<00:01:53.470> to<00:01:53.590> use<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:55.420> get<00:01:55.600> it<00:01:55.689> running<00:01:55.810> all<00:01:56.080> the

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
going to use to get it running all the

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:57.899 
going to use to get it running all the
time<00:01:56.470> you're<00:01:56.680> going<00:01:56.770> to<00:01:56.830> need<00:01:57.009> five<00:01:57.369> stirling

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
time you're going to need five stirling

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.590 
time you're going to need five stirling
engines<00:01:58.299> or<00:01:59.310> one<00:02:00.310> by<00:02:00.549> a<00:02:00.580> gas<00:02:00.880> engine<00:02:01.180> running

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
engines or one by a gas engine running

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.550 
engines or one by a gas engine running
on<00:02:01.689> biomass<00:02:03.720> combustion<00:02:04.720> engine<00:02:05.200> running<00:02:05.470> on

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
on biomass combustion engine running on

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.850 
on biomass combustion engine running on
fuel<00:02:05.950> will<00:02:06.159> be<00:02:06.369> I<00:02:06.729> think<00:02:07.329> it's<00:02:07.450> 6<00:02:07.780> MJ<00:02:08.289> now<00:02:08.500> so

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
fuel will be I think it's 6 MJ now so

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.410 
fuel will be I think it's 6 MJ now so
that's<00:02:09.069> a<00:02:09.459> little<00:02:09.849> bit<00:02:10.060> stronger<00:02:10.509> but<00:02:12.000> is<00:02:13.000> well

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
that's a little bit stronger but is well

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.110 
that's a little bit stronger but is well
within<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:14.560> maximum<00:02:15.010> input<00:02:15.160> so<00:02:15.730> you<00:02:15.790> should

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
within the maximum input so you should

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.530 
within the maximum input so you should
be<00:02:16.209> fine<00:02:16.420> with<00:02:16.480> that

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
be fine with that

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.790 
be fine with that
otherwise<00:02:19.540> you<00:02:19.990> would<00:02:20.230> you<00:02:20.380> will<00:02:20.590> need<00:02:20.770> a

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
otherwise you would you will need a

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.699 
otherwise you would you will need a
regular<00:02:21.580> BuildCraft<00:02:21.940> engine<00:02:22.420> or<00:02:23.020> in<00:02:23.230> fact<00:02:23.470> a

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
regular BuildCraft engine or in fact a

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.320 
regular BuildCraft engine or in fact a
redstone<00:02:23.980> energy<00:02:24.430> cell<00:02:24.700> which<00:02:24.850> is<00:02:25.030> what<00:02:25.180> I'm

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
redstone energy cell which is what I'm

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.030 
redstone energy cell which is what I'm
going<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.569> be<00:02:25.690> using<00:02:26.080> and<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.620> redstone

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
going to be using and the redstone

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.340 
going to be using and the redstone
energy<00:02:27.370> cell<00:02:27.640> if<00:02:27.819> you<00:02:27.910> haven't<00:02:28.240> seen<00:02:28.450> it<00:02:28.630> I'll

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
energy cell if you haven't seen it I'll

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.410 
energy cell if you haven't seen it I'll
have<00:02:29.590> a<00:02:29.620> spotlight<00:02:30.280> on<00:02:30.459> that<00:02:30.490> it<00:02:30.880> basically

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
have a spotlight on that it basically

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.559 
have a spotlight on that it basically
stores<00:02:31.780> BuildCraft<00:02:32.200> energy<00:02:32.709> for<00:02:32.920> you<00:02:33.069> and<00:02:33.569> you

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
stores BuildCraft energy for you and you

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.440 
stores BuildCraft energy for you and you
can<00:02:35.040> let<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.069> energy<00:02:36.340> out<00:02:36.580> a<00:02:36.940> controlled

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
can let that energy out a controlled

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.670 
can let that energy out a controlled
rate<00:02:38.489> configurable<00:02:39.489> rate<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:41.290> I'll<00:02:41.440> be<00:02:41.560> using

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
rate configurable rate so I'll be using

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.710 
rate configurable rate so I'll be using
that<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:42.130> power<00:02:42.280> this<00:02:42.520> just<00:02:42.910> to<00:02:43.390> keep<00:02:43.540> things

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
that to power this just to keep things

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.140 
that to power this just to keep things

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.370 
gene pool now the rest of this as you
can<00:02:50.739> see<00:02:50.860> here<00:02:51.480> it's<00:02:52.480> complaining<00:02:52.930> that<00:02:53.170> it's

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
can see here it's complaining that it's

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.220 
can see here it's complaining that it's
gotten<00:02:53.620> though<00:02:53.739> be<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:55.150> B's<00:02:55.360> go<00:02:55.630> in<00:02:55.780> this<00:02:55.959> left

hand<00:02:56.410> side<00:02:56.709> here<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:59.130> this<00:03:00.130> is<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.550> tank<00:03:00.790> for

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
the DNA the resulting DNA so let's have

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.570 
the DNA the resulting DNA so let's have
a<00:03:04.569> look<00:03:04.690> at<00:03:04.840> how<00:03:04.989> we<00:03:05.050> make<00:03:05.410> this<00:03:05.650> machine<00:03:05.920> now

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
a look at how we make this machine now

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.470 
a look at how we make this machine now
it's<00:03:07.920> it's<00:03:08.920> a<00:03:09.010> three-step<00:03:09.519> process<00:03:09.550> I<00:03:10.269> guess

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
it's it's a three-step process I guess

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.640 
it's it's a three-step process I guess
and<00:03:11.340> it<00:03:12.340> starts<00:03:12.790> with<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:14.500> a<00:03:15.010> pious<00:03:15.430> machine

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
and it starts with the a pious machine

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:21.750 
and it starts with the a pious machine
which<00:03:18.269> is<00:03:19.269> the<00:03:19.540> basic<00:03:19.989> machine<00:03:20.709> block<00:03:21.160> the

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
which is the basic machine block the

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.509 
which is the basic machine block the
extra<00:03:22.090> B's<00:03:22.269> ads<00:03:22.510> and<00:03:22.870> that's<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.920> steady<00:03:24.220> case

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
extra B's ads and that's the steady case

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.220 
extra B's ads and that's the steady case
with<00:03:24.820> the<00:03:24.940> cop<00:03:25.120> on<00:03:25.329> the<00:03:25.450> side<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:26.019> the

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
with the cop on the side and the

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.789 
with the cop on the side and the
redstone<00:03:26.620> up<00:03:26.769> above<00:03:27.549> below<00:03:28.110> so<00:03:29.110> that<00:03:29.440> is<00:03:29.620> the

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
redstone up above below so that is the

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.250 
redstone up above below so that is the
basic<00:03:30.160> one<00:03:30.340> and<00:03:30.400> that's<00:03:30.730> the<00:03:31.360> same<00:03:31.570> machine

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
basic one and that's the same machine

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.710 
basic one and that's the same machine
that<00:03:32.470> you<00:03:32.620> use<00:03:32.920> to<00:03:33.130> make<00:03:33.280> so<00:03:34.090> the<00:03:34.239> data<00:03:34.480> bank

and<00:04:30.449> one<00:04:31.449> thing<00:04:31.690> to<00:04:31.720> note<00:04:32.910> is<00:04:33.910> that<00:04:34.830> it<00:04:35.830> doesn't

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
and one thing to note is that it doesn't

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.390 
and one thing to note is that it doesn't
cope<00:04:36.639> particularly<00:04:37.449> well<00:04:37.660> with<00:04:38.400> stacked

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
cope particularly well with stacked

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.600 
cope particularly well with stacked
drones<00:04:39.760> at<00:04:40.030> the<00:04:40.090> moment<00:04:40.389> and<00:04:41.130> stack<00:04:42.130> drones<00:04:42.430> is

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
drones at the moment and stack drones is

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.930 
drones at the moment and stack drones is
something<00:04:42.880> the<00:04:44.070> forestry<00:04:45.070> is<00:04:45.190> recently<00:04:45.639> added

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
something the forestry is recently added

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.560 
something the forestry is recently added
but<00:04:46.660> if<00:04:46.900> you<00:04:47.110> put<00:04:47.410> a<00:04:47.560> stack<00:04:47.889> of<00:04:47.919> drones<00:04:48.340> if<00:04:49.300> I<00:04:49.510> do

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
but if you put a stack of drones if I do

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.890 
but if you put a stack of drones if I do
that<00:04:49.840> you<00:04:50.710> will<00:04:50.830> see<00:04:50.860> you<00:04:51.280> only<00:04:51.490> get<00:04:51.850> the<00:04:52.630> same

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
that you will see you only get the same

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.870 
that you will see you only get the same
amount<00:04:53.199> of<00:04:54.870> DNA<00:04:55.870> as<00:04:56.229> you<00:04:56.440> would<00:04:56.620> from<00:04:56.770> one<00:04:57.100> it's

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
amount of DNA as you would from one it's

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.379 
amount of DNA as you would from one it's
not<00:04:58.210> really<00:04:58.660> working<00:04:58.900> currently<00:04:59.320> and<00:05:00.210> we<00:05:01.210> can

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:01.389 
not really working currently and we can

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:03.300 
not really working currently and we can
put<00:05:01.540> any<00:05:01.750> kind<00:05:02.229> of<00:05:02.380> drone<00:05:02.560> in<00:05:02.710> here<00:05:02.889> so<00:05:03.100> if<00:05:03.190> I

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
put any kind of drone in here so if I

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.840 
put any kind of drone in here so if I
put<00:05:03.550> in<00:05:03.729> some<00:05:04.720> more<00:05:04.870> tests<00:05:05.229> and<00:05:05.530> the<00:05:06.460> best<00:05:06.639> bet

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
put in some more tests and the best bet

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.870 
put in some more tests and the best bet
is<00:05:07.150> to<00:05:07.180> put<00:05:07.539> them<00:05:07.690> in<00:05:07.810> individually<00:05:08.410> like<00:05:08.590> that

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
is to put them in individually like that

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.219 
is to put them in individually like that
which<00:05:09.880> is<00:05:10.300> going<00:05:10.419> to<00:05:10.510> make<00:05:10.660> it<00:05:10.840> a<00:05:10.900> little<00:05:11.020> bit

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
which is going to make it a little bit

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:14.510 
which is going to make it a little bit
awkward<00:05:11.800> right<00:05:12.280> now<00:05:12.550> to<00:05:12.729> to<00:05:13.690> actually

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
awkward right now to to actually

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.189 
awkward right now to to actually
automate<00:05:15.520> this<00:05:15.910> process<00:05:16.000> because<00:05:16.780> these<00:05:16.990> bees

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199 
automate this process because these bees

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:20.550 
automate this process because these bees
are<00:05:17.229> naturally<00:05:17.770> going<00:05:17.919> to<00:05:17.979> stack<00:05:19.380> you<00:05:20.380> could

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
are naturally going to stack you could

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.200 
are naturally going to stack you could
possibly<00:05:20.919> do<00:05:21.130> it<00:05:21.190> with<00:05:21.310> the<00:05:21.370> router<00:05:21.580> I<00:05:21.910> guess

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
possibly do it with the router I guess

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.990 
possibly do it with the router I guess
and<00:05:24.060> yeah<00:05:25.090> that<00:05:25.750> would<00:05:25.870> be<00:05:26.050> my<00:05:26.229> best<00:05:26.440> bet<00:05:27.000> but

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
and yeah that would be my best bet but

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.790 
and yeah that would be my best bet but
otherwise<00:05:28.419> you're<00:05:28.960> probably<00:05:29.229> gonna<00:05:29.470> have<00:05:29.680> to

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
otherwise you're probably gonna have to

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.379 
otherwise you're probably gonna have to
do<00:05:29.919> this<00:05:30.039> manually<00:05:30.490> for<00:05:30.760> the<00:05:30.880> time<00:05:31.090> being

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:31.389 
do this manually for the time being

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:35.610 
do this manually for the time being
until<00:05:32.370> until<00:05:33.370> this<00:05:33.490> gets<00:05:33.729> bug<00:05:34.630> fix<00:05:34.870> or<00:05:35.169> born

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
until until this gets bug fix or born

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.909 
until until this gets bug fix or born
up-to-date<00:05:36.099> with<00:05:36.280> the<00:05:36.340> delays<00:05:36.880> forestry<00:05:37.919> so

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 
up-to-date with the delays forestry so

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.370 
up-to-date with the delays forestry so
as<00:05:39.070> you<00:05:39.160> can<00:05:39.280> see<00:05:39.490> this<00:05:39.639> is<00:05:40.289> generating<00:05:41.289> this

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
as you can see this is generating this

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.370 
as you can see this is generating this
DNA<00:05:41.830> which<00:05:42.729> is<00:05:42.910> this<00:05:43.030> very<00:05:43.300> funky<00:05:43.810> pink<00:05:44.050> color

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
DNA which is this very funky pink color

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.890 
DNA which is this very funky pink color
and<00:05:44.849> that's<00:05:45.849> going<00:05:46.120> into<00:05:46.270> this<00:05:46.419> build<00:05:46.690> craft

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
and that's going into this build craft

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.029 
and that's going into this build craft
Hank<00:05:47.849> she's<00:05:48.849> very<00:05:49.270> cool<00:05:49.539> and<00:05:49.810> there<00:05:50.620> are<00:05:50.800> other

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 
Hank she's very cool and there are other

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:54.180 
Hank she's very cool and there are other
machines<00:05:51.250> I<00:05:51.700> want<00:05:51.970> that<00:05:52.780> will<00:05:53.590> make<00:05:53.830> use<00:05:54.130> of

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
machines I want that will make use of

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:58.200 
machines I want that will make use of
this<00:05:54.520> DNA<00:05:55.030> and<00:05:56.010> I<00:05:57.010> will<00:05:57.430> cover<00:05:57.610> those<00:05:57.880> in<00:05:58.120> the

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
this DNA and I will cover those in the

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.350 
this DNA and I will cover those in the
next<00:05:58.330> few<00:05:58.599> days<00:05:58.979> I'll<00:05:59.979> cover<00:06:00.490> the<00:06:00.699> process<00:06:00.940> in

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
next few days I'll cover the process in

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.750 
next few days I'll cover the process in
the<00:06:01.419> next<00:06:01.660> few<00:06:01.810> days<00:06:01.930> should<00:06:02.260> I<00:06:02.320> say<00:06:02.639> so<00:06:03.639> there

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
the next few days should I say so there

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.300 
the next few days should I say so there
we<00:06:03.849> go<00:06:03.940> guys<00:06:04.120> there's<00:06:04.479> the<00:06:04.630> gene<00:06:04.840> pool<00:06:05.310> it's

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
we go guys there's the gene pool it's

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.100 
we go guys there's the gene pool it's
doing<00:06:06.699> this<00:06:06.789> thing<00:06:07.090> it's<00:06:07.389> you<00:06:07.750> can<00:06:07.870> see<00:06:08.050> it

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
doing this thing it's you can see it

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.860 
doing this thing it's you can see it
does<00:06:08.289> work<00:06:08.530> fairly<00:06:09.010> quickly<00:06:09.430> so<00:06:12.570> you<00:06:13.570> won't<00:06:13.750> be

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
does work fairly quickly so you won't be

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.180 
does work fairly quickly so you won't be
hanging<00:06:14.020> around<00:06:14.169> too<00:06:14.530> long<00:06:14.710> if<00:06:14.860> you<00:06:15.010> often

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:15.190 
hanging around too long if you often

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.480 
hanging around too long if you often
need<00:06:15.610> manually<00:06:16.710> so<00:06:17.710> I<00:06:17.740> guess<00:06:18.070> that<00:06:18.280> really

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
need manually so I guess that really

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.040 
need manually so I guess that really
depends<00:06:18.849> how<00:06:18.970> many<00:06:19.150> bees<00:06:19.330> you've<00:06:19.570> got

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
depends how many bees you've got

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.990 
depends how many bees you've got
I<00:06:20.080> know<00:06:20.680> bees<00:06:20.919> can<00:06:21.190> go<00:06:21.220> out<00:06:21.490> of<00:06:21.550> hand<00:06:21.760> quite

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
I know bees can go out of hand quite

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.320 
I know bees can go out of hand quite
