00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.870 

I'm<00:01:47.320> not<00:01:47.530> that<00:01:47.770> far<00:01:48.040> into<00:01:48.190> the<00:01:48.340> game<00:01:48.370> currently

days<00:01:51.880> ago<00:01:55.260> there<00:01:56.260> is<00:01:56.470> a<00:01:56.500> bit<00:01:56.890> of<00:01:56.920> lag<00:01:57.280> right<00:01:57.310> now

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.510 

but<00:02:05.170> I'm<00:02:05.290> assuming<00:02:05.410> it's<00:02:05.770> just<00:02:06.040> the<00:02:06.160> room<00:02:06.369> that

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
but I'm assuming it's just the room that

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:19.510 
but I'm assuming it's just the room that
was<00:02:06.610> giving<00:02:06.880> me<00:02:07.000> lag

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:48.059

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.270 

walking<00:02:48.939> through<00:02:48.969> little<00:02:49.329> tunnels<00:02:49.719> is<00:02:49.870> fine

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
walking through little tunnels is fine

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.250 
walking through little tunnels is fine
it<00:02:51.280> wasn't<00:02:51.459> too<00:02:51.670> concerned<00:02:51.819> about<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.480> it's

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
it wasn't too concerned about the it's

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.989 
it wasn't too concerned about the it's
mainly<00:02:53.439> the<00:02:53.620> big<00:02:53.889> rooms<00:02:54.159> and<00:02:54.430> battle<00:02:54.760> scenes

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:54.999 
mainly the big rooms and battle scenes

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:56.550 
mainly the big rooms and battle scenes
that<00:02:55.299> I<00:02:55.359> have<00:02:55.659> a<00:02:55.689> little<00:02:55.989> bit<00:02:56.170> of<00:02:56.200> a<00:02:56.290> problem

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
that I have a little bit of a problem

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:44.700 
that I have a little bit of a problem
with<00:02:56.889> when<00:02:57.189> I<00:02:57.599> displaying<00:02:58.599> it<00:02:58.719> on<00:02:58.780> both<00:02:59.049> scream

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:44.710 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.500 

a<00:03:44.830> little<00:03:45.430> bit<00:03:45.520> of<00:03:45.610> lag<00:03:45.790> but<00:03:46.000> then<00:03:46.150> it<00:03:46.270> starts

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
a little bit of lag but then it starts

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.170 
a little bit of lag but then it starts
to<00:03:46.660> smooth<00:03:46.960> out
