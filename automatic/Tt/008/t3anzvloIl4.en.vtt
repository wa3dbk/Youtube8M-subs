00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
boosting shot color black because I

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.119

guessing um it will shoot around 600
feet<00:05:35.319> because<00:05:36.129> there's<00:05:36.399> like<00:05:36.669> the<00:05:37.119> same<00:05:37.330> shop

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:37.539 
feet because there's like the same shop

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:44.119 
feet because there's like the same shop
out<00:05:37.749> it<00:05:38.289> ten<00:05:38.649> times<00:05:38.830> more<00:05:40.379> think<00:05:41.639> it<00:05:42.639> has<00:05:42.879> more

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:44.129 
out it ten times more think it has more

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:49.619 
out it ten times more think it has more
strength<00:05:46.409> and<00:05:47.409> this<00:05:48.069> is<00:05:48.219> how<00:05:48.369> is<00:05:48.580> straight<00:05:48.909> it

00:05:49.619 --> 00:05:49.629 
strength and this is how is straight it

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:52.619 
strength and this is how is straight it
if<00:05:50.319> it<00:05:50.469> doesn't<00:05:50.769> curl<00:05:50.949> or<00:05:51.189> nothing<00:05:51.639> that<00:05:52.360> mines
