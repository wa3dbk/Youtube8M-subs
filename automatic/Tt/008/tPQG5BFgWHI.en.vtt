00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
way of doing it because the way it used

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.800 
way of doing it because the way it used
to<00:00:25.500> be<00:00:25.650> was<00:00:25.830> some<00:00:26.010> cars<00:00:26.670> get<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.000> use<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.150> magnet

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
to be was some cars get to use a magnet

who<00:00:38.190> would<00:00:38.280> get<00:00:38.579> tire<00:00:38.820> pressure<00:00:39.120> monitors

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
who would get tire pressure monitors

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.900 
who would get tire pressure monitors
were<00:00:39.660> like<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.200> fancy<00:00:40.440> Cadillacs<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.520> Buicks

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
were like the fancy Cadillacs and Buicks

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.340 
were like the fancy Cadillacs and Buicks
and<00:00:42.120> usually<00:00:42.809> people<00:00:43.079> who<00:00:43.170> could<00:00:43.320> afford

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
and usually people who could afford

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.709 
and usually people who could afford
those<00:00:43.920> well<00:00:44.550> they<00:00:44.700> can<00:00:44.850> go<00:00:44.969> afford<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.570> go<00:00:45.660> to

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
those well they can go afford to go to

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.240 
those well they can go afford to go to
the<00:00:45.840> dealer<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.260> have<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.559> sensors<00:00:46.920> learned

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
the dealer to have the sensors learned

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.760 
the dealer to have the sensors learned
that's<00:00:47.789> not<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.180> case<00:00:48.360> anymore<00:00:48.719> all<00:00:49.260> cars

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
that's not the case anymore all cars

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.680 
that's not the case anymore all cars
including<00:00:50.489> this<00:00:50.579> basic<00:00:51.059> Cobalt

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
including this basic Cobalt

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.229 
including this basic Cobalt
must<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.379> these<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.340> think<00:00:53.699> they<00:00:53.850> made<00:00:54.059> it

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
must have these so I think they made it

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.260 
must have these so I think they made it
so<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.780> want<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.320> need<00:00:55.469> such<00:00:55.710> fancy<00:00:56.160> crap<00:00:56.489> now

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
so you want to need such fancy crap now

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.360 
so you want to need such fancy crap now
first<00:00:57.899> proceed<00:00:58.410> first<00:00:58.770> thing<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.980> want<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.190> do

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
first proceed first thing you want to do

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.700 
first proceed first thing you want to do
you<00:00:59.579> want<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.789> bring<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.059> up<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.180> about<00:01:00.449> 60<00:01:01.050> psi

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
you want to bring it up to about 60 psi

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.200 
you want to bring it up to about 60 psi
because<00:01:02.280> part<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:02.640> procedure<00:01:02.879> is

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
because part of this procedure is

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.200 
because part of this procedure is
deflating<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.229> tire<00:01:04.850> you<00:01:05.850> don't<00:01:06.000> want<00:01:06.119> to

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
deflating the tire you don't want to

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.510 
deflating the tire you don't want to
start<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.540> 30<00:01:06.869> because<00:01:07.439> then<00:01:07.740> you'll<00:01:08.159> flatten

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
start a 30 because then you'll flatten

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.219 
start a 30 because then you'll flatten
the<00:01:08.729> tire<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.360> if<00:01:09.510> you're<00:01:09.630> doing<00:01:09.750> this<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.140> the

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
the tire and if you're doing this on the

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.100 
the tire and if you're doing this on the
ground<00:01:10.560> you<00:01:11.430> actually<00:01:11.880> risk<00:01:12.180> pinching<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
ground you actually risk pinching the

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.710 
ground you actually risk pinching the
sidewall<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.040> then<00:01:14.760> you're<00:01:14.939> short<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.450> tire

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
sidewall and then you're short of a tire

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.620 
sidewall and then you're short of a tire
and<00:01:16.049> even<00:01:16.890> this<00:01:17.009> 195<00:01:17.939> 60<00:01:18.479> 15<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:20.150> even<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.390> now

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
and even this 195 60 15 is even that now

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.359 
and even this 195 60 15 is even that now
like<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.960> cheapest<00:01:22.439> one<00:01:22.650> now<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:22.890> think<00:01:23.040> it's

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
like the cheapest one now I think it's

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.270 
like the cheapest one now I think it's
like<00:01:23.520> no<00:01:23.790> less<00:01:24.030> than<00:01:24.210> 60<00:01:24.570> bucks<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.280> definitely

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
like no less than 60 bucks so definitely

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.310 
like no less than 60 bucks so definitely
take<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.640> extra<00:01:26.909> time<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.180> fill<00:01:27.930> them<00:01:28.080> up<00:01:28.140> to

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
take the extra time to fill them up to

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.410 
take the extra time to fill them up to
around<00:01:28.530> 60<00:01:28.680> psi<00:01:29.490> for<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:29.850> procedure<00:01:30.150> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
around 60 psi for this procedure the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.319 
around 60 psi for this procedure the
next<00:01:30.689> thing<00:01:30.900> order<00:01:31.710> does<00:01:32.520> matter<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:33.180> way

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
next thing order does matter the way

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.090 
next thing order does matter the way
this<00:01:33.540> works<00:01:33.900> when<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.290> initiate<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.799> learn

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
this works when you initiate the learn

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.440 
this works when you initiate the learn
mode<00:01:35.340> which<00:01:35.549> I'll<00:01:35.670> show<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:35.880> how<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.060> do<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.360> a

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
mode which I'll show you how to do in a

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.140 
mode which I'll show you how to do in a
moment<00:01:37.790> what<00:01:38.790> will<00:01:38.909> happen<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:40.970> shut<00:01:41.970> up

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
moment what will happen is I shut up

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.780 
moment what will happen is I shut up
yeah<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:42.720> botched<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.710> previous<00:01:44.189> take<00:01:44.460> so<00:01:44.640> this

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
yeah I botched the previous take so this

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.010 
yeah I botched the previous take so this
is<00:01:44.850> actually<00:01:45.060> my<00:01:45.149> second<00:01:45.540> tape<00:01:45.689> but<00:01:45.810> don't

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
is actually my second tape but don't

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.080 
is actually my second tape but don't
worry<00:01:46.170> I'm<00:01:46.439> going<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.920> show<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.250> I'm<00:01:47.850> going<00:01:47.970> to

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
worry I'm going to show you I'm going to

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.219 
worry I'm going to show you I'm going to
tell<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.390> everything<00:01:48.509> else<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:48.990> need<00:01:49.110> to

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
tell you everything else you need to

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:49.960 
tell you everything else you need to
know

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
know

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:59.050 
know
so<00:01:50.970> left<00:01:51.899> front<00:01:52.500> right<00:01:54.770> front<00:01:55.939> right<00:01:56.939> rear

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.270 

and<00:01:59.409> left-rear<00:02:00.409> that<00:02:00.710> order<00:02:01.040> does<00:02:01.250> matter

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
and left-rear that order does matter

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.490 
and left-rear that order does matter
because<00:02:02.150> when<00:02:02.360> you<00:02:02.450> start<00:02:02.750> deflating<00:02:03.350> them

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
because when you start deflating them

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.800 
because when you start deflating them
after<00:02:03.710> you<00:02:03.770> initiate<00:02:04.190> the<00:02:04.340> learn<00:02:04.520> mode<00:02:04.810> what's

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
after you initiate the learn mode what's

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.410 
after you initiate the learn mode what's
going<00:02:05.900> to<00:02:06.080> happen<00:02:06.530> is<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:07.580> first<00:02:07.790> sensor<00:02:08.270> it

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
going to happen is the first sensor it

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.620 
going to happen is the first sensor it
sees<00:02:08.660> action<00:02:09.110> from<00:02:09.789> it's<00:02:10.789> going<00:02:11.030> to<00:02:11.090> interpret

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
sees action from it's going to interpret

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.530 
sees action from it's going to interpret
it<00:02:11.780> as<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.730> left-front<00:02:13.730> so<00:02:14.180> let's<00:02:14.390> say<00:02:14.510> I

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
it as the left-front so let's say I

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.690 
it as the left-front so let's say I
started<00:02:14.900> to<00:02:14.959> do<00:02:15.110> this<00:02:15.319> one<00:02:15.590> first<00:02:15.920> and<00:02:16.489> let's

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
started to do this one first and let's

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.699 
started to do this one first and let's
say<00:02:16.819> this<00:02:16.970> was<00:02:17.180> the<00:02:17.330> only<00:02:17.450> tire<00:02:17.750> 50<00:02:18.050> psi<00:02:18.470> it

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
say this was the only tire 50 psi it

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.979 
say this was the only tire 50 psi it
would<00:02:18.800> be<00:02:18.920> saying<00:02:19.190> on<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.489> dash<00:02:19.760> that<00:02:20.090> you<00:02:20.630> are

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
would be saying on the dash that you are

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.130 
would be saying on the dash that you are
50<00:02:21.440> psi<00:02:22.010> on<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:23.000> left<00:02:23.180> front<00:02:23.510> when<00:02:23.840> this<00:02:23.989> is

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
50 psi on the left front when this is

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
50 psi on the left front when this is
really<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:25.430> left<00:02:25.670> rear<00:02:26.470> so<00:02:27.470> order<00:02:27.920> does

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
really the left rear so order does

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.680 
really the left rear so order does
matter<00:02:28.209> so<00:02:29.209> again<00:02:29.510> it's<00:02:29.690> left<00:02:30.500> front<00:02:30.950> right

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
matter so again it's left front right

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.680 
matter so again it's left front right
front<00:02:32.690> right<00:02:33.530> to<00:02:33.739> rear<00:02:34.070> left<00:02:34.730> rear<00:02:35.090> and<00:02:35.660> you

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
front right to rear left rear and you

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.790 
front right to rear left rear and you
have<00:02:36.080> to<00:02:36.230> do<00:02:36.410> it<00:02:36.560> in<00:02:36.739> that<00:02:37.100> order<00:02:37.430> so<00:02:38.440> I<00:02:39.440> am<00:02:39.680> at

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
have to do it in that order so I am at

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.390 
have to do it in that order so I am at
60<00:02:40.310> psi<00:02:40.519> now<00:02:41.090> or<00:02:41.450> maybe<00:02:41.630> a<00:02:41.720> little<00:02:41.840> less<00:02:42.220> like<00:02:43.220> I

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
60 psi now or maybe a little less like I

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.800 
60 psi now or maybe a little less like I
said<00:02:43.580> this<00:02:43.700> is<00:02:43.790> actually<00:02:44.060> a<00:02:44.090> second<00:02:44.510> take<00:02:44.660> I

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
said this is actually a second take I

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.390 
said this is actually a second take I
botched<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.620> first<00:02:45.950> one<00:02:46.250> okay<00:02:47.650> mm-hmm<00:02:48.739> they

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
botched the first one okay mm-hmm they

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.920 
botched the first one okay mm-hmm they
should<00:02:49.580> have<00:02:49.700> a<00:02:49.730> charged<00:02:50.030> battery<00:02:50.300> to<00:02:50.780> of
