00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
watch my pickaxe video the block

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.119 
watch my pickaxe video the block
harvesting<00:00:35.489> level<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:36.230> what<00:00:37.230> kinds<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.829> tools

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
level two that kind of thing but at the

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.420 
level two that kind of thing but at the
moment<00:01:08.850> our<00:01:09.170> custom<00:01:10.170> or<00:01:10.350> doesn't<00:01:11.250> have<00:01:11.400> a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
moment our custom or doesn't have a

moment our custom or doesn't have a
harvest<00:01:11.880> level<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.420> any<00:01:12.689> kind<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.260> pick<00:01:13.439> axe<00:01:13.590> at

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
all can harvest it and the way you

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.980 
all can harvest it and the way you
change<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.119> give<00:01:18.210> their<00:01:18.330> harvest<00:01:18.689> level

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
change this and give their harvest level

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.200 
change this and give their harvest level
is<00:01:19.140> actually<00:01:19.500> very<00:01:19.530> very<00:01:19.920> simple<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.759> just

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
is actually very very simple you just

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.420 
is actually very very simple you just
need<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.689> add<00:01:21.810> one<00:01:22.080> little<00:01:22.530> line<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.070> code<00:01:23.250> and

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
need to add one little line of code and

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.370 
need to add one little line of code and
that<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.820> minecraft<00:01:24.680> forge<00:01:25.680> dot<00:01:26.780> set<00:01:27.780> block

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
that is minecraft forge dot set block

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.679 
that is minecraft forge dot set block
harvest<00:01:28.920> level<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.430> then<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.240> block<00:01:30.450> you

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
harvest level and then the block you

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.600 
harvest level and then the block you
want<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:31.740> case<00:01:31.950> it's<00:01:32.159> going<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.520> be

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
want so in this case it's going to be

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.550 
want so in this case it's going to be
the<00:01:32.729> tutorial<00:01:33.240> or<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.990> doesn't<00:01:34.350> necessarily

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
to mine it with a pickaxe it's actually

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:49.280 
to mine it with a pickaxe it's actually

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
have reasons outside of my control

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.160 
have reasons outside of my control
because<00:04:53.820> it<00:04:53.940> doesn't<00:04:54.240> seem<00:04:54.390> to<00:04:54.540> have

very quickly with an axe and it minds
quickly<00:05:05.130> with<00:05:05.280> the<00:05:05.310> pickaxe<00:05:06.560> but<00:05:07.560> the

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
quickly with the pickaxe but the

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.610 
quickly with the pickaxe but the
reasoning<00:05:08.160> for<00:05:08.190> that<00:05:08.370> is<00:05:08.640> that<00:05:09.020> our<00:05:10.020> pickaxe

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
reasoning for that is that our pickaxe

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.660 
reasoning for that is that our pickaxe
is<00:05:10.970> just<00:05:11.970> such<00:05:12.180> high<00:05:12.450> quality<00:05:12.830> that<00:05:13.830> it<00:05:14.340> can

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
is just such high quality that it can

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.820 
is just such high quality that it can
mine<00:05:14.850> anything<00:05:15.740> rather<00:05:16.740> quickly<00:05:17.750> so<00:05:18.830> that's

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
mine anything rather quickly so that's

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.880 
mine anything rather quickly so that's
it<00:05:20.160> this<00:05:21.000> tutorial<00:05:21.270> I'm<00:05:21.780> not<00:05:22.200> quite<00:05:22.440> sure<00:05:22.470> what

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
it this tutorial I'm not quite sure what

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.410 
it this tutorial I'm not quite sure what
I<00:05:22.920> will<00:05:23.040> talk<00:05:23.430> about<00:05:23.580> in<00:05:23.850> the<00:05:24.000> next<00:05:24.030> tutorial

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
I will talk about in the next tutorial

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.200 
I will talk about in the next tutorial
but<00:05:25.410> I<00:05:25.650> can<00:05:25.950> guarantee<00:05:26.130> it<00:05:26.370> will<00:05:26.730> be<00:05:26.940> something

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
but I can guarantee it will be something

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.060 
but I can guarantee it will be something
