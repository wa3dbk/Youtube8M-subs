00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.320
 Welcome to another video! 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.779
 pc gamer budget here and the channel 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.119
 your very cheap pc gamer video that 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.650
 you can ride for 1,500 reais 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.270
 remembering that this is the new style of 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.009
 video and I'm not putting the 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.779
 prices I find in the river 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.460
 January, it's much cheaper, I'm 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.770
 placing prices only two 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.140
 malls so I'm doing everyone 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.340
 the videos with the price ranges that I 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.420
 I think it's cool to do 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.030
 first I wanted to leave some messages 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.070
 here with you first is the following 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.200
 my channel it is more directed to the 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.680
 public cost benefit what does it want 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.660
 tell 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.670
 I give you tips that you do not want 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.930
 spend so much money so buying 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.390
 expensive components 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.400
 the focus of the channel was for this purpose and 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.260
 because of this some components are 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.450
 much cheaper than the ones you are 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.550
 accustomed to seeing there the pc gamer much 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.380
 He then says he has to have memory says 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.170
 with heatsink and the memory has to be 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.850
 with 1600mhz to be able to turn that pcs 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.290
 that I am riding here can not be 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.939
 classified as gamer 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.070
 What I have to say the following to 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:11.110
 me pc gamer it mainly has to 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.539
 run the games for me little importance 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.429
 if the memory has a heatsink not the 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:17.560
 memory clock does not 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:18.850
 a lot of difference and the next message that 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.159
 I want to leave, I have to. 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.200
 decrease the frequency of this type of 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.049
 video because it's being very tiring 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.460
 make this video every week I intend 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.499
 make other series 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.299
 so I wanted to decrease the frequency to 

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:33.039
 two videos of you per month 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.689
 So start what you think about 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:35.229
 this and so are the messages that I had 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.299
 to give 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.649
 so now let's talk about the assembly 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.369
 What did I do here for you? 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:44.380
 follows the video the processor is an efecs 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.969
 4.300 process of entering the emilia it 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.609
 is a quadcore processor are four 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:51.100
 3.8 point garrett cores with 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:53.619
 cache l3 of 4 mega its consumption which is 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.560
 the 95 watt tdp which is very important 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.479
 to know that the socket am3 plus is a 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.700
 processor for input to a machine 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.069
 low cost the best price and I found 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.979
 there was 300 reais and we are going to the next 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:09.580
 component the motherboard is a frost 78 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.830
 lmp trace s2 indian much in recommend 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.810
 much this motherboard as it is input 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.150
 has very basic characteristics 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.020
 even she does not have exact and gigabit by 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.450
 second 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:23.050
 before up to 3 megabits per second supports 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.060
 memory up to 1333 mhz and a maximum of 16 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.610
 gigas the price that I found of it smaller 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.890
 was 140 reais and we are going to 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.230
 ram memory is a very 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.090
 controversy when it comes to pc gamer 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.670
 many people think that for a pc gamer to 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.650
 memory has to be 1600mhz item that 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.270
 It has a heatsink I do not know 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.950
 advantage of having a heatsink 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.560
 memory that does not 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.810
 How are you, but let's go there. 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.940
 I wanted to put this memory and kingston 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.790
 the model is pretty basic even the most 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.500
 cheap possible this memory of 1333 mhz 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.720
 and how are you seeing there I put 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.800
 a four gigabyte foot and another 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.570
 2 gb 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.370
 this is because there are some games that 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:04.030
 they use more than four gigas per 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.430
 example the beque 4 10 has memories r $ 241 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.250
 and the prices of each comb are 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.880
 Seeing the HD there I chose a more basic one 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.160
 or even a Samsung 5400 rpm type 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.830
 sata 2 or second type electricity 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.550
 its size of 500 standard twirls 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:24.130
 price of 7 78 and we go to the office 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.709
 the cabinet galley is a winick was that 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.280
 leave your office very basic as 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:33.160
 you can see it has a sbt point 0 2s b 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.680
 2.0 microphones chop and its price is 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.200
 approximately 115 reais which is very 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.000
 cheap and as you can see he takes it 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.040
 the source at the bottom and is a 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.630
 cheaper cabinet I found that 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.340
 has this characteristic of having a source in 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.290
 bottom because it's interesting 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.350
 because when you have the source in the 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.390
 the top of the fountain cooler draws air 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.760
 from the inside of the cabinet to the 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.800
 source this can damage there then it is well 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.350
 important thing I did not understand and 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.570
 cabinet with the power supply on the bottom 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.090
 here you could even put 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.980
 standard atx cabinet because the 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.780
 video card is not as powerful and does not 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.340
 will thus send an unbearable heat 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.440
 by cabinet 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.700
 but as I found a cheap and 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.890
 which has this characteristic 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.900
 I decided to join the useful to the pleasant then 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.570
 there is the video card chosen for 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.430
 this configuration with seven more 250x 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.990
 this model that you see the 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:24.970
 gigabyte I put this model of the 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.580
 gigabyte for the price but you can 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.560
 put from other brands like xfx a 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.630
 faetec and other automakers 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.400
 that has this chip as characteristics to 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.419
 You can emphasize that put it that 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:40.570
 is 1,050 megasex are 645 processes is 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.980
 only has 1gb of memory gddr5 the size 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.080
 of the video card's memory does not 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.419
 influences nothing in your games 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.810
 interface is 128 bit and the memory 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:52.210
 these influences is 4,500 in the 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.520
 gazeta your telÃª pt is also something very 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.380
 important is 95 watts which is well 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.300
 reduced and you can place a 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.370
 source of 400 watts of good 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.050
 quality that will be able to withstand a 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.760
 configuration using this 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.510
 video the lowest price I found was of 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.919
 338 reais and follow the next opponent 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:12.160
 next component for me one of the most 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:14.650
 important is the source chose 6 x 4 130 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.600
 watts boats is a very cool model I 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.880
 even I have one is a source that has a 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.520
 very good quality has been 80 plus 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.560
 which will ensure an efficiency has pfc 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.350
 active and the guarantee of a good 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.600
 power to your pc will export from 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.729
 good configuration in fact up to 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.820
 support a great future she supports 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:36.010
 up to a gtx 660 quietly I even 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.979
 could put sources like her price 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.930
 such as conga sl 400 or 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:43.810
 but the soul of 400 watts 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.700
 but this one has the long cabling and 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.450
 how cabinet holds strong in the part 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.610
 bottom 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.680
 perhaps the four- pin cable that connects 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.229
 that gives energy the processor does not arrive 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.039
 on the motherboard and this could prevent the pc 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:55.780
 to function 

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:58.240
 but if you want to put the source 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.250
 cheaper I recommend to run 400 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.200
 watts only in that case you will have to 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.550
 place an enclosure with the bridge in the 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.410
 top of the cabinet 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.570
 be sure to always connect the 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.470
 source directly into the outlet do not use 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.810
 stabilizer 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.700
 if you want to use one thing a ruler or 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:15.130
 line filter but never use 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.669
 instability in quality sources 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.110
 guys 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:18.910
 if you want to know why I'm going 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.130
 leave a video link in the description 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.229
 this video comes out with a price 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:25.180
 average of 200 reais and with this 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:27.280
 essential in our budget is the 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.740
 Total in 1512 was real 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.350
 If you liked the video by clicking jewels 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.789
 are favorites because it helps a lot 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:35.500
 Thank you all for the affection. 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:37.479
 that I get on social networks for whom 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.580
 want to enjoy the channel fan page on 

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:42.479
 description of the video a hug to everyone and 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.479
 thanks
