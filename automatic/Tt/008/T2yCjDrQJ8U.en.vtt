funny<00:00:32.969> thing<00:00:33.270> about<00:00:33.360> all<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.719> this<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.170> course

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
funny thing about all of this of course

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.610 
funny thing about all of this of course
is<00:00:34.710> well<00:00:35.160> there<00:00:35.399> are<00:00:35.489> two<00:00:35.520> things<00:00:36.620> firstly

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
is well there are two things firstly

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.560 
is well there are two things firstly
they're<00:00:38.040> using<00:00:38.340> an<00:00:38.550> nvidia<00:00:38.910> graphics<00:00:39.300> card

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
they're using an nvidia graphics card

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.229 
they're using an nvidia graphics card
the<00:00:39.870> second<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.590> that<00:00:41.100> there<00:00:41.579> have<00:00:41.730> been<00:00:42.000> at

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
the second is that there have been at

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.170 
the second is that there have been at
numerous<00:00:42.629> interviews<00:00:43.379> for<00:00:44.280> example<00:00:44.850> peter

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
numerous interviews for example peter

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.760 
numerous interviews for example peter
moore<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.809> told<00:00:47.719> jeff<00:00:48.719> Keeley<00:00:49.350> doing<00:00:49.680> a

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
moore and told jeff Keeley doing a

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
conference interview at e3 that the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.660 
conference interview at e3 that the
games<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.469> are<00:00:52.649> actually<00:00:52.860> showing<00:00:53.190> and

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
games that are actually showing and

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.290 
games that are actually showing and
running<00:00:54.360> on<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:55.350> dev<00:00:55.620> kits<00:00:55.980> were<00:00:56.309> pretty<00:00:57.120> much

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
running on the dev kits were pretty much

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.299 
running on the dev kits were pretty much
exactly<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.960> same<00:00:58.199> specifications<00:00:58.920> as<00:00:59.070> home

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
exactly the same specifications as home

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.459 
exactly the same specifications as home
consoles<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.690> actually<00:01:00.989> turning<00:01:01.170> out<00:01:01.410> to

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
consoles this is actually turning out to

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.609 
consoles this is actually turning out to
not<00:01:01.890> be<00:01:01.920> true<00:01:02.510> because<00:01:03.510> as<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.290> guys<00:01:04.439> are

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
not be true because as you guys are

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:05.899 
not be true because as you guys are
probably<00:01:04.710> aware<00:01:05.040> by<00:01:05.430> now<00:01:05.460> probably

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
probably aware by now probably

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
painstakingly so if your regular viewers

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.530 
painstakingly so if your regular viewers
that's<00:01:08.909> AMD<00:01:09.630> hardware<00:01:10.850> exclusively<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.060> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
that's AMD hardware exclusively in the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.810 
that's AMD hardware exclusively in the
xbox<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.320> by<00:01:13.680> which<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.159> mean<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.400> graphics

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
xbox and by which I mean the graphics

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.350 
xbox and by which I mean the graphics
card<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.210> cpu<00:01:15.950> but<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.580> case<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.240> this

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
card and cpu but on this case in this

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.789 
card and cpu but on this case in this
case<00:01:18.600> you'll<00:01:18.780> i<00:01:18.869> say<00:01:19.110> they're<00:01:19.290> actually<00:01:19.590> using

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
case you'll i say they're actually using

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:26.060 
case you'll i say they're actually using
a<00:01:20.070> gtx<00:01:20.820> 780<00:01:22.490> so<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:24.299> gtx<00:01:24.780> 780<00:01:25.229> has<00:01:25.680> got<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> lot

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
a gtx 780 so the gtx 780 has got a lot

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.670 
a gtx 780 so the gtx 780 has got a lot
more<00:01:26.340> computing<00:01:27.090> power<00:01:27.180> in<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.720> than<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
more computing power in it than the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.580 
more computing power in it than the
mid-range<00:01:29.220> kind<00:01:29.700> of<00:01:29.790> card<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.689> xbox<00:01:31.350> one

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
mid-range kind of card that the xbox one

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.190 
mid-range kind of card that the xbox one
has<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.130> xbox<00:01:32.400> one<00:01:32.790> roughly<00:01:33.450> has<00:01:33.780> the

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
has the xbox one roughly has the

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.560 
has the xbox one roughly has the
computational<00:01:35.159> power<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.729> something<00:01:36.450> like

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
computational power of something like

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:43.100 
computational power of something like
the<00:01:36.960> AMD<00:01:37.409> Radeon<00:01:38.240> 7790<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:40.130> 7790<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.820> it's<00:01:42.810> not

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
the AMD Radeon 7790 so 7790 and it's not

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.350 
the AMD Radeon 7790 so 7790 and it's not
like<00:01:43.409> that's<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.979> bad<00:01:44.189> code<00:01:44.640> but<00:01:45.000> it's<00:01:45.119> by<00:01:45.329> no

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
like that's a bad code but it's by no

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.789 
like that's a bad code but it's by no
means<00:01:45.710> something<00:01:46.710> like<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.950> gtx<00:01:47.430> 780<00:01:48.649> so<00:01:49.649> how

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
means something like the gtx 780 so how

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.590 
means something like the gtx 780 so how
much<00:01:49.920> of<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.159> discrepancy<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.329> there

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
much of a discrepancy that is there

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.310 
much of a discrepancy that is there
between<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.049> gtx<00:01:52.560> 780<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.390> AMD<00:01:54.990> card

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
between the gtx 780 and the AMD card

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.679 
between the gtx 780 and the AMD card
that's<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.130> course<00:01:56.159> inside<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.939> xbox<00:01:57.360> one

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
that's of course inside the xbox one

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.200 
that's of course inside the xbox one
well<00:01:58.140> quite<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.500> bit<00:01:58.799> you're<00:01:59.369> looking<00:01:59.670> at<00:01:59.820> just

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
well quite a bit you're looking at just

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.139 
well quite a bit you're looking at just
under<00:02:00.450> four<00:02:01.140> gflops<00:02:02.869> 3.97<00:02:03.869> 78<00:02:04.740> gflops<00:02:05.189> based

the card inside there
box1<00:02:14.709> indeed<00:02:15.709> there<00:02:15.980> was<00:02:16.069> actually<00:02:16.489> someone

because<00:02:38.180> there's<00:02:38.599> something<00:02:38.900> even<00:02:39.140> funnier

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
because there's something even funnier

also<00:02:52.760> bodes<00:02:53.180> really<00:02:53.900> well<00:02:54.079> of<00:02:54.230> course<00:02:54.560> for

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
those who are interested in emulation

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.089 
those who are interested in emulation
now<00:02:57.019> obviously<00:02:57.409> it's<00:02:57.530> going<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.709> be<00:02:57.799> a<00:02:57.829> long

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
now obviously it's going to be a long

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:01.180 
now obviously it's going to be a long
time<00:02:58.370> before<00:02:58.430> emulation<00:02:59.239> as<00:02:59.569> in<00:03:00.190> something

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
time before emulation as in something

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.789 
time before emulation as in something
that<00:03:01.220> say<00:03:01.909> homebrew<00:03:02.720> developers<00:03:03.260> are<00:03:03.409> able<00:03:03.680> to

00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 
that say homebrew developers are able to

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.470 
that say homebrew developers are able to
put<00:03:03.950> out<00:03:04.099> it's<00:03:04.639> going<00:03:04.790> to<00:03:04.879> be<00:03:04.940> able<00:03:05.030> to<00:03:05.209> match

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
put out it's going to be able to match

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.180 
put out it's going to be able to match
something<00:03:05.989> along<00:03:06.349> the<00:03:06.470> lines<00:03:06.650> of<00:03:06.739> the<00:03:06.799> xbox

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
something along the lines of the xbox

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.619 
something along the lines of the xbox
one<00:03:07.400> because<00:03:07.670> obviously<00:03:07.819> the<00:03:08.090> Xbox<00:03:08.420> one<00:03:08.599> is

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
one because obviously the Xbox one is

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:09.759 
one because obviously the Xbox one is
going<00:03:08.840> to<00:03:08.900> have<00:03:09.049> a<00:03:09.079> hell<00:03:09.230> of<00:03:09.290> a<00:03:09.379> lot<00:03:09.530> of<00:03:09.560> copy

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
going to have a hell of a lot of copy

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.420 
going to have a hell of a lot of copy
protection<00:03:10.310> but<00:03:10.970> it<00:03:11.060> does<00:03:11.329> show<00:03:11.359> the<00:03:11.690> actual

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
protection but it does show the actual

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.789 
protection but it does show the actual
compatibility<00:03:13.430> here<00:03:13.700> so<00:03:14.629> was<00:03:14.780> it<00:03:14.930> surprising

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
compatibility here so was it surprising

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.440 
compatibility here so was it surprising
in<00:03:16.010> particular<00:03:16.340> they're<00:03:16.819> not<00:03:17.060> actually<00:03:17.209> using

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
in particular they're not actually using

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.890 
in particular they're not actually using

did<00:03:37.250> do<00:03:37.340> an<00:03:37.430> analysis<00:03:37.970> of<00:03:38.090> that<00:03:38.150> so<00:03:38.359> you<00:03:38.449> can

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
did do an analysis of that so you can

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:40.140 
did do an analysis of that so you can
check<00:03:38.690> it<00:03:38.810> out<00:03:38.900> if<00:03:39.049> you<00:03:39.139> want<00:03:39.169> more<00:03:39.410> info<00:03:39.799> but

check it out if you want more info but

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.110 
check it out if you want more info but
to<00:03:41.150> summarize<00:03:42.129> it's<00:03:43.129> not<00:03:43.400> really<00:03:43.609> surprised

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
to summarize it's not really surprised

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.699 
to summarize it's not really surprised
that<00:03:44.150> they're<00:03:44.449> not<00:03:44.599> using<00:03:44.810> proper<00:03:45.290> consoles

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
that they're not using proper consoles

that they're not using proper consoles
I'm<00:03:45.859> not<00:03:46.069> I<00:03:46.280> don't<00:03:46.579> really<00:03:46.699> think<00:03:46.790> Lee<00:03:47.060> where

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
I'm not I don't really think Lee where

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
I've it for that and obviously a lot of

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.129 
I've it for that and obviously a lot of
other<00:03:49.280> stuff<00:03:49.340> is<00:03:49.609> still<00:03:49.940> in<00:03:50.000> beta<00:03:50.060> as<00:03:50.599> in<00:03:50.780> it's

other stuff is still in beta as in it's

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:52.930 
other stuff is still in beta as in it's
not<00:03:51.530> like<00:03:51.739> the<00:03:51.919> console<00:03:52.340> is<00:03:52.459> coming<00:03:52.790> out

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
not like the console is coming out

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.580 
not like the console is coming out
tomorrow<00:03:53.269> it's<00:03:53.690> not<00:03:53.810> even<00:03:53.989> coming<00:03:54.169> out<00:03:54.319> next

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590

thing is not finalized however it is a

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.890 
thing is not finalized however it is a
little<00:04:00.889> bit<00:04:01.069> amusing<00:04:01.489> that<00:04:02.120> not<00:04:02.329> only<00:04:02.449> were

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
little bit amusing that not only were

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.259 
little bit amusing that not only were
the<00:04:03.079> PCs<00:04:03.440> using<00:04:03.889> a<00:04:03.949> Windows<00:04:04.250> 7<00:04:04.639> rather<00:04:05.120> than

that you're using a very high-end card

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.810 
that you're using a very high-end card
when<00:04:49.330> of<00:04:50.330> course<00:04:50.690> in<00:04:50.840> interviews<00:04:51.820> numerous

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
when of course in interviews numerous

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.610 
when of course in interviews numerous
developers<00:04:53.330> said<00:04:53.660> no<00:04:53.810> no<00:04:53.960> no<00:04:53.990> no<00:04:54.170> no<00:04:54.410> we're

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.440 
developers said no no no no no we're
actually<00:04:54.680> using<00:04:54.970> specifications<00:04:55.970> pretty

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
actually using specifications pretty

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.070

much ignore the xbox one and no you're
not<00:05:00.290> using<00:05:00.650> a<00:05:00.950> card<00:05:01.460> that<00:05:01.760> several<00:05:02.120> times<00:05:02.150> more

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.980 
not using a card that several times more
powerful<00:05:03.170> so<00:05:03.620> all<00:05:03.980> of<00:05:04.040> this<00:05:04.550> stuff<00:05:04.850> is<00:05:05.090> just

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
now on the hardware side now once again

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.640 
now on the hardware side now once again
and<00:05:35.270> then<00:05:35.390> these<00:05:35.540> really<00:05:35.840> is<00:05:35.900> confirmed<00:05:36.380> it<00:05:36.620> is

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
publicity is not good as people already

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.980 
publicity is not good as people already
a<00:06:01.520> little<00:06:01.730> bit<00:06:01.910> dubious<00:06:02.150> about<00:06:02.419> the<00:06:02.540> system

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
a little bit dubious about the system

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.620 
a little bit dubious about the system
