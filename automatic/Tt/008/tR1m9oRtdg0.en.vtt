00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.250
 hello everyone today I 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.450
 you come back with a very sweet guy and 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.070
 half but I decided to introduce you 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.660
 how am I preparing to go to 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.760
 school I confess that often just 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.860
 a little bit more because it's like 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.599
 I wrote here but casually this 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.740
 routine is going about about five 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:20.730
 minutes realized did that when 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.290
 even fast enough 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.239
 the first thing I like to do a 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.610
 case I make up his mines missed the 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:27.960
 skin so I start by doing it 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.320
 stone gets you to be shocked 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.690
 to learn that I that I am with my 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.250
 famous becquerel from garnier peas 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.050
 and the BB cream for combination skin that 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.640
 know that I paid attention for 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.899
 part the regular is maybe that 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.090
 would suit you well if you have the 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.170
 dry skin but I hate her and 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.210
 that it is really it is for for 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.199
 meetic and I love my country and I play it 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.609
 a little bit like that in my 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.350
 face and then if I liked to of 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:51.660
 clean and well I 'm blurring it with 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.039
 Bejaia with only puts the full me 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.199
 view to both own fact that there is 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.850
 then I will go with what is it 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.050
 that sherlock cd at garnier then I 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.370
 you admit that I really determined 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.199
 but I have the impression that I will come 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.609
 never end 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.739
 I called Canton meyzieu and then 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.350
 while I let dry I go 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.250
 with his two correctors there you know 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.770
 I showed her several times 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.119
 py.g camouflage but perfection so 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.220
 mostly but you deceive 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.259
 scars with AIDS cnls plan even simba 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.430
 and why I must have gone to the 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.579
 cash and spa what is not so common 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.899
 feet too liquid for my taste and canada 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:23.520
 at the end of a little bit lost 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:24.750
 settle everything pieced instant pc with 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.280
 print like that and then the finish and 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.049
 really number one 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.430
 then because we want it to hold 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.820
 all day long when we are 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.500
 at school I will take a break that 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.210
 practically not cover in club I 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.189
 find that the skin of coverage then I 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.750
 come serve me more to matify my 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.869
 skin then have it hold everything we have 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.039
 applied down then it's some 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.240
 thing that I never neglect is the 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.619
 eyebrows then I really suggest you 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.390
 to do the same given a little love 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.619
 with on to your sources if that makes 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.210
 so much a difference there I 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.280
 you say you tried then you will regret 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.619
 no and we would like us to be afraid of everything 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.359
 but seriously to try them then 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.880
 it only gives in appearance more 

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:01.320
 neatly so I find there as you have 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.729
 could see I apply a powder in my 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.329
 worry is the duo of friends 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.609
 read watier 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.350
 but I worked with the gel for 

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:08.640
 sources marched nautical I love but 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.780
 is almost finished and I am 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.340
 really sad 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.530
 because I really have a lot then that 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.540
 is going to come fatal is deaf if you have 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.040
 worries a little rebellious and that's 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.150
 really a pencil novel of the moment I 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.350
 even so much it's again 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.290
 pencil from home does he have in 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.730
 reaching smoky thanks it's too good that 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.100
 I have never been the kind of girl 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.300
 who loved stood black pencil the 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.100
 other than in the mucosa because I 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.489
 really find that the eye hole 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.470
 dark 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.790
 but that's too much of a beautiful color 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.980
 it was super long 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.590
 then the key that makes the whole 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.720
 difference have stopped mascara and then 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.580
 his 7 years and I use the extensions 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.130
 more from marcel it really gives a 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.840
 very beautiful if it's going to be everything 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.250
 for the eyes it's simply 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.320
 here I need some colors 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.780
 as you've seen done I'm going there 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.280
 go with my famous brothers or there of 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.989
 benefit that I love is so much the 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.350
 perfect brother I could more 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.030
 pass 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.519
 he's almost finished mine he's me 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.930
 Looks like it really long 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.180
 to know there I apply it in my forehead 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.530
 because I still have a good forehead 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.790
 perform it I can afford to in 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.290
 apply there 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.510
 then I also have our host masters myself 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.970
 play a handkerchief in my class on my 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.390
 mail it's really going to change everything like 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.250
 wants to see it 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.299
 then I do not always apply bloch 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.790
 when I go to school but today 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:20.250
 I wanted to put the total and that 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.070
 I take the blush orgasm yes orgasm 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.620
 orgasm it's really a very beautiful 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.420
 hair color fall in love with 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.130
 pipo I gave myself that's when I 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.970
 more time to wake up 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.860
 look a little bit I like a lot 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.350
 of them and the benefit hybrid is so 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.239
 it's like a pencil a pinkish color 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.549
 not the support foot submitting reprieve 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.870
 in the inner corner of monein and worse 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.030
 really comes to wake up my eyes 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:46.079
 then as a lift and my eyebrows 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.190
 can say a little bit that also defines the 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.510
 solution if I really find that 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.549
 some of the little difference then 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.810
 it's subtle then it's not long to 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.799
 apply because when I go to 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.170
 school I do not really have time 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.489
 to apply eye shadows 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.350
 then something that I'm lying 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.769
 that's how it's this waste 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.560
 maybelline the body elixir workshop itself 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.760
 leave in the cross hibiscus even so 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.950
 that it's not bad all for one 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.269
 makeup now for the hair 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.980
 I confess that from day to day 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:12.540
 hair I'm really not much 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.030
 motor that look a little bulky 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.729

 then these little beasts there like that 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.540
