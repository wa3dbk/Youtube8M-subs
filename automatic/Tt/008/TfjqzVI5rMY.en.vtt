00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
few weak spots that I've been finding

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.189 
few weak spots that I've been finding
out<00:00:17.190> right<00:00:18.090> back<00:00:18.300> here<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.720> frame<00:00:19.020> is

out right back here and the frame is

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.500 
out right back here and the frame is
pretty<00:00:19.320> weak<00:00:20.119> actually<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.180> know<00:00:21.240> let<00:00:21.480> me

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
pretty weak actually you know let me

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.349 
pretty weak actually you know let me
redo<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:21.990> since<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.380> wasn't<00:00:22.560> flat<00:00:23.990> good<00:00:24.990> ah

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
to put a little bit of silicone or

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.389 
to put a little bit of silicone or
something<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.510> hold<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.719> boom<00:00:39.930> in<00:00:40.280> and<00:00:41.280> the

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
something to hold the boom in and the

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.220 
something to hold the boom in and the
two-piece<00:00:42.090> swash<00:00:42.360> plate<00:00:42.600> likes<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.110> come

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
two-piece swash plate likes to come

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.170 
two-piece swash plate likes to come
apart<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.649> crashes<00:00:44.070> but<00:00:44.640> besides<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.059> I

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
apart and crashes but besides that I

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.720 
apart and crashes but besides that I
mean<00:00:45.379> just<00:00:46.379> keep<00:00:46.559> gluing<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.039> pushing<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.610> back

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
mean just keep gluing it pushing it back

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.610 
mean just keep gluing it pushing it back
together<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.629> seems<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.960> fly<00:00:49.170> pretty<00:00:49.440> well

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
together and it seems to fly pretty well

00:00:49.620 --> 00:01:04.380 
together and it seems to fly pretty well
so<00:00:50.520> let's<00:00:50.700> get<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.879> little<00:00:51.000> bit<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.300> flight<00:00:51.539> in

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:10.290 

okay<00:01:05.080> we're<00:01:05.350> an<00:01:05.440> idle<00:01:05.710> up<00:01:08.970> get<00:01:09.970> out<00:01:10.060> here<00:01:10.210> in

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
okay we're an idle up get out here in

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:20.179 
okay we're an idle up get out here in
the<00:01:10.360> parking<00:01:10.660> lot

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.849 

so<00:01:20.759> as<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:20.939> can<00:01:21.060> see<00:01:21.270> it's<00:01:21.420> pretty<00:01:21.659> stable<00:01:21.929> got

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:22.859 
so as you can see it's pretty stable got

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:24.440 
so as you can see it's pretty stable got
a<00:01:22.890> little<00:01:23.159> bit<00:01:23.249> of<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.429> wag<00:01:23.609> and<00:01:23.880> it's<00:01:23.999> kind<00:01:24.179> of<00:01:24.210> a

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
a little bit of a wag and it's kind of a

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.419 
a little bit of a wag and it's kind of a
bummer<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.710> can't<00:01:25.950> really<00:01:26.069> do<00:01:26.219> anything

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:26.429 
bummer that you can't really do anything

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:38.940 
bummer that you can't really do anything
about<00:01:26.579> it<00:01:26.880> with<00:01:26.999> this<00:01:27.090> controller

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.109 

but<00:01:39.950> it<00:01:40.070> holds<00:01:40.159> pretty<00:01:40.400> good<00:01:40.640> it<00:01:40.729> doesn't<00:01:40.909> wash

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
but it holds pretty good it doesn't wash

00:01:41.119 --> 00:02:06.190 
but it holds pretty good it doesn't wash
out<00:01:41.270> too<00:01:41.479> bad

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.440

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.839 

wind<00:03:24.269> is<00:03:24.389> a<00:03:24.420> little<00:03:24.749> bit<00:03:24.950> strong<00:03:25.950> today<00:03:26.189> you

could do all right let's check the tail
check<00:04:26.150> the<00:04:26.270> frame<00:04:26.510> check<00:04:26.590> the<00:04:27.590> swash

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
check the frame check the swash

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.120 
check the frame check the swash
everything<00:04:30.200> looks<00:04:30.380> pretty<00:04:30.530> good

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
linkages are all still in place we

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:40.000 
linkages are all still in place we
should<00:04:33.470> be<00:04:33.620> good<00:04:33.860> to<00:04:34.010> take<00:04:34.160> back<00:04:34.340> off
