00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
actually do what we call the 12 they

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.870 
actually do what we call the 12 they
turn<00:01:38.570> in<00:01:38.780> once<00:01:39.070> then<00:01:40.070> they<00:01:40.280> turn<00:01:40.520> their<00:01:40.759> head

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880

and<00:01:41.030> they<00:01:41.119> turn<00:01:41.360> the<00:01:41.509> second<00:01:41.840> time<00:01:41.990> so<00:01:42.140> they

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
and they turn the second time so they

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.550 
and they turn the second time so they
make<00:01:42.380> a<00:01:42.409> corner<00:01:42.770> a<00:01:42.890> one<00:01:43.220> oops<00:01:44.030> too<00:01:44.659> if<00:01:45.320> you<00:01:45.440> are
