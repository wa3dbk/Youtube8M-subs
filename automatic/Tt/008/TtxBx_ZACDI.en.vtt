00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.900
 Hey what's up? Maybe some of you already know some things 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.310
 but for those who do not know, here are 6 things 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:37.310
 of Harry Potter! 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:40.920
 JK Rowling, the writer of Harry Potter, went from being a humble person to a multi-millionaire in only 5 years. 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.809
 His first book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.479
 It was sent to 12 different publishers and none accepted the manuscript. 

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:52.780
 Until it was accepted by a small publisher just because 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.250
 the daughter of the editorial president read it, and asked for a second book. 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:02.250
 The first book was sold with only 500 copies. 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.220
 Richard, who plays Ambus Dumbledore ... I only accept the role because his granddaughter called him and told him that if he did not accept, I would not talk to him again. 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.950
 And in the third movie was replaced by another actor since he died of a disease. 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.600
 Luna Lovegood, was chosen by among 15,000 other girls who aspired for the role. 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.030
 Many things that are written in the books do not appear in the movies ... 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:37.990
 Because the writer of harry potter said that if they followed the books to the letter the movies would last 10 hours! 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.799
 It is said that if a Muggle meets by chance at Hogwarts, the only thing he would see 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.869
 They would be ruins and a sign with the words: 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:46.499
 stay away, dangerous ruins. 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:53.899
 The pranksters, Fred and George, celebrate their birthday on April Fools Day, which is the day of the United States. 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.279
 The two companions of Draco Malfoy ... in the Harry Potter movie 7 part 2, only one came out 

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:08.690
 and the other one is replaced by an actor that we had not seen 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.110
 because the other was discovered growing marijuana and put him in jail. 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:19.110
 The director of the movie Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azcaban 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.760
 He was proudly Mexican. 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.260
 He asked the main characters to do a rehearsal of what it was like to be 13 years old so that they could get involved in the adolescent's concerns. 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:35.260
 Ruper Grint, I mean Ron, he did not. While Emma Watson, I mean Hermione, made 11 pages.
