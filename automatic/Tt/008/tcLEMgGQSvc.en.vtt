00:00:00.389 --> 00:00:04.200
 components of a computer 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.939
 the hard drive 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.860
 the hard disk is the device of 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.930
 storage of digital data not 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.730
 Volatile uses a recording system 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.710
 digital 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.750
 the hard drive where we store from 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.800
 permanent way the programs and 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.120
 records 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.210
 We can currently buy hard drives 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.480
 internal 500 gigabytes to about 2 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.480
 terabytes 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.390
 and base plate 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.280
 the motherboard in the fundamental part 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.890
 of the computer is a card 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.080
 printed circuits and is the center of 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.360
 connection between the microprocessor the 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.550
 ram memory the expansion slot and 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.680
 then other devices 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.760
 the current basic plate models 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:11.690
 base are amd e intel the most brands 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:13.740
 recognized are their macro and cold bay 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.410
 inserted in the motherboard we can 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.960
 find the microprocessor memory 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:23.660
 ram slot expansion slots and the 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.660
 microprocessor stack 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.470
 the microprocessor is the brain of 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.570
 computer cpu or central unit of 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.280
 processing is in charge of 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.990
 run it program from the system 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.440
 operative until the applications of 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.750
 user 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.020
 current microprocessor models 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:48.300
 they are 20 minds we can 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:50.780
 find us intel core i3 i5 i7 and intel 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.780
 duo core 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.649
 the microprocessor incorporates a 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.530
 fan as cooling system 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.390
 to dissipate the heat the speed of 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.549
 the microprocessors are measured in 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.560
 gigahertz we can find in the 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:12.679
 market processors with speeds of 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.679
 2.5 gigahertz to 4 with 2 gigahertz 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.430
 RAM 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.930
 the run memory is the access memory 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.819
 random and is used as memory of 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.400
 work for the operating system and the 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.049
 most software where the 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.870
 data at the moment they are 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.970
 using 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.190
 currently we can find in the 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.860
 market a ram memory capabilities 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.860
 ranging from pig gb to 8 gb 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.230
 and the pile 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.209
 the stack maintains the parameters of 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.030
 configuration of the bios when the 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.900
 computer is turned off and slot 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.900
 expansion or slot 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.310
 and the expansion slots are the 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.810
 elements of the motherboard that allow 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.720
 connect to the computer cards 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:19.020
 additional ones such as video and sound or 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.020
 network 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:30.980
 this is the outside view of the 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.980
 sound card 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.070
 the sound card we can 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.410
 find connected or integrated to the 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:41.930
 motherboard process the input sound 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.290
 and output from the computer convert the 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.790
 audio signals in digital and vice versa 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.250
 the most recognized current brands of 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:53.860
 sound cards are logitech creative 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.860
 enter video card 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.250
 and the graphics card is responsible for 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.239
 show the images on the monitor 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:05.480
 cards are currently installed 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.610
 graphs of 13 most brands 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.690
 recognized graphic cards are ati 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:16.540
 and nvidia is sold card of about 512 mb 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.540
 to 12 gb network card 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.130
 the function of the network card in the 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:27.320
 prepare send and control the data in 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.320
 the power supply network 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.360
 The power supply is the 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.919
 device that brings the energy to 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.960
 all computer components 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:45.380
 converts the AC voltage that 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:48.229
 supplies the network in continuous converts 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.449
 the 220 volts of the network alternates in 12 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:53.419
 continuous volts in the market we can 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:58.400
 find currently 550 source 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:05:02.020
 watts to 700 watts flat cables 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.020
 communication or ribbon cable 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.830
 the communication cables are used 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.470
 to connect the disk drives 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.030
 Gothic and the hard drive are going 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.950
 currently replacing cable 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.740
 round because of the problems they had with 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:22.550
 the cooling of the computer 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.550
 dvd recorders 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.140
 the dvd recorders read and record in 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.090
 dvd format all types of data 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:35.380
 Currently they are sold internally and also 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:38.420
 external speed of 22 to 24 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:41.840
 he has also appeared the dvd combo with 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:44.330
 blu-ray the best-known brands of 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.419
 DVD recorders are the pioneer axis 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.750
 sony and samsung 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:49.750
 speaker english 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.900
 the speaker and the LEDs are connected to the 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.610
 motherboard each plate has a 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.620
 different configuration 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.380
 the speaker provides a basic audio 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.240
 to the computer the lex are the indicators 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.360
 luminous external front lights 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:11.680

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:17.110
 led power batum and reset house casing or 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:18.460
 metal tower the box or the tower is the 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:21.550
 framework that contains all 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:25.170
 components of the agustín ortego team
