with at least the kjw mark one as since
that<00:05:05.120> is<00:05:05.270> my<00:05:05.450> strongest<00:05:05.720> gun<00:05:06.170> and<00:05:06.410> then

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
that is my strongest gun and then

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.250 
that is my strongest gun and then
possibly<00:05:07.430> maybe<00:05:07.940> an<00:05:08.120> AEG<00:05:08.540> if<00:05:08.690> it<00:05:08.840> will<00:05:08.990> pierce

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
possibly maybe an AEG if it will pierce

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.740 
possibly maybe an AEG if it will pierce
so<00:05:09.980> y'all<00:05:10.790> look<00:05:10.970> forward<00:05:11.300> to<00:05:11.390> that<00:05:11.540> that's

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
so y'all look forward to that that's

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.090 
so y'all look forward to that that's
going<00:05:11.930> to<00:05:11.990> be<00:05:12.080> coming<00:05:12.230> in<00:05:12.440> the<00:05:12.470> future<00:05:12.620> too<00:05:12.950> and

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
going to be coming in the future too and

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.160 
going to be coming in the future too and
then<00:05:13.610> hopefully<00:05:14.030> if<00:05:14.240> I<00:05:14.360> get<00:05:14.420> the<00:05:14.630> ammo<00:05:14.900> fast

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
then hopefully if I get the ammo fast

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:16.660 
then hopefully if I get the ammo fast
enough<00:05:15.500> and<00:05:15.680> I<00:05:15.770> can<00:05:15.920> actually<00:05:15.950> get<00:05:16.370> out<00:05:16.490> to<00:05:16.640> the
