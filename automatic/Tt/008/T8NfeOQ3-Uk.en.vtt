00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.109
 hi friends from youtube good 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.540
 we are here in this warrior region 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.000
 as you can see there are many 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.780
 very bright stones here in the in the 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.150
 floor and on these occasions we will help 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.730
 to identify what kind of stones have 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.880
 gold but 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.550
 in galena that is the galena the galena is 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.070
 One is a stone that brings different 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.800
 concentrations of several minerals but 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.090
 also of this type of stones can be 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.690
 extract the gold 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.690
 all right 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.219
 right now let's find a good sample 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.610
 of doctor to be the good sample of 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.610
 chain 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:01.820
 basically this is the 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:04.370
 the galena has several mineral streaks 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.890
 and vetoes can exceed the 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.680
 gold but what we are looking for is a 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.160
 more black hen that is for example 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.160
 this 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.350
 is there is a chicken that has very 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.680
 all right 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.680
 and it 's more 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.870
 more apt to extract gold 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.350
 are the basic characteristics of 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:34.150
 machine this is what you should 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.110
 to be 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.270
 looking for when they try to search or 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.030
 we will not see what is the 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:47.320
 the difference of a galena stone 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.320
 and I do not deserve stone 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.760
 what from here should 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.300
 down 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.610
 is the normal stone is pure stone is not 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.670
 they see any kind of brightness 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.620
 and this one on top is the stone of 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.400
 galena 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.380
 is the stone that already contains this 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.900
 look you can see that they ask not 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.220
 they contain no ore and the one above 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.890
 A) Yes 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.920
 good friends of youtube study them there 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.920
 liked 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.550
 we are finding many stones that 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.350
 they really have 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.350
 very good concentration d 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:34.280
 and so good here is this region 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:38.100
 used to search normally in addition 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:41.220
 that there are many mines 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.030
 Well I hope you like the whole video and 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.030
 see you later
