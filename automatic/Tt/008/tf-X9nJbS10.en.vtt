00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
quick now think about grades change I

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.300 
quick now think about grades change I
definitely<00:02:17.349> don't<00:02:17.469> think<00:02:17.560> that<00:02:17.709> that's<00:02:17.920> him

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
definitely don't think that that's him

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.490 
definitely don't think that that's him
wanting<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.209> do<00:02:19.359> this<00:02:19.599> I<00:02:19.780> like<00:02:20.019> unless<00:02:20.290> he's

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
wanting to do this I like unless he's

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.199 
wanting to do this I like unless he's
doing<00:02:20.620> like<00:02:20.769> some<00:02:21.010> spy<00:02:21.340> mission<00:02:21.849> or<00:02:21.969> whatever

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
doing like some spy mission or whatever

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.940 
doing like some spy mission or whatever
I<00:02:22.450> don't<00:02:22.689> necessarily<00:02:23.379> think<00:02:23.439> that<00:02:23.590> graders

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
I don't necessarily think that graders

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.589 
I don't necessarily think that graders
doing<00:02:24.129> this<00:02:24.250> on<00:02:24.400> his<00:02:24.430> own<00:02:24.730> it<00:02:25.030> could<00:02:25.450> possibly

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
doing this on his own it could possibly

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.420 
doing this on his own it could possibly
be<00:02:25.989> that<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.290> curse<00:02:26.469> mark<00:02:26.709> seal<00:02:26.950> was<00:02:27.069> taken

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
be that the curse mark seal was taken

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.130 
be that the curse mark seal was taken
over<00:02:27.579> that<00:02:27.909> curse<00:02:28.359> that<00:02:28.569> he<00:02:28.659> had<00:02:28.810> you<00:02:28.930> know<00:02:29.019> the

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
over that curse that he had you know the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.630 
over that curse that he had you know the
cursed<00:02:29.349> magic<00:02:29.739> or<00:02:29.829> whatever<00:02:30.069> it<00:02:30.340> could<00:02:30.400> be

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
cursed magic or whatever it could be

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.610 
cursed magic or whatever it could be
that<00:02:31.000> it's<00:02:31.480> either<00:02:31.659> words<00:02:31.989> either<00:02:32.109> he's<00:02:32.349> doing

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
that it's either words either he's doing

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.619 
that it's either words either he's doing
this<00:02:32.739> because<00:02:32.950> he's<00:02:33.519> on<00:02:33.640> a<00:02:33.670> secret<00:02:34.090> mission<00:02:34.120> or

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
this because he's on a secret mission or

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.780 
this because he's on a secret mission or
it's<00:02:35.260> possible<00:02:35.739> that<00:02:35.859> it's<00:02:36.069> taken<00:02:36.430> over<00:02:36.519> him

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
it's possible that it's taken over him

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:37.979 
it's possible that it's taken over him
and<00:02:36.939> it's<00:02:37.030> turning<00:02:37.299> him<00:02:37.390> to<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.599> dark<00:02:37.810> side

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
and it's turning him to the dark side

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.899 
and it's turning him to the dark side
because<00:02:38.200> even<00:02:38.620> Juvia<00:02:38.950> saw<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.280> change<00:02:39.639> in<00:02:39.819> his

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:39.909 
because even Juvia saw the change in his

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:41.580 
because even Juvia saw the change in his
character<00:02:40.359> as<00:02:40.540> she<00:02:40.599> was<00:02:41.049> living<00:02:41.319> with<00:02:41.409> him

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
character as she was living with him

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.959 
character as she was living with him
certain<00:02:42.099> points<00:02:42.340> it<00:02:42.430> was<00:02:42.489> just<00:02:42.639> like<00:02:42.730> he

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:42.969 
certain points it was just like he

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:44.250 
certain points it was just like he
stopped<00:02:43.209> coming<00:02:43.359> home<00:02:43.629> so<00:02:44.079> you<00:02:44.139> can

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
stopped coming home so you can

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.050 
stopped coming home so you can
definitely<00:02:44.379> see<00:02:44.650> that<00:02:44.680> it<00:02:45.040> could<00:02:45.579> be<00:02:45.790> a<00:02:45.819> little

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
definitely see that it could be a little

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.270 
definitely see that it could be a little
bit<00:02:46.269> of<00:02:46.359> column<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:47.019> column<00:02:47.260> B<00:02:47.620> maybe<00:02:47.799> maybe<00:02:48.129> it

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
bit of column a column B maybe maybe it

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.099 
bit of column a column B maybe maybe it
is<00:02:48.400> that<00:02:48.430> he's<00:02:48.730> you<00:02:49.120> know<00:02:49.150> still<00:02:49.569> somewhat

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
is that he's you know still somewhat

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.140 
is that he's you know still somewhat
there<00:02:50.349> but<00:02:50.590> at<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.799> same<00:02:50.920> time<00:02:51.159> the<00:02:51.400> seal<00:02:51.970> is

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
there but at the same time the seal is
