00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hey people if i am out of mine now 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.629
 window out look exactly then see 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.490
 I'm rainy and thunderstorm when I am 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.290
 now look at my calendar 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.920
 me it is july and it is always 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.420
 a bit contradictory if I but 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.100
 based on my calendar and me 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.199
 especially dress with short pants and 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.430
 t shirt and spd or whatever else she is 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.189
 because go out in the rain 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.960
 It looks like you will get sick 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.849
 sniff and cough and that's because we 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.369
 not all but we do not want it either 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.900
 complain because of the bad weather and 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.640
 That's why I just thought 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.100
 I'll give you a few survival tips 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.809
 you might think about yourself 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.030
 to be able to wear summerly despite 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.829
 bad summer weather and just that 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.140
 rain and the thunderstorm the fight 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.280
 to say the first problem is what 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.170
 it prevents in summer clothes 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.300
 To go out is just the cold but 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.160
 We do not want a winter jacket and we can 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.690
 Also do not need long pants because of that 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.629
 we something in between and I think 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.050
 the best solution is simply that you too 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.969
 do 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.890
 the shirt also apply but not 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.510
 upper body to be free but a t 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.460
 shirt to have under it or stew 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.510
 because we can still summer 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.339
 donning simply involve 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.920
 summer top a shorts and 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.650
 solid shoes or shoes in which no 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.000
 to coming in rain but we remain 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.040
 one I think when it's warm draw 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.080
 We just sing off when it comes to us 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.420
 around the hips or nodes to increase or 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.100
 that 's all out and carry it in the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.930
 hand and we are not summer if it is 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.490
 but a bit colder is easy 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.930
 we are over it despite the summer light 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.580
 if we have such a beach so one 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.350
 a bit high school until I was me 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.780
 mega course kempen finds about the 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.159
 Do not get up and sweat even if 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.960
 but now it starts to rain 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.329
 Do you have two options you can 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.100
 either the shirt as a small rain 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.840
 take shelter and quickly to the bus 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.400
 race home or somehow 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.640
 quickly go to the next shelter 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.189
 if you are outside or you are 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.290
 it just ties in to sound awesome 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.450
 banal but when it gets cold outside 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.920
 in the summer and the shirt have knotted 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.079
 is to you have a t shirt down and 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.850
 it just warmer nobody sees you 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.500
 she is the business concept anyway 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.479
 summery selection on a pair of shorts 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.759
 just could put on something and it 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.020
 just protects that is not super cool 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.030
 I just mentioned that 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.710
 that shoes do not need water 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.390
 she laughs but we still want to 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.190
 somehow summery 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.200
 and how does it make you better 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.900
 just buy a holiday just look 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.420
 around times or looks in his cabinet rum 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.010
 and dig such boots out of her mind 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.720
 you now like such boots otherwise 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.670
 I do not mean that now an example 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.380
 and too easy summer boots you can 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.209
 They are now easy to buy in bohemians 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.250
 or in the basement or just after 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.270
 your kind of autumn already look the 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.530
 not too thick, for example 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.330
 such shoes are now again 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.670
 shoes that have no lining now 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.709
 are just ankle high so they are not 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.120
 too long for any short pants 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.340
 you can move in the summer if it is 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.410
 It's raining because he's just passing through 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.090
 rain your feet does not protect soft 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.920
 through her work nevertheless summer light 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.870
 could put on shorts and a t 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.880
 shirt or shirt over and that has that 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.950
 perfect summer outfit despite rain and 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.930
 thunderstorm my next tip turns 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.519
 to my female audience and indeed 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.870
 a quick tip if you like me 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.310
 just a bit of cold outside 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.780
 but despite the rain, you are in spite of me 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.850
 do without your hot pants or skirts 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.920
 Wanted to pull pantyhose or leggings 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.260
 to do a very simple thing too 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.120
 very many people but it is 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.980
 really so the outfit is not on any 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.930
 case it does not look bad 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.940
 but it keeps you warm and you can yours 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.760
 hotpants start euro expensive short 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.380
 pants shirts anyway and mine 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.480
 goodness we can just be summer 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.310
 Despite the rain at the next tip must be 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.170
 thanks to the textile industry for 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.750
 to pronounce this invention for 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.940
 these tops and what is that for a 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.290
 shell this is a long one 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.170
 top part I have now here from 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.459
 bershka but what is so thin is that one 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.170
 just that you just look through 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.030
 So you may not see it though 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.769
 it's such a top that's pretty 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.269
 thin what you think best I too 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.100
 Invers concert you will find something very 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.480
 often because he comes so spain in 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.510
 Learning south can be found like this 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.190
 generally what but long sleeve has the 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.980
 advantage of this is simply the sleeves can 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.810
 when it's too warm roll up in it 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.150
 protect one way or the other not designed 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.350
 this is so to speak, than to be t shirt 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.239
 it is thinner than a t-shirt 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.180
 or right there and it 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.640
 protects but still denied or before 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.320
 rain because it has very long sleeves smart 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.329
 ideas and still you can somehow 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.739
 Courses drop to the flip flop because of it 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.000
 Do not break it, you can do it 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.390
 also roll up pull up as well 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.519
 always 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.620
 and you just have an outfit 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.209
 has protected you from rain for a long time 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.010
 on 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.330
 what do you want more like this 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.330
 Of course, the three are long ago 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.740
 quarter tops 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.330
 small tip you can also 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.280
 Getting dressed is longer but 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.050
 still not too long and not too 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.330
 short for exactly three quarters so to speak 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.430
 and are mostly also thinner as has 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.780
 he designed them to be warmer 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.639
 to attract temperatures 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.830
 Do you know this problem when it's out there 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:40.449
 it rains you dressed shortly is 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.550
 but best of all should be so 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:43.689
 do not want to take a winter jacket and 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.819
 You also have little desire now 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:47.979
 to put on more clothes or something like that 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:49.300
 because I have the perfect tip namely 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.500
 just those parker who knows her 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.550
 probably from the autumn has 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.409
 yes, in the fall as the 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.810
 transition jacket and the sense of one 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:57.759
 Überlinger it is not too hot too 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.349
 not to keep warm not too strong 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:04:59.949
 on the second but before the rain too 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:01.629
 protect 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:03.370
 Dean is there in spring and autumn 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:05.169
 perfect or because i behave my way 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.669
 not great warm psychosis if you 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:08.469
 keep warm the easy topp down 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.250
 whether it comes and whatever and one 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:11.050
 shorts 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.360
 but you have yourselves for the rain 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.460
 protected and I will always 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.199
 the one in the rooms so i say then 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.509
 actually the whole time he stays then 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:21.250
 already a bit colder you are 

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:22.439
 can you ever including thick 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.610
 attract 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:26.169
 and because I've been summery so often 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.430
 I've used that 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.620
 again for the next tip of the 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.900
 that is simply not important anyway 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:35.319
 what the weather is you are outside 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.669
 Nevertheless, especially attracted namely 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:39.819
 you just go summer 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:41.199
 no accessories if you are interested 

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:43.089
 glasses on or off together 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:45.849
 flower band or your favorite user 

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:47.740
 Anklet anyway my goodness 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:49.839
 I think the rain does not say anything 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.729
 neither the day, and I think it's right 

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:52.719
 Cool because I wear it even in the rain 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:55.000
 a sunglasses because I'm easy 

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:56.620
 summery feel easy in the summer 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.020
 can go in without any 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.029
 to get depression because it is raining 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.800
 and just do not forget him and me 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:04.930
 my the can wear the rain 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.190
 Flower wreaths I can wear in the rain 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.000
 I think they 're happy about that 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.289
 Of course, extra water hh if there 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.479
 you can also wear so just do it 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:14.650
 do without it and first with axis 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:16.300
 one could not put in long 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.819
 pants but at least the feeling 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:21.099
 have you still in july 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:22.259
 what are you wearing when it rains? 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:24.009
 what do you do when the sluggish 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:25.900
 do not barricade yourself in there 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:27.729
 or what do you mean ? 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.169
 write in the comments 

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:30.459
 and about which I would roll on 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:32.469
 is not just about these tips but 

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:34.270
 also about a rating like that finds
