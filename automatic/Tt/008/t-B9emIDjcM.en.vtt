00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.000 
backing of the blanket itself wasn't
very<00:02:18.720> thick<00:02:18.959> here<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.319> just<00:02:19.620> went<00:02:19.799> ahead<00:02:19.860> and

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
very thick here so I just went ahead and

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.399 
very thick here so I just went ahead and
cut<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.310> out<00:02:20.549> if<00:02:20.790> I<00:02:21.360> wanted<00:02:21.750> to<00:02:21.930> I<00:02:21.959> could<00:02:22.379> have

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
then instead used this little seam

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.649 
then instead used this little seam
ripper<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.799> slip<00:02:26.700> underneath<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.360> threads
