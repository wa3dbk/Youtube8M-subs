00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
think the issue is with this system or

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.389 
think the issue is with this system or
any<00:02:00.930> other<00:02:01.080> system<00:02:01.259> it's<00:02:01.830> not<00:02:02.070> because<00:02:02.369> of

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
any other system it's not because of

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.609 
any other system it's not because of
this<00:02:02.670> initial<00:02:03.090> hole<00:02:03.330> actually<00:02:04.080> the<00:02:04.200> initial

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
this initial hole actually the initial

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.840 
this initial hole actually the initial

inside and you talk this and you're
rolling<00:02:32.340> tight<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:32.940> can<00:02:33.090> be<00:02:33.209> a<00:02:33.239> scenario<00:02:33.569> where

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
rolling tight it can be a scenario where

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.390 
rolling tight it can be a scenario where
this<00:02:34.260> goes<00:02:35.220> inside<00:02:36.290> one<00:02:37.290> of<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.560> faults<00:02:37.950> okay

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
this goes inside one of the faults okay

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.920 
this goes inside one of the faults okay
like<00:02:39.060> this<00:02:39.470> right<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.830> then<00:02:41.790> you<00:02:42.120> roll<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.420> you

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
like this right and then you roll it you

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.009 
like this right and then you roll it you
finish<00:02:43.680> okay<00:02:44.100> cool<00:02:44.549> so<00:02:44.760> then<00:02:45.420> you<00:02:45.570> throw<00:02:45.840> your

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
finish okay cool so then you throw your

finish okay cool so then you throw your
polish<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:46.650> because<00:02:47.130> your<00:02:47.250> polish<00:02:47.609> is

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
polish and because your polish is

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.390 
polish and because your polish is
getting<00:02:48.030> pulled<00:02:48.269> by<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.510> bridle<00:02:49.010> it<00:02:50.010> happens

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
getting pulled by the bridle it happens

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.060 
getting pulled by the bridle it happens
something<00:02:51.150> like<00:02:51.390> this<00:02:54.590> this<00:02:55.590> is<00:02:55.799> the<00:02:55.829> issue

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
something like this this is the issue

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.520

skydiving okay
let's<00:03:27.940> take<00:03:28.120> the<00:03:28.240> same<00:03:28.420> let's<00:03:28.870> let's<00:03:29.290> continue

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
let's take the same let's let's continue

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.230 
let's take the same let's let's continue
these<00:03:29.890> because<00:03:30.190> I<00:03:30.280> believe<00:03:30.520> this<00:03:30.670> is<00:03:30.730> good<00:03:31.090> in

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
these because I believe this is good in

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.230 
these because I believe this is good in
case<00:03:31.270> you<00:03:32.050> have<00:03:32.170> a<00:03:32.200> premature<00:03:32.760> then<00:03:33.760> I<00:03:33.850> flip<00:03:34.150> it

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
case you have a premature then I flip it

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.850 
case you have a premature then I flip it
though<00:03:34.450> then<00:03:34.870> then<00:03:35.770> let's<00:03:36.760> do<00:03:37.330> this

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
though then then let's do this

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.610 
though then then let's do this
eliminate<00:03:38.860> those<00:03:39.070> long<00:03:39.400> things<00:03:39.690> okay<00:03:40.690> let's

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
eliminate those long things okay let's

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.270 
eliminate those long things okay let's
just<00:03:42.400> perfectly<00:03:43.290> flip<00:03:44.290> it<00:03:44.470> here<00:03:44.710> okay<00:03:45.100> and

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
just perfectly flip it here okay and

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.570 
just perfectly flip it here okay and
then<00:03:46.000> this<00:03:46.660> is<00:03:46.840> way<00:03:47.140> smaller<00:03:47.560> you<00:03:47.950> see<00:03:48.160> there's

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
then this is way smaller you see there's

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.610 
then this is way smaller you see there's
no<00:03:48.790> way<00:03:48.970> what<00:03:49.720> I<00:03:49.750> do<00:03:49.870> here<00:03:50.530> is<00:03:50.680> I'll<00:03:51.100> do<00:03:51.280> this

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
no way what I do here is I'll do this

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:59.550 
no way what I do here is I'll do this
right<00:03:54.270> and<00:03:55.560> instead<00:03:56.560> of<00:03:58.080> making<00:03:59.080> this<00:03:59.260> one

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
right and instead of making this one

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.300 
right and instead of making this one
like<00:04:00.190> come<00:04:00.610> over<00:04:00.640> here<00:04:01.120> what<00:04:01.690> I<00:04:01.720> do<00:04:01.840> is<00:04:02.350> I<00:04:02.890> or
