output just cut out from the sub ends up
these<00:00:49.590> two<00:00:49.800> toroid<00:00:50.809> transformers<00:00:52.370> came<00:00:53.370> loose

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
these two toroid transformers came loose

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.850 
these two toroid transformers came loose
and<00:00:54.390> uh<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.870> solder<00:00:55.140> broke<00:00:55.469> loose<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.770> little

board out and restarted these

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.690 
board out and restarted these
transformers<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:07.100> so<00:01:08.100> yeah<00:01:08.220> they're<00:01:08.400> good<00:01:08.580> to

put a little weight on them let them dry
five-minute<00:01:18.960> epoxy<00:01:19.020> should<00:01:19.590> be<00:01:19.680> good<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.890> go

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
five-minute epoxy should be good to go

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.760 
five-minute epoxy should be good to go
but<00:01:21.180> yeah<00:01:21.299> we<00:01:21.810> tested<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.320> after<00:01:22.560> they<00:01:22.680> were

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770
