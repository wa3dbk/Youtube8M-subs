00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.899
 Hello everyone, but who watched mine 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:11.219
 previous videos about this 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:14.040
 an unfortunate knife that I got in 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.910
 overall I did not stop there and by the way 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.890
 I do not remember private owners, but I said that it looked like 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.939
 such a bearded knife with a little slaughter 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.070
 a big pen that is something in this but 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.650
 pen like i did under my arm but 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.960
 blades just did not work that is it 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.219
 should be much bigger but since 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.950
 she broke down so it came out like this 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.790
 Here but I did not stop at this and from 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:47.070
 forged the same bearing 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:53.030
 here is a knife tree the same as 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:57.480
 It called do not know I think that's an oak means 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:00.390
 the tree is the same as i said the steering wheel 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:06.689
 sculpt a little less but also convenient 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:10.470
 sits comfortably in your hand here sits comfortably in 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:15.170
 the hand is now a little bit with light 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:19.380
 lose and was obviously mean 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:25.020
 almost polished descents in the mirror 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.549
 from the butt with a small cutting edge but 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.650
 as they say everything is made of improvised 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:35.990
 the materials of the wood that you found and here 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.770
 this one here is a stump if anyone found out this bolt 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.320
 from computer 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:46.380
 occupied the rear of the computer just 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:48.240
 he sharpened the ball here and it turned out 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.549
 Here is such as if 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:56.340
 the tip could do more for 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:59.310
 beauty than for something it's plastic type 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:04.790
 so and not plastics as either there is no either 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:22.360
 but here's such a knife 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:22.360
 naturally sisters mean blade size 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:31.960
 if anyone is interested, of course, 8 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.960
 centimeters almost eight centimeters 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.290
 butt thickness 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.290
 the thickest place 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:03:03.590
 three millimeters on the handle nine with 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:03:10.879
 half well blade width two 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:16.639
 centimeter well the tip is reduced 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:18.769
 here it was a furrow for the balls i 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:25.730
 would have decided so and would have left so symmetrical 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:27.439
 It turned out well, in general, compared to 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.919
 don't think with this knife anymore here 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:36.079
 how much myself and but all sizes there and what 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:39.260
 that kind of thing but such a knife 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:43.250
 turned out we will not dwell on 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:47.470
 thank you all for your support 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.470
 Thank you all for your attention. Bye bye.
