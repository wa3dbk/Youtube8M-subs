00:00:00.373 --> 00:00:06.172
 Find the sum of 4/11 and 9/13. 

00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:09.916
 To gather these two fractions, we need to find their common denominator. 

00:00:09.916 --> 00:00:14.384
 And this common denominator should be at least a total multiple of 11 and 13. 

00:00:14.384 --> 00:00:17.617
 These numbers do not have common multipliers, 

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:22.410
 so that at least the combined total would be the product of 11 and 13. 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.188
 We can say 13. 11. 

00:00:27.188 --> 00:00:29.273
 13. 1 = 13 

00:00:29.273 --> 00:00:32.415
 Already 13. 1 = 13 

00:00:32.415 --> 00:00:35.394
 Or you can say that 13. 10 = 130 

00:00:35.394 --> 00:00:39.480
 And we get 3, 4, 1 - 143. 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.540
 This will be our common denominator. 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.292
 I will record it here: 

00:00:43.292 --> 00:00:45.523
 something on 143+ 

00:00:45.523 --> 00:00:48.756
 something else on 143. 

00:00:48.756 --> 00:00:52.125
 To get from 4/11 to something on 143, 

00:00:52.125 --> 00:00:55.438
 we multiply 11 by 13. 

00:00:55.438 --> 00:00:58.257
 That is, we multiply the denominator by 13. 

00:00:58.257 --> 00:01:01.223
 So we will have to multiply the numerator by 13. 

00:01:01.223 --> 00:01:04.938
 And 4. 13 - let's see: 4. 10 = 40; 

00:01:04.938 --> 00:01:07.594
 4. 3 = 12. So it's 52. 

00:01:07.594 --> 00:01:10.106
 If you want, you can do it by hand. 

00:01:10.106 --> 00:01:12.291
 4. 13 = 52. 

00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:17.714
 Then, to get from 13 to 143, we multiply by 11. 

00:01:17.714 --> 00:01:20.104
 If we multiply the denominator by 11, 

00:01:20.104 --> 00:01:22.018
 if we do not want to change the value of the liver, 

00:01:22.018 --> 00:01:24.722
 we have to multiply the numerator by 11. 

00:01:24.722 --> 00:01:27.331
 9. 11 = 99 

00:01:27.331 --> 00:01:33.925
 We are now ready to collect: this is equal to ... our common denominator is 143 ... 

00:01:33.925 --> 00:01:35.591
 A 52 + 99 ... 

00:01:35.591 --> 00:01:37.959
 52 + 100 equals 152, 

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:39.739
 it will be 1 less than that 

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:43.073
 Then it will be 151. 

00:01:43.073 --> 00:01:45.739
 I think we can not simplify it more than that. 

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:51.714
 As far as I know, 151 and 143 do not have common multipliers. 

00:01:51.714 --> 00:01:54.732
 So we get 151/143. 

00:01:54.732 --> 00:01:56.585
 We can also record it as a mixed number. 

00:01:56.585 --> 00:02:01.774
 Because 143 is contained in 151 once. 

00:02:01.774 --> 00:02:04.107
 1. 143 = 143 

00:02:04.107 --> 00:02:07.678
 When we take out - let's see, it can be 11, 

00:02:07.678 --> 00:02:08.667
 this is 4. 

00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:10.473
 11 - 3 = 8 

00:02:10.473 --> 00:02:11.905
 We have left 8. 

00:02:11.905 --> 00:02:21.260
 So 151/143 = 1 and 8/143 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.294
 Now it becomes even clearer that these can no longer be simplified. 

00:02:25.294 --> 00:02:32.537
 And we're done. This is the same as 1 and 8/143.
