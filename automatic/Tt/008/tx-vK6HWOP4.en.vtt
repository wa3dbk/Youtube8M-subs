the transmission used a couple different

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.209 
the transmission used a couple different

and<00:00:46.039> a<00:00:47.600> CV<00:00:48.600> axle<00:00:49.579> attachment<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.700> end<00:00:52.520> one

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
and a CV axle attachment on the end one

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.950 
and a CV axle attachment on the end one
of<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.670> issues<00:00:54.000> was<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.239> slide<00:00:54.719> hammer

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
of the issues was the slide hammer

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.170 
of the issues was the slide hammer
wasn't<00:00:55.440> really<00:00:55.649> long<00:00:55.829> enough<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.940> get<00:00:57.059> the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
wasn't really long enough to get the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.340 
wasn't really long enough to get the
leverage<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.600> needed<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.050> then<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.230> other

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
leverage I needed and then the other

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.770 
leverage I needed and then the other
issue<00:00:58.590> was<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.100> CV<00:00:59.430> axle<00:00:59.579> tool<00:01:00.149> there<00:01:00.539> on<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
issue was the CV axle tool there on the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.880 
issue was the CV axle tool there on the
end<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.109> attachment<00:01:02.210> would<00:01:03.210> not<00:01:03.420> go<00:01:03.690> around

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
end the attachment would not go around

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.350 
end the attachment would not go around
the<00:01:04.890> CV<00:01:05.159> axle<00:01:05.280> was<00:01:05.670> not<00:01:05.820> enough<00:01:06.030> clearance

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
the CV axle was not enough clearance

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.600 
the CV axle was not enough clearance
between<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.260> transmission<00:01:07.860> case<00:01:08.100> in<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.549> so

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
between the transmission case in that so

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.990 
between the transmission case in that so
used<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:12.530> breaker<00:01:13.530> bar<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.990> a<00:01:16.369> nylon<00:01:17.369> pull

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
used a breaker bar and a nylon pull

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.350 
used a breaker bar and a nylon pull
strap<00:01:18.390> wrap<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.560> nylon<00:01:19.950> pull<00:01:20.189> strap<00:01:20.520> around

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
strap wrap the nylon pull strap around

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.679 
strap wrap the nylon pull strap around
the<00:01:21.900> base<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:23.280> CV<00:01:23.970> axle<00:01:24.119> where<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.600> goes

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
the base of the CV axle where it goes

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.380 
the base of the CV axle where it goes
into<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.080> transmission<00:01:26.119> secured<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.240> with<00:01:27.270> a

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
into the transmission secured it with a

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.350 
into the transmission secured it with a
slipknot<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.229> then<00:01:29.659> basically<00:01:30.659> just<00:01:32.270> put<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
slipknot and then basically just put the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.600 
slipknot and then basically just put the
breaker<00:01:33.600> bar<00:01:33.869> through<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.439> outlet<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.369> this

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
breaker bar through the outlet of this

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.950 
breaker bar through the outlet of this
hook<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:37.310> then<00:01:39.140> swung<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.290> like<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> hammer<00:01:41.960> and

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
hook and then swung it like a hammer and

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.719 
hook and then swung it like a hammer and
about<00:01:43.470> five<00:01:44.100> or<00:01:44.280> six<00:01:44.430> pulls<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.840> popped<00:01:46.439> out

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
about five or six pulls it popped out

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.490 
about five or six pulls it popped out
and

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.680 

here<00:01:53.500> you<00:01:53.680> can<00:01:53.830> see<00:01:54.010> what<00:01:54.190> popped<00:01:54.430> out

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
here you can see what popped out

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.020 
here you can see what popped out
basically<00:01:55.690> this<00:01:55.960> little<00:01:56.549> bushing<00:01:57.549> right<00:01:57.700> here

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
basically this little bushing right here

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.930 
basically this little bushing right here
is<00:01:58.150> supposed<00:01:58.510> to<00:01:58.600> collapse<00:01:59.049> when<00:01:59.670> you<00:02:00.670> when

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
is supposed to collapse when you when

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.800 
is supposed to collapse when you when
you<00:02:01.030> go<00:02:01.150> to<00:02:01.180> pull<00:02:01.479> it<00:02:01.570> out<00:02:01.690> or<00:02:01.960> pry<00:02:02.170> it<00:02:02.229> out<00:02:02.440> and

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
you go to pull it out or pry it out and

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.510 
you go to pull it out or pry it out and
just<00:02:04.810> sometimes<00:02:05.229> hard<00:02:05.470> to<00:02:05.530> dislodge<00:02:05.950> from<00:02:06.009> the

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
just sometimes hard to dislodge from the

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:12.210 
just sometimes hard to dislodge from the
from<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:06.990> transmission<00:02:07.990> so<00:02:11.010> if<00:02:12.010> you<00:02:12.100> have

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
from the transmission so if you have

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.100 
from the transmission so if you have
problems<00:02:12.459> maybe<00:02:13.450> that's<00:02:13.660> a<00:02:13.750> way<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:13.870> do<00:02:14.080> it

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
problems maybe that's a way to do it

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.110 
problems maybe that's a way to do it
again<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:14.860> could<00:02:14.980> probably<00:02:15.130> use<00:02:15.340> a<00:02:15.370> chain<00:02:15.730> or

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
again you could probably use a chain or

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.090 
again you could probably use a chain or
in<00:02:16.540> my<00:02:16.780> case<00:02:16.840> I<00:02:17.230> did<00:02:17.380> not<00:02:17.500> have<00:02:17.620> a<00:02:17.680> chain<00:02:17.890> so<00:02:18.040> I

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
in my case I did not have a chain so I

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.690 
in my case I did not have a chain so I
used<00:02:18.370> a<00:02:18.900> nylon<00:02:19.900> strap<00:02:20.860> and<00:02:21.220> then<00:02:22.180> attached<00:02:22.989> the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
used a nylon strap and then attached the

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.720 
used a nylon strap and then attached the
breaker<00:02:24.700> bar<00:02:25.000> to<00:02:25.269> it<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:26.190> you<00:02:27.190> can<00:02:27.370> swing<00:02:27.640> it

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
breaker bar to it and you can swing it

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.890 
breaker bar to it and you can swing it
like<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.880> bat<00:02:28.890> thanks
