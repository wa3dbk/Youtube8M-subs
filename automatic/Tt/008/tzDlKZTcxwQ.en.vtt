00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.319 
duplicate that one more time d XR ey and
then<00:03:43.959> bring<00:03:44.200> it<00:03:44.350> over<00:03:44.739> here<00:03:44.820> ok<00:03:45.820> so<00:03:45.880> now<00:03:46.150> we're

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
then bring it over here ok so now we're

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.780 
then bring it over here ok so now we're
done<00:03:46.480> modeling<00:03:46.780> it<00:03:47.200> and<00:03:47.380> now<00:03:47.709> let's<00:03:48.130> go<00:03:48.640> ahead

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
done modeling it and now let's go ahead

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.830 
done modeling it and now let's go ahead
and<00:03:49.709> do<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:50.920> textures<00:03:51.450> so<00:03:52.450> you're<00:03:52.690> going<00:03:52.780> to

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
and do the textures so you're going to

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.470 
and do the textures so you're going to
click<00:03:53.109> on<00:03:53.140> one<00:03:53.620> thing<00:03:54.130> and<00:03:54.489> go<00:03:55.180> to<00:03:55.239> the

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
click on one thing and go to the

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.840 
click on one thing and go to the
textures<00:03:55.989> by<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.040> way<00:03:57.190> you<00:03:57.250> can<00:03:57.579> go<00:03:57.700> ahead<00:03:57.760> and

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
textures by the way you can go ahead and

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.920 
textures by the way you can go ahead and
apply<00:03:58.150> that<00:03:58.530> go<00:03:59.530> to<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.829> textures<00:04:00.870> added<00:04:01.870> a

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
apply that go to the textures added a

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.930 
apply that go to the textures added a
new<00:04:02.079> one<00:04:02.290> and<00:04:02.560> then<00:04:02.980> just<00:04:03.190> make<00:04:03.400> the<00:04:03.549> color<00:04:03.760> one

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
new one and then just make the color one

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.960 
new one and then just make the color one

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
of the colors or the rubik's cube so red

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.900 
of the colors or the rubik's cube so red
they're<00:04:09.970> going<00:04:10.180> to<00:04:10.239> slip<00:04:10.450> this<00:04:10.600> one<00:04:10.840> and<00:04:11.910> do

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
they're going to slip this one and do

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
they're going to slip this one and do
blue<00:04:15.180> then<00:04:16.180> move<00:04:18.930> yellow<00:04:21.690> yellow
