00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.500
 hi all guys are drinking areas a 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.500
 day a new review initials 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.420
 and here we are guys with another one 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.730
 ninja turtles if he did n't yet 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.500
 understood the month of August and delicate a 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.060
 these ninja turtles from the series 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.099
 playmates just for the film 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.009
 which will be released in September I wanted to do 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.620
 this guys anyway we have today 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.120
 michelangelo the most joker we say 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.339
 of the ninja turtles we see the 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.290
 packaging quickly always the same 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:42.570
 with the difference that naturally exists 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.210
 written michelangelo really very beautiful 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.449
 really very colorful indeed a lot 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.190
 90 years I have to say however we see on 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:51.570
 back guys there's the usual image 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.460
 very beautiful 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.100
 the four turtles to collect 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.540
 of course I have already reviewed donatello 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.519
 and leonardo if you want to see theirs 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.369
 reviews clicked on respectively 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.680
 leonardo Can Donatello is now like at 

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:07.260
 usually here is the biography if you want 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.299
 read it pause 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.610
 now the figure is naturally produced 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.530
 of the playmates toys we go immediately to 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.869
 see how it looks out of the 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.880
 packaging and here we are guys with the 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.550
 our michelangelo out of the box 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.420
 really beautiful this is one of the 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.310
 my favorites 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.470
 my absolute favorite and leonardo 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.480
 I haven't told you in the past then there is 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.040
 naturally raffaello that I will review the 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.290
 next week is this here is the 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.480
 third favorite even almost equal 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.370
 merit with others especially for the 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.800
 color because orange is one of mine 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.630
 favorite colors is really cool 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.640
 wherever we go to see immediately 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.040
 details begin with the usual basis 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.229
 guys I wrote michelangelo is the 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.330
 place of teenage ninja turtles 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.170
 mutant ninja turtles really raised 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.210
 beautiful 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.790
 the usual pins to position ours 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.010
 michelangelo with the holes under the feet 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.979
 naturally he is accompanied by his own 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.740
 nunchaku here they are orange and 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.310
 silver with the chain a moment of 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.100
 zoom 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.020
 here they are splendid real handle 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.530
 orange with the added parts of the 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.400
 metal chain 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.990
 I hope very simple children really but 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.030
 made perfectly now 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.250
 naturally we focus on ours 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.410
 michelangelo as you see unlike 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.750
 Leonardo and Atellana none 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.640
 opening with intense grits but to the 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.850
 mouth completely closed expression 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.250
 always serious but less pissed we say 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.680
 so with regards to the eyes perhaps 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.290
 here this is a little more cross-eyed 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.880
 of the high but not so much noticed then 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.040
 doesn't bother me at all like at 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.900
 usually the mask and the color of 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.480
 turtle as well as all bands 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.190
 of the body that is the orange and we have the 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.280
 bow that flutters in a position 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.530
 different from both Leonardo and Donatello 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.540
 this turtle is really beautiful too 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.489
 as you see the color of the skin a little 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.709
 darker than the others after the 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.470
 I will compare 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.630
 we have the waistband without shoulder strap 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.340
 this time with m this is the only one 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.590
 present painting 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.690
 for the rest it is really very well done 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.250
 as usual, however, there is no repentance 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.650
 really all very simple without 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.720
 nuances or nothing but me guys 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.549
 they like this tartare a lot 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.590
 shell carved beautifully into 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.650
 hard plastic this shell is not in 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.780
 semi soft plastic like all the 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.390
 turtle instead of this piece 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.299
 frontal which is applied over like 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.420
 see here on the strip there are four 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:34.150
 let's say slots to insert precisely in 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.970
 a charlie here well i post live 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.519
 really gorgeous guys this thing 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:43.299
 that weapons can be sheathed 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:45.459
 all of them perfect here in a 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.410
 play behind our michelangelo 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.060
 really spectacular guys 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.120
 let's look at the joints like 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:55.120
 as usual, the rep is on me today 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.070
 involata children boys plot twist 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.989
 however now I show you the sphere 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.640
 here we are, here it is perfect 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.340
 let's put our heads back in place 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.170
 however you can put a little more 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.540
 upwards and you leaning it a little 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.670
 on the spire however it can do it and also 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.070
 the others can do this 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.870
 but guys I don't know whether to recommend it to you 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.519
 because maybe it could come loose 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.510
 the joint then we put the a 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.700
 place 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.860
 I said the head can rotate 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.110
 maybe a little upward as if also 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.880
 laterally so really a good one 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.890
 articulation for the head 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.660
 we have the opening here in the arms 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.790
 as long as it can reach upwards 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.440
 rotation here at the biceps dop e 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.650
 elbow joint always with the 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.810
 band in the middle that limits a little 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.360
 the joint is bent at the wrist 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.340
 single to the fingers of course really 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.800
 very cool this fact the little can 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.960
 we bend and rotate we have the classic 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.380
 articulation here on the bus really a lot 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.780
 effective can rotate see here can 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.150
 rotate almost entirely naturally is 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.340
 limited by the shell so I don't recommend 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.920
 too much to force because it could 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.080
 to detach the shell we have the opening 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.030
 at the legs net here are a bit of us 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.730
 as I also said the others on the plate 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.160
 so there is a risk that they will not go 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.440
 properly used it is very simple 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.630
 move them boys a little anyway 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.160
 flaw on total perfection 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.990
 because these figures love them 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.670
 we keep turning here 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.750
 leg 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.030
 we have double folding at 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.000
 knee bending at the foot 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.900
 single activation of the toes 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.610
 fantastic guys 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.800
 and here we are guys with all the taxes 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.840
 which I reviewed so far to put 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.090
 a little comparison of the colors as you see 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.550
 michelangelo's is much darker 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.290
 compared to the other two, that of raising 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.210
 donatello is almost similar but it shows 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.160
 that of donatello and a little lighter 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.410
 so guys this difference 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.240
 chromatic is really splendid and proper 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.280
 how the height should be 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.220
 of course the same as for the high way 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:54.010
 2 or about 16 centimeters the price 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:56.770
 this too is the same, that is, about 20 euros 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:59.560
 about even 25 a little up from 15 euros 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:02.380
 initials to which I found the boys 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.690
 I wanted to tell you to be careful about those 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.730
 who come from Hong Kong from China 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.980
 because I'm not 100 percent sure 

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:11.020
 one hundred that they can be original 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.720
 find at 15 16 euros 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.150
 but guys I honestly don't 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.280
 I would risk because I see details that 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.890
 they are not exactly the same for example 

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:23.710
 for example one that I noticed is that the 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:24.729
 white band of donatello in those from 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:28.059
 Hong Kong 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:30.069
 it is not white but silver so it is not 

00:06:28.059 --> 00:06:31.330
 I know guys, this detail makes me 

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:33.490
 turn up your nose a little 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:36.099
 I wouldn't want them to be fakes then 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.199
 guys if you can find them from europe 

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:39.789
 and check those why too 

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:42.580
 there are sellers 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:44.650
 let's say a bit forks anyway also for 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.360
 Today our review ends in 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.889
 which the boys let me like if the 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.689
 video you liked leave a comment 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:52.059
 with your opinions 

00:06:49.689 --> 00:06:53.710
 if you really want to help them, share it 

00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:56.050
 as always there is the law we close 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.550
 below in description if found 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.169
 something interesting lives that

 we sent it and it will make you beautiful 

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:01.899
 Discount 

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:05.969
 we believe in the next video guys 

00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:05.969
 hello give by the three ninja turtles
