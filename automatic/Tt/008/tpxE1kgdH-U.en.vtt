00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
to get to that position and it's

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.150

have a guide my guide is the thumb
touching<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:44.030> curvature<00:00:45.030> on<00:00:45.269> the<00:00:45.629> inside<00:00:45.960> of

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
touching the curvature on the inside of

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.419 
touching the curvature on the inside of
the<00:00:46.199> violin<00:00:46.559> now<00:00:46.710> we've<00:00:47.010> been<00:00:47.129> talking<00:00:47.280> about

00:00:47.419 --> 00:00:47.429 
the violin now we've been talking about

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:50.209 
the violin now we've been talking about
first<00:00:47.729> position<00:00:48.210> second<00:00:49.139> position<00:00:49.219> third

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
first position second position third

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.219 
first position second position third
position<00:00:50.249> this<00:00:51.089> is<00:00:51.299> fourth<00:00:51.569> position<00:00:51.959> for<00:00:52.109> me

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:52.229 
position this is fourth position for me

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:57.709 
position this is fourth position for me
so<00:00:52.589> play<00:00:53.159> an<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.429> on<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.030> g<00:00:54.209> string<00:00:55.909> shift<00:00:56.909> until

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
so play an a on the g string shift until

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.559 
so play an a on the g string shift until
for<00:00:58.260> me<00:00:58.409> it<00:00:58.769> feels<00:00:59.100> like<00:00:59.429> my<00:00:59.850> first<00:01:00.089> finger<00:01:00.420> my

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:00.569 
for me it feels like my first finger my

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:02.270 
for me it feels like my first finger my
thumb<00:01:00.600> are<00:01:01.019> meeting<00:01:01.499> each<00:01:01.619> other<00:01:01.829> right<00:01:02.039> here

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
thumb are meeting each other right here

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.770 
thumb are meeting each other right here
it<00:01:02.549> actually<00:01:02.729> feels<00:01:03.179> that<00:01:03.329> way<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.479> know<00:01:03.600> it

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
it actually feels that way I know it

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.119 
it actually feels that way I know it
doesn't<00:01:04.080> look<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.500> when<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.800> look<00:01:04.980> at

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
doesn't look like that when you look at

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.950 
doesn't look like that when you look at
it<00:01:05.280> across<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.790> string<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.510> best<00:01:06.690> way<00:01:06.870> it

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
it across the string the best way it

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.620 
it across the string the best way it
feels<00:01:07.110> like<00:01:07.380> for<00:01:07.590> me<00:01:10.940> so<00:01:11.940> once<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.270> get<00:01:12.450> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
feels like for me so once you get the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.930 
feels like for me so once you get the
fourth<00:01:12.840> position<00:01:13.020> practice<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.100> scale<00:01:14.520> on<00:01:14.820> it

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
fourth position practice a scale on it

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.030 
fourth position practice a scale on it
so<00:01:15.420> we're<00:01:15.840> starting<00:01:16.080> with<00:01:16.230> a<00:01:16.380> diesel<00:01:16.560> play<00:01:16.950> at

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
so we're starting with a diesel play at

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.310 
so we're starting with a diesel play at
the<00:01:17.160> major

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:31.440 

anyway<00:01:25.740> when<00:01:26.740> you<00:01:26.830> get<00:01:26.980> there<00:01:30.270> playing<00:01:31.270> both

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
anyway when you get there playing both

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.970 
anyway when you get there playing both
notes<00:01:31.720> at<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:31.840> same<00:01:31.900> time<00:01:32.200> just<00:01:32.620> to<00:01:32.680> check

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
notes at the same time just to check

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.740 
notes at the same time just to check
that<00:01:33.130> it's<00:01:33.280> right<00:01:33.430> so<00:01:33.850> do<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.090> same<00:01:34.270> thing<00:01:34.540> on

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
that it's right so do the same thing on

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:43.770 
that it's right so do the same thing on
the<00:01:35.140> D<00:01:35.290> string<00:01:36.690> once<00:01:37.690> you<00:01:37.780> get<00:01:37.900> there<00:01:38.940> check<00:01:39.940> it

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.980 

then<00:01:44.780> do<00:01:44.900> the<00:01:44.990> same<00:01:45.140> thing<00:01:45.200> on<00:01:45.410> the<00:01:45.470> a-string

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.350 

check<00:01:48.619> it
