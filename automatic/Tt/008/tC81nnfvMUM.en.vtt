00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:18.290
 the hpc 1 river is the newest scion 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.290
 from the forge of hpi 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:28.449
 a lot of power paired with true to the original 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:31.070
 optics at the moment in the trend 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:35.710
 with bosch drive and deserts buggy 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.710
 design is the 18 model so full fashion 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.449
 Under the body hides 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.220
 solid hpi technology a watertight 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:47.600
 steers servo with metal gear provides 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.220
 for a direct implementation of the 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.470
 steering commands the lower wishbones 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.239
 stand out due to their massive construction 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.299
 so dirt does not come so easily to the 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.220
 axles cvd waves and zeha bearer 

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:00.619
 reflect the high quality standard of the 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.930
 Model's again the flight engine has more 

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:05.049
 as sufficient power of the regulator 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.909
 sits well protected in the back of the model 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.530
 the onboard perspective shows that 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.700
 even the interior of the model 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.700
 Model is modeled 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.320
 favorite terrain of the desert buggies 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.270
 Of course, sand can be here 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.340
 and mature your strengths fully play 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.050
 as a small drawback you could the 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.580
 cite missing stabilizers 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.800
 But you really miss them 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:43.590
 not so even apache wanted clean 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:45.360
 Over the underground you leave it in 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.810
 terrain really is fun 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.610
 on 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:52.740
 optically, the model is a real one 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.450
 tasty flat cracks over gentle 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.400
 Of course, hills are one of them 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.120
 they are driving style 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.120
 easy to handle 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.650
 The chassis can be the ba's origin 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.560
 do not deny 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.119
 only the wheelbase is a bit bigger 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.640
 the yokohama tires are exemplary 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.200
 and have a good clip the one-piece 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.830
 body gives the model its 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.830
 typical look 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.330
 the hpc 1 fliers in the sales of the 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.130
 Electronics is an ultimate 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.500
 jokers for easy and rough 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.660
 terrain he convinced not only by the 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.530
 robust construction but also by the 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.530
 realistic look
