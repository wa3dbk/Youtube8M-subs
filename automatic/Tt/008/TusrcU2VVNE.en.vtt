00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.170
 good people, how are you? 

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:07.030
 We are in test of 3x 2015 we are going to 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.299
 spend a few representatives but 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:13.780
 before I want to say hello to quite dharma 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:16.750
 to be and to be and frame flowers so to 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.060
 the four sent them a huge salute a 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.429
 heartfelt hug from my heart 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.679
 and I hope you enjoy this video and 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:26.169
 others also come good vale see 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:29.339
 that I have five representatives and the 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:29.339
 true that I know very well what to do 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.990
 well I think I'm going to spend in a 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.989
 star well for throwing it because total 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:41.730
 so I want it 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.010
 uy 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.880
 to see I counted well the sixth was a 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.700
 black ball how can it be if yes a 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.400
 good black frob but if the cone 5% of 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.190
 my mother practically against all 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.230
 probability you want this class 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.609
 good midfielder I do not know if I'll be able to 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.070
 use is good time can play from 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.840
 defensive midfielder to the best one and 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.820
 saved me 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.909
 although it was good to have neither is it a 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.390
 super top the player vale 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.189
 yellow but good come on let's go with the 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.069
 rest of representatives you see me 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.500
 there are three the spent 12 in total are 4 

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:21.950
 but it puts me 5 out so there is something wrong 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:29.930
 there is something that is wrong and 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:33.649
 in short let's change the word good 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.679
 nothing happens this with a 20% percentage 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:40.579
 I get a bronze ball 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:44.539
 the fucking trash in short roberto chen you're 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:49.039
 sales bait more bad and classic 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:50.810
 have it omnipresent good is a 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.439
 plug 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.500
 quite unruly is like daniel the 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:00.430
 naughty some good I think 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.799
 pretty good from the life of gunboat 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.670
 well interesting especially if 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.700
 used as defensive midfielder 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.630
 because of course I do not have midfielders and 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.630
 then they have nothing 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.240
 good 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.069
 let's spend 10 thousand game points that 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.970
 we have curred them in a front 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:24.490
 come I want someone else up there 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.660
 someone who can put when he is 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.760
 tired or rem and og pine or even 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.670
 replace popo which is also not not going 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.540
 to be black ball that I already tell you 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.430
 it's not a big deal 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.719
 I have been left for one but it is that the 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:45.109
 fifth is the fifth one gave black ball good 

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:46.909
 who are you and I saw andinista not you 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.829
 seen and what I've seen players 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:51.310
 Italians the strength of being in Italy 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:54.750
 but this project is never 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.510
 what to investigate, let's see 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.690
 structure the template we change it for 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.350
 Cardenas so 75 x 75 I have no problems 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.040
 of expenses 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.849
 Where are you 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:10.790
 down here in Abidjan team and well let's go 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:12.200
 to place it in all positions 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.099
 Of attack 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:21.349
 we bring front to see the 71 front 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:23.620
 good end 70 and the other side 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.620
 as well 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.710
 which low enough the average 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.530
 70 of mediapunta is quite versatile 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.060
 Can be used as a replacement and such 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:38.060
 It seems pretty good, I hope you have 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.060
 liked is opening balls 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.440
 surprise no black ball with class already 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.360
 we will see if I use it or not in the end what is said 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.950
 a pleasure to be here as much as this is 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.120
 a ratillo and see you in the next 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.120
 example see you later
