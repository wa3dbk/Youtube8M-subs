that in fact enhances complexity that

that in fact enhances complexity that
enhances<00:01:04.430> flexibility<00:01:05.269> that<00:01:05.510> frees<00:01:05.900> us<00:01:06.170> from

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.500 

we<00:01:16.370> introduced<00:01:16.850> something<00:01:17.390> called

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
we introduced something called

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.870 
we introduced something called
congestion<00:01:18.020> charging<00:01:18.530> here<00:01:18.740> in<00:01:18.920> London<00:01:19.520> which

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
congestion charging here in London which

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.630 
congestion charging here in London which
was<00:01:20.120> designed<00:01:20.360> to<00:01:20.810> reduce<00:01:21.500> traffic<00:01:22.190> flows

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
was designed to reduce traffic flows

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.660 
was designed to reduce traffic flows
into<00:01:22.940> the<00:01:23.750> center<00:01:24.050> of<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:24.230> city<00:01:24.410> as<00:01:24.650> well<00:01:25.400> as

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
into the center of the city as well as

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.280 
into the center of the city as well as
to<00:01:25.700> reduce<00:01:25.940> congestion<00:01:26.330> in<00:01:26.930> terms<00:01:27.170> of

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
to reduce congestion in terms of

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.350 
to reduce congestion in terms of
congestion<00:01:27.650> charging<00:01:28.280> I<00:01:28.490> think<00:01:28.820> what<00:01:29.180> that

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
congestion charging I think what that

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.020 
congestion charging I think what that
has<00:01:29.540> done<00:01:29.570> is<00:01:29.930> given<00:01:30.140> a<00:01:30.290> strong<00:01:30.530> message<00:01:30.770> to

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
has done is given a strong message to

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.260 
has done is given a strong message to
cities<00:01:32.030> across<00:01:32.360> the<00:01:32.450> Western<00:01:32.990> world<00:01:33.160> that<00:01:34.270> the

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
cities across the Western world that the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.380 
cities across the Western world that the
road<00:01:35.540> is<00:01:35.570> discussed<00:01:36.350> good<00:01:36.740> and<00:01:37.240> therefore<00:01:38.240> we

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
road is discussed good and therefore we

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.720 
road is discussed good and therefore we
have<00:01:38.420> to<00:01:38.600> have<00:01:38.930> some<00:01:39.680> way<00:01:39.710> of<00:01:40.130> making<00:01:40.700> people

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
have to have some way of making people

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.090 
have to have some way of making people
feel<00:01:41.240> differently<00:01:41.810> about<00:01:42.050> the<00:01:42.440> way<00:01:42.590> they<00:01:42.800> use

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
feel differently about the way they use

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.820 
feel differently about the way they use
it<00:01:43.370> just<00:01:43.970> in<00:01:44.180> the<00:01:44.360> four<00:01:44.900> years<00:01:44.930> plus<00:01:45.500> that<00:01:45.710> I've

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
it just in the four years plus that I've

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.340 
it just in the four years plus that I've
been<00:01:46.040> here<00:01:46.250> we've<00:01:46.700> achieved<00:01:46.880> a<00:01:47.420> major<00:01:47.750> change

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
been here we've achieved a major change

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.130 
been here we've achieved a major change
and<00:01:48.680> that<00:01:49.010> public<00:01:49.520> transport<00:01:50.090> use<00:01:50.300> is<00:01:50.570> now<00:01:50.810> up

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
and that public transport use is now up

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.010 
and that public transport use is now up
four<00:01:51.440> percent<00:01:51.920> and<00:01:52.160> automobile<00:01:53.150> use<00:01:53.420> is<00:01:53.660> down

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
four percent and automobile use is down

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.440 
four percent and automobile use is down
four<00:01:54.500> percent<00:01:54.620> and<00:01:55.130> now<00:01:55.610> we<00:01:55.670> can<00:01:55.940> be<00:01:56.060> a<00:01:56.090> model

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
four percent and now we can be a model

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.500 
four percent and now we can be a model
for<00:01:56.600> other<00:01:56.660> cities<00:01:57.170> so<00:01:57.440> if<00:01:57.560> New<00:01:57.740> York's

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
for other cities so if New York's

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.360 
for other cities so if New York's
focusing<00:01:59.510> on<00:01:59.690> this<00:01:59.870> paid<00:02:00.590> any<00:02:00.800> attention<00:02:00.830> at

he is going to at least lay the base for
city<00:02:24.680> in<00:02:24.980> which<00:02:25.160> people<00:02:25.640> have<00:02:25.670> a<00:02:25.850> shot<00:02:26.180> at

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
city in which people have a shot at

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.840 
city in which people have a shot at
lives<00:02:26.800> spending<00:02:27.800> a<00:02:27.920> lot<00:02:28.100> less<00:02:28.130> time<00:02:28.520> in<00:02:28.700> their

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
lives spending a lot less time in their

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.520

so<00:02:31.160> what<00:02:31.400> better<00:02:32.180> on<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.420> donor<00:02:32.630> is<00:02:32.660> doing<00:02:33.080> is

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
so what better on the donor is doing is

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.440 
so what better on the donor is doing is
taking<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:34.160> place<00:02:34.400> out<00:02:34.640> of<00:02:34.940> the<00:02:35.030> cars<00:02:35.270> and
