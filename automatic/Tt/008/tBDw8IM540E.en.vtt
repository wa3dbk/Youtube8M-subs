00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:07.099 

alright<00:00:02.879> so<00:00:03.980> this<00:00:04.980> is<00:00:05.190> my<00:00:05.370> kite<00:00:06.359> fishing<00:00:06.600> set

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
alright so this is my kite fishing set

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.680 
alright so this is my kite fishing set
up<00:00:07.290> to<00:00:07.589> a<00:00:08.040> couple<00:00:08.639> people<00:00:08.670> that<00:00:09.059> wanted<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.389> see

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
up to a couple people that wanted to see

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.919 
up to a couple people that wanted to see
what<00:00:09.870> it<00:00:09.900> was<00:00:10.139> but<00:00:11.130> I<00:00:11.400> use<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.790> dial<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.389> tannic

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
what it was but I use the dial of tannic

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.010 
what it was but I use the dial of tannic
on<00:00:13.110> 1000<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:17.150> is<00:00:18.150> I'm<00:00:18.330> pretty<00:00:18.570> sure<00:00:18.810> this<00:00:18.960> is

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
on 1000 and is I'm pretty sure this is

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.290 
on 1000 and is I'm pretty sure this is
like<00:00:19.260> 80<00:00:19.529> pound<00:00:19.859> I<00:00:20.160> think<00:00:20.609> it's<00:00:20.699> tough<00:00:20.910> line<00:00:21.119> or

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
like 80 pound I think it's tough line or

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.810 
like 80 pound I think it's tough line or
something<00:00:21.660> but<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:22.199> like<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.890> 80-pound

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
something but I like the 80-pound

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.599 
something but I like the 80-pound
because<00:00:24.600> it's<00:00:24.900> pretty<00:00:25.230> strong<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.920> don't

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
because it's pretty strong I don't

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.029 
because it's pretty strong I don't
really<00:00:26.849> use<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.480> kite<00:00:27.750> too<00:00:28.109> much<00:00:28.289> in<00:00:28.529> high

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
really use the kite too much in high

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.189 
really use the kite too much in high
winds<00:00:29.359> so<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.390> don't<00:00:30.630> really<00:00:30.689> need<00:00:31.019> the

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
winds so I don't really need the

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.440 
winds so I don't really need the
strength<00:00:31.529> but<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.899> lower<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:34.730> pound<00:00:35.730> test<00:00:36.239> you

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
strength but the lower of pound test you

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.299 
strength but the lower of pound test you
can<00:00:36.630> go<00:00:36.809> on<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.649> better<00:00:37.890> because<00:00:38.129> it

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
can go on this is the better because it

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.450 
can go on this is the better because it
will<00:00:38.460> help<00:00:39.420> keep<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.230> drag<00:00:40.530> down<00:00:40.770> which<00:00:41.129> can

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
will help keep the drag down which can

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.110 
will help keep the drag down which can
help<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.790> kite<00:00:42.000> fly<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.360> lot<00:00:42.600> easier<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:44.120> for

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
help the kite fly a lot easier and for

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:53.979 
help the kite fly a lot easier and for
the<00:00:45.210> clips<00:00:46.879> so<00:00:48.710> do<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.800> want<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.219> do<00:00:50.480> is<00:00:51.710> have

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
the clips so do you want to do is have

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.260 
the clips so do you want to do is have
you<00:00:54.989> can<00:00:55.410> notice<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.949> like<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.579> person<00:00:56.850> when

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
you can notice it like in person when

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.459 
you can notice it like in person when
you're<00:00:57.420> doing<00:00:57.719> it<00:00:57.809> but<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:59.960> second<00:01:00.960> clip<00:01:01.230> is

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
you're doing it but the second clip is

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.640 
you're doing it but the second clip is
the<00:01:01.800> biggest<00:01:02.219> one<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.899> by<00:01:03.899> big<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.290> mean<00:01:04.500> like

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
the biggest one and by big I mean like

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.810 
the biggest one and by big I mean like
the<00:01:04.710> diameter<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.790> hole<00:01:06.060> on<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:07.610> so<00:01:08.610> you're

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
the diameter of the hole on it so you're

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.670 
the diameter of the hole on it so you're
going<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.030> want<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.240> have<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:10.320> smallest

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
going to want to have the smallest

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.820 
going to want to have the smallest
diameter<00:01:11.100> clip<00:01:11.909> closest<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.990> snap<00:01:13.320> swivel

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
diameter clip closest to the snap swivel

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.429 
diameter clip closest to the snap swivel
where<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.340> attach<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.850> kite<00:01:15.299> on<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:18.439> what

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
where you attach the kite on to and what

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.160 
where you attach the kite on to and what
happens<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:20.250> when<00:01:20.670> you're<00:01:21.360> sending<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.810> kite

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
happens is when you're sending the kite

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:32.560 
happens is when you're sending the kite
out

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.010 

maybe<00:01:33.440> this<00:01:33.650> is<00:01:33.800> it<00:01:33.860> but<00:01:34.310> I<00:01:34.520> try<00:01:34.729> to<00:01:34.760> do<00:01:35.000> like<00:01:35.240> 75

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
maybe this is it but I try to do like 75

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:43.960 
maybe this is it but I try to do like 75
feet<00:01:36.350> and<00:01:36.970> between<00:01:40.990> in<00:01:41.990> between<00:01:42.220> the<00:01:43.220> kite<00:01:43.490> and

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
feet and between in between the kite and

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:51.340 
feet and between in between the kite and
swivel<00:01:44.960> and<00:01:45.170> in<00:01:46.130> between<00:01:46.340> swivels<00:01:47.860> and<00:01:50.350> so

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
swivel and in between swivels and so

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.020 
swivel and in between swivels and so
what's<00:01:51.560> going<00:01:51.680> to<00:01:51.770> happen<00:01:52.040> is<00:01:52.190> this<00:01:52.520> swivel<00:01:52.970> is

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
what's going to happen is this swivel is

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.170 
what's going to happen is this swivel is
going<00:01:53.180> to<00:01:53.240> come<00:01:53.479> out<00:01:53.890> which<00:01:54.890> is<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:55.580> smallest

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
going to come out which is the smallest

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.180 
going to come out which is the smallest
swivel<00:01:56.950> on<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.430> line<00:01:59.380> let<00:02:00.380> me<00:02:00.500> get<00:02:00.619> this<00:02:00.770> clip

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
swivel on the line let me get this clip

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:22.410 
swivel on the line let me get this clip
really<00:02:01.610> quick

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.510 

and<00:02:22.950> what's<00:02:23.950> going<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.160> happen<00:02:24.580> is<00:02:25.080> since<00:02:26.080> this

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
and what's going to happen is since this

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.020 
and what's going to happen is since this
the<00:02:27.520> diameter<00:02:28.090> of<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.480> Ring<00:02:28.720> here<00:02:29.080> is<00:02:29.349> a

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
the diameter of the Ring here is a

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.690 
the diameter of the Ring here is a
bigger<00:02:31.030> than<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.450> swivel<00:02:32.280> then<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.430> first

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
bigger than the swivel then the first

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.750 
bigger than the swivel then the first
small<00:02:34.120> swivel<00:02:34.660> this<00:02:35.530> clip<00:02:35.920> is<00:02:36.160> going<00:02:36.489> to<00:02:36.580> go

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
small swivel this clip is going to go

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.600 
small swivel this clip is going to go
right<00:02:37.630> through<00:02:38.200> or<00:02:38.500> the<00:02:38.800> swivels<00:02:39.280> going<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:39.459> go

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
right through or the swivels going to go

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:46.160 
right through or the swivels going to go
right<00:02:39.880> through<00:02:40.330> that<00:02:41.580> like<00:02:42.580> that<00:02:43.270> and<00:02:44.700> then

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
right through that like that and then

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.140 
right through that like that and then
this<00:02:47.170> one<00:02:47.380> will<00:02:47.500> slide<00:02:47.830> back<00:02:48.130> down<00:02:48.160> but<00:02:48.970> this

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
this one will slide back down but this

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.220 
this one will slide back down but this
swivel<00:02:49.630> will<00:02:50.230> catch<00:02:50.590> your<00:02:51.209> first<00:02:52.209> clip<00:02:52.569> which

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
swivel will catch your first clip which

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.640 
swivel will catch your first clip which
has<00:02:53.440> a<00:02:53.470> smaller<00:02:53.950> diameter<00:02:54.220> hole<00:02:54.730> and<00:02:55.650> that's

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
has a smaller diameter hole and that's

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.130 
has a smaller diameter hole and that's
pretty<00:02:56.980> much<00:02:57.130> how<00:02:57.340> you<00:02:57.370> lon<00:02:57.700> data<00:02:57.970> might<00:02:58.870> take

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
pretty much how you lon data might take

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.789 
pretty much how you lon data might take
a<00:02:59.170> couple<00:02:59.350> tries<00:02:59.980> to<00:03:00.190> get<00:03:00.340> it<00:03:00.459> right<00:03:00.489> and

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
a couple tries to get it right and

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.930 
a couple tries to get it right and
usually<00:03:02.799> you<00:03:03.760> can<00:03:03.940> buy<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:05.040> kite<00:03:06.040> clips<00:03:06.400> that

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
usually you can buy the kite clips that

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.330 
usually you can buy the kite clips that
come<00:03:07.239> with<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.690> size<00:03:08.200> swivel<00:03:08.769> so<00:03:09.040> you<00:03:09.160> don't

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
come with the size swivel so you don't

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.309 
come with the size swivel so you don't
