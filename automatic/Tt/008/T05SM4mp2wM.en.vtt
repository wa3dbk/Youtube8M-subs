00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:13.160
 hi girls again this is lourdes you 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.510
 friend I do not show my face because I'm 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.309
 working 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.789
 andoni makeup and you do not want me 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.949
 see like this 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.900
 today I want to show you this shoe that 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.900
 I'm doing good 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.220
 I do not know what I have and it's half 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.559
 it's not good it 's night 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.699
 good the color is a blue like a blue 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.890
 litmus the stones that I am 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:48.930
 using are crystal glass 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.719
 these stones are like a 'triplet' 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.629
 or they are not flat they are not flash then you 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.979
 they give that iridescent effect as you can see 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.839
 it looks like gold looks like yellow 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:05.250
 actually the color is a blue and I chose 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:09.179
 this color because the color of the shoe is 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.390
 how about a blue sky inflated blue 

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:14.340
 cake that's why I chose this 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.490
 stone 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.759
 in making the lamp fall 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:25.659
 how can you see the shoe without stones 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.990
 simple has nothing of mercy girls 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.579
 I do not know if they like it they do not like it but 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.420
 I'm trying to teach this is a 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:36.579
 'vis a vis' civil and necessary 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.289
 I'm decorating because it's like 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:42.819
 well and nothing I hope you like I'm going to 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.209
 try to show them to see how it is that 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:49.070
 I put the stones I did not want him 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:52.010
 put nothing on the heel 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.540
 because the taco is like I do not like me 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.090
 like my material that is tea with sun 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.580
 just as it is, I think it's fine 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.700
 I only put the stones in front 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.920
 there are those of mine 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.250
 the stone here in front and I wanted him 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.640
 put a little on the sides too and 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.450
 as always I use the stones that 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.450
 bought on ebay 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.210
 I get a rock over there 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.140
 my tool that is the one that I use 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.840
 but everything itches 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.930
 that I also got it on ebay are 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.870
 easy to grab him 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.220
 yes the stone because it has a like rubber 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.580
 here in front as 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.770
 Something sticky is not that the front 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.160
 that's easier to grab it and 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.050
 this part he used to come with 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.390
 infinity and used it to water the 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.100
 glue on this side and sometimes this 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.160
 side that is more point of the use for 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.050
 give you your stone but there not given 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.270
 that turning the stone takes a lot 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.640
 weather 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.560
 just let me do a little 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.030
 demonstration had already made them a 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.250
 show with our shoes 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.900
 jessica simpson but I will return to 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.390
 make another demonstration of how I 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.100
 I place the stones ok 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.120
 also to apply the glue 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.460
 the glue I use is the 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.560
 6000 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.360
 This is the one that I recommend you not 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.610
 I recommend no other glue this what 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.340
 can be found in any store 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.400
 Crafts 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.760
 it's very cheap I also think that this boat 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.069
 it cost me 13 dollars 3 because it's the 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.170
 medium and large is worth 5 dollars 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:39.800
 it's so expensive and it 's the one I recommend 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.879
 It is very good and we will make the 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.879
 show to see how it is 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.590
 although girls let's see how I have left 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.810
 because working and recording is not the same 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.900
 this as I tell you this is the part of the 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:59.920
 chopped that I use I can not do it 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:03.100
 well I can not see the shoe to laugh at 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:06.010
 perform the glue that I will have 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.990
 that leaving the camera aside only is 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.910
 to teach them how I do it 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.870
 the glue 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:16.139
 let me do it well 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.209
 ok now I will try to put the stone 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:22.470
 As I tell you, it is very difficult to work 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:24.750
 so I put the my ipad on the other side 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.680
 to give me a little bit of light they take the 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.600
 stone with teknaf then place it on the 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.990
 piece as I tell them to keep these are 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.610
 some of the materials that he used 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.919
 but what more the material more 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.419
 important is your patience girls have 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.220
 have to be patient because it is 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.270
 stone for stones that are going to go 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.820
 placing 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.940
 what we followed came to interrupt me 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:53.410
 my children listen to that background noise 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:56.449
 my earthquakes are my children who are 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:59.050
 in the room alone 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.050
 okay 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:07.380
 and we are putting a crown like them 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.940
 I say this is a lot of patience a lot 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.170
 dedication 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.480
 I hope that 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:16.910
 that can teach it 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:20.590
 is losing that glue I'm not going to 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:23.790
 teach how the whole shoe because 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:28.190
 the camera does not let me 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.190
 and finally how to gild and work 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.940
 good girls that's how the 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.270
 shoe and how they are going elevates giving 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.610
 shape 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.760
 It looks beautiful those stones that give a 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:44.860
 very elegant touch the shoe and so it was 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.349
 how I started this other 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:51.099
 and gradually gains will reach 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:53.590
 these pacts super super nes and 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:56.270
 successively as I told them the best 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:59.500
 tool is patience 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.500
 I turned to the camera 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.540
 so that my week is done all for today 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.100
