right<00:01:43.049> now<00:01:43.140> my<00:01:43.350> ideal<00:01:43.799> society<00:01:44.369> isn't<00:01:44.520> going

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
right now my ideal society isn't going

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.760 
right now my ideal society isn't going
to<00:01:44.880> arrive<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.390> week<00:01:45.420> or<00:01:45.750> two<00:01:45.899> or<00:01:46.409> in<00:01:46.680> a

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
four-year presidency so my argument is

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.440 
four-year presidency so my argument is
that<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.250> can<00:01:50.520> do<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.119> can<00:01:51.149> take<00:01:51.420> care
