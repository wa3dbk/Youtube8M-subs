00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hi girls and reserves never succeed in 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.339
 filmed this tutorial inspired by it 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.259
 autumn and the autumn 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.150
 really like tricks with 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.849
 very intense lips and eyes on 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.440
 bronze copper and I said he signed it yesterday 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.790
 evening and this morning when I am 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.920
 woke up I realized that he 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.660
 signed the introduction and I just got it 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.310
 woke up i'm in my pajamas and i 'm 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.900
 no make-up and I have absolutely no desire 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.519
 to re- film the video 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.830
 now the movies on the introduction because they are 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.230
 lazy, however, I hope that by that I see 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.119
 good even beautiful photos and nothing I leave you 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.890
 the tutorial starts applying e 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.899
 blending the concealer and playing it 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.760
 I use this brush and this is one 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.710
 of the real techniques of samantha chapman 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.020
 and I love this brush for the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.640
 concealer is really fantastic part 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.399
 that I love all these brushes and maybe 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.289
 well I should talk about it after that 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.289
 spreads foundation all over my face 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:04.070
 after which he applies a powder for 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.070
 fix the foundation 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.290
 at this point apply a primer on the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.000
 eyes to make the eyeshadow last longer 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.800
 long and after doing the base 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.360
 I apply the polish from something that we do 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.820
 I had never shown it in a tutorial but 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.670
 which I often do then return to 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.720
 our eye makeup 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.670
 I spread this eye shadow in cream of 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.560
 this beautiful gold color over the whole 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.960
 my eyelid bringing it too 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:33.479
 in the fold, however, in sculpture 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.619
 I apply this bronze color in April 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.619
 metallic copper 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.870
 on the fig eyelid instead this color 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.190
 gold that I call to them that I have 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.810
 previously applied and with a 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.340
 brush pen I apply the same two 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.340
 colors also below the lower lashes 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.490
 she wide inside the eye for 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.910
 give some light to this trick 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.680
 I apply an illuminant and then how to 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.150
 usually fill wood eyebrows and le 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.800
 fixed with an eyebrow gel and a 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.510
 Now more and as usual 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.100
 draw a line of black eyeliner 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.680
 ap with the black pencil in the internal rhyme 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.150
 both superior and inferior I pray mine 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.150
 china and I apply a lot of mascara 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:10.050
 on the ancient cheekbones this very pink 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:11.730
 intense and on the lips tricot instead 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.310
 these two primary products with the 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.680
 pencil which is a cherry red almost a 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.600
 burgundy very very clear and then over 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.820
 the lip gloss that has a little bit instead 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.380
 more purple a little more so to the 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.120
 fuchsia and the combination pleases 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.800
 very much for the fall because in 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.380
 autumn I like these lips 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.540
 chastity of the red burgundy plum 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:36.630
 in short these beautiful bright colors beautiful 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:38.010
 intense and therefore this is mine 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.840
 tutorial I hope you enjoyed it 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.790
 I hope there was a little bit useful 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.290
