00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.940 

I<00:00:06.919> think<00:00:07.919> what<00:00:08.160> sets<00:00:08.460> Wayne<00:00:09.420> apart<00:00:09.870> from<00:00:10.139> many

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
I think what sets Wayne apart from many

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.280 
I think what sets Wayne apart from many
other<00:00:11.099> choreographers<00:00:11.880> is<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.330> intensity<00:00:12.990> of

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
other choreographers is the intensity of

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.680 
other choreographers is the intensity of
his<00:00:13.950> choreography

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
his choreography

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.320 
his choreography
what<00:00:16.260> he<00:00:16.379> asks<00:00:16.859> of<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.160> sometimes<00:00:17.609> feels<00:00:18.150> so

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
what he asks of you sometimes feels so

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.850 
what he asks of you sometimes feels so
impossible<00:00:18.689> so<00:00:20.330> extraterrestrial<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:22.230> it's

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:22.860 
impossible so extraterrestrial that it's

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.589 
impossible so extraterrestrial that it's
refreshing<00:00:24.529> it<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.880> extremely<00:00:26.880> demanding<00:00:27.060> on

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
refreshing it is extremely demanding on

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.630 
refreshing it is extremely demanding on
the<00:00:27.810> body<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.710> often<00:00:29.039> come<00:00:29.220> out<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.520> those

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
the body and I often come out of those

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.479 
the body and I often come out of those
rehearsals<00:00:30.360> with<00:00:30.810> big<00:00:31.529> headaches<00:00:31.950> because

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
rehearsals with big headaches because

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.729 
rehearsals with big headaches because
you<00:00:33.180> know<00:00:33.270> my<00:00:33.480> brain<00:00:33.780> feels<00:00:34.140> like<00:00:34.410> it's<00:00:34.590> about

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
you know my brain feels like it's about

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.819 
you know my brain feels like it's about
to<00:00:35.129> explode<00:00:35.969> from<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:36.660> much<00:00:36.809> stimulation<00:00:37.620> but

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
to explode from so much stimulation but

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.900 
to explode from so much stimulation but
also<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.640> know<00:00:39.290> just<00:00:40.290> from<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:41.070> exertion<00:00:41.820> of

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
also you know just from the exertion of

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.260 
also you know just from the exertion of
it<00:00:42.829> wanes<00:00:43.829> works<00:00:44.070> are<00:00:44.280> really<00:00:44.309> athletic<00:00:44.670> and

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
it wanes works are really athletic and

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.470 
it wanes works are really athletic and
they're<00:00:45.420> really<00:00:45.719> powerful<00:00:46.909> there's<00:00:47.909> a<00:00:47.969> lot<00:00:48.269> of

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
they're really powerful there's a lot of

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.250 
they're really powerful there's a lot of
over<00:00:49.350> stretching<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.339> and<00:00:51.079> pushing<00:00:52.079> and

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
over stretching and and pushing and

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.029 
over stretching and and pushing and
physicality<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.809> it<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.469> tiring<00:00:55.769> but

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
physicality and it is it is tiring but

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.619 
physicality and it is it is tiring but
it's<00:00:56.190> also<00:00:56.339> tiring<00:00:56.789> for<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.030> brain<00:00:57.269> as<00:00:57.449> well

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
it's also tiring for the brain as well

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.689 
it's also tiring for the brain as well
you<00:00:58.350> never<00:00:58.559> have<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.920> opportunity<00:00:59.429> to<00:00:59.519> feel

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
you never have the opportunity to feel

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.189 
you never have the opportunity to feel
complacent<00:01:00.359> or<00:01:00.449> bored<00:01:00.719> you're<00:01:00.989> always

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
complacent or bored you're always

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.160 
complacent or bored you're always
feeling<00:01:01.769> you<00:01:02.550> know<00:01:02.670> stimulated<00:01:03.569> by<00:01:03.870> it

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
feeling you know stimulated by it

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.300 
feeling you know stimulated by it
I<00:01:04.670> think<00:01:05.670> wanes<00:01:05.970> works<00:01:06.420> really<00:01:07.100> push<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
I think wanes works really push the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.880 
I think wanes works really push the
limits<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:08.820> dancers<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.510> give<00:01:09.890> especially

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
limits for dancers and give especially

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.410 
limits for dancers and give especially
in<00:01:11.250> classical<00:01:11.610> ballet<00:01:11.670> companies<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
in classical ballet companies the

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.180 
in classical ballet companies the
opportunity<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:13.020> use<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.770> technique<00:01:14.159> that

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
opportunity to use the technique that

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.240 
opportunity to use the technique that
you<00:01:14.580> have<00:01:15.360> been<00:01:15.630> developing<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.620> foundation

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
you have been developing as a foundation

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.770 
you have been developing as a foundation
and<00:01:17.340> really<00:01:17.549> pushed<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:17.940> in<00:01:18.150> interesting

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
and really pushed that in interesting

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.720 
and really pushed that in interesting
directions<00:01:18.810> it's<00:01:19.650> classical<00:01:20.250> classical

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:20.730 
directions it's classical classical

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.020 
directions it's classical classical
dancers<00:01:21.120> and<00:01:21.300> classical<00:01:21.660> bodies<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.800> are

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
dancers and classical bodies that are

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.750 
dancers and classical bodies that are
being<00:01:24.030> pushed<00:01:24.540> into<00:01:24.870> a<00:01:25.520> real<00:01:26.520> modern

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
being pushed into a real modern

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.920 
being pushed into a real modern
territory<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:28.340> actually<00:01:29.340> really<00:01:29.700> like<00:01:29.940> the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
it almost felt right even though he

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.490 
it almost felt right even though he
breaks<00:01:41.370> so<00:01:41.640> many<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.300> rules<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:43.170> ballet
