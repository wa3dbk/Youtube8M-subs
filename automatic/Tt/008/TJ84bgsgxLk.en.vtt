00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.090
 by minecraft friends today I bring you 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.429
 a solution those who had a 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.740
 problem can not install because 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.099
 1.8 corresponding to version in 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.099
 kraft 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.610
 but before we get into matter 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:22.940
 I want you to consider three factors 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.780
 that will have a major impact 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.930
 per se 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.570
 Your minecraft comfort already runs you what 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.810
 discover 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.910
 I want you to review these requirements 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.070
 before they proceed to the execution of 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.059
 that solution but what we are all going to 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.059
 go to your minecraft 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.380
 and here I'm going to open the nest 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.320
 and here 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.320
 where it says versions are going to look for that 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.480
 have the 1.8 selected the one that already 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.890
 I have the put had of the 1.8 of 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.390
 lesson given by him already with the others 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.190
 so many that I have installed 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.050
 in case all this was in 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.990
 white and my installation was in 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:12.640
 clean will have to select is the 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.640
 1.8 if I have it installed 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.399
 if 40 is already selected we do not have 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:23.009
 why because the euro forum was installed 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.330
 point 8 in a different version of my 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.520
 launcher 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.870
 is going to be the only thing that urges us we're going 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.159
 to give a number of errors of 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.740
 installation 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.979
 we're not going to confuse anymore let's write 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.149
 that with the new big one is not like that 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.990
 we check in our hitch has 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:44.009
 a 1.8 version in our profile if 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.689
 this is so then the second thing that 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.530
 we have to check if it is properly installed 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:52.810
 java 7 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:55.990
 I think there are hundreds of people here on YouTube 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:59.380
 of videos that explain what happens if not 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.110
 you were installed and if you have java 8 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.060
 running computer so check 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.640
 that you have java 7 installed in your 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.170
 computer and the third thing that you have to 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.500
 check and it's also extremely 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:15.160
 important is that your windows 7 is 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.110
 absolutely updated if there is a missing 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.930
 patch on your computer or many 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.180
 patches will not run hard because 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.640
 because it's a very sensitive file has 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.830
 many different dependencies 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.920
 places on your computer so if 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.319
 many patient computer are missing and there 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.080
 problems with a gentleman is not going to 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.550
 operate a wine craft comfort can 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.310
 that works for you without him because he is not going to 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.190
 work has been per day before having 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.110
 all this well as I wanted to have it but 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.830
 if you want to be one working with a 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.660
 folio with the fort you have to have your 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.220
 computer also update this is 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.980
 indispensable 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.100
 Now, if we meet these requirements 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.320
 then let's proceed to the 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.470
 installation of the supports simply 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.510

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.070
 will accept the minutes immediately 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.920
 to look like the one around you always 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.540
 appears or you read your away from help 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.700

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.000

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.720

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.490

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.329
 do you have 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:56.510
 done this comes back without starting the 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:59.689
 1.8 sport heart file starts it 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.180
 affects and it will install you without any 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:05.450

 as you see the solution is simple what 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.440
 you have to keep in mind if it's a lot 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.120
