00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.090
 hello beauties i wanted today 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.740
 like to keep warring video - 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:12.040
 actually no investor adoption for it 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.269
 I liked it and that's what I wanted 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.800
 my tips in the next bit 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.560
 more compact if I so 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.539
 short rips has got croes 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.770
 It's about what I do today 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.119
 actually with a foundation whose 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.529
 I do not like it or the 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.080
 It does not spread so well 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.539
 for example and many many people 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.570
 So use finishing spray times water 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.739
 or mac fixplatz or other things and 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.540
 I did it at some point tried 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.070
 and have thermal water easy on the 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.670
 sprayed the brush before I use it 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.440
 foundation and tada the 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.610
 foundation was much less puttrichs 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.830
 Sincerely better with the skin 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.839
 connected and it looked a lot better and 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.519
 I think that maybe even one 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:50.799
 a little better than that is only at the end 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.750
 as if I'm going to play-off and play 

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:54.519
 I I wanted to today delude times 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.080
 You can even water in the pharmacy 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.210
 buy this is a small size 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.379
 from avent to try it out there 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.239
 small sizes that I find very 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.190
 you can practically do it for example though 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.260
 also take water or facial water 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.140
 or just try a little 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.299
 around and my brush is from sofora that 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.280
 system in europe or industry and then 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.619
 you jump the whole easy as I said 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.829
 just before on the brush dani 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.630
 foundation on it and ki duk so me 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:21.009
 think it looks much better than 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.539
 before and with that you can find like me 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:24.700
 such a few foundations somehow 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.140
 they really do not save you 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.909
 More so much or the one you liked 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.850
 otherwise would never have stood aside or 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.649
 like that and I like that because you really 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.109
 not have to change much and you have it 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.429
 but won in bees difference and 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:38.079
 I think it leaves me that way too 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:40.060
 look more natural so it connects 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.109
 Get better with the skin and see it 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.200
 just better 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:46.600
 and I hope that was helpful for you 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.069
 if you have such a few tips yourself 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.819
 or so then she writes in the 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:50.859

 or send mini video response or something 

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:55.060

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.219

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.039

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:01.179
 as a better name knows that says 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.789
 In any case, that's what I want 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.560
 I am very happy about it and otherwise 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.590

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.590

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.800
 I have too few purchases of which I 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.410
 I do not know how to prepare it 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.849
