00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
going to do it's really getting second

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.220 
going to do it's really getting second
position<00:01:00.040> and<00:01:00.219> a<00:01:00.969> faster<00:01:01.360> way<00:01:01.480> to<00:01:01.510> do<00:01:01.660> that<00:01:01.809> is

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
position and a faster way to do that is

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.799 
position and a faster way to do that is
your<00:01:02.500> spleen<00:01:02.710> background<00:01:03.129> heels<00:01:03.629> spread<00:01:04.629> your

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
feet out wide to the side and then take

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.630 
feet out wide to the side and then take
a<00:01:09.460> step<00:01:09.880> out<00:01:10.810> a<00:01:11.260> little<00:01:12.159> bit<00:01:12.340> wider<00:01:12.490> than

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
a step out a little bit wider than

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.250 
a step out a little bit wider than
shoulder<00:01:12.670> width<00:01:13.119> just<00:01:13.810> doing<00:01:13.960> the<00:01:14.049> same

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
shoulder width just doing the same

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.530 
shoulder width just doing the same
position<00:01:14.740> and<00:01:14.920> what<00:01:15.520> we<00:01:15.640> want<00:01:15.820> to<00:01:15.880> do<00:01:16.000> is<00:01:16.150> focus

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
position and what we want to do is focus

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.700 
position and what we want to do is focus
on<00:01:16.630> twist<00:01:17.200> their<00:01:17.380> hips<00:01:17.650> out<00:01:19.409> turning<00:01:20.409> them<00:01:20.560> out

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
on twist their hips out turning them out

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
so that way we're putting the right

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.170 
so that way we're putting the right
pressure<00:01:23.470> on<00:01:23.710> knees<00:01:23.920> and<00:01:23.950> our<00:01:24.610> knees<00:01:24.880> are<00:01:25.030> you
