spending my last few few days on took me

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.310 
spending my last few few days on took me
a<00:00:30.850> while<00:00:31.029> what<00:00:31.270> I've<00:00:31.359> been<00:00:31.480> doing<00:00:31.630> but<00:00:31.990> yeah

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
a while what I've been doing but yeah

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.299 
a while what I've been doing but yeah
this<00:00:32.439> is<00:00:32.500> where<00:00:32.710> I've<00:00:32.800> been<00:00:32.949> doing<00:00:33.129> all<00:00:33.190> my

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:33.309 
this is where I've been doing all my

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:35.340 
this is where I've been doing all my
mining<00:00:33.699> or<00:00:34.030> at<00:00:34.149> least<00:00:34.329> my<00:00:34.690> own<00:00:34.840> preliminary

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
mining or at least my own preliminary

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.950 
mining or at least my own preliminary
mining<00:00:35.739> and<00:00:36.550> that<00:00:37.359> goes<00:00:37.510> pretty<00:00:37.780> much

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
mining and that goes pretty much

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.270 
mining and that goes pretty much
straight<00:00:38.199> down<00:00:38.409> I'm<00:00:38.710> probably<00:00:38.890> going<00:00:39.069> to<00:00:39.159> fall

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
straight down I'm probably going to fall

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.799 
straight down I'm probably going to fall
so<00:00:39.489> I'm<00:00:39.550> not<00:00:39.670> going<00:00:39.879> to<00:00:39.940> try<00:00:40.089> to<00:00:40.120> show<00:00:40.210> you<00:00:40.359> that

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
so I'm not going to try to show you that

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.349 
so I'm not going to try to show you that

00:00:43.349 --> 00:00:43.359 
goes straight to bed rock and this way a

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:46.049 
goes straight to bed rock and this way a
little<00:00:43.389> bridge<00:00:43.719> takes<00:00:44.409> me<00:00:44.589> to<00:00:44.739> my<00:00:44.819> house<00:00:45.819> that

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
little bridge takes me to my house that

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.520 
little bridge takes me to my house that
I<00:00:46.179> connected<00:00:47.019> to<00:00:47.199> through<00:00:47.409> there<00:00:47.850> dwarf<00:00:48.850> fail

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
I connected to through there dwarf fail

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.840

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:53.049 
you see that everything's moved moved

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:55.860 
you see that everything's moved moved
out<00:00:53.350> now<00:00:53.920> on<00:00:54.359> right<00:00:55.359> here<00:00:55.539> you're<00:00:55.690> going<00:00:55.780> to

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
out now on right here you're going to

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.719 
out now on right here you're going to
notice<00:00:56.019> that<00:00:56.379> this<00:00:56.829> was<00:00:57.100> completely<00:00:57.370> full<00:00:57.670> of

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:57.729 
notice that this was completely full of

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:59.789 
notice that this was completely full of
rock<00:00:57.999> at<00:00:58.179> one<00:00:58.299> point<00:00:58.479> and<00:00:59.260> that<00:00:59.319> has<00:00:59.499> all<00:00:59.679> been

00:00:59.789 --> 00:00:59.799 
rock at one point and that has all been

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:01.199 
rock at one point and that has all been
smelted<00:01:00.219> down<00:01:00.399> to<00:01:00.579> create<00:01:00.850> what<00:01:00.969> I've<00:01:01.089> been

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:01.209 
smelted down to create what I've been

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:04.020 
smelted down to create what I've been
creating<00:01:01.780> this<00:01:02.499> was<00:01:02.769> also<00:01:02.979> full<00:01:03.339> of<00:01:03.399> rock<00:01:03.699> and

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
creating this was also full of rock and

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.730 
creating this was also full of rock and
there's<00:01:04.659> a<00:01:04.720> little<00:01:04.930> dirt<00:01:05.080> in<00:01:05.199> there<00:01:05.320> too<00:01:05.470> but

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
there's a little dirt in there too but

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.110 
there's a little dirt in there too but
not<00:01:05.920> too<00:01:06.130> much<00:01:06.159> and<00:01:08.280> basically<00:01:09.280> I've<00:01:09.790> cleaned

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
not too much and basically I've cleaned

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.580 
not too much and basically I've cleaned
this<00:01:10.210> entire<00:01:10.510> house<00:01:10.750> out<00:01:10.990> and<00:01:11.140> I've<00:01:11.200> moved<00:01:11.440> on

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
this entire house out and I've moved on

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.700 
this entire house out and I've moved on
and<00:01:12.990> you're<00:01:13.990> probably<00:01:14.140> thinking<00:01:14.350> what<00:01:14.590> could

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
and you're probably thinking what could

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.410 
and you're probably thinking what could
he<00:01:14.800> possibly<00:01:14.830> do<00:01:15.460> that<00:01:15.670> would<00:01:15.730> take<00:01:16.060> that<00:01:16.210> much

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
he possibly do that would take that much

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.460 
he possibly do that would take that much
stuff<00:01:16.660> and<00:01:16.960> now<00:01:17.730> also<00:01:18.730> before<00:01:19.300> I<00:01:19.540> guys<00:01:19.750> I<00:01:20.170> am

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
get too far here you go to my Start

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.180 
get too far here you go to my Start
screen<00:01:22.930> here<00:01:23.230> and<00:01:23.410> go<00:01:23.470> to<00:01:23.530> options<00:01:23.980> i'm

screen here and go to options i'm
playing<00:01:24.460> on<00:01:24.610> short<00:01:24.910> for<00:01:25.060> my<00:01:25.150> render<00:01:25.390> distance

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
playing on short for my render distance

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.950 
playing on short for my render distance
with<00:01:25.900> the<00:01:26.430> what<00:01:27.430> is<00:01:27.520> it<00:01:27.550> the<00:01:27.670> fog<00:01:27.940> and<00:01:28.750> the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
with the what is it the fog and the

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.230 
with the what is it the fog and the
problem<00:01:29.290> is<00:01:29.410> like<00:01:29.620> my<00:01:30.370> own<00:01:30.400> perhaps<00:01:30.850> cannot

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
problem is like my own perhaps cannot

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.020 
problem is like my own perhaps cannot
record<00:01:31.570> pretty<00:01:32.320> much<00:01:32.530> if<00:01:32.800> i'm<00:01:33.130> any<00:01:33.490> higher

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
record pretty much if i'm any higher

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.930 
record pretty much if i'm any higher
than<00:01:34.180> that<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.560> if<00:01:35.770> you<00:01:35.890> guys<00:01:36.040> can<00:01:36.310> tell<00:01:36.490> me<00:01:36.670> how

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
than that so if you guys can tell me how

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.330 
than that so if you guys can tell me how
to<00:01:37.000> make<00:01:37.180> it<00:01:37.210> better<00:01:37.360> because<00:01:37.860> what<00:01:38.860> I<00:01:38.890> goat

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
to make it better because what I goat

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.420 
to make it better because what I goat
looks<00:01:40.240> so<00:01:40.510> much<00:01:40.690> better<00:01:40.930> in<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:41.890> way<00:01:42.010> that<00:01:42.280> it

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
looks so much better in the way that it

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.370 
looks so much better in the way that it
could<00:01:42.580> be<00:01:42.640> with<00:01:43.420> stars<00:01:43.840> and<00:01:43.930> everything<00:01:44.260> out

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
could be with stars and everything out

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.470 
could be with stars and everything out
but<00:01:44.620> on<00:01:44.830> over<00:01:45.220> here<00:01:45.400> made<00:01:46.030> a<00:01:46.060> little<00:01:46.210> wiener

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
but on over here made a little wiener

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.420 
but on over here made a little wiener
because<00:01:46.990> I'm<00:01:47.170> completely<00:01:47.830> immature<00:01:48.100> and

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
because I'm completely immature and

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.280 
because I'm completely immature and
obviously<00:01:48.700> can't<00:01:48.909> do<00:01:49.000> anything<00:01:49.150> better<00:01:49.390> you

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290
