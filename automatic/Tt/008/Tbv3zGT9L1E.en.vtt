00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.140
 which wave I hope you are very well 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.940
 welcome to this your samuel channel 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.680
 boom like every Saturday I'll try that 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.989
 Today's video is as short as possible 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.030
 and the lightest but at the same time understandable 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.160
 I had time that did not touch this guy 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.199
 of videos watching them so I hope this 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.300
 idea that I bring to you today you love today 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:48.949
 we are going to deal with the issue of recycling and 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.260
 I had time thinking what I'm going to do 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.550
 with these acetate disks so I think 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.100
 that this is a very good opportunity 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.170
 to recycle this product and 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.239
 transform it into something new we are going to 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.930
 make a wall clock using a 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.210
 single disk lp this is 33 revolutions 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.220
 and the truth is that it is perfect for 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.200
 this idea and well let's reuse 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.360
 other things that we will see later 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.280
 in truth this idea is very very very 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.440
 easy to do and I think it's going to 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.350
 take only about five minutes and 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.750
 well then we started these are the 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.780
 materials that we're going to need a 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.640
 You can buy lp or acetate disk 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.830
 for a few prices in some bazaar 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.380
 or maybe your parents or grandparents 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.000
 have downloadable sheets that can 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.270
 find in the video description 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.759
 white concealer or white paint 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.969
 This can be optional glue on 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.100
 pencil silicon gun scissors and a 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:44.020
 clock that you no longer occupy which you can 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.700
 remove the mechanism you can also 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.600
 buy the watch mechanism in 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.600
 any stationery 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.990
 we started by disassembling the clock to 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.970
 take away the mechanism 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.130
 so that the mechanism can come out 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.899
 we have to push the second hand of a 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.479
 side to side until it comes out the 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.610
 screw you can now remove the other 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.790
 hands and the mechanism will come out with 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.790
 ease 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.650
 we can paint the hands or leave them 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.290
 of the original color in the central part 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.360
 I'm going to paste my own cover 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.069
 as always in the description I leave you 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.670
 all downloadable so they can 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.670
 print it out 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.780
 you have to make a small hole 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.490
 right in the center of the drawing and 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.490
 then cut out the numbers 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:19.210
 let's first paste the numbers 12 3 6 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.210
 and 9 in this way we are going to guide 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.590
 we stick the mechanism with silicone 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:39.260
 and we put the hands back in their 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.239
 place is very important that at the beginning 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.239
 everyone is pointing to the number 12 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.359
 i 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.050
 we're almost done with what we're going to do 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.350
 now it 's moving the hands with the 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.190
 mechanism until it points to the one 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:08.290
 subsequently in the direction of 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.290
 more little hand we paste the number 1 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.640
 ah 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:20.739
 we go through the hands again until 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:22.750
 point to both and in that direction 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.060
 we hit number 2 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.330
 we do this consecutively for each 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.330
 hour 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:44.090
 and ready you have a wall clock 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:44.090
 great and super retro 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.320
 and 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:02.180
 very important do not forget to add something 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:05.000
 with what can be hung I put a 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.310
 clip make sure it's very good 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.480
 subject otherwise your watch can be 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.480
 fall and it can spoil 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.900
 Y 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:36.370
 and this was all for today and I hope that 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:38.470
 I loved this idea as much as I did 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.210
 I already had time wanting to resume this 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.250
 kind of retro videos that good 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:45.160
 it's practically like a series that I'm going 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.229
 to go up little by little once a month 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.270
 12 depends on the ideas that bring the 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:51.039
 I still have many retro ideas 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.349
 so if you like this wave, comment 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:54.910
 down here and well I say goodbye 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:57.190
 like if you want to keep doing 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:59.169
 videos on how to reuse this type 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.479
 of disks subscribe to be at 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:03.220
 So much of each of my videos shares 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:04.810
 this idea with your friends remember that the 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.210
 description of the video are the 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.370
 downloadable so that nothing else prints 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.590
 the numbers and the cover that goes on the 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:16.289
 take good care of me, I'm samuel gum 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:16.289
 and see you in the next delivery bye 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.200
 plus
