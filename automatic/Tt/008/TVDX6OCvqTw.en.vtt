00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
packed with barricade I believe but I

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.750 
packed with barricade I believe but I
checked<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.410> pictures<00:03:16.010> that<00:03:16.220> have<00:03:16.310> popped<00:03:16.520> up

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
checked the pictures that have popped up

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.760 
checked the pictures that have popped up
and<00:03:17.030> Blake<00:03:17.480> his<00:03:17.750> grills<00:03:18.170> a<00:03:18.410> little<00:03:18.650> bit

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
and Blake his grills a little bit

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.380 
and Blake his grills a little bit
different<00:03:19.190> and<00:03:19.340> I<00:03:19.430> don't<00:03:19.489> think<00:03:19.790> he<00:03:19.880> has<00:03:19.970> a<00:03:20.000> saw

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
different and I don't think he has a saw

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.920 
different and I don't think he has a saw
and<00:03:20.959> I<00:03:21.650> believe<00:03:21.980> this<00:03:22.520> arm<00:03:22.880> is<00:03:23.150> different<00:03:23.630> but

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
and I believe this arm is different but

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.199 
and I believe this arm is different but
uh<00:03:23.989> it's<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.739> same<00:03:25.040> general<00:03:25.310> pose<00:03:25.760> so<00:03:26.060> it's

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
uh it's the same general pose so it's

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.780 
uh it's the same general pose so it's
kind<00:03:26.480> of<00:03:26.540> just<00:03:26.720> a<00:03:26.900> remould<00:03:29.290> here's<00:03:30.290> Sam<00:03:30.770> in<00:03:31.520> his

bigger figures that were all new but
brawl<00:06:04.020> and<00:06:04.230> Megatron<00:06:04.620> might<00:06:05.010> have<00:06:05.220> new<00:06:05.460> paint

detailing<00:06:06.360> because<00:06:06.540> I<00:06:06.630> don't<00:06:06.900> know<00:06:07.110> about<00:06:07.490> so

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
detailing because I don't know about so

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.120 
detailing because I don't know about so
if<00:06:08.640> they<00:06:08.820> do<00:06:08.880> they<00:06:09.330> the<00:06:10.170> kind<00:06:10.500> of<00:06:10.650> new

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 
if they do they the kind of new

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.830 
if they do they the kind of new
I<00:06:12.410> recommend<00:06:13.410> the<00:06:14.180> Battle<00:06:15.180> of<00:06:15.240> the<00:06:15.360> fall<00:06:15.600> and<00:06:15.780> I

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
I recommend the Battle of the fall and I

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.240 
I recommend the Battle of the fall and I
believe<00:06:16.110> what's<00:06:16.260> called<00:06:16.470> the<00:06:16.650> pack<00:06:17.220> I

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
believe what's called the pack I

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.010 
believe what's called the pack I
reviewed<00:06:17.610> earlier<00:06:17.730> a<00:06:18.060> lot<00:06:18.330> more<00:06:18.660> than<00:06:18.840> this

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 
reviewed earlier a lot more than this

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.350 
reviewed earlier a lot more than this
even<00:06:19.890> though<00:06:19.980> you<00:06:20.040> get<00:06:20.190> less<00:06:20.460> figures<00:06:21.000> I

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
even though you get less figures I

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.360 
even though you get less figures I
believe<00:06:21.660> the<00:06:21.960> figures<00:06:22.680> in<00:06:22.800> that<00:06:22.920> pack<00:06:23.130> are<00:06:23.310> a

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
believe the figures in that pack are a

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.110 
believe the figures in that pack are a
lot<00:06:23.550> more<00:06:23.580> worse<00:06:23.940> than<00:06:24.300> this<00:06:24.420> one<00:06:26.120> that's

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
lot more worse than this one that's

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.270 
lot more worse than this one that's
about<00:06:27.330> it<00:06:27.510> for<00:06:27.690> now<00:06:27.750> so<00:06:28.260> I'm<00:06:28.530> still<00:06:28.830> waiting<00:06:28.950> on

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 
about it for now so I'm still waiting on

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.630 
about it for now so I'm still waiting on
the<00:06:29.810> commoner<00:06:30.810> to<00:06:30.930> keep<00:06:31.110> in<00:06:31.230> merchandise<00:06:31.680> as

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:32.640 
the commoner to keep in merchandise as

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.400 
the commoner to keep in merchandise as

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:34.410 
soon as I get those I'll probably be

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.940 
soon as I get those I'll probably be
reviewing<00:06:35.100> one<00:06:35.610> a<00:06:35.640> day<00:06:35.880> so<00:06:36.720> until<00:06:37.110> then<00:06:37.440> see
