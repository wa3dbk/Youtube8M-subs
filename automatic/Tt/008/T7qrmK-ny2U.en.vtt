now it's time for each morning this is
UV<00:02:57.290> light<00:02:57.470> source<00:02:57.770> and<00:02:57.980> this<00:02:58.760> is<00:02:59.000> basket

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
UV light source and this is basket

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.420 
UV light source and this is basket
handyman<00:03:00.800> and<00:03:01.130> rang<00:03:01.940> here<00:03:02.150> i<00:03:02.300> have<00:03:02.569> the<00:03:02.599> wafer

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
handyman and rang here i have the wafer

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.530 
handyman and rang here i have the wafer
basically<00:03:04.430> what<00:03:04.580> i'm<00:03:04.700> going<00:03:04.880> to<00:03:04.970> do<00:03:05.120> is<00:03:05.150> I'm

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
basically what i'm going to do is I'm

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.229 
basically what i'm going to do is I'm
going<00:03:05.720> to<00:03:05.810> put<00:03:06.140> this<00:03:06.319> mess<00:03:06.650> over<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:07.700> top<00:03:07.940> of

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
going to put this mess over the top of

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.809 
going to put this mess over the top of
the<00:03:08.540> wafer<00:03:08.750> and<00:03:09.170> then<00:03:09.530> he<00:03:09.620> first<00:03:09.980> said<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:10.670> the

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
the wafer and then he first said to the

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:17.950 
the wafer and then he first said to the
UV<00:03:11.120> light

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:17.960 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.930 

I'm<00:03:18.530> will<00:03:18.740> be<00:03:18.830> positive<00:03:19.190> profits<00:03:19.490> in<00:03:19.640> second

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
I'm will be positive profits in second

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.160 
I'm will be positive profits in second
let's<00:03:20.240> go

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.220 

they<00:03:24.650> save

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
they save

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.339 
they save
exposed<00:03:26.890> to<00:03:27.040> wait<00:03:27.220> for<00:03:27.780> what<00:03:28.780> I'm<00:03:28.900> going<00:03:29.140> to<00:03:29.200> do

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
exposed to wait for what I'm going to do

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.520 
exposed to wait for what I'm going to do
now<00:03:29.590> is<00:03:29.890> going<00:03:30.459> to<00:03:30.580> develop<00:03:30.909> the<00:03:31.569> photo<00:03:32.230> is

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
now is going to develop the photo is

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.699 
now is going to develop the photo is
what<00:03:32.830> I<00:03:32.860> have<00:03:33.159> in<00:03:33.370> here<00:03:33.400> is<00:03:33.790> I<00:03:34.360> have<00:03:34.560> exposed<00:03:35.560> to

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
what I have in here is I have exposed to

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.940 
what I have in here is I have exposed to
wait<00:03:35.890> for<00:03:36.129> with<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.459> photoresist<00:03:37.120> and<00:03:37.620> I<00:03:38.620> have

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
wait for with the photoresist and I have

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:49.800 
wait for with the photoresist and I have
the<00:03:39.159> developer

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.830 

to<00:03:50.140> develop<00:03:50.680> the<00:03:50.800> wafer<00:03:51.160> and<00:03:51.400> this<00:03:52.180> is<00:03:52.420> a<00:03:52.450> mess

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
to develop the wafer and this is a mess

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.740 
to develop the wafer and this is a mess
those<00:03:53.650> two<00:03:53.890> are<00:03:53.920> the<00:03:54.160> same<00:03:54.430> right<00:03:54.849> here

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
those two are the same right here

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
those two are the same right here
this<00:03:57.350> is<00:03:57.530> the<00:03:57.740> end<00:03:57.770> of<00:03:58.190> photolithography
