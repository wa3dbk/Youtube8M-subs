head of the deltoid the shoulder muscle
if<00:00:34.600> you're<00:00:34.660> weaker<00:00:35.199> in<00:00:35.350> this<00:00:35.470> area<00:00:35.800> maybe

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
if you're weaker in this area maybe

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.580 
if you're weaker in this area maybe
start<00:00:36.430> with<00:00:36.640> this<00:00:36.820> exercise<00:00:37.270> first<00:00:37.720> the<00:00:38.470> outer

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
start with this exercise first the outer

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.070 
start with this exercise first the outer
delts<00:00:39.070> are<00:00:39.220> worked<00:00:39.550> with<00:00:39.850> outer<00:00:40.330> side<00:00:40.780> raises

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
delts are worked with outer side raises

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.470 
delts are worked with outer side raises
this<00:00:41.890> will<00:00:42.040> give<00:00:42.220> you<00:00:42.309> width<00:00:42.580> and<00:00:42.850> I'll<00:00:43.300> put

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
this will give you width and I'll put

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.540 
this will give you width and I'll put
caps<00:00:43.780> onto<00:00:44.170> your<00:00:44.470> shoulders<00:00:44.890> that<00:00:45.280> will<00:00:45.400> give

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
caps onto your shoulders that will give

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.970 
caps onto your shoulders that will give
you<00:00:45.640> the<00:00:45.730> illusion<00:00:46.030> of<00:00:46.390> a<00:00:46.570> smaller<00:00:46.720> waist<00:00:47.170> and

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
you the illusion of a smaller waist and

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.130 
you the illusion of a smaller waist and
finally<00:00:48.579> you've<00:00:48.969> got<00:00:49.000> the<00:00:49.239> rear<00:00:49.480> head<00:00:49.780> of<00:00:49.960> the

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
finally you've got the rear head of the

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.590 
finally you've got the rear head of the
deltoid<00:00:50.500> muscle<00:00:50.890> this<00:00:51.460> is<00:00:51.670> a<00:00:51.700> hard<00:00:52.059> muscle<00:00:52.480> to

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
deltoid muscle this is a hard muscle to

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.209 
deltoid muscle this is a hard muscle to
really<00:00:52.930> isolate<00:00:53.050> so<00:00:53.500> make<00:00:53.710> sure<00:00:53.739> you<00:00:54.040> go<00:00:54.190> a

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219 
really isolate so make sure you go a

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.430 
really isolate so make sure you go a
little<00:00:54.489> bit<00:00:54.790> lighter<00:00:54.940> keep<00:00:55.480> strict<00:00:55.870> form<00:00:56.170> and

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
little bit lighter keep strict form and

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.680 
little bit lighter keep strict form and
get<00:00:56.890> that<00:00:57.040> mind-muscle<00:00:57.550> connection<00:00:57.690> now

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
get that mind-muscle connection now

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.959 
get that mind-muscle connection now
these<00:00:58.840> are<00:00:59.020> isolation<00:00:59.620> exercises<00:01:00.129> so

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
these are isolation exercises so

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:02.819 
these are isolation exercises so
isolation<00:01:01.660> means<00:01:01.899> that<00:01:02.200> it's<00:01:02.320> just<00:01:02.590> working

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
isolation means that it's just working

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.710 
isolation means that it's just working
one<00:01:03.280> particular<00:01:03.879> muscle<00:01:04.239> that<00:01:04.360> you're<00:01:04.479> trying

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
one particular muscle that you're trying

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.020 
one particular muscle that you're trying
to<00:01:04.750> focus<00:01:04.989> on<00:01:05.320> a<00:01:05.560> compound<00:01:06.190> movement<00:01:06.369> is<00:01:06.759> going

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
to focus on a compound movement is going

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.760 
to focus on a compound movement is going
to<00:01:07.090> bring<00:01:07.270> in<00:01:07.360> several<00:01:07.720> of<00:01:07.990> those<00:01:08.140> muscles<00:01:08.380> so

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
to bring in several of those muscles so

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.980 
to bring in several of those muscles so
compound<00:01:09.610> movements<00:01:10.149> of<00:01:10.240> the<00:01:10.330> shoulder<00:01:10.750> is

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
compound movements of the shoulder is

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.749 
compound movements of the shoulder is
going<00:01:11.050> to<00:01:11.289> be<00:01:11.350> like<00:01:11.500> the<00:01:11.619> shoulder<00:01:12.039> press<00:01:12.280> so

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
going to be like the shoulder press so

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:14.730 
going to be like the shoulder press so
if<00:01:12.850> you're<00:01:13.000> doing<00:01:13.149> a<00:01:13.240> straight<00:01:13.539> up<00:01:13.780> press<00:01:14.080> this

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:14.740 
if you're doing a straight up press this

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.469 
if you're doing a straight up press this
is<00:01:14.890> going<00:01:15.100> to<00:01:15.220> incorporate<00:01:15.550> predominantly

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
is going to incorporate predominantly

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:18.719 
is going to incorporate predominantly
the<00:01:16.630> front<00:01:16.930> and<00:01:17.170> outer<00:01:17.410> head<00:01:17.920> of<00:01:18.160> the<00:01:18.369> deltoid

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
the front and outer head of the deltoid

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.550 
the front and outer head of the deltoid
muscle<00:01:19.180> so<00:01:19.750> it's<00:01:19.869> going<00:01:19.960> to<00:01:20.049> work<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.350> front

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
muscle so it's going to work the front

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.140 
muscle so it's going to work the front
and<00:01:20.890> it's<00:01:21.070> going<00:01:21.220> to<00:01:21.280> work<00:01:21.430> the<00:01:21.610> side<00:01:21.850> of<00:01:22.060> the

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
and it's going to work the side of the

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.120 
and it's going to work the side of the
shoulder<00:01:22.479> as<00:01:22.570> well<00:01:22.750> so<00:01:23.260> now<00:01:23.409> we're<00:01:23.590> moving<00:01:23.740> on

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
shoulder as well so now we're moving on

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.890 
shoulder as well so now we're moving on
to<00:01:24.189> the<00:01:24.400> triceps<00:01:24.909> which<00:01:25.150> is<00:01:25.180> the<00:01:25.330> back<00:01:25.450> your

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
to the triceps which is the back your

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.899 
to the triceps which is the back your
arms<00:01:26.229> you've<00:01:26.740> got<00:01:26.770> three<00:01:27.250> muscles<00:01:27.640> there

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
arms you've got three muscles there

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.740 
arms you've got three muscles there
hence<00:01:28.240> try<00:01:28.869> triceps<00:01:29.740> pushing<00:01:30.640> down<00:01:30.880> this<00:01:31.600> is

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
hence try triceps pushing down this is

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.600 
hence try triceps pushing down this is
going<00:01:31.930> to<00:01:31.990> work<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.560> outer<00:01:32.830> head<00:01:33.220> of<00:01:33.460> the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
going to work the outer head of the

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.899 
going to work the outer head of the
tricep<00:01:34.060> muscle<00:01:34.409> if<00:01:35.409> you're<00:01:36.159> pushing<00:01:36.759> like

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
tricep muscle if you're pushing like

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:38.249 
tricep muscle if you're pushing like
you're<00:01:37.119> doing<00:01:37.270> a<00:01:37.330> close<00:01:37.540> grip<00:01:37.810> bench<00:01:37.869> press

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
you're doing a close grip bench press

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.710 
you're doing a close grip bench press
for<00:01:39.040> instance<00:01:39.130> this<00:01:39.970> is<00:01:40.090> going<00:01:40.270> to<00:01:40.360> work<00:01:40.390> the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
for instance this is going to work the

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.810 
for instance this is going to work the
middle<00:01:40.990> head<00:01:41.290> so<00:01:41.799> extending<00:01:42.430> your<00:01:42.520> arms

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
middle head so extending your arms

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.850 
middle head so extending your arms
overhead<00:01:43.150> while<00:01:43.479> using<00:01:43.810> a<00:01:43.869> rope<00:01:44.110> or<00:01:44.380> dumbbell

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
overhead while using a rope or dumbbell

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.310 
overhead while using a rope or dumbbell
will<00:01:45.340> really<00:01:45.700> work<00:01:45.909> the<00:01:46.150> rear<00:01:46.360> head<00:01:46.659> to<00:01:47.110> give

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
will really work the rear head to give

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.249 
will really work the rear head to give
you<00:01:47.409> that<00:01:47.650> out<00:01:47.920> of<00:01:48.189> fullness<00:01:48.810> 70%<00:01:49.810> of<00:01:49.930> your<00:01:50.049> arm

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
you that out of fullness 70% of your arm

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.230 
you that out of fullness 70% of your arm
is<00:01:50.409> made<00:01:50.619> up<00:01:50.860> from<00:01:51.100> the<00:01:51.220> tricep<00:01:51.759> so<00:01:52.119> it's

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
is made up from the tricep so it's

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.609 
is made up from the tricep so it's
something<00:01:52.509> that<00:01:52.720> you<00:01:52.840> should<00:01:53.020> really<00:01:53.049> focus

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
something that you should really focus

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.440 
something that you should really focus
on<00:01:53.890> a<00:01:54.100> lot<00:01:54.340> of<00:01:54.369> people<00:01:54.729> train<00:01:55.030> their<00:01:55.210> bigger

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
on a lot of people train their bigger

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.810 
on a lot of people train their bigger
muscles<00:01:55.960> they<00:01:56.590> hit<00:01:56.829> their<00:01:57.009> biceps<00:01:57.520> when<00:01:57.729> in

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
muscles they hit their biceps when in

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.030 
muscles they hit their biceps when in
fact<00:01:58.119> if<00:01:58.299> it's<00:01:58.450> only<00:01:58.780> thirty<00:01:59.170> percent<00:01:59.350> of<00:01:59.829> the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
fact if it's only thirty percent of the

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.480 
fact if it's only thirty percent of the
overall<00:02:00.340> arm<00:02:00.700> going<00:02:01.689> onto<00:02:01.840> biceps<00:02:02.470> we<00:02:03.280> have

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
overall arm going onto biceps we have

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.080 
overall arm going onto biceps we have
two<00:02:03.880> muscle<00:02:04.540> groups<00:02:04.780> here<00:02:05.079> hence<00:02:05.950> by<00:02:06.430> meaning

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
two muscle groups here hence by meaning

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:08.850 
two muscle groups here hence by meaning
to<00:02:07.299> to<00:02:07.810> hit<00:02:07.990> their<00:02:08.170> inner<00:02:08.320> head<00:02:08.560> of<00:02:08.739> your

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
to to hit their inner head of your

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.490 
to to hit their inner head of your
biceps<00:02:09.310> you<00:02:09.459> should<00:02:09.670> use<00:02:09.910> a<00:02:10.090> wide<00:02:10.360> grip<00:02:10.780> to<00:02:11.320> hit

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
biceps you should use a wide grip to hit

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.890 
biceps you should use a wide grip to hit
that<00:02:11.680> outer<00:02:11.920> head<00:02:12.280> of<00:02:12.640> your<00:02:12.850> biceps<00:02:13.299> then<00:02:13.570> use

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
that outer head of your biceps then use

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.780 
that outer head of your biceps then use
something<00:02:14.470> like<00:02:14.500> a<00:02:14.620> hammer<00:02:14.890> grip<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.400> if<00:02:15.670> you

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
something like a hammer grip and if you

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.310 
something like a hammer grip and if you
want<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.030> hit<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.329> overall<00:02:16.690> mass<00:02:16.959> of<00:02:17.200> the

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
want to hit the overall mass of the

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.190 
want to hit the overall mass of the
bicep<00:02:17.709> use<00:02:18.220> a<00:02:18.250> neutral<00:02:18.549> grip<00:02:19.060> now<00:02:19.660> on<00:02:19.840> two<00:02:19.989> back

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
bicep use a neutral grip now on two back

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.920 
bicep use a neutral grip now on two back
muscles<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.950> back<00:02:21.459> is<00:02:21.640> very<00:02:21.910> complex<00:02:22.600> it's

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
muscles the back is very complex it's

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.630 
muscles the back is very complex it's
got<00:02:23.110> different<00:02:23.530> muscle<00:02:23.799> fibers<00:02:24.220> running<00:02:24.520> in

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
got different muscle fibers running in

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.130 
got different muscle fibers running in
different<00:02:25.000> direction<00:02:25.300> so<00:02:25.599> you<00:02:25.690> have<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:25.930> work

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
different direction so you have to work

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.530 
different direction so you have to work
it<00:02:26.319> from<00:02:26.410> different<00:02:26.680> angles

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
it from different angles

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.509 
it from different angles
your<00:02:27.750> traps<00:02:28.049> are<00:02:28.290> actually<00:02:28.590> part<00:02:28.890> of<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.370> back

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
your traps are actually part of the back

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.280 
your traps are actually part of the back
muscle<00:02:29.939> so<00:02:30.209> when<00:02:30.390> you're<00:02:30.540> working<00:02:30.930> your<00:02:31.049> trap

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
muscle so when you're working your trap

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.449 
muscle so when you're working your trap
muscles<00:02:31.709> you're<00:02:31.890> going<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.099> be<00:02:32.159> doing<00:02:32.370> a

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
muscles you're going to be doing a

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.729 
muscles you're going to be doing a
shrugging<00:02:32.819> movement<00:02:33.420> if<00:02:33.629> you're<00:02:34.439> going<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.650> be

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
shrugging movement if you're going to be

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.800 
shrugging movement if you're going to be
working<00:02:34.950> your<00:02:35.219> lap<00:02:35.400> muscles<00:02:35.909> that's<00:02:36.480> going<00:02:36.719> to

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
working your lap muscles that's going to

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.690 
working your lap muscles that's going to
be<00:02:36.930> worked<00:02:37.140> predominantly<00:02:37.349> on<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.069> pulldown

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
be worked predominantly on a pulldown

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.309 
be worked predominantly on a pulldown
movement<00:02:39.180> that's<00:02:39.359> really<00:02:39.659> going<00:02:39.810> to<00:02:39.870> hit<00:02:40.109> your

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
movement that's really going to hit your

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.809 
movement that's really going to hit your
lats<00:02:40.500> but<00:02:40.709> thickness<00:02:41.159> and<00:02:41.340> give<00:02:41.579> you<00:02:41.670> that

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
lats but thickness and give you that

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.880 
lats but thickness and give you that
nice<00:02:42.090> V<00:02:42.450> tapering<00:02:42.870> if<00:02:43.140> you're<00:02:43.290> going<00:02:43.439> to<00:02:43.620> work

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
nice V tapering if you're going to work

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.160 
nice V tapering if you're going to work
for<00:02:44.370> thickness<00:02:44.640> of<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.150> back<00:02:45.359> predominately

for thickness of the back predominately

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.660 
for thickness of the back predominately
then<00:02:46.379> you'll<00:02:46.530> want<00:02:46.739> to<00:02:46.769> do<00:02:46.920> a<00:02:46.950> lot<00:02:47.189> of<00:02:47.220> rolling

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
then you'll want to do a lot of rolling

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.509 
then you'll want to do a lot of rolling
movements<00:02:48.239> so<00:02:48.780> you're<00:02:48.959> bent<00:02:49.170> over<00:02:49.349> rows<00:02:49.650> cable

pulley rows and single dumbbell rows

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.649 
pulley rows and single dumbbell rows
that's<00:02:53.519> what's<00:02:53.819> really<00:02:54.060> going<00:02:54.359> to<00:02:54.420> give<00:02:54.569> you

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659 
that's what's really going to give you

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.869 
that's what's really going to give you
the<00:02:54.780> beef<00:02:55.019> and<00:02:55.230> thickness<00:02:55.739> on<00:02:55.920> your<00:02:56.040> back<00:02:56.250> now

I<00:04:00.629> don't<00:04:00.840> bother<00:04:01.049> really<00:04:01.409> hitting<00:04:01.769> obliques

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
I don't bother really hitting obliques

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.789 
I don't bother really hitting obliques
directly<00:04:03.150> because<00:04:03.329> I<00:04:03.540> find<00:04:03.870> they<00:04:04.349> get<00:04:04.530> works

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
directly because I find they get works

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.369 
directly because I find they get works
from<00:04:05.099> several<00:04:05.549> other<00:04:05.669> exercises<00:04:06.329> so<00:04:07.109> I<00:04:07.139> like

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
from several other exercises so I like

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.439 
from several other exercises so I like
to<00:04:07.500> Train<00:04:07.739> ABS<00:04:07.979> once<00:04:08.310> a<00:04:08.459> week<00:04:08.639> but<00:04:08.790> I<00:04:08.849> go<00:04:09.060> really

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:09.449 
to Train ABS once a week but I go really

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.719 
to Train ABS once a week but I go really
hard<00:04:09.629> sometimes<00:04:10.109> heavy<00:04:10.680> on<00:04:10.889> those<00:04:11.040> days<00:04:11.280> next

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:11.729 
hard sometimes heavy on those days next

going<00:04:16.470> to<00:04:16.530> be<00:04:16.620> really<00:04:16.979> isolated<00:04:17.729> when<00:04:18.180> you

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
going to be really isolated when you

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.659 
going to be really isolated when you
perform<00:04:18.750> in<00:04:18.900> a<00:04:19.049> leg<00:04:19.289> extending<00:04:19.979> movement<00:04:20.430> like

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
perform in a leg extending movement like

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.000 
perform in a leg extending movement like
leg<00:04:20.909> extensions<00:04:21.570> on<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:22.289> machine<00:04:22.620> that's

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
leg extensions on the machine that's

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.520 
leg extensions on the machine that's
going<00:04:23.280> to<00:04:23.370> hit<00:04:23.580> the<00:04:23.639> for<00:04:24.210> quadricep<00:04:25.110> muscles

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
going to hit the for quadricep muscles

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.469 
going to hit the for quadricep muscles
and<00:04:25.830> that's<00:04:26.009> it<00:04:26.220> it's<00:04:26.820> not<00:04:26.970> going<00:04:27.150> to<00:04:27.210> bring<00:04:27.360> in

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
and that's it it's not going to bring in

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.390 
and that's it it's not going to bring in
any<00:04:27.750> other<00:04:27.990> muscle<00:04:28.199> group<00:04:28.560> so<00:04:28.919> that's<00:04:29.070> a<00:04:29.159> great

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
any other muscle group so that's a great

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.909 
any other muscle group so that's a great
exercise<00:04:29.729> to<00:04:30.120> start<00:04:30.509> on<00:04:30.750> it<00:04:31.020> really<00:04:31.470> warms<00:04:31.770> up

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
exercise to start on it really warms up

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.890 
exercise to start on it really warms up
your<00:04:32.099> knees<00:04:32.280> and<00:04:32.580> pre<00:04:33.180> fatigues<00:04:33.659> your

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
your knees and pre fatigues your

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.930 
your knees and pre fatigues your
quadriceps<00:04:34.560> before<00:04:35.250> going<00:04:35.460> into<00:04:35.669> some

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
quadriceps before going into some

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.060 
quadriceps before going into some
compound<00:04:36.450> movements<00:04:36.900> so<00:04:37.229> a<00:04:37.500> compound

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
compound movements so a compound

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.040 
compound movements so a compound
movement<00:04:38.219> for<00:04:38.610> your<00:04:38.729> legs<00:04:38.969> is<00:04:39.300> going<00:04:39.900> to<00:04:39.960> be

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
movement for your legs is going to be

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.360 
movement for your legs is going to be
predominately<00:04:40.529> for<00:04:40.770> your<00:04:40.919> quad

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
predominately for your quad

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.850 
predominately for your quad
this<00:04:41.729> would<00:04:41.910> include<00:04:42.210> squats<00:04:42.870> and<00:04:43.169> leg

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
this would include squats and leg

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.830 
this would include squats and leg
presses<00:04:44.160> the<00:04:44.790> further<00:04:45.060> you<00:04:45.240> have<00:04:45.270> your<00:04:45.600> legs

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
presses the further you have your legs

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.170 
presses the further you have your legs
up<00:04:46.080> on<00:04:46.199> a<00:04:46.320> leg<00:04:46.500> press<00:04:46.740> platform<00:04:47.430> is<00:04:47.880> going<00:04:48.120> to

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
up on a leg press platform is going to

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.240 
up on a leg press platform is going to
hit<00:04:48.330> more<00:04:48.540> hamstrings<00:04:49.139> so<00:04:49.530> if<00:04:49.680> you<00:04:49.830> have<00:04:50.010> it<00:04:50.160> in

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
hit more hamstrings so if you have it in

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.070 
hit more hamstrings so if you have it in
a<00:04:50.340> neutral<00:04:50.760> position<00:04:50.910> it's<00:04:51.540> going<00:04:51.840> to<00:04:51.930> really

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
a neutral position it's going to really

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.170 
a neutral position it's going to really
hit<00:04:52.350> more<00:04:52.680> of<00:04:52.919> your<00:04:53.190> quadricep<00:04:53.790> muscles

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
hit more of your quadricep muscles

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.060 
hit more of your quadricep muscles
you've<00:04:54.690> also<00:04:54.840> got<00:04:55.110> lunges<00:04:55.530> but<00:04:55.680> that<00:04:55.830> works

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
you've also got lunges but that works

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.040 
you've also got lunges but that works
everything<00:04:56.639> it<00:04:56.790> works<00:04:57.000> your<00:04:57.180> glutes<00:04:57.510> and<00:04:57.840> it

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
everything it works your glutes and it

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.600 
everything it works your glutes and it
works<00:04:58.229> your<00:04:58.410> hamstrings<00:04:58.889> as<00:04:59.130> well<00:04:59.160> as<00:04:59.490> your

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
works your hamstrings as well as your

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.520 
works your hamstrings as well as your
quads<00:05:00.000> at<00:05:00.210> the<00:05:00.270> same<00:05:00.479> time<00:05:00.720> if<00:05:00.960> you<00:05:01.260> want<00:05:01.440> to

isolate your hamstrings you're going to

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.450 
isolate your hamstrings you're going to
be<00:05:03.479> leg<00:05:03.750> curling<00:05:04.320> so<00:05:04.680> this<00:05:04.830> is<00:05:04.949> a<00:05:04.979> really<00:05:05.310> good

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
be leg curling so this is a really good

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.550 
be leg curling so this is a really good
movement<00:05:05.729> to<00:05:06.479> do<00:05:06.660> if<00:05:06.780> you<00:05:06.900> want<00:05:07.080> to<00:05:07.110> isolate

bulk of the calf muscle that's a little
higher<00:05:31.740> up<00:05:31.919> towards<00:05:32.070> your<00:05:32.340> knee<00:05:32.520> then<00:05:33.270> you'll

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
higher up towards your knee then you'll

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.990 
higher up towards your knee then you'll
work<00:05:33.720> that<00:05:33.990> with<00:05:34.199> standing<00:05:34.800> car<00:05:35.039> presence<00:05:35.580> so

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
work that with standing car presence so

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.090 
work that with standing car presence so
legs<00:05:36.330> calves<00:05:36.900> hamstrings<00:05:37.590> quads

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
legs calves hamstrings quads

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.580 
legs calves hamstrings quads
I<00:05:38.160> find<00:05:38.610> them<00:05:38.760> work<00:05:39.360> really<00:05:39.690> well<00:05:40.139> with<00:05:40.350> high

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
I find them work really well with high

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.830 
I find them work really well with high
repetitions<00:05:41.370> so<00:05:41.610> that's<00:05:42.210> why<00:05:42.360> I<00:05:42.389> always<00:05:42.570> do

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
repetitions so that's why I always do

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.900 
repetitions so that's why I always do
around<00:05:43.020> 20<00:05:43.500> repetitions<00:05:43.710> as<00:05:44.280> a<00:05:44.310> minimum<00:05:44.760> I

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
around 20 repetitions as a minimum I

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.520 
around 20 repetitions as a minimum I
think<00:05:45.300> that's<00:05:45.479> it<00:05:45.720> we've<00:05:45.960> covered<00:05:46.200> pretty

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
think that's it we've covered pretty

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.650 
think that's it we've covered pretty
much<00:05:46.770> every<00:05:47.099> muscle<00:05:47.340> group<00:05:47.490> in<00:05:47.729> the<00:05:47.789> body<00:05:47.880> so

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
much every muscle group in the body so

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.480 
much every muscle group in the body so
when<00:05:48.840> I<00:05:48.870> refer<00:05:49.169> to<00:05:49.560> different<00:05:49.950> muscles<00:05:50.310> you
