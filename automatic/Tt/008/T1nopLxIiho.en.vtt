00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.550
 I decided to go under the rock and created

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.480

 youtube buga and did not release the video for 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.440
 everyone but the people who were 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.059
 facebook will not lose the video because 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.559
 I'll always be posting there. 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.479
 I do not know if facebook also usually 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.740
 public bugalho for everyone but 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.960
 come on 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.000
 we are here in the challenge of the pyramid 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.030
 people was a map that I created here is a 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.680
 map with a very simple challenge and I think 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.960
 That's really cool, I want you to become 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.580
 then test the map will let you go to 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.780
 also download the map 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.790
 so I wanted to show you that the 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.380
 At the beginning of it I will not pass from her people 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.509
 Of course I'll let you try 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.600
 This challenge and tac challenge in the pyramid 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.700
 neighborhood beginnings 13 is also regent that 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.560
 is the first challenge in the pyramid that 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.360
 it is inside the pyramid it is outside the pyramid 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.100
 pyramid how can you see who's going to 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.900
 another place that has nothing else to see 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.479
 with the pyramid and as you can see that 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.369
 we are at level 1 are five levels and 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.899
 after the fifth level there is another room 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.520
 a secret room 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.259
 So we can get people there. 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.579
 will have to go through those doors without 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.979
 break them of course 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.600
 so some rules here are no 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.159
 plays in the pacific, let me see that already 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.020
 it's not easy at least it does not make us 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.479
 if you want to put it in the hard to say 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.630
 that the buzz and get stronger you 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.180
 You can put some books here in the chest. 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.469
 we read some rules if you do not 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.270
 You will see what I mean everything to 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.520
 you have a pick that in 17 games 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.560
 that you will already know what you have 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.590
 that one stays fighting the flu 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.540
 I already left ready for you each level. 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.970
 will have some hidden items people 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.550
 so you do not forget to take 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.290
 these items at all right then come here 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.120
 Let's see Paul 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.030
 already we will get this arc that these 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:35.880
 things and also for example he already has 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:37.319
 an opa has taken on the little patchwork 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.360
 here is a little book that I also 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.709
 I left for you here is that during the 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.750
 mini game you will find several 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.209
 managers like this do not forget to 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.200
 they can contain items of 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.569
 big help 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.430
 This is just an example for you guys, you go. 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.549
 find managers like this 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.470
 it's with these buttons and then just fire 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.489
 you will get the item that 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.319
 has inside it 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.319
 also present to the rule is more or less 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:04.170
 the next each level has a door and 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.480
 each port has a password is a password of 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.340
 two digits on each wall you go 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.930
 put one also said that there are some 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.110
 buttons here, but we 'll have to 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.610
 use the blocks in order to place 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.890
 these sayings year will have to hit the 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.989
 disk with these blocks for example I go 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.209
 put the block here in that place in the 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:22.049
 level at number one here I will press the 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.650
 button 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:29.190
 Level 1 is the 1st level he will collect 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.600
 block and that wall has to stay 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.280
 block on each wall 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.590
 so after you put this block 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.120
 What are you going to do? 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.170
 you really are ready you find 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.910
 that this is the right 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.640
 You will put there in front of you. 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.859
 light if it lights up because you got it right 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.100
 The password on this wall here is very 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:49.019
 very simple if you do not hit it will 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.100
 hang some monsters there for you to fight 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.459
 against them 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.620
 the level here quite easy just two strangers 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.900
 in 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.610
 a car or an almost you kill me 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.379
 with the meat society 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.420
 Let me see that the sound is pretty 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:04.099
 stop here because the 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.959
 zombies do not make much noise 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:08.299
 so let's go get this stone out of here. 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:11.900
 answer opa disable the first 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:13.310
 lawan of course and I will put the stone that 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.780
 somewhere else 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.489
 I 'll put it in the right place here to 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.799
 not stay too long and that 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.329
 here on the side of the wall is the 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.979
 level is number four 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.110
 It's logical that on the map that you download 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.770
 it will not be that you see it lit a 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.360
 light on there 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.580
 now you go on the other side of the wall 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.720
 will also try to do this 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:35.120
 for example here at 5 here it is not 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.900
 Let's go fight against zombies. 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.610
 here new car is not what 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.169
 It really is very easy but as 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.840
 you go by and it's making it difficult 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:48.350
 but the things of me are going well 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.419
 more fun, I do not know, I passed 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.520
 decide in this game that I think 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:55.250
 It's because I created it so I think 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.020
 I found I found it easy but I have 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.880
 sure that it will stay a little longer 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.440
 Difficult for guys who do not know that 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.169
 It's still because I already know the password already 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.780
 So it was much easier for me and the 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:10.000
 Password on this side here is here 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:12.740
 block that break this blog here again 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.900
 hungry and how a little 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.880
 Let's go now and see if it will work. 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.490
 this here 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.139
 the walk gave him the door will open and there 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.360
 will open another level for you that is 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:25.190
 level 2 and level 2 is that I will not 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.560
 show you guys I want you guys 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:30.139
 see from now on how it is each 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.510
 level has its challenges everyone is always 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:34.490
 put these passwords here is always a one 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.970
 digit on each side a block in each 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.650
 side 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.060
 no use putting you all or not 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.310
 let everyone that you will not 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.680
 getting people has to be just one 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.419
 an already right password for this 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.949
 So thank you so much that you watched the 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:47.750
 video until you want to do the 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:49.760
 download this map and has a link in the 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.470
 description and for you to download 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.630
 you want to record videos on that map that 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.910
 feel free to feel free 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.250

 it's all right, it's just you shoot the video 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.760
 You can send the video as an answer. 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.500
 in this video here that I'm going to accept 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.159
 all videos reset response from this 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.710
 video 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:08.030
 only that the videos that were referring 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.100
 to this map 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.630
 download a video record you 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:14.150
 passing that unused map into a 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.670
 rack without breaking blocks using all 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.140
 rules right there and record a video 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.480
 It seems that for me to be able to watch 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.580
 So you playing people can be and those who 

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.130
 More like I'm going to publish the videos of 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.330
 I liked the use of the challenges of course I 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.230
 But I wish you both succeeded. 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.790
 to complete 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.500
 so thank you so much people are everybody 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.000

 I even wish you to help me. 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.930
 still a fan and a favorite in this video 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.490
 because it's been a lot of work on this pyramid 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.470
 It's too much work to even do these 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.190
 course the map is not very difficult to 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.990
 do 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.390
 The annoying thing is because it's too slow for you. 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:47.480
 must increase the difficulty with the 

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:49.310
 levels put item right if it gives too much 

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.840
 work and do many tests then by 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.520
 please help me even a like one 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.860
