00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:06.750
 ok let's demonstrate how is the adjustment 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.299
 for the thickness of this this kind of 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.110
 machine that is what we are going to do if 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:15.570
 we want slimming 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.190
 what we're going to see the following 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.190
 we loose the nuts 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.990
 we loosened both nuts 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.930
 we loosened that is against nut also 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.380
 Y 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.660
 we move this screw so that it advances 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.480
 forward a little bit nothing more some 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.330
 quarter back one third turn if 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.440
 perhaps not to lose weight a lot and 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.310
 that is going to burst 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.980
 then we move towards 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.760
 clockwise so that the screw 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.890
 semeta 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.850
 and once done that we return to 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.700
 to tight 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.460
 the little nut 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.239
 we press this 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.239
 two nuts 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.980
 this setting 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.570
 here it is very rare to be done but 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.000
 to prove it and if on the contrary 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.210
 we want 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.400
 and open the plate 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.740
 the plant that 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.740
 in this lower part 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:33.560
 what we do is remove it 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.560
 here we loose the Turkish counter is 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.679
 we loosened the nut 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.960
 as we see the screw towards the 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:49.900
 inverse in counterclockwise direction why 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.900
 the sum wax is removed we press 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.259
 it is very little that really moves 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.240
 again 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:00.939
 we squeeze 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.939
 I already approved and we knocked on the door 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.470
 and we are going to pull the one so that it stops the sum 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.619
 will be in the tournament then already after 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:13.230
 that nothing mix we go back to 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:16.459
 to press that we do not forget because 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.459
 then it will be moving us 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.740
 and the simplest thing is up here the 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.770
 thickness what are we going to do what 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.770
 same 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.150
 I speak camos is against nut 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.980
 and what we are going to do is say 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.900
 if we want to thin the tortilla 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.490
 What are we going to do? 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.420
 screws there it closed completely not 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.420
 it must be completely closed 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.069
 let's say we 're going to water it we give it 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.020
 although I was a little open 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.420
 why 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.110
 I 'm not going to burst the tortilla very 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.110
 important 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.640
 with everything we do 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.140
 and what we did was close it to 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.760
 lose weight 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.970
 must be a little open nothing more 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.580
 if on the contrary what we want to be 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.120
 what we want is to swell the tortilla 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.650
 or take out gorditas 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.230
 the screws 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.659
 put them so that the iron 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.890
 it was opening was and what day is more 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:35.170
 open 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.390
 and it opened 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.690
 if we put the screws it opens if the 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.690
 we take out 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.160
 close the iron 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:49.480
 since when we make the adjustment 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.050
 again that we never forget 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.050
 to affect 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.960
 that's all
