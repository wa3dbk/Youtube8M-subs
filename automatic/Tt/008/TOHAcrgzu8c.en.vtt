00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
reward of a star so we kind of to this

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.340 
reward of a star so we kind of to this
was<00:00:52.640> actually<00:00:52.760> really<00:00:53.030> short<00:00:53.480> all<00:00:53.749> if<00:00:54.109> the

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
was actually really short all if the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.290 
was actually really short all if the
first<00:00:54.589> two<00:00:54.739> on<00:00:54.980> this<00:00:55.100> stage<00:00:55.399> is<00:00:55.640> really<00:00:55.940> short

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
first two on this stage is really short

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.970 
first two on this stage is really short
than<00:00:56.629> they're<00:00:56.809> both<00:00:57.019> basically<00:00:57.679> the<00:00:57.769> same

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
than they're both basically the same

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.759

thing<00:00:58.039> just<00:00:58.719> swim<00:00:59.719> it<00:00:59.870> then<00:01:00.079> it's<00:01:00.469> even<00:01:00.710> the

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:00.769 
thing just swim it then it's even the

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.990 
thing just swim it then it's even the
same<00:01:00.800> path<00:01:01.190> even<00:01:02.109> so<00:01:03.400> it's<00:01:04.400> just<00:01:04.519> a<00:01:04.670> matter<00:01:04.699> of

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000

do it I and these retooling apparently

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.030 
do it I and these retooling apparently
making<00:02:10.310> overly<00:02:10.820> first<00:02:11.470> as<00:02:12.470> if<00:02:12.680> you<00:02:12.830> really

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
making overly first as if you really

need<00:02:13.190> at<00:02:13.340> this<00:02:13.550> point<00:02:13.610> but

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:27.630 

here<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.030> get<00:02:21.150> back<00:02:21.269> up<00:02:21.300> again<00:02:21.480> so<00:02:21.989> we<00:02:22.170> win

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.650 

I'm<00:02:28.640> not<00:02:28.849> sure<00:02:29.000> if<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:29.209> actually<00:02:29.360> have<00:02:29.569> to

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
I'm not sure if you actually have to

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.070 
I'm not sure if you actually have to
beat<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:30.019> time<00:02:30.560> of<00:02:30.830> 130<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.670> get<00:02:31.910> it<00:02:32.030> but<00:02:32.269> here

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
beat the time of 130 to get it but here

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:41.860 
beat the time of 130 to get it but here
is<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.290> start<00:02:39.340> and<00:02:40.340> just<00:02:40.849> because<00:02:41.450> it<00:02:41.690> always

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
is the start and just because it always

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.420 
is the start and just because it always
annoys<00:02:42.230> me<00:02:42.319> whenever<00:02:42.590> these<00:02:42.739> guys<00:02:42.980> make<00:02:43.250> me

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
annoys me whenever these guys make me

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.009 
annoys me whenever these guys make me
work<00:02:43.640> for<00:02:43.670> starters<00:02:44.330> when<00:02:44.629> I'm<00:02:44.750> trying<00:02:44.930> to

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
work for starters when I'm trying to

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
save them all I stopped by this head to

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.500 
save them all I stopped by this head to
