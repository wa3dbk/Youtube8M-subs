rollin<00:06:11.340> is<00:06:11.490> he<00:06:11.789> doesn't<00:06:12.210> like<00:06:12.330> Cholula<00:06:12.810> so

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
rollin is he doesn't like Cholula so

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.740 
rollin is he doesn't like Cholula so
what<00:06:14.430> he<00:06:14.759> doesn't<00:06:14.909> like<00:06:15.090> yeah<00:06:15.240> I<00:06:15.509> think<00:06:15.599> he

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750 
what he doesn't like yeah I think he

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.029 
what he doesn't like yeah I think he
likes<00:06:15.930> that<00:06:16.080> style<00:06:16.349> of<00:06:16.439> hot<00:06:16.650> sauce

better<00:06:19.680> because<00:06:20.099> it<00:06:20.280> doesn't<00:06:20.669> taste<00:06:20.849> that

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:20.969 
better because it doesn't taste that

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:22.459 
better because it doesn't taste that
well<00:06:21.210> it's<00:06:21.330> a<00:06:21.360> little<00:06:21.479> better<00:06:21.659> than<00:06:21.960> human
