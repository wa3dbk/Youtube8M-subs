didn't really knows that that much but
now<00:02:47.860> it's<00:02:48.040> mounted<00:02:48.519> I<00:02:48.730> suppose<00:02:49.090> it's<00:02:49.239> more

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
now it's mounted I suppose it's more

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.870 
now it's mounted I suppose it's more
rigid<00:02:49.840> I<00:02:49.989> don't<00:02:50.709> know<00:02:50.769> how<00:02:50.980> monix<00:02:51.370> or<00:02:51.519> whatever

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
rigid I don't know how monix or whatever

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.880 
rigid I don't know how monix or whatever
but<00:02:52.209> it's<00:02:52.390> it's<00:02:52.900> enough<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:53.410> really<00:02:53.590> give<00:02:53.769> me

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
but it's it's enough to really give me

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.580 
but it's it's enough to really give me
the<00:02:53.920> willies<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.959> yeah<00:02:55.959> I'd<00:02:56.140> rather<00:02:56.260> have<00:02:56.500> the

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
the willies and yeah I'd rather have the

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.520 
the willies and yeah I'd rather have the
old<00:02:56.620> AC<00:02:56.920> motor<00:02:57.340> in<00:02:57.519> there<00:02:57.900> how<00:02:58.900> many<00:02:58.959> you<00:02:59.410> know

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
old AC motor in there how many you know

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.910 
old AC motor in there how many you know
you<00:02:59.590> can<00:02:59.829> always<00:03:00.070> go<00:03:00.250> and<00:03:00.340> put<00:03:00.519> a<00:03:01.350> VFD<00:03:02.350> on<00:03:02.709> with

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
you can always go and put a VFD on with

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.370 
you can always go and put a VFD on with
three-phase<00:03:03.459> but<00:03:04.420> then<00:03:04.570> probably<00:03:05.109> that<00:03:05.230> is

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
three-phase but then probably that is

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.080 
three-phase but then probably that is
then<00:03:05.680> then<00:03:05.859> you<00:03:05.920> got<00:03:06.040> no<00:03:06.160> bottom<00:03:06.489> in<00:03:06.549> guts<00:03:06.820> you

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
then then you got no bottom in guts you

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.170 
then then you got no bottom in guts you
know<00:03:07.120> VFD<00:03:07.959> motors<00:03:08.519> attract<00:03:09.519> the<00:03:09.670> gutless<00:03:10.000> when

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
know VFD motors attract the gutless when

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.610 
know VFD motors attract the gutless when
you<00:03:10.239> get<00:03:10.420> down<00:03:10.600> low<00:03:10.840> and<00:03:10.870> you'll<00:03:11.170> find<00:03:11.500> the

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
you get down low and you'll find the

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.610 
you get down low and you'll find the
variable<00:03:11.920> speed<00:03:12.160> to<00:03:12.519> have<00:03:13.230> yeah<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.440> low

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
variable speed to have yeah the low

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.460 
variable speed to have yeah the low
speed<00:03:15.130> for<00:03:15.760> threading<00:03:16.180> and<00:03:16.329> you<00:03:16.540> know<00:03:16.660> you

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
speed for threading and you know you

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.979 
speed for threading and you know you
want<00:03:17.650> some<00:03:17.829> sort<00:03:18.070> of<00:03:18.130> talkback<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:19.570> it<00:03:19.780> cost

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
want some sort of talkback and it cost

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.330 
want some sort of talkback and it cost
you<00:03:20.079> hundreds<00:03:20.470> of<00:03:20.500> dollars<00:03:20.560> to<00:03:20.859> do<00:03:21.100> it<00:03:21.220> so<00:03:21.310> I

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
you hundreds of dollars to do it so I

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.949 
you hundreds of dollars to do it so I
just<00:03:21.400> can't<00:03:21.670> be<00:03:21.760> bothered<00:03:21.790> so<00:03:22.630> I'm<00:03:22.750> just<00:03:22.840> going

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
the noise out the motor and you know

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:17.620 
the noise out the motor and you know
sort<00:04:16.730> of<00:04:16.820> like<00:04:16.910> a<00:04:17.000> cross<00:04:17.269> between<00:04:17.299> the

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
sort of smooth pot I think the main

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
thing has been of any part at all keep

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.670 
thing has been of any part at all keep
it<00:04:29.240> as<00:04:29.330> short<00:04:29.360> as<00:04:29.750> possible<00:04:29.780> so<00:04:30.200> they<00:04:30.500> can<00:04:30.590> get

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
it as short as possible so they can get

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.510 
it as short as possible so they can get
that<00:04:30.860> that<00:04:31.640> organ<00:04:32.060> pipe<00:04:32.270> effect<00:04:32.630> but<00:04:33.250> so<00:04:34.250> yeah

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
that that organ pipe effect but so yeah

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.300 
that that organ pipe effect but so yeah
even<00:04:35.120> that<00:04:35.150> didn't<00:04:35.480> work<00:04:35.800> then<00:04:36.800> of<00:04:37.010> course<00:04:37.220> to

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
even that didn't work then of course to

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.740 
even that didn't work then of course to
do<00:04:37.460> these<00:04:37.580> jobs<00:04:37.640> and<00:04:38.090> you<00:04:38.150> got<00:04:38.300> all<00:04:38.450> the<00:04:38.510> crap

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
do these jobs and you got all the crap

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.370 
do these jobs and you got all the crap
in<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:38.990> will<00:04:39.169> drag<00:04:39.740> down<00:04:39.770> I<00:04:40.280> mean<00:04:40.460> a<00:04:41.380> better

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
in the will drag down I mean a better

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.260 
in the will drag down I mean a better

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
pissed off probably a bit of an

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.700 
pissed off probably a bit of an
understatement

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
understatement

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.800 
understatement

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
but what's gained it's project and I

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.840 
but what's gained it's project and I
mean<00:04:50.960> when<00:04:51.169> you<00:04:51.380> were<00:04:51.820> experimenting<00:04:52.820> with

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850 
mean when you were experimenting with

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.610 
mean when you were experimenting with
stuff<00:04:53.180> you<00:04:53.360> got<00:04:53.479> to<00:04:53.510> expect<00:04:53.780> fire<00:04:54.110> so<00:04:54.560> you

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
stuff you got to expect fire so you

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.880 
stuff you got to expect fire so you
can't<00:04:55.100> get<00:04:55.250> through<00:04:55.400> to<00:04:56.050> another<00:04:57.050> nice<00:04:57.380> -<00:04:57.620> but

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
can't get through to another nice - but

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.320 
can't get through to another nice - but
it<00:04:58.040> was<00:04:58.130> a<00:04:58.160> lot<00:04:58.340> of<00:04:58.430> work<00:04:58.580> for<00:04:58.790> nothing<00:04:58.940> because

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
it was a lot of work for nothing because

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.070 
it was a lot of work for nothing because
I<00:04:59.750> just<00:05:00.050> know<00:05:00.950> I<00:05:00.979> don't<00:05:01.100> want<00:05:01.250> to<00:05:01.370> have<00:05:02.080> humming

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:03.080 
I just know I don't want to have humming

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.750 
also piss travel is almost going to
delete<00:05:24.320> the<00:05:24.470> original<00:05:24.560> videos<00:05:25.100> nice<00:05:25.370> but<00:05:25.580> what

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
happen but these project you think

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.650 
happen but these project you think
you've<00:05:28.640> got<00:05:28.760> everything<00:05:28.970> covered<00:05:29.060> and<00:05:29.540> then

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
you've got everything covered and then

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.810 
you've got everything covered and then
you<00:05:30.440> get<00:05:30.620> spammy<00:05:31.250> with<00:05:31.370> something<00:05:31.640> like<00:05:31.790> a

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
you get spammy with something like a

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.490 
you get spammy with something like a
noisy<00:05:32.540> motor<00:05:32.780> and<00:05:33.290> even<00:05:33.560> though<00:05:33.680> a<00:05:34.270> DC<00:05:35.270> motor

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
noisy motor and even though a DC motor

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.040 
noisy motor and even though a DC motor
humming<00:05:36.500> like<00:05:36.740> that<00:05:36.979> can<00:05:37.250> be<00:05:37.490> due<00:05:37.940> to<00:05:38.050> lower

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
humming like that can be due to lower

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.230 
humming like that can be due to lower
amperage<00:05:39.380> in<00:05:39.620> this<00:05:39.740> case<00:05:39.950> that's<00:05:40.940> not<00:05:41.030> the

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
amperage in this case that's not the

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.010 
amperage in this case that's not the
case<00:05:41.450> because

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
case because

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.130 
case because
answer<00:05:43.440> right<00:05:43.620> up<00:05:43.830> there<00:05:44.040> so<00:05:44.310> it's<00:05:44.520> just<00:05:45.140> the

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
answer right up there so it's just the

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.720 
answer right up there so it's just the
motor<00:05:46.730> okay

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:49.730 
motor okay

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.820 
motor okay
things<00:05:50.730> like<00:05:50.820> this<00:05:50.970> happen<00:05:51.030> okay<00:05:51.750> see<00:05:52.740> you
