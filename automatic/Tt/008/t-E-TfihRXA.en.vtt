00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.640
 and as they are, I hope they are very well 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.100
 I am crazy madoff assets are 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.260
 welcome to a video more here in gta 5 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.790
 online this time revealed that there would be two 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.309
 new options that have been added 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.289
 with this new dlc I touch not all the 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.060
 Everyone knows that the added because they are 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.099
 two very simple options one that if 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.480
 is very good and the other one is 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.980
 seeing there on screen or that the one 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.929
 he saw her and that he already recognized her 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.429
 better you know what is ok is that 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:30.499
 good one of the options that added 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.930
 in this new dlc is where you go to 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:34.610
 to be able to wait when you join a 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.289
 quick session using the cell phone that 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.570
 Get out of the cell you go to who they are 

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:40.010
 the monitos quick activity and you join 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.780
 any activity now appears the 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.239
 option that you can put the activity 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.980
 in standby ok what does it mean waiting in 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.690
 wait means that you are going to be 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.100
 in the game you will be waiting for 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.530
 more players there are where the 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.329
 players the options the information of 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.949
 the players but you will be able to follow 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.019
 playing and when the list is ready 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.730
 starting to start going to start what 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:00.440
 is the game and you're going to tie 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.030
 carry what is the game ok that's 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.620
 something very chinky since sometimes you had 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.630
 to wait for them to join more than 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.920
 five players more than three players and 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.530
 Well the truth was a bit boring 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.450
 so now you can play 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.729
 so that they see I am going to give him in waiting 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.070
 sure and here is going to start a time there 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.409
 We are waiting and we took too 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.640
 that would be a totally random game 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.860
 this is when they want to play something 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.960
 fast and when the game is ready 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.240
 to start will take us to what it is 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.890
 the game ok sometimes we usually appear 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.570
 there the number of players the numbers 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.399
 of players who have the game let's 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.200
 here is a full game and well here 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.119
 we would be ready to begin what 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.920
 it's this game that this is something very 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.659
 simple very fast we can at the same time 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.009
 that we want and with any 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.929
 quick game that we want 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.520
 but since I do not want to play, we're going 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:45.320
 to go out to teach what would be the 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.170
 second option that you have added in this 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.119
 new dlc and good people a also from 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.490
 things the second thing that they added 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.110
 in this new dlc is where stress 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.789
 will be able to send what would be a 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.590
 murder mission that as they came 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.300
 saying there what will appear to us 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.009
 would be the mission down to the left we 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.330
 will seem to kill target nothing more 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.190
 we would have to take out what would be 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.500
 our cell phone we go to list of 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.360
 activities and we go to the invitation of the 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.039
 this was killing goal ok there we are going to 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.590
 mark what would be the goal usually 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.150
 being a pedestrian are usually several cars 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.620
 sometimes namas a car and that will be more 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.420
 stopped and na more we go and kill him 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.030
 sometimes they will give us what would be the 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.379
 money so that's like one for that 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.659
 do not get bored they did not say there is 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.860
 people who get bored in online then put 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.989
 it's a mission not for them to go to 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.310
 murder someone and well that's something 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.080
 not entertaining, you do not have anything 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.640
 but if you do not want to go 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.159
 to kill a target and means a 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.140
 death game, you can go do what 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.250
 that would be the waiting session and you can 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.470
 keep playing and when the 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.060
 so you get in session ok so 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.250
 they would be practically two new options 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.780
 they added in this new dlc that I 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.790
 know if they have any option that they have 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.410
 added in this dlc that is not so 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.150
 known you can leave me here below in 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.010
 the comments you already know that everything down 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.090
 in the comments is answered yes no 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.170
 So you think I see the comments 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.079
 previous of the next of the 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.870
 previous videos because I just put what 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:01.730
 that would be my google account to this to 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.140
 youtube associate you and then I can 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.970
 answer the comments ok so 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.739
 well you know if you know any other 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.599
 thing they added this new dlc that not 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.069
 everybody know you can leave me to 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.170
 out in the comments if you liked this 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.819
 video you can leave your little like that 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.590
 it helps me too seriously they are nothing more 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.150
 if you liked the video subscribe to the channel 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.280
 and then practically it would not be everything and 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.750
 nothing else let's kill this killer this 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.410
 it's a quick video just for them to see 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.870
 what I know 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.970
 the new options because in itself then 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.190
 they are options that almost not all of them 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.780
 they realize the stress possibly 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.550
 have realized but the other one 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.170
 I bet no, so, well, well, let's go 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.170
 to kill this goal we eat something very 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.330
 easy we come we put a c4 and you 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.980
 we make bubisher prime or the packers and 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.920
 there is what is this objective that 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.930
 as we saw we got 5 thousand 800 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.610
 money so I think it 's fine and 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.240
 it hardly would be all up 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.420
 the next 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.420
 goodbye
