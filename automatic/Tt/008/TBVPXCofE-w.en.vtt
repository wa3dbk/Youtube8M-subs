opportunity to work everyday for six
years<00:02:12.200> and<00:02:12.470> not<00:02:12.709> many<00:02:12.860> actors<00:02:13.190> get<00:02:13.310> a<00:02:13.340> chance

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
years and not many actors get a chance

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.220 
years and not many actors get a chance
to<00:02:13.730> do<00:02:13.850> that<00:02:14.030> it's<00:02:14.209> a<00:02:14.270> very<00:02:14.450> rare<00:02:15.050> opportunity

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
to do that it's a very rare opportunity

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.059 
to do that it's a very rare opportunity
so<00:02:15.920> when<00:02:16.520> Hawaii<00:02:16.790> five-o<00:02:17.180> came<00:02:17.420> around<00:02:18.069> it

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
so when Hawaii five-o came around it

so when Hawaii five-o came around it
actually<00:02:19.220> shoots<00:02:19.670> also<00:02:20.150> in<00:02:20.300> Hawaii<00:02:20.630> and<00:02:20.840> so<00:02:21.230> I

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
actually shoots also in Hawaii and so I

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.400 
actually shoots also in Hawaii and so I
felt<00:02:22.190> like<00:02:22.340> I<00:02:22.490> was<00:02:22.670> home<00:02:23.300> still<00:02:23.810> for<00:02:24.170> Hawaii

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
felt like I was home still for Hawaii

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
English so it's a very different kind of

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.309 
English so it's a very different kind of
character<00:02:28.489> that<00:02:29.270> guy<00:02:29.390> speaks<00:02:29.690> English<00:02:30.020> yeah

because Hollywood is different isn't it

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.290 
because Hollywood is different isn't it
it<00:03:00.709> really<00:03:00.739> is<00:03:01.130> and<00:03:01.489> you<00:03:01.730> know<00:03:01.850> just<00:03:02.060> because

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
it really is and you know just because

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.820 
it really is and you know just because
you're<00:03:02.480> star<00:03:02.780> in<00:03:02.900> one<00:03:03.050> place<00:03:03.350> doesn't<00:03:03.739> mean

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
you're star in one place doesn't mean

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:04.830 
you're star in one place doesn't mean
you're<00:03:03.950> going<00:03:04.100> to<00:03:04.190> be<00:03:04.280> a<00:03:04.310> star<00:03:04.580> in<00:03:04.670> another

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
you're going to be a star in another

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.520 
you're going to be a star in another
unfortunately<00:03:05.840> I<00:03:05.870> wish<00:03:06.110> it<00:03:06.260> were<00:03:06.350> that<00:03:06.380> easy

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
unfortunately I wish it were that easy

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.960 
unfortunately I wish it were that easy
because<00:03:06.890> then<00:03:07.100> we<00:03:07.190> could<00:03:07.310> all<00:03:07.459> travel<00:03:07.640> back

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
because then we could all travel back

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.949 
because then we could all travel back
and<00:03:08.000> forth<00:03:08.209> um<00:03:09.080> but<00:03:09.980> I<00:03:10.190> think<00:03:10.480> advice<00:03:11.480> for<00:03:11.810> them

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
and forth um but I think advice for them

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.560 
and forth um but I think advice for them
would<00:03:12.680> be<00:03:12.829> number<00:03:13.130> one<00:03:13.310> and<00:03:13.610> get<00:03:14.420> your

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
would be number one and get your

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.509 
would be number one and get your
language<00:03:14.900> skills<00:03:15.019> as<00:03:15.769> good<00:03:16.070> as<00:03:16.160> they<00:03:16.310> can<00:03:16.370> be

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
language skills as good as they can be

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.180 
language skills as good as they can be

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.680 
is important to their bottom line and
that's<00:05:07.920> you<00:05:08.550> know<00:05:08.670> people<00:05:09.030> always<00:05:09.180> ask<00:05:09.330> me

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
that's you know people always ask me

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.080 
that's you know people always ask me
like<00:05:09.930> does<00:05:10.800> Hollywood<00:05:11.130> care<00:05:11.430> about<00:05:11.610> color<00:05:11.850> and

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
like does Hollywood care about color and

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.190 
like does Hollywood care about color and
I<00:05:12.120> say<00:05:12.330> yes<00:05:12.570> it<00:05:12.780> does

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
I say yes it does

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.900 
I say yes it does
but<00:05:13.500> the<00:05:13.620> most<00:05:13.740> important<00:05:14.220> color<00:05:14.370> is<00:05:14.640> green

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
but the most important color is green

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.490 
but the most important color is green
because<00:05:15.450> what<00:05:15.750> they<00:05:15.870> care<00:05:16.020> about<00:05:16.050> is<00:05:16.410> the

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
because what they care about is the

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.160 
because what they care about is the
dollar<00:05:16.680> mm-hmm<00:05:17.280> and<00:05:17.400> so<00:05:18.020> whoever's<00:05:19.020> gonna

is that when Korean actors come to do

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.670 
is that when Korean actors come to do
American<00:05:26.280> movies<00:05:26.670> that<00:05:27.270> it<00:05:27.870> increases<00:05:28.350> roles

for Asian American actors or Korean

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.300 
for Asian American actors or Korean
American<00:05:30.690> actors<00:05:31.020> so<00:05:31.500> far<00:05:31.740> that<00:05:31.920> hasn't<00:05:32.100> been

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
American actors so far that hasn't been

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:34.520 
American actors so far that hasn't been
the<00:05:32.490> case<00:05:32.520> but<00:05:33.120> we'll<00:05:33.660> see<00:05:33.810> how<00:05:33.930> it<00:05:34.080> goes<00:05:34.110> you
