that that season finale cut off I think

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.510 
that that season finale cut off I think
everyone's<00:00:39.989> really<00:00:40.079> kind<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:40.980> anticipating

a<00:00:42.989> little<00:00:43.200> bit<00:00:43.290> about<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.560> in<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.710> most

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
a little bit about it in the most

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.130 
a little bit about it in the most
general<00:00:44.310> non<00:00:44.850> spoilery<00:00:45.149> terms<00:00:45.600> possibly

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
general non spoilery terms possibly

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.870 
general non spoilery terms possibly
where's<00:00:46.560> Dexter<00:00:46.890> at<00:00:47.070> this<00:00:47.280> season<00:00:47.520> well<00:00:47.850> I

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 
where's Dexter at this season well I

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.420 
where's Dexter at this season well I
mean<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.239> think<00:00:48.300> we<00:00:48.780> first<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.559> all<00:00:49.620> get<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.160> find

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
mean I think we first of all get to find

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.330 
mean I think we first of all get to find
out<00:00:50.750> what<00:00:51.750> happened<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.290> the<00:00:52.649> immediate

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
out what happened in the immediate

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.030 
out what happened in the immediate
aftermath<00:00:53.690> of<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.840> conclusion<00:00:55.440> of<00:00:55.530> six<00:00:55.800> I

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
aftermath of the conclusion of six I

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.280 
aftermath of the conclusion of six I
mean<00:00:56.190> he's<00:00:56.370> caught<00:00:56.640> as<00:00:57.239> red-handed<00:00:58.050> as<00:00:58.170> you

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
mean he's caught as red-handed as you

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.229 
mean he's caught as red-handed as you
can<00:00:58.440> never<00:00:58.559> be<00:00:58.710> caught<00:00:58.950> so<00:00:59.820> we<00:00:59.910> get<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.120> see

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
can never be caught so we get to see

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.500 
can never be caught so we get to see
that<00:01:00.360> unfold<00:01:00.890> and<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.430> guess<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.239> could<00:01:03.390> say

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
that unfold and I guess I could say

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.200 
that unfold and I guess I could say
generally<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.019> think<00:01:04.350> I'm<00:01:04.530> excited<00:01:04.649> about<00:01:05.210> how

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
generally I think I'm excited about how

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.809 
generally I think I'm excited about how
the<00:01:06.270> season<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.810> shaping<00:01:07.229> up<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.799> shooting<00:01:08.670> it

00:01:08.809 --> 00:01:08.819 
the season is shaping up and shooting it

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:11.149 
the season is shaping up and shooting it
because<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.719> think<00:01:10.139> the<00:01:10.380> show<00:01:10.409> is<00:01:10.590> always<00:01:10.950> at

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
because I think the show is always at

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.020 
because I think the show is always at
its<00:01:11.310> best<00:01:11.459> when<00:01:11.819> he<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.329> in<00:01:13.200> hot<00:01:14.069> water<00:01:14.100> and

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
its best when he is in hot water and

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.340 
its best when he is in hot water and
he's<00:01:16.039> and<00:01:17.149> he's<00:01:18.149> just<00:01:18.389> going<00:01:18.539> from<00:01:18.659> pot<00:01:18.959> to<00:01:19.170> pot

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
he's and he's just going from pot to pot

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.010 
he's and he's just going from pot to pot
to<00:01:19.560> pot<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:20.100> know<00:01:20.219> it's<00:01:20.759> boiling<00:01:21.179> water<00:01:21.389> it's

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
to pot you know it's boiling water it's

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.260 
to pot you know it's boiling water it's
exciting<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.439> mean<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.889> know<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.270> sense

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
exciting I mean that you know the sense

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.849 
exciting I mean that you know the sense
now<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.659> like<00:01:24.779> after<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.139> many<00:01:25.229> seasons<00:01:25.740> like

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:25.859 
now that like after so many seasons like

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:27.230 
now that like after so many seasons like
you<00:01:25.979> know<00:01:26.069> you<00:01:26.130> need<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.579> even<00:01:26.700> ratchet<00:01:27.119> up

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
you know you need to even ratchet up

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.149 
you know you need to even ratchet up
that<00:01:27.539> hot<00:01:27.749> water<00:01:27.959> even<00:01:28.409> more<00:01:28.439> at<00:01:28.709> this<00:01:28.859> point

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
that hot water even more at this point

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.440 
that hot water even more at this point
just<00:01:29.340> well<00:01:29.490> that's<00:01:29.639> nice<00:01:29.909> if<00:01:30.209> there's

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
just well that's nice if there's

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.239 
just well that's nice if there's
something<00:01:30.929> that<00:01:30.959> comes<00:01:31.109> organically<00:01:32.009> out<00:01:32.039> of

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:32.249 
something that comes organically out of

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:34.760 
something that comes organically out of
the<00:01:32.310> story<00:01:32.579> we've<00:01:32.789> been<00:01:32.819> telling<00:01:33.209> that<00:01:34.139> allows

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
the story we've been telling that allows

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.349 
the story we've been telling that allows
the<00:01:35.159> landscape<00:01:35.639> to<00:01:35.789> fundamentally<00:01:36.329> change

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:36.359 
the landscape to fundamentally change

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:39.199 
the landscape to fundamentally change
and<00:01:36.959> that<00:01:37.049> certainly<00:01:37.439> happens<00:01:37.920> with<00:01:38.209> the

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:39.209 
and that certainly happens with the

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:42.190 
and that certainly happens with the
discovery<00:01:39.749> that<00:01:40.020> Deb<00:01:40.619> makes

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
discovery that Deb makes

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.530 
discovery that Deb makes
the<00:01:42.680> whole<00:01:42.950> landscape<00:01:43.190> has<00:01:43.640> changed<00:01:43.670> and<00:01:44.240> it's

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
the whole landscape has changed and it's

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.719 
the whole landscape has changed and it's
really<00:01:44.810> exciting<00:01:45.110> to<00:01:45.350> be<00:01:45.380> able<00:01:45.470> to<00:01:45.680> you<00:01:46.610> know

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
really exciting to be able to you know

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.790 
really exciting to be able to you know
breathe<00:01:46.970> life<00:01:47.180> into<00:01:47.210> a<00:01:47.479> new<00:01:47.720> energy<00:01:47.930> now

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
breathe life into a new energy now

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.810
