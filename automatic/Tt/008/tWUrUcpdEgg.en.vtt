and<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.390> second<00:01:06.870> responses<00:01:10.310> so<00:01:11.310> it's<00:01:11.490> like

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
and the second responses so it's like

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.140 
and the second responses so it's like
the<00:01:12.150> second<00:01:12.750> part<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.440> but<00:01:13.820> with<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> little

the second part of it but with a little

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.180 
the second part of it but with a little
bit<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.450> pull<00:01:15.720> off<00:01:16.190> and<00:01:17.510> then<00:01:18.510> a<00:01:18.540> slide

and<00:01:21.280> then<00:01:22.030> ax<00:01:22.330> I<00:01:22.540> think<00:01:22.750> he<00:01:22.840> slides<00:01:23.140> back<00:01:23.290> to

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
and then ax I think he slides back to

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:31.620 
and then ax I think he slides back to
the<00:01:23.710> G<00:01:29.130> like<00:01:30.130> that<00:01:30.460> so<00:01:30.850> that's<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.210> second

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
the G like that so that's the second

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.770 
the G like that so that's the second
response<00:01:31.840> rate<00:01:34.080> and<00:01:35.520> then<00:01:36.520> going<00:01:37.480> to<00:01:37.510> the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
response rate and then going to the

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.620 
response rate and then going to the
third<00:01:38.310> response<00:01:39.310> is<00:01:39.550> the<00:01:39.640> same<00:01:39.880> as<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.180> first

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.060 

and<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:44.710> last<00:01:44.920> one<00:01:45.430> is<00:01:45.910> I<00:01:46.470> start<00:01:47.470> sliding<00:01:47.830> my

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070
