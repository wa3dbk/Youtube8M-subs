00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
two by fours they're flat take a 1 by 2

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.470 
two by fours they're flat take a 1 by 2
with<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:32.970> connection<00:00:33.510> piece<00:00:34.640> with<00:00:35.640> their<00:00:35.940> two

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
with a connection piece with their two

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.560 
with a connection piece with their two
by<00:00:36.660> fours<00:00:36.989> place<00:00:37.530> them<00:00:37.890> like<00:00:38.240> so<00:00:39.240> you<00:00:39.300> have

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
by fours place them like so you have

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.840 
by fours place them like so you have
spacers<00:00:40.290> here<00:00:42.050> take<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.140> 1<00:00:43.290> by<00:00:43.470> 2<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:44.280> place

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
spacers here take the 1 by 2 and place

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.570 
spacers here take the 1 by 2 and place
it<00:00:45.090> there<00:00:46.250> with<00:00:47.250> these<00:00:48.170> place<00:00:49.170> them<00:00:49.380> below<00:00:49.950> on

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:50.580 
it there with these place them below on

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.610 
it there with these place them below on
the<00:00:51.270> 2<00:00:51.450> by<00:00:51.660> 4<00:00:51.800> which<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.950> the<00:00:53.130> lowest<00:00:54.470> so<00:00:55.470> it

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
the 2 by 4 which is the lowest so it

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.420 
the 2 by 4 which is the lowest so it
looks<00:00:55.860> like<00:00:55.950> some<00:00:56.220> rather<00:00:58.760> then<00:01:00.590> you<00:01:01.590> take<00:01:01.830> one

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
looks like some rather then you take one

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.370 
looks like some rather then you take one
by<00:01:02.610> far<00:01:02.850> with<00:01:03.750> these<00:01:04.320> parts<00:01:04.799> sticking<00:01:05.489> out

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
by far with these parts sticking out

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.470 
by far with these parts sticking out
then<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.710> place<00:01:07.950> them<00:01:08.250> here<00:01:11.030> and<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.090> can

Lego<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:16.620> I<00:01:16.950> have<00:01:17.490> these<00:01:18.120> parts<00:01:18.600> which<00:01:19.170> will<00:01:19.380> do

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
Lego so I have these parts which will do

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:28.850

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
place that in the middle like that and

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.550 
place that in the middle like that and
then<00:03:44.720> if<00:03:45.720> you<00:03:46.410> want<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:46.770> build<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:47.069> trunk<00:03:47.370> now

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
then if you want to build the trunk now

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.559 
then if you want to build the trunk now
you<00:03:49.560> need<00:03:49.800> two<00:03:50.700> of<00:03:51.350> these<00:03:52.350> cones<00:03:53.180> cone<00:03:54.180> shaped

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
you need two of these cones cone shaped

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:01.250 
you need two of these cones cone shaped
rings<00:03:54.810> and<00:03:55.489> a<00:03:56.489> little<00:03:57.390> like<00:03:59.600> place<00:04:00.600> these<00:04:01.200> two

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
rings and a little like place these two

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
on top of each other and the claw thing

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:13.270 
on top of each other and the claw thing
right<00:04:10.160> then<00:04:11.160> you<00:04:11.340> place<00:04:11.730> this<00:04:12.030> in<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.570> middle

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
right then you place this in the middle

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:21.069 
right then you place this in the middle
yeah<00:04:14.360> so<00:04:15.360> the<00:04:15.480> trunk<00:04:17.120> and<00:04:19.340> you<00:04:20.340> will<00:04:20.489> need

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
yeah so the trunk and you will need

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:28.700 
yeah so the trunk and you will need
another<00:04:23.240> two<00:04:24.620> cones<00:04:25.620> like<00:04:26.430> that<00:04:26.640> and<00:04:27.710> some

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
another two cones like that and some

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:35.830 
another two cones like that and some
larger<00:04:29.370> glass<00:04:31.100> place<00:04:32.100> them<00:04:32.430> inside<00:04:34.190> sign<00:04:35.190> up

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
larger glass place them inside sign up

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.030 
larger glass place them inside sign up
that<00:04:36.840> one<00:04:37.050> same<00:04:38.300> you<00:04:39.300> play<00:04:39.510> says<00:04:39.840> it<00:04:40.530> either

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
that one same you play says it either

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:49.070 
that one same you play says it either
side<00:04:44.750> then<00:04:46.010> you<00:04:47.010> will<00:04:47.130> need<00:04:47.340> these<00:04:47.970> on<00:04:48.330> by<00:04:48.870> ones

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
side then you will need these on by ones

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:56.600 
side then you will need these on by ones
that<00:04:49.289> sloped<00:04:49.560> down<00:04:50.780> that<00:04:53.360> move<00:04:54.360> on<00:04:54.919> and<00:04:55.919> you

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
that sloped down that move on and you

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:02.450 
that sloped down that move on and you
place<00:04:56.880> them<00:04:57.180> here

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:09.320 

so<00:05:03.090> it<00:05:03.390> builds<00:05:03.630> Apple<00:05:06.560> then<00:05:07.560> if<00:05:08.220> you<00:05:09.090> have

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
so it builds Apple then if you have

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:15.440 
so it builds Apple then if you have
these<00:05:09.570> two<00:05:10.290> binocular<00:05:11.250> things<00:05:14.210> you<00:05:15.210> don't

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
these two binocular things you don't

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.020 
these two binocular things you don't
have<00:05:15.690> to<00:05:15.870> have<00:05:16.020> them<00:05:16.320> but<00:05:16.920> it<00:05:17.400> looks<00:05:17.670> better<00:05:17.910> if

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
have to have them but it looks better if

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.840 
have to have them but it looks better if
you<00:05:18.210> do<00:05:18.390> and<00:05:19.200> you<00:05:19.530> just<00:05:19.710> place<00:05:19.980> them<00:05:20.190> over<00:05:20.370> here

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
you do and you just place them over here

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:28.760 
you do and you just place them over here
for<00:05:22.640> the<00:05:23.640> legs<00:05:24.500> you<00:05:25.500> need<00:05:25.820> these<00:05:27.290> things<00:05:28.290> I

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
for the legs you need these things I

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.580 
for the legs you need these things I
don't<00:05:28.980> know<00:05:29.190> what<00:05:29.310> to<00:05:29.400> call<00:05:29.690> but<00:05:30.690> you<00:05:30.750> need<00:05:30.930> to
