know the bumper to bumper of the side
skirts<00:00:08.610> and<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:09.389> rear<00:00:09.540> bumpers<00:00:09.900> are<00:00:10.260> unique

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:10.849 
skirts and the rear bumpers are unique

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.360 
skirts and the rear bumpers are unique
with<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:11.940> headlights<00:00:12.269> me<00:00:13.019> they<00:00:13.920> are<00:00:14.040> unique

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
with the headlights me they are unique

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.269 
with the headlights me they are unique
in<00:00:14.490> that<00:00:14.549> we<00:00:14.790> have<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:15.030> LED<00:00:15.509> turn<00:00:16.379> signals<00:00:16.770> at

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
in that we have that LED turn signals at

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.890 
in that we have that LED turn signals at
the<00:00:17.520> bottom<00:00:17.789> there<00:00:17.970> so<00:00:18.240> it's<00:00:18.359> similar<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.750> what

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
the bottom there so it's similar to what

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.810 
the bottom there so it's similar to what
we<00:00:18.960> have<00:00:19.050> on<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.230> Gulf<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:20.160> we've<00:00:20.310> got<00:00:20.490> the

we have on the Gulf and we've got the

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.179 
we have on the Gulf and we've got the
xenon<00:00:21.270> standard<00:00:21.750> on<00:00:21.840> all<00:00:21.930> gun<00:00:22.170> fires<00:00:22.439> with<00:00:22.980> the

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
two cannon dr l three shapes on the Golf

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.669 
two cannon dr l three shapes on the Golf
R<00:00:26.640> that's<00:00:26.880> specific<00:00:27.599> about<00:00:27.810> fire<00:00:30.380> real<00:00:31.380> wise

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
R that's specific about fire real wise

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.910 
R that's specific about fire real wise
so<00:00:32.430> we'll<00:00:32.700> at<00:00:32.880> launch<00:00:33.120> will<00:00:33.360> have<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:34.350> cadiz

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
so we'll at launch will have the cadiz

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.520 
so we'll at launch will have the cadiz
so<00:00:35.340> those<00:00:35.520> are<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.730> 19th<00:00:36.210> will<00:00:36.750> be<00:00:36.899> 18<00:00:37.350> which

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
so those are the 19th will be 18 which

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:46.670 
so those are the 19th will be 18 which
would<00:00:37.649> be<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.829> standard<00:00:38.160> wheels<00:00:45.500> we<00:00:46.500> had<00:00:46.620> on

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
would be the standard wheels we had on

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.470 
would be the standard wheels we had on
the<00:00:46.770> previous<00:00:46.800> little<00:00:47.430> be<00:00:47.579> fickle<00:00:47.850> off<00:00:48.090> black

all<00:01:23.580> known<00:01:23.909> i<00:01:23.939> have<00:01:24.210> start/stop<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.080> we<00:01:25.170> won't

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
all known i have start/stop so we won't

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.100 
all known i have start/stop so we won't
have<00:01:25.470> start<00:01:25.740> stuff<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.220> US<00:01:26.460> cars<00:01:26.930> we<00:01:27.930> do

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
have start stuff on the US cars we do

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.730 
have start stuff on the US cars we do
get<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.579> electric<00:01:29.579> parking<00:01:29.759> brake<00:01:30.590> which<00:01:31.590> is

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
get that electric parking brake which is

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.469 
get that electric parking brake which is
different<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.640> golf<00:01:32.909> in<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.119> GTI

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
different to the to the golf in the GTI

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.960 
different to the to the golf in the GTI
these<00:01:34.409> all<00:01:34.590> have<00:01:34.619> two<00:01:34.829> big<00:01:35.009> screen<00:01:35.369> image

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
these all have two big screen image

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.200 
these all have two big screen image
snaps<00:01:36.270> think<00:01:37.110> most<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.439> them<00:01:37.560> do<00:01:38.060> we'll<00:01:39.060> have

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
snaps think most of them do we'll have

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.020 
snaps think most of them do we'll have
the<00:01:39.240> 5.8<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.049> we<00:01:40.140> have<00:01:40.290> on<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.470> GTI<00:01:40.799> we<00:01:41.520> get<00:01:42.000> a

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
the 5.8 that we have on the GTI we get a

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.249 
the 5.8 that we have on the GTI we get a
larger<00:01:42.479> screen<00:01:42.689> for<00:01:43.020> 16<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:44.869> for<00:01:45.869> launch<00:01:46.079> will

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
larger screen for 16 so for launch will

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.630 
larger screen for 16 so for launch will
have<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.530> one<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.070> guys<00:01:47.189> are<00:01:47.340> used<00:01:47.520> to

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
have the one that you guys are used to

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.899 
have the one that you guys are used to
seeing<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.090> Golf<00:01:48.299> GTI<00:01:49.460> LED<00:01:50.460> taillights

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
seeing in the Golf GTI LED taillights

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.539 
seeing in the Golf GTI LED taillights
will<00:01:51.720> have<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.200> standard<00:01:52.560> GTI<00:01:52.950> tail<00:01:53.280> lights

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
will have the standard GTI tail lights

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.399 
will have the standard GTI tail lights
at<00:01:54.270> launch<00:01:55.219> in<00:01:56.219> 16<00:01:56.670> believe<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.149> LEDs<00:01:57.420> or<00:01:57.450> no

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
at launch in 16 believe the LEDs or no

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.230 
at launch in 16 believe the LEDs or no
now<00:01:59.040> they'll<00:01:59.310> be<00:01:59.430> coming<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.729> little<00:01:59.820> bit<00:02:00.030> later

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
now they'll be coming a little bit later

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.300 
now they'll be coming a little bit later
so<00:02:00.840> unfortunately

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
so unfortunately

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.210 
so unfortunately
just<00:02:02.850> due<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.119> regulations<00:02:03.470> it<00:02:04.470> takes<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.799> lot<00:02:04.829> a

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
just due to regulations it takes a lot a

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.830 
just due to regulations it takes a lot a
lot<00:02:05.430> more<00:02:05.579> time<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.880> develop<00:02:06.090> these<00:02:06.360> these

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
lot more time to develop these these

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.620 
lot more time to develop these these
taillights<00:02:07.170> into<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.160> US<00:02:08.369> market<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:09.060> we<00:02:09.270> just

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
taillights into the US market so we just

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.920 
taillights into the US market so we just
keep<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.709> GTI<00:02:11.009> ones<00:02:11.280> for<00:02:11.489> now<00:02:14.569> the<00:02:15.569> only<00:02:15.720> other

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
keep the GTI ones for now the only other

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.780 
keep the GTI ones for now the only other
difference<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:16.680> we'll<00:02:17.190> have<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.489> fender
