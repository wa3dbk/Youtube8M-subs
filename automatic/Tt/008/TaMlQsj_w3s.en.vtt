00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
could go to one club when we could go to

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.630 
could go to one club when we could go to
the<00:02:41.989> different<00:02:42.319> clubs<00:02:42.560> and<00:02:42.860> then<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:43.489> would<00:02:43.610> be

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
the different clubs and then it would be

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.770 
the different clubs and then it would be
different<00:02:43.880> events<00:02:44.269> although<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:44.540> club's

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
could open do the same thing every day

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.460 
could open do the same thing every day
from<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:49.579> majority<00:02:49.880> of<00:02:49.940> our<00:02:50.030> lives<00:02:50.290> and<00:02:51.290> we're

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
from the majority of our lives and we're

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.490
