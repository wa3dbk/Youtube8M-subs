00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
that comes out it's already out um I

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.450 
that comes out it's already out um I
think<00:00:15.960> it's<00:00:16.049> horrible<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.890> whole<00:00:17.039> thing<00:00:17.279> with

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
think it's horrible the whole thing with

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.640 
think it's horrible the whole thing with
flip<00:00:17.730> they<00:00:17.910> should<00:00:18.180> have<00:00:18.270> made<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.289> better

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
flip they should have made a better

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.800 
flip they should have made a better
priced<00:00:20.010> camera<00:00:20.430> for<00:00:21.270> better<00:00:21.510> competition

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
priced camera for better competition

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.910 
priced camera for better competition
instead<00:00:22.769> they<00:00:23.660> you<00:00:24.660> know<00:00:24.689> went<00:00:25.320> through<00:00:25.590> and

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
instead they you know went through and

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.500 
instead they you know went through and
made<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:26.400> more<00:00:26.699> expensive<00:00:26.939> one<00:00:27.119> it's<00:00:27.390> right

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
made a more expensive one it's right

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.359 
made a more expensive one it's right
around<00:00:27.599> 250<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.590> say<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.740> think<00:00:28.830> it's<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.070> cue<00:00:29.220> to

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
around 250 to say I think it's a cue to

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.880 
around 250 to say I think it's a cue to
79<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.000> camera<00:00:30.330> itself<00:00:30.740> think<00:00:31.740> that's

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
79 to the camera itself think that's

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.380 
79 to the camera itself think that's
ridiculous<00:00:32.309> 300<00:00:32.640> hours<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:32.910> can<00:00:33.059> get<00:00:33.180> a

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
ridiculous 300 hours you can get a

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.990 
ridiculous 300 hours you can get a
camcorder<00:00:33.809> for<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.290> price<00:00:34.850> defeats<00:00:35.850> the

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
camcorder for that price defeats the

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.340 
camcorder for that price defeats the
purpose<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.420> having<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.719> pot<00:00:36.899> camcorder

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
purpose of having a pot camcorder

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.990 
purpose of having a pot camcorder
especially<00:00:37.710> they<00:00:37.800> made<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.040> bigger<00:00:38.250> with<00:00:38.879> the

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
especially they made it bigger with the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.330 
especially they made it bigger with the
slide-out<00:00:39.239> screen<00:00:39.710> seen<00:00:40.710> some<00:00:40.890> videos<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.309> it

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
slide-out screen seen some videos on it

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.540 
slide-out screen seen some videos on it
not<00:00:42.300> been<00:00:42.450> impressed<00:00:42.800> so<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:44.100> couple<00:00:44.250> weeks<00:00:44.430> ago
