know<00:01:47.979> what<00:01:48.159> this<00:01:48.340> guy<00:01:48.579> blew<00:01:48.850> up<00:01:48.969> so<00:01:49.149> fast<00:01:49.390> he

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
know what this guy blew up so fast he

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.590 
know what this guy blew up so fast he
can't<00:01:50.200> just<00:01:50.380> be<00:01:50.499> um<00:01:51.210> doing<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.299> same<00:01:52.420> thing

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
can't just be um doing the same thing

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.300 
can't just be um doing the same thing
about<00:01:52.630> us<00:01:52.810> is<00:01:52.990> doing<00:01:53.229> every<00:01:53.890> time<00:01:54.039> somebody

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
about us is doing every time somebody

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.370 
about us is doing every time somebody
makes<00:01:54.520> tremendous<00:01:54.700> progress<00:01:55.600> not<00:01:56.079> progress

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
makes tremendous progress not progress

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
combination of high intensity and how

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.620 
combination of high intensity and how
about<00:02:23.220> our<00:02:24.220> value<00:02:24.610> meaning<00:02:24.819> in<00:02:25.030> a<00:02:25.090> lot<00:02:25.270> of<00:02:25.390> sets

about our value meaning in a lot of sets
high<00:02:25.810> intensity<00:02:26.260> meaning<00:02:26.500> he<00:02:26.560> goes<00:02:26.710> beyond

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
high intensity meaning he goes beyond

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.800 
high intensity meaning he goes beyond
failure<00:02:27.460> uses<00:02:27.850> intensity<00:02:28.300> principles<00:02:28.720> like

giant said stuff like that and um so

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.280 
giant said stuff like that and um so
pretty<00:02:34.000> much<00:02:34.060> like<00:02:34.240> the<00:02:34.390> vegetable<00:02:34.840> world<00:02:34.870> so

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
pretty much like the vegetable world so

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.750 
pretty much like the vegetable world so
he's<00:02:35.440> lifting<00:02:35.770> heavy<00:02:35.980> enough<00:02:36.310> to<00:02:36.580> you<00:02:36.730> know
