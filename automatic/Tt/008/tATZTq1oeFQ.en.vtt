only torture kind of situation exactly

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.650

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
exactly it's like he whatever the reason

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.140 
exactly it's like he whatever the reason
was<00:02:24.840> behind<00:02:25.319> or<00:02:25.650> whatever<00:02:25.950> wrong<00:02:26.489> thing<00:02:26.940> Haute

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
which jurors can base a finding extreme

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.270 
which jurors can base a finding extreme
atrocity<00:02:45.239> or<00:02:45.690> cruelty<00:02:46.080> so<00:02:46.590> you<00:02:46.860> guys<00:02:46.980> remember

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
atrocity or cruelty so you guys remember

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.130 
atrocity or cruelty so you guys remember
that<00:02:47.459> that<00:02:47.760> you<00:02:47.940> know<00:02:48.060> other<00:02:48.450> are<00:02:48.720> as<00:02:48.900> the

that that you know other are as the

that that you know other are as the
Court<00:02:50.099> of<00:02:50.160> Appeals<00:02:50.489> they<00:02:50.880> give<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.120> lot<00:02:51.420> of

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
Court of Appeals they give a lot of

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.900 
Court of Appeals they give a lot of
leeway<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:52.049> the<00:02:52.410> jurors<00:02:52.680> findings<00:02:53.400> because

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
leeway to the jurors findings because

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.339 
leeway to the jurors findings because
they<00:02:54.299> didn't<00:02:54.569> sit<00:02:54.690> there<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:54.870> listen<00:02:54.989> to<00:02:55.140> all

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
they didn't sit there and listen to all

they didn't sit there and listen to all
the<00:02:55.500> facts<00:02:55.739> like<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.220> jurors<00:02:56.610> didn't<00:02:56.970> even

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
the facts like the jurors didn't even

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.160 
the facts like the jurors didn't even
kind<00:02:57.269> of<00:02:57.360> take<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.630> totality<00:02:58.140> of

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
kind of take the totality of

kind of take the totality of
circumstances<00:02:58.769> so<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.310> chance<00:02:59.579> of<00:02:59.910> him

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
circumstances so the chance of him

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.330 
circumstances so the chance of him
getting<00:03:00.450> reversed<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.470> in<00:03:01.590> Massachusetts<00:03:02.160> is

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
getting reversed and in Massachusetts is

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.979 
getting reversed and in Massachusetts is
a<00:03:02.370> very<00:03:02.610> small<00:03:02.940> percentage<00:03:03.390> of<00:03:03.510> cases<00:03:03.690> that

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
a very small percentage of cases that

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.319 
a very small percentage of cases that
gets<00:03:04.170> reversed<00:03:04.440> but<00:03:05.099> there<00:03:05.280> is<00:03:05.430> actually<00:03:05.819> a

gets reversed but there is actually a

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.150 
gets reversed but there is actually a
legitimate<00:03:06.720> basis<00:03:07.319> here<00:03:07.470> I<00:03:07.500> think<00:03:07.890> for<00:03:08.069> them

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
legitimate basis here I think for them

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.130 
legitimate basis here I think for them
to<00:03:08.310> argue<00:03:08.459> so<00:03:08.970> when<00:03:09.150> people<00:03:09.269> say<00:03:09.569> he<00:03:09.780> really

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
to argue so when people say he really

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.720 
to argue so when people say he really
has<00:03:10.260> no<00:03:10.290> appellate<00:03:10.739> grounds<00:03:11.250> I<00:03:11.370> think<00:03:11.610> there

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
has no appellate grounds I think there

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.789 
has no appellate grounds I think there
actually<00:03:11.849> is<00:03:12.180> one<00:03:12.420> now<00:03:12.630> whether<00:03:13.290> it<00:03:13.410> works<00:03:13.620> or

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
actually is one now whether it works or

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.920 
actually is one now whether it works or
not<00:03:13.860> is<00:03:14.130> a<00:03:14.160> whole<00:03:14.340> nother<00:03:14.489> issue<00:03:14.610> but<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.599> big

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
not is a whole nother issue but the big

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.559 
not is a whole nother issue but the big
thing<00:03:16.230> is<00:03:16.349> if<00:03:16.590> it<00:03:16.799> works<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:17.700> they<00:03:18.180> end<00:03:18.389> up

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
thing is if it works and they end up

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.090 
thing is if it works and they end up
wiping<00:03:18.930> out<00:03:19.079> the<00:03:19.200> first-degree<00:03:19.560> murder<00:03:19.680> he

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
wiping out the first-degree murder he

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.009 
wiping out the first-degree murder he
goes<00:03:20.310> from<00:03:20.549> being<00:03:20.760> in<00:03:20.970> prison<00:03:21.120> for<00:03:21.480> life

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
goes from being in prison for life

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.129 
goes from being in prison for life
-<00:03:22.470> now<00:03:22.650> being<00:03:23.069> it<00:03:24.060> could<00:03:24.299> be<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.480> second-degree

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
- now being it could be a second-degree

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:26.599 
- now being it could be a second-degree
murder<00:03:25.500> which<00:03:25.799> would<00:03:25.920> be<00:03:26.040> fifteen<00:03:26.459> to<00:03:26.579> life

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
murder which would be fifteen to life

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.280 
murder which would be fifteen to life
which<00:03:26.910> means<00:03:27.060> he<00:03:27.209> could<00:03:27.299> be<00:03:27.359> out<00:03:27.569> in<00:03:27.690> 15<00:03:27.810> years

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
which means he could be out in 15 years

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.550 
which means he could be out in 15 years
so<00:03:29.010> that's<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:29.340> huge<00:03:29.850> change<00:03:30.780> if<00:03:31.139> they<00:03:31.260> went<00:03:31.470> on

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
so that's a huge change if they went on

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.889 
so that's a huge change if they went on
that<00:03:31.680> issue
