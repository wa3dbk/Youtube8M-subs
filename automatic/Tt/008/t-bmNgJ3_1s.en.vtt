00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:11.639
 stretch shoes leather shoes suede 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:14.219
 uggs the fact is that not necessarily you 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.279
 let's say we bought new shoes and they 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.310
 too tight there is still such a winter 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.609
 a pack of shoes in the closet and then in the spring they 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.660
 too, as if tight, that is, here with all 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:31.520
 ways to stretch shoes 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:34.680
 new this which has been settled in his closet 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.020
 the first simplest one is all these ways 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.050
 who call everyone today and I them 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.340
 I tried it and for me at the end 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.320
 pyrider will say what is the most 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.739
 effective good means he 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.899
 can do can wear socks 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.910
 moisten them wear shoes on the foot and 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.670
 walk and walk rarely 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.350
 walk around the room 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.910
 2-3 days vodka wear daily 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.980
 walking around the room is the second way 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.439
 tasks you can take because you can shampoo 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.540
 and gel and liquid soap yes so here drip 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.020
 on foot well this leg maeda 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.229
 drip on the leg and moisten the leg and here in 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.020
 In this condition, the slippery leg is wet and 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.770
 with shampoo as it seems to be 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.530
 easy to enter 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.750
 so here too wet foot and so 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.780
 we also walk around the room around the apartment 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.939
 raznoshu them Toussaint then you can also 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.470
 so what else can you do 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:34.790
 take a newspaper moisten it with water and here 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.030
 so here with the cocoon complex this newspaper 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.030
 the answer is that 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.670
 important newspaper wet newspaper 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.479
 carry on like this 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:52.789
 plump fotik and let 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:55.700

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:56.600
 she lie down for two or three hours maybe 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.149
 even more 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.759
 shoe and foot at the driver will stretch 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:05.420
 We will look at the leg and we will 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:08.030
 shoes , what else can you wear 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.310
 complicate a rag any 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.930
 it's also putting tuff it is possible that 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.829
 make can take pure alcohol 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.459
 dilute with water in half and that too 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:22.610
 or with cotton or cloth to handle 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.650
 surface top bottom and put on shoes and 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.720
 in this form it can be worn 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.000
 point to line castor softens well 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.190
 skin and there and only the skin of the face on the skin 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.799

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.980
 simply or a new treat with castor 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:39.019
 or that or pour a drop of a drop from here 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.640
 lats so that if we say black 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.760
 carcasses are not scary white so that there is no 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:46.100
 stains yes just here in here 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.030
 pen and so lose it wear again 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:53.540
 on the leg and wear around the room 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:58.220
 how much can you day or two 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:01.500
 so we wear with castor oil so 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.360
 can be attributed to the shoe workshop and 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.260
 stretch there is a mechanical special 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.270
 stretch marks if with and special sprays 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.130
 I'm not talking about what we can 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.200
 do at home and what we can do in 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.209
 home conditions that's very much 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.060
 effective way to protect like 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.250
 The first way is hot as I call 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.230
 Well, I do not have such a teapot 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.239
 simple so I'll show you here on 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.370
 this teapot but if anyone has 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.880
 real tea which is put on 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.330
 slab 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.940
 water pours into the kettle 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:36.540
 boils and boils and here in 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.880
 through this spout comes you here goes 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.730
 good pars means what we do 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.900
 I take this shoe and so I bring to 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:48.860
 I hold this spout in my hands and 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:53.580
 I bring to this spout and pare pare 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:58.319
 getting inside it doesn't last long 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:01.260
 this minute and a half and it is very necessary 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:04.019
 hot type and immediately put on shoes on 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.660
 leg I still want to say it 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.760
 wonderful prevention and all if u 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.340
 someone smells unpleasant 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.239
 shoes where unpleasant unpleasant 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.239
 the smell of shoes 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.970
 then one and a half two minutes and a half two minutes 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.609
 again a half to two minutes before this 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.950
 absolutely no smell 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.470
 will be if fungal disease or what 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.430
 then something else it will all be killed that is 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.320
 it is also a little prevention is the fact that 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:34.560
 you see those hot with them 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:38.280

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.490
 leg stretch is hot 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:49.039
 there is a kettle 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:53.020
 steam is hot and the second way is very 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:54.590
 effective very effective it 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.160

 why did they stand by me a day 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:29.479
 because I thought the transfer to do yesterday 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:33.080

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:35.380

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:29.210
 the smell of the dough will kill all these 

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:32.530
 microbes and lousy bacteria which 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.530
