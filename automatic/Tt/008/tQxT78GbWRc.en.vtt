00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.120 
them to the front I retouched a couple
of<00:01:56.369> them<00:01:56.899> especially<00:01:57.899> around<00:01:58.229> my<00:01:58.470> hairline<00:01:58.649> so

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
of them especially around my hairline so

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
they can look a little neater but the

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.830 
they can look a little neater but the
back<00:02:01.979> ones<00:02:02.310> i<00:02:02.490> noticed<00:02:02.850> needed<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.240> be<00:02:03.360> braided

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
back ones i noticed needed to be braided

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.250 
back ones i noticed needed to be braided
because<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.740> was<00:02:04.890> slipping<00:02:05.220> out<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.369> lot<00:02:05.640> easier

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260
