00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.989 

my<00:00:01.270> vision<00:00:01.780> was<00:00:01.810> never<00:00:02.379> to<00:00:02.800> earn<00:00:03.340> money<00:00:03.610> a<00:00:03.820> lot

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:03.999 
my vision was never to earn money a lot

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:06.570 
my vision was never to earn money a lot
of<00:00:04.180> money<00:00:04.210> in<00:00:04.840> industry<00:00:05.710> so<00:00:06.010> I<00:00:06.040> was<00:00:06.430> really

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:06.580 
of money in industry so I was really

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.890 
of money in industry so I was really
always<00:00:07.060> interested<00:00:07.900> in<00:00:08.019> staying<00:00:08.950> into

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
always interested in staying into

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.180 
always interested in staying into
academics<00:00:10.900> are<00:00:11.110> going<00:00:11.530> in<00:00:11.620> direction<00:00:12.070> of

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:12.190 
academics are going in direction of

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:24.509 
academics are going in direction of
science<00:00:12.700> or<00:00:12.970> being<00:00:13.450> a<00:00:13.660> researcher<00:00:14.290> I<00:00:23.519> think

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:24.519 
science or being a researcher I think

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:26.909 
science or being a researcher I think
material<00:00:25.239> science<00:00:25.630> is<00:00:25.749> really<00:00:25.960> very<00:00:26.349> special

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:26.919 
material science is really very special

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.040 
material science is really very special
because<00:00:27.099> it's<00:00:27.550> so<00:00:27.819> broad<00:00:28.119> and<00:00:28.599> you<00:00:28.720> have<00:00:28.899> very

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
because it's so broad and you have very

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.960 
because it's so broad and you have very
interesting<00:00:29.679> phenomena<00:00:30.339> which<00:00:30.729> are

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
interesting phenomena which are

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.240 
interesting phenomena which are
interesting<00:00:31.599> in<00:00:31.720> context<00:00:32.200> of<00:00:32.380> and<00:00:32.619> mechanics

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:33.250 
interesting in context of and mechanics

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.790 
interesting in context of and mechanics
like<00:00:33.489> super<00:00:33.850> conductivity<00:00:34.379> so<00:00:35.379> you<00:00:35.440> learn<00:00:35.769> a

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
like super conductivity so you learn a

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.900 
like super conductivity so you learn a
lot<00:00:36.010> about<00:00:36.730> the<00:00:37.420> philosophy<00:00:37.859> also<00:00:38.859> on<00:00:39.489> the

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
lot about the philosophy also on the

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.549 
lot about the philosophy also on the
other<00:00:40.030> side<00:00:40.300> you<00:00:40.449> can<00:00:40.660> make<00:00:40.840> us<00:00:41.019> materials

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
other side you can make us materials

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.369 
other side you can make us materials
which<00:00:41.739> are<00:00:41.949> useful<00:00:42.219> for<00:00:42.760> society<00:00:43.719> to<00:00:43.750> check<00:00:44.170> us

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
which are useful for society to check us

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:46.770 
which are useful for society to check us
to<00:00:44.679> save<00:00:44.890> energy<00:00:45.210> thermoelectric<00:00:46.210> materials

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
to save energy thermoelectric materials

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.840 
to save energy thermoelectric materials
and<00:00:46.929> materials<00:00:47.350> also<00:00:47.530> lessens<00:00:48.100> the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.119 

interaction<00:00:54.850> with<00:00:54.879> the<00:00:55.829> company's<00:00:56.829> of<00:00:56.980> a

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
interaction with the company's of a

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:59.840 
interaction with the company's of a
strong<00:00:57.519> so<00:00:57.820> we<00:00:57.850> do<00:00:58.210> this<00:00:58.539> term<00:00:58.749> electric

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
strong so we do this term electric

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.829 
strong so we do this term electric
development<00:01:00.850> of<00:01:00.969> new<00:01:01.149> term<00:01:01.390> elective

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
development of new term elective

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.130 
development of new term elective
materials<00:01:02.260> with<00:01:02.609> Bosch<00:01:03.609> and<00:01:03.969> BASF<00:01:04.750> together

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
materials with Bosch and BASF together

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.190 
materials with Bosch and BASF together
for<00:01:05.470> example<00:01:05.980> or<00:01:06.190> solar<00:01:06.640> cells<00:01:07.000> IBM<00:01:07.630> and<00:01:07.900> chard

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
for example or solar cells IBM and chard

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.980 
for example or solar cells IBM and chard
so<00:01:08.800> we<00:01:09.040> do<00:01:09.220> research<00:01:09.940> together<00:01:10.300> so<00:01:10.780> it's

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
so we do research together so it's

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.480 
so we do research together so it's
constant<00:01:11.950> interaction<00:01:12.870> so<00:01:13.870> our<00:01:14.380> research<00:01:15.310> is

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
constant interaction so our research is

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.370 
constant interaction so our research is
also<00:01:15.820> inspired<00:01:16.240> by<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:16.600> ideas<00:01:17.080> of<00:01:17.110> the

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
also inspired by the ideas of the

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.510 
also inspired by the ideas of the
companies<00:01:17.860> and<00:01:18.130> our<00:01:19.380> ideas<00:01:20.380> also<00:01:20.620> influences

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
companies and our ideas also influences

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.360 
companies and our ideas also influences
the<00:01:21.700> company's<00:01:22.470> about<00:01:23.470> the<00:01:23.680> decision<00:01:24.190> in

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:24.370 
the company's about the decision in

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:31.649 
the company's about the decision in
future<00:01:24.790> for<00:01:25.200> future<00:01:26.200> directions

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.330 

so<00:01:32.659> the<00:01:32.869> really<00:01:33.439> nice<00:01:33.619> thing<00:01:33.860> of<00:01:34.040> the<00:01:34.159> credit

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
so the really nice thing of the credit

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.670 
so the really nice thing of the credit
school<00:01:34.850> is<00:01:35.119> bringing<00:01:35.600> people<00:01:35.960> from<00:01:35.990> heart<00:01:36.380> and

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
school is bringing people from heart and

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.639 
school is bringing people from heart and
soft<00:01:36.890> matter<00:01:37.130> together<00:01:37.580> and<00:01:38.229> to<00:01:39.229> learn<00:01:39.409> from

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
soft matter together and to learn from

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.010 
soft matter together and to learn from
each<00:01:39.860> other<00:01:40.189> and<00:01:40.340> also<00:01:40.909> to<00:01:41.030> work<00:01:41.240> just<00:01:41.720> at<00:01:41.869> the

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
each other and also to work just at the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.950 
each other and also to work just at the
interface<00:01:42.530> of<00:01:42.880> materials<00:01:43.880> which<00:01:44.240> have<00:01:44.270> a

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
interface of materials which have a

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.929 
interface of materials which have a
combination<00:01:45.289> of<00:01:45.710> soft<00:01:46.039> and<00:01:46.159> hard<00:01:46.280> metaboci

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
combination of soft and hard metaboci

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.139 
combination of soft and hard metaboci
are<00:01:47.330> really<00:01:47.750> needed<00:01:48.229> today<00:01:48.439> because

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
are really needed today because

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.490 
are really needed today because
materials<00:01:50.149> become<00:01:50.330> more<00:01:50.840> and<00:01:50.990> more<00:01:51.080> complex

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
materials become more and more complex

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.820 
materials become more and more complex
and<00:01:52.009> you<00:01:53.000> need<00:01:53.210> also<00:01:53.450> knowledge<00:01:54.170> from<00:01:54.439> both

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
and you need also knowledge from both

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.770 
and you need also knowledge from both
directions<00:01:55.039> or<00:01:55.670> also<00:01:55.970> for<00:01:56.149> the<00:01:56.240> students<00:01:56.659> to

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
directions or also for the students to

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:04.740 
directions or also for the students to
have<00:01:57.020> a<00:01:57.080> broad<00:01:57.979> education<00:01:58.399> is<00:01:59.360> very<00:01:59.630> important

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.070 

yes<00:02:05.750> fortunately<00:02:06.409> i'm<00:02:06.709> free<00:02:07.009> now<00:02:07.899> because<00:02:08.899> my

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
yes fortunately i'm free now because my

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.259 
yes fortunately i'm free now because my
daughter<00:02:09.140> is<00:02:09.500> 20<00:02:10.009> and<00:02:10.039> she's<00:02:10.489> now<00:02:10.700> in<00:02:10.759> berlin

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
daughter is 20 and she's now in berlin

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.940 
daughter is 20 and she's now in berlin
studying<00:02:12.400> some<00:02:13.400> engineering<00:02:14.110> and<00:02:15.110> in<00:02:15.799> the

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
studying some engineering and in the

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.740 
studying some engineering and in the
sense<00:02:16.220> it's<00:02:16.489> much<00:02:16.700> easier<00:02:16.730> now<00:02:17.299> than<00:02:17.330> it<00:02:17.720> was

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
sense it's much easier now than it was

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.949 
sense it's much easier now than it was
before<00:02:18.110> but<00:02:19.100> it's<00:02:19.280> a<00:02:19.519> little<00:02:20.150> bit<00:02:20.420> it's<00:02:20.600> really

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
before but it's a little bit it's really

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.190 
before but it's a little bit it's really
a<00:02:20.989> question<00:02:21.650> of<00:02:22.060> having<00:02:23.060> and<00:02:23.480> very<00:02:23.810> effective

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
a question of having and very effective

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.020 
a question of having and very effective
management<00:02:25.040> of<00:02:26.019> the<00:02:27.019> time<00:02:27.290> if<00:02:28.250> you<00:02:28.459> want<00:02:28.489> to<00:02:28.849> do

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
management of the time if you want to do

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.589 
management of the time if you want to do
both<00:02:29.239> science<00:02:30.019> and<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:30.680> having<00:02:31.130> a<00:02:31.610> child<00:02:32.360> for
