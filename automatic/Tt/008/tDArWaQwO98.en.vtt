00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.860
 hello to all of you on the life of 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.719
 find you in this new video 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.969
 to present you five ideas nayla 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.710
 to hide your scaly varnish so I 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.940
 you presented his ideas following the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.580
 size and where is the 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.470
 party and notebooks our dishes like you 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.180
 see it is very small gone on 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.740
 my free port so that's why 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.470
 I chose to make points to for 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.060
 fill this little hole so I'm laying a 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.560
 drop of black wine on the palette is 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.840
 then with youtube everything I want 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.489
 take some of the material and we 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.090
 as I told you I just fill 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.500
 the hole with this black polish is here 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.579
 I continued to do alone or type 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.860
 especially my fingernail 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.670
 so I try to make enough gaps 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.670
 regular 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.290
 so here as you see it's 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.910
 almost all my free edge that were 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.750
 stalled so that's why I decided to 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.460
 to make a fresco 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.500
 so in fact there I do not eat 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.350
 absolutely not my brush game there just 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.790
 we have to turn and kill ourselves to fill 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.790
 the small roads that I have my foot 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.479
 so there as you see it's still 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.520
 my free edge which was notebook except 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.270
 that he is a little bit more than the omb the 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.040
 former 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.020
 so here I cut four terminals of 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.180
 intel strips and I just married him 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.509
 horizontally each year on 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.509
 other 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.950
 and I will then use my nail polish 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.270
 black to fill the places where he 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.820
 there are no intel strips 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.980
 so here I do not use in last black 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.570
 as if I pose it is abnormally I 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.000
 come on I have it's only in fact of 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.800
 fill in the holes to prevent the 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.780
 varnish seeps under the stripping 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.110
 samurai taipei completely the 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.110
 pattern 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.240
 I will then remove the tapes from this 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:11.310
 pipeline tap one by one so I try 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.890
 to do it in the order in which I 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.030
 put them down to avoid 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.030
 problems to remove them 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.760
 and so then of course I can 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.800
 apply a rate cost as for the 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.890
 others but when I introduced you 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.720
 just before then there you will see that my 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.220
 polish is not only about the 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.760
 league bench but also a little bit about 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.260
 the plaque 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.210
 so that's why I decided to 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.950
 to do a pretty abstract mail art in 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.280
 cutting out strips of tape with 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.080
 sludges that are not similar 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.850
 so sometimes they are sharp and 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.490
 once they are rounded and I come but 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.350
 place them where my pink polish is 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.150
 still intact where there is no 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.250
 scales and so here again I 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.190
 unite to sting my black polish does not 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.959
 do not apply it as if I will apply 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.239
 a classic polish so I do not get there 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.630
 only where there is no 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.630
 Scotch 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.400
 and then I will retire even 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.400
 piece of tape 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:28.590
 so here as you see it's the 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.150
 right part of my uncle who was 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.859
 stalled so I'm going to come carved a 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.109
 piece of scotch and lay it in 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:39.209
 diagonal on the part still intact 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:41.400
 and I come then to use my 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.030
 black polish to fill the party and 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.030
 notebooks 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.080
 and I come then removed this piece of 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:52.819
 Scotch 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.680
 so here's this video is now 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.360
