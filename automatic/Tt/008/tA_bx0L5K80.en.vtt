00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.150
 hello nutritional counseling friends here 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.429
 I am with you this is the first of 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.530
 many videos that I plan to make we are 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.310
 here in my office and on this side 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:20.369
 We have a beautiful dish with its 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.439
 covered and is our our area for 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.130
 to be able to work and to design the 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.599
 ideal portions of the food my 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.220
 section swing and portion are I going to 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.230
 try to do it this way too 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.390
 a little more graphic that I hope that 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.850
 you like it and we are going to start then 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.610
 first because they are which are 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.410
 the food groups and in what 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.140
 nutriment they go to that is what they are going to 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.489
 contain of each nutriment but ok 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.770
 first let's start with the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.170
 entry carbohydrates here you can see 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.480
 back that I have a lot of 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.430
 fruits all these fruits are going to come in 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.620
 in the group of carbohydrates each 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.870
 one will come serving nothing if they are fixed 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.559
 here we have a piece of watermelon that 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.970
 we have an apple 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:08.850
 naranjita here we have this 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:12.210
 tangerine papaya half grapefruit 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.759
 it's a small mango a banana but 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.729
 all of these that this is part also of 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:20.750
 those of the material that I occupy in that 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.200
 I'm promoting what is the nutri kit 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.630
 will bring back when he has 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.810
 a piece of banana are practically 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.070
 22 servings of fruits or 2 servings 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.750
 of carbohydrates 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.969
 if we only eat half of it 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.280
 banana then we are talking about 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:39.530
 a carbohydrate how are we going to balance 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.869
 this banana for breakfast for 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.299
 example is many times we occupy it for 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:48.310
 put the cereal but hey let's 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:51.329
 take into account this I go to these 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.329
 we are going to save 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.710
 and I'm going to show you the way in which 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:59.100
 We will use this medium banana 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.530
 how to balance 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.689
 suppose we are occupying the 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.259
 more Christmas although here we see it 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.259
 full 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.599
 and we are going to balance it 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.609
 hello we are going to think that we have this 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.370
 portion is half a cup of sealing this 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:20.530
 would also be a carbohydrate and 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.180
 let's think that I am 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.859
 allowing you to eat carbohydrates by 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.480
 food that is the most that you 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:29.200
 they must be eating in each of their 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:33.790
 meals then we have half cup with 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.760
 half banana ok here I was already all 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.819
 my amount of carbohydrates available 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.540
 for this meal nothing else now this 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.540
 I'm going to balance 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.000
 with some protein that would be 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.490
 milk here we are going to occupy the milk the 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.720
 milk is going to have a lot of 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.000
 protein and lots of 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.520
 carbohydrates then if we have to 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.260
 take into account the two groups namely 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.580
 let's say it would be a group of protein and 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.220
 a group of carbohydrates 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.860
 but take me all my 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.660
 carbohydrates here in this case does not pass 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.640
 nothing in itself comes balanced 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.990
 we can occupy a little bit more all 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.660
 let's take it into account as nothing else 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.660
 protein enters' my the protein 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.840
 and every time we take a 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.959
 carbohydrate we have to balance 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.180
 with a protein then if I have already 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.489
 two carbohydrates I need two proteins 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.560
 and here he only took one what would be the 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.689
 better way to include a little bit here 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.310
 more than protein and I what normally 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:46.019
 I give you this another wild card as well 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.640
 I mean you can have the same amount of 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.680
 protein and carbohydrates we can 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.959
 occupy as either well 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.370
 like dairy products and legumes that 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.659
 They contain carbohydrates and protein 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.049
 there are also others that are 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:04:01.770
 oilseeds are going to contain 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:05.370
 protein and fat then let's look 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:07.410
 of thanks I do not have as such no 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.390
 essential while in these models but 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.880
 let's assume that this would be six 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.120
 months study here I'm going to mix it 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:18.390
 then I have my cereal with my banana 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:21.450
 the carbohydrate and the protein would be the 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:24.480
 milk and nuts then if you 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.400
 they set this would be a a breakfast 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.760
 balanced these would be the portions 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.610
 ideals of this breakfast and I hope that 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.140
 it worked for them to tell me if 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.450
 they like that I'm driving it from this 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.640
 way we're going to try a lot of good 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.620
 combinations and options for them 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.150
 become clearer and maybe this will 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.730
 be a good way to handle this 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.670
 section that is very well I say goodbye 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:50.120
 this moment and we continue to see that 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.120
 be very good
