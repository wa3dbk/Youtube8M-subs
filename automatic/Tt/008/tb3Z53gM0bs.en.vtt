00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello I have had with you today 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.540
 about a new brand called verona 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.910
 and kenneth of mine who set it up 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.460
 with a few other people and always 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.820
 brand sells is this giant hot watches 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.529
 also blow at verona and so is fun with 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.570
 these watches have that chance themselves 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.039
 designs in webshop I also have two 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.060
 watches that I designed today 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.310
 show you 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.810
 i will finish my favorite i would 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.939
 first of all I have this watch and he 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.830
 is in the color sky blue has a 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.480
 white clock in the middle which is handy 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.700
 to this release that it is my band from 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.020
 silicone watches with such straps and 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.840
 of course super nice but always stand 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.670
 run for me i always go something 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.649
 so these are actually missing silicone 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.690
 very handy band he is this 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.910
 so the first as you see is super 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.739
 simple but that is what i want for 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.930
 this watch came in a can 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.190
 I also really liked it so get it 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.780
 cool packaging 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.579
 and my second watch that is actually 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.430
 much nicer delicious in it 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.829
 in the middle opted for a disney print 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.909
 it is my favorite mint color anyway 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:10.409
 color and if you look closely you see 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:11.970
 not in scope, there is minimal it can 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.580
 but the still nice turned out to be you and 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.080
 disney can 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.880
 I think it's a nice concept because of you 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.259
 chance the site may yourself can you 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.360
 you can choose a package 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.130
 yes choose the clock in the middle 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.140
 making you countless of course altogether 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.670
 to your style 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.100
 here you see the shop and here you see 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.229
 also how you can choose your own band and 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.060
 the clock yourself you can choose the size or 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.430
 A gift is also a can 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.189
 some inspiration watching others bob 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.229
 if you like design so much you can 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.360
 it also share via the share function 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.680
 by boxes there are 25 euros for sale 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.960
 just had to share it with you because it 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.700
 something new and yes I think 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.590
 especially this very nice he really stands 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.750
 super cute sheets is black hair just like 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.299
 what is cool is that you turn the clock 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.579
 band channels the suppose your band likes you 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.350
 really not at all with an outfit from 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.729
 smart clocks you can do one like that 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.619
 switch between the different ones 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.960
 watches that so I'd say take one 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.180
 look at www.funda.nl 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.890
 I'm gone again this was my tip 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.229
 day 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.910
 yes let me know how your watch looks like 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.580
 would see if 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.170
 would be allowed to design one completely 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.180
 I'm very curious about that, okay 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.260
 that it was a look over and over 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.410
 next time 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.410
