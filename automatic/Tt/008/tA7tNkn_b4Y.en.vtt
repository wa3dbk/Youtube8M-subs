00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.100
 very dangerous moment now we are seeing 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.250
 goes the evacuation of white viburnum from 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.200
 Ulyanovsk region any seconds snow 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.160
 may fall under the weight 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:28.070
 car and evacuation will not work at 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.149
 us car can fall on watt 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.829
 roll over now risks not 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.950
 only your car and your 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.239
 health 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:42.769
 the owner of the tow truck felt 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:45.260
 professional and here's the car is almost tightened 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:47.570
 on the pallet almost tightened on something 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.989
 went not quite on the script yes yes yes 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:56.210
 height difference friends height difference 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:59.379
 20 centimeters will it all work out to us 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.379
 It remains a little to generate 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.300
 about to wheel the wheel evacuator 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.750
 all the same it turned out interesting 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.060
 how much did the driver pay for this rut 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.280
 tow truck driver 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.979
 This is not a standard procedure for 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.050
 tow truck of non-standard perhaps 

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.050
 our city has not been this 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.540
 literally centimeter by millimeter 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.110
 cars pulled out here it stretches 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.150
 stretches 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.670
 This is an unusual design tow truck 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.890
 by the way he would be so modernized 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:44.140
 said if in different planes 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:48.700
 rotates this bottom and you well 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:51.430
 the machine can be considered state-owned but so it 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.979
 subaru lobby stood a car about such 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.660
 serious snowdrift here is the same 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:01.050
 car costs I don't know how it will be 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.050
 move out probably k-bet for a breakthrough 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.820
 So it goes
