00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.679 
there are some other terms that may seem
quite<00:01:17.009> confusing<00:01:17.430> such<00:01:17.700> as<00:01:17.820> aperture<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.509> ISO

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
quite confusing such as aperture and ISO

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.840 
quite confusing such as aperture and ISO
so<00:01:19.500> let's<00:01:19.680> just<00:01:19.860> jump<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.189> with<00:01:20.280> aperture<00:01:20.549> and

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
so let's just jump in with aperture and

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.160 
so let's just jump in with aperture and
I'll<00:01:20.909> explain<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.540> word<00:01:21.570> aperture

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
I'll explain that the word aperture

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.960 
I'll explain that the word aperture
literally<00:01:22.680> means<00:01:22.860> hole<00:01:23.130> or<00:01:23.340> opening<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.850> that

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
literally means hole or opening and that

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.219 
literally means hole or opening and that
is<00:01:24.060> exactly<00:01:24.210> what<00:01:24.659> we<00:01:24.750> mean<00:01:24.900> when<00:01:25.080> we<00:01:25.200> talk

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
is exactly what we mean when we talk

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.960 
is exactly what we mean when we talk
about<00:01:25.409> aperture<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:26.070> terms<00:01:26.280> of<00:01:26.460> cameras<00:01:26.820> and

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
about aperture in terms of cameras and

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.700 
about aperture in terms of cameras and
lenses<00:01:27.119> we<00:01:27.450> mean<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.750> size<00:01:28.020> of<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.290> hole<00:01:28.439> in

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
lenses we mean the size of the hole in

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.440 
lenses we mean the size of the hole in
the<00:01:28.829> lens<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.430> allows<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.909> light<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.150> come

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
the lens that allows the light to come

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.910 
the lens that allows the light to come
through<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.930> obviously<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.590> bigger<00:01:31.799> the

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
through and obviously the bigger the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.530 
through and obviously the bigger the
hole<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.280> more<00:01:32.430> light<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.729> can<00:01:33.060> get<00:01:33.240> into

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
hole the more light you can get into

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.730 
hole the more light you can get into
your<00:01:33.689> camera<00:01:33.900> on<00:01:34.110> your<00:01:34.259> camera<00:01:34.590> you've

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
your camera on your camera you've

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.080 
your camera on your camera you've
probably<00:01:34.890> noticed<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.430> value<00:01:35.700> called<00:01:35.970> the

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
probably noticed a value called the

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.330 
probably noticed a value called the
f-stop<00:01:36.600> value<00:01:37.020> now<00:01:37.409> basically<00:01:38.100> you're<00:01:38.220> going

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
f-stop value now basically you're going

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.679 
f-stop value now basically you're going
to<00:01:38.400> want<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:38.579> number<00:01:38.970> as<00:01:39.119> low<00:01:39.420> as<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.659> can

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
to want that number as low as you can

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.300 
to want that number as low as you can
because<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.290> means<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.710> aperture<00:01:41.159> is

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
because that means the aperture is

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.980 
because that means the aperture is
bigger<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.880> now<00:01:41.970> it's<00:01:42.119> quite<00:01:42.299> confusing<00:01:42.450> that

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
bigger and now it's quite confusing that

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.840 
bigger and now it's quite confusing that
you<00:01:43.200> know<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.350> low<00:01:43.560> number<00:01:43.770> means<00:01:44.130> bigger<00:01:44.549> but

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
you know a low number means bigger but

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.249 
you know a low number means bigger but
just<00:01:45.360> go<00:01:45.450> with<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.630> when<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.840> have<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.020> low

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
just go with it when you have a low

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.690 
just go with it when you have a low
f-stop<00:01:46.740> value<00:01:47.009> that's<00:01:47.220> when<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.460> get<00:01:47.610> the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
f-stop value that's when you get the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.460 
f-stop value that's when you get the
cool<00:01:47.909> focus<00:01:48.450> thing<00:01:48.689> when<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.930> get<00:01:49.079> things<00:01:49.350> in

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
cool focus thing when you get things in

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.990 
cool focus thing when you get things in
the<00:01:49.530> foreground<00:01:49.829> being<00:01:50.070> really<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.610> focus<00:01:50.909> and

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
the foreground being really in focus and

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.219 
the foreground being really in focus and
things<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.329> background<00:01:51.509> looking<00:01:51.930> really

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
things in the background looking really

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.200 
things in the background looking really
blurry<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:53.009> just<00:01:53.159> looks<00:01:53.369> really<00:01:53.670> nice<00:01:53.820> now

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
blurry and it just looks really nice now

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.730 
blurry and it just looks really nice now
along<00:01:54.540> with<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.750> f-stop<00:01:55.049> there<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.320> also<00:01:55.500> the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
along with the f-stop there is also the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.770 
along with the f-stop there is also the
ISO<00:01:56.189> which<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.670> light<00:01:56.909> sensitivity<00:01:57.450> of

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
ISO which is the light sensitivity of

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.810 
ISO which is the light sensitivity of
the<00:01:57.869> camera<00:01:58.170> lower<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.649> ISO<00:01:59.100> value<00:01:59.520> then<00:01:59.700> the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
the camera lower the ISO value then the

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.249 
the camera lower the ISO value then the
higher<00:02:00.060> quality<00:02:00.630> image<00:02:00.930> you're<00:02:01.079> going<00:02:01.110> to

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
higher quality image you're going to

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.899 
higher quality image you're going to
have<00:02:01.409> but<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.829> also<00:02:02.009> means<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.430> image<00:02:02.790> is

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
have but it also means the image is

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.580 
have but it also means the image is
going<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.090> be<00:02:03.180> slightly<00:02:03.570> dark<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.259> have<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.500> be

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
going to be slightly dark and have to be

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.410 
going to be slightly dark and have to be
very<00:02:04.799> careful<00:02:05.280> it's<00:02:05.430> all<00:02:05.579> about<00:02:05.759> experiment

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
very careful it's all about experiment

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.479 
very careful it's all about experiment
and<00:02:06.630> make<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.229> ISO<00:02:07.680> value<00:02:08.009> suit<00:02:08.340> the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
and make the ISO value suit the

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.830 
and make the ISO value suit the
surroundings<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.149> you're<00:02:09.270> filming<00:02:09.569> in

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
surroundings that you're filming in

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.270 
surroundings that you're filming in
having<00:02:10.110> said<00:02:10.319> that<00:02:10.349> I<00:02:10.500> normally<00:02:10.679> just<00:02:11.039> keep

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
having said that I normally just keep

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.979 
having said that I normally just keep
her<00:02:11.400> an<00:02:11.489> auto<00:02:11.670> because<00:02:12.030> most<00:02:12.300> DSLRs<00:02:12.870> are

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
her an auto because most DSLRs are

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.580 
her an auto because most DSLRs are
pretty<00:02:13.260> good

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
pretty good

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.229 
pretty good
guessing<00:02:13.950> where<00:02:14.129> the<00:02:14.280> ISO<00:02:14.610> should<00:02:14.819> be<00:02:14.970> now<00:02:15.180> the

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
guessing where the ISO should be now the

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.460 
guessing where the ISO should be now the
next<00:02:15.540> thing<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:15.750> want<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:15.959> talk<00:02:16.140> about<00:02:16.260> is

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
next thing I want to talk about is

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.259 
next thing I want to talk about is
lenses<00:02:17.129> now<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.430> lot<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.819> these<00:02:17.879> review<00:02:18.239> videos

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
lenses now a lot of these review videos

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.089 
lenses now a lot of these review videos
online<00:02:18.870> they<00:02:19.080> use<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.379> best<00:02:19.590> lenses<00:02:19.830> that

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
online they use the best lenses that

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.680 
online they use the best lenses that
money<00:02:20.280> can<00:02:20.489> buy<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.940> they're<00:02:21.060> thousands<00:02:21.629> of

money can buy and they're thousands of

money can buy and they're thousands of
pounds<00:02:21.900> but<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.890> first<00:02:23.220> lens<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.610> everyone

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
pounds but the first lens that everyone

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.089 
pounds but the first lens that everyone
should<00:02:24.090> buy<00:02:24.269> is<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.810> kit<00:02:25.050> lens<00:02:25.200> kit<00:02:25.560> lenses<00:02:25.950> get

should buy is a kit lens kit lenses get

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.339 
should buy is a kit lens kit lenses get
quite<00:02:26.400> a<00:02:26.430> lot<00:02:26.610> of<00:02:26.730> bad<00:02:26.879> rep<00:02:27.150> but<00:02:27.540> if<00:02:27.840> this<00:02:28.230> is

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
quite a lot of bad rep but if this is

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:29.990 
quite a lot of bad rep but if this is
your<00:02:28.470> first<00:02:28.739> DSLR<00:02:29.010> then<00:02:29.459> you're<00:02:29.610> not<00:02:29.790> even

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
your first DSLR then you're not even

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.369 
your first DSLR then you're not even
going<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.180> notice<00:02:30.299> the<00:02:30.599> difference<00:02:30.629> between<00:02:31.170> a

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
going to notice the difference between a

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.229 
going to notice the difference between a
kit<00:02:31.620> lens<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:32.069> a<00:02:32.129> thousand-pound<00:02:32.640> lens<00:02:32.940> for

just<00:02:34.650> fine<00:02:34.920> I'm<00:02:35.430> using<00:02:35.849> the<00:02:36.090> 18<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.599> 55

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
be honest it doesn't really matter it's

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.680 
be honest it doesn't really matter it's
all<00:02:41.040> about<00:02:41.250> experiment<00:02:41.910> but<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.150> is<00:02:42.239> important

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
all about experiment but it is important

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.940 
all about experiment but it is important
to<00:02:42.720> know<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.110> quality<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:43.530> entirely

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
to know that the quality is entirely

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.250 
to know that the quality is entirely
down<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.430> lens<00:02:44.610> you<00:02:44.700> could<00:02:44.970> have<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.420> 5

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
down to the lens you could have a 5

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.710 
down to the lens you could have a 5
grand<00:02:46.620> camera<00:02:47.370> but<00:02:47.579> if<00:02:47.670> your<00:02:47.819> lens<00:02:48.120> is<00:02:48.510> only

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
grand camera but if your lens is only

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.750 
grand camera but if your lens is only
worth<00:02:48.930> 20<00:02:49.349> pounds<00:02:49.709> then<00:02:49.890> it's<00:02:50.099> probably<00:02:50.340> not

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
worth 20 pounds then it's probably not

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.160 
worth 20 pounds then it's probably not

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
going to look good you just have to

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.860 
going to look good you just have to
experiment<00:02:59.640> with<00:03:00.000> what<00:03:00.180> you've<00:03:00.299> got<00:03:00.480> and<00:03:00.629> that

experiment with what you've got and that

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.270 
experiment with what you've got and that
brings<00:03:01.079> me<00:03:01.140> nicely<00:03:01.590> onto<00:03:01.769> the<00:03:01.980> next<00:03:02.129> point

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
brings me nicely onto the next point

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.009 
brings me nicely onto the next point
which<00:03:02.519> is<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.940> content<00:03:03.420> of<00:03:03.480> your<00:03:03.540> video<00:03:03.720> it
