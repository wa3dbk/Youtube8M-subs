00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.150 
the place here we've used them for four

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.270 
the place here we've used them for four
years<00:00:55.390> one<00:00:55.930> of<00:00:55.960> the<00:00:56.079> types<00:00:56.410> of<00:00:56.590> knives<00:00:56.800> you

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
years one of the types of knives you

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.500 
years one of the types of knives you
know<00:00:57.310> other<00:00:57.520> than<00:00:57.640> pocketknife<00:00:58.150> that<00:00:58.450> of

know other than pocketknife that of

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.139 
know other than pocketknife that of
course<00:00:58.660> is<00:00:58.870> the<00:00:58.900> most<00:00:59.140> useful<00:00:59.470> tool<00:01:00.250> going<00:01:00.880> I

course is the most useful tool going I

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.040 
course is the most useful tool going I
guess<00:01:01.390> that<00:01:01.960> most<00:01:02.200> of<00:01:02.410> us<00:01:02.530> that<00:01:02.770> are<00:01:03.040> not<00:01:03.430> too

organized in a city fight use probably

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.460

every<00:01:07.600> hour<00:01:08.170> on<00:01:08.470> something<00:01:09.130> but<00:01:09.729> a<00:01:10.210> knife<00:01:11.200> with

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
a little size to it is really handy if

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.780 
a little size to it is really handy if
you<00:01:13.930> have<00:01:13.960> a<00:01:14.140> placing<00:01:14.740> of<00:01:14.860> trails<00:01:15.190> you're<00:01:15.520> kind

really to kill them just get some of the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.110 
really to kill them just get some of the
throat<00:02:33.110> off<00:02:33.320> of<00:02:33.560> them<00:02:33.710> but<00:02:33.890> that<00:02:34.730> once<00:02:34.940> they

get leads on on them these on some of

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.700 
get leads on on them these on some of
this<00:02:37.580> growth<00:02:37.910> it's<00:02:38.840> exaggerated

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
this growth it's exaggerated

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.790 
this growth it's exaggerated
by<00:02:40.130> tenfold<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:41.780> you<00:02:41.960> can<00:02:42.230> see<00:02:42.560> where<00:02:42.710> you're

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
by tenfold and you can see where you're

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.790 
by tenfold and you can see where you're
going<00:02:45.070> as<00:02:46.070> those<00:02:46.370> we<00:02:46.520> move<00:02:46.670> on<00:02:46.820> through<00:02:46.850> here

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
going as those we move on through here

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.070 
going as those we move on through here
looks<00:02:48.800> like<00:02:49.040> it'll<00:02:49.940> drive<00:02:50.210> right<00:02:50.480> here<00:02:51.050> I

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
looks like it'll drive right here I

00:02:51.080 --> 00:03:06.540 
looks like it'll drive right here I
think<00:02:56.170> won't<00:02:57.170> be<00:02:57.260> able<00:02:57.380> to<00:02:57.440> walk<00:02:57.650> with<00:02:57.710> you<00:02:58.160> -<00:02:58.430> I

don't like to actually kill most of the
trees<00:03:09.590> I<00:03:09.710> there's<00:03:09.950> a<00:03:10.040> tree<00:03:10.340> that's<00:03:10.580> really<00:03:10.880> in

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
trees I there's a tree that's really in

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.540 
trees I there's a tree that's really in
the<00:03:11.180> way<00:03:11.390> so<00:03:11.780> what<00:03:11.930> we<00:03:12.050> have<00:03:12.200> in<00:03:12.320> mind<00:03:12.550> I'll

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
the way so what we have in mind I'll

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.700 
the way so what we have in mind I'll
take<00:03:13.730> it<00:03:13.880> out<00:03:14.030> I'm<00:03:14.300> not<00:03:14.540> too<00:03:14.810> shy<00:03:15.230> about<00:03:15.380> that

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
take it out I'm not too shy about that

take it out I'm not too shy about that
we<00:03:16.340> have<00:03:16.660> you<00:03:17.660> know<00:03:17.750> so<00:03:17.930> many<00:03:17.990> trees<00:03:18.500> and<00:03:18.830> I've

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
we have you know so many trees and I've

we have you know so many trees and I've
let<00:03:19.220> probably<00:03:19.820> 15<00:03:20.090> to<00:03:20.180> 20<00:03:20.450> acres<00:03:20.570> that<00:03:20.990> had

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
let probably 15 to 20 acres that had

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.580 
let probably 15 to 20 acres that had
been<00:03:21.710> mowed<00:03:22.580> for<00:03:23.030> hey<00:03:23.210> I'd<00:03:23.810> let<00:03:24.050> it<00:03:24.170> grow<00:03:24.320> up<00:03:24.470> in

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
been mowed for hey I'd let it grow up in

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.420 
been mowed for hey I'd let it grow up in
the<00:03:24.709> woods<00:03:24.920> and<00:03:25.900> over<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:26.990> last<00:03:27.140> 25<00:03:27.800> years<00:03:27.830> so

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
the woods and over the last 25 years so

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.690 
the woods and over the last 25 years so
we've<00:03:28.640> created<00:03:28.820> a<00:03:29.360> really<00:03:29.930> nice<00:03:30.370> area<00:03:31.370> of

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
we've created a really nice area of

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.310 
we've created a really nice area of
wooded<00:03:32.090> this<00:03:32.240> was<00:03:32.420> always<00:03:32.630> woods<00:03:32.959> right<00:03:33.110> here

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
wooded this was always woods right here

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.670 
wooded this was always woods right here
but<00:03:33.500> we've<00:03:34.160> increased<00:03:34.580> that<00:03:34.670> by<00:03:35.480> oh<00:03:35.720> well<00:03:36.290> 15

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
but we've increased that by oh well 15

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.780 
but we've increased that by oh well 15
20<00:03:36.950> acres<00:03:37.570> so<00:03:38.570> yeah<00:03:38.690> we<00:03:38.840> do<00:03:38.990> manage<00:03:39.260> it<00:03:39.590> uh<00:03:39.950> one

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
we're at just kind of hacking around

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.260 
we're at just kind of hacking around
with<00:03:51.800> it<00:03:51.950> I<00:03:52.070> picked<00:03:52.310> this<00:03:52.430> thing<00:03:52.640> up<00:03:52.820> at<00:03:53.030> a<00:03:53.060> gun

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
with it I picked this thing up at a gun

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.960 
with it I picked this thing up at a gun
show<00:03:53.450> recently<00:03:54.200> in<00:03:54.350> fact<00:03:54.500> last<00:03:54.830> weekend<00:03:55.340> and<00:03:55.730> I

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
show recently in fact last weekend and I

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.390 
show recently in fact last weekend and I
just<00:03:56.230> wanted<00:03:57.230> to<00:03:57.320> get<00:03:57.440> out<00:03:57.560> and<00:03:57.590> try<00:03:58.160> it<00:03:58.220> out

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 
just wanted to get out and try it out

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.250 
just wanted to get out and try it out
because<00:03:58.640> it's<00:03:58.880> exactly<00:03:59.420> the<00:03:59.630> kind<00:03:59.810> of<00:03:59.870> knife<00:04:00.050> I

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
because it's exactly the kind of knife I

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.980 
because it's exactly the kind of knife I
like<00:04:00.530> in<00:04:01.430> a<00:04:01.550> perfect<00:04:01.760> size<00:04:02.120> for<00:04:02.150> this<00:04:02.720> sort<00:04:02.930> of

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
like in a perfect size for this sort of

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.350 
like in a perfect size for this sort of
hacking<00:04:03.440> and<00:04:04.070> it<00:04:04.220> just<00:04:04.370> so<00:04:04.459> happens<00:04:04.790> this<00:04:05.120> is

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
hacking and it just so happens this is

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:08.199 
hacking and it just so happens this is
an<00:04:05.480> old<00:04:05.660> Camillus<00:04:06.530> cutlery<00:04:06.920> as<00:04:07.760> I<00:04:07.880> understand
