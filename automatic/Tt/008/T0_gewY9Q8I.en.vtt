hi<00:00:17.730> I'm<00:00:17.940> Kenny<00:00:18.270> for<00:00:18.539> mini<00:00:18.690> bowl<00:00:18.900> design<00:00:19.260> and

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
hi I'm Kenny for mini bowl design and

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.870 
hi I'm Kenny for mini bowl design and
this<00:00:19.949> morning<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.460> went<00:00:20.640> out<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:22.670> finished<00:00:23.670> up

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
this morning I went out and finished up

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.019 
this morning I went out and finished up
the<00:00:24.119> electric<00:00:24.840> trike<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.859> took<00:00:26.760> her<00:00:26.849> out<00:00:27.000> for

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
the electric trike and took her out for

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.189 
the electric trike and took her out for
a<00:00:27.240> test<00:00:27.539> run<00:00:27.779> now<00:00:29.510> it<00:00:30.510> turned<00:00:30.779> out<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.990> lot

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
a test run now it turned out a lot

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.740 
a test run now it turned out a lot
better<00:00:31.410> than<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:31.980> thought<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.250> would<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.880> I've

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
better than I thought it would and I've

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.780 
better than I thought it would and I've
been<00:00:33.960> running<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.530> this<00:00:34.710> morning<00:00:35.130> I've<00:00:35.280> got<00:00:35.489> 10

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
been running it this morning I've got 10

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.250 
been running it this morning I've got 10
miles<00:00:36.059> on<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:38.000> the<00:00:39.000> mile<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.690> voltage

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
miles on it and the mile it the voltage

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.940 
miles on it and the mile it the voltage
when<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.559> started<00:00:41.100> out<00:00:41.280> was<00:00:44.660> 53<00:00:45.660> volts<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.739> has

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
when I started out was 53 volts it has

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.069 
when I started out was 53 volts it has
gel<00:00:47.250> sell<00:00:47.489> their<00:00:47.730> about<00:00:47.910> full<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.270> 13<00:00:48.690> bulky

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
gel sell their about full the 13 bulky

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.520 
gel sell their about full the 13 bulky
piece<00:00:49.320> I've<00:00:50.100> got<00:00:50.399> 4<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.239> series<00:00:51.539> on<00:00:52.050> each<00:00:52.230> side

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
piece I've got 4 in series on each side

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.670 
piece I've got 4 in series on each side
and<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:53.010> those<00:00:53.699> are<00:00:53.730> wired<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.390> parallel<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:55.199> I

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
and and those are wired in parallel so I

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.500 
and and those are wired in parallel so I
had<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.039> working<00:00:56.250> voltage<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.910> about<00:00:56.969> fifty

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
had a working voltage of about fifty

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.599 
had a working voltage of about fifty
three<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.079> half<00:00:58.109> when<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.559> started<00:00:59.039> I've

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
three and a half when I started I've

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.540 
three and a half when I started I've
driven<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.090> ten<00:01:00.329> miles<00:01:00.800> up<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.010> down<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.340> road

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
driven it ten miles up and down the road

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.380 
driven it ten miles up and down the road
and<00:01:02.820> right<00:01:03.270> now<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.539> voltage<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.379> at<00:01:04.610> 50.4<00:01:05.610> so

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
and right now the voltage is at 50.4 so

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.609 
and right now the voltage is at 50.4 so
it<00:01:06.479> hasn't<00:01:06.659> even<00:01:06.840> dropped<00:01:07.200> down<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.409> the

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
it hasn't even dropped down to the

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.280 
it hasn't even dropped down to the
working<00:01:07.799> voltage<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.430> 48<00:01:08.909> yet<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.110> don't

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
working voltage of 48 yet so I don't

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.289 
working voltage of 48 yet so I don't
know<00:01:10.710> how<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.250> going<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.610> play<00:01:11.790> out<00:01:11.880> but

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
know how this is going to play out but

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.800 
know how this is going to play out but
it<00:01:12.450> looks<00:01:12.659> like<00:01:12.869> i<00:01:12.900> may<00:01:13.290> get<00:01:13.880> over<00:01:14.880> 30<00:01:15.150> miles<00:01:15.450> on

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
it looks like i may get over 30 miles on

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.460 
it looks like i may get over 30 miles on
a<00:01:15.840> charge<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.729> the<00:01:17.729> top<00:01:17.970> speed<00:01:18.420> i<00:01:18.810> haven't

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
a charge and the top speed i haven't

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.260 
a charge and the top speed i haven't
dared<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.950> let<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.250> completely<00:01:20.670> top<00:01:21.030> out

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
dared to let it completely top out

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.390 
dared to let it completely top out
because<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.110> just<00:01:22.200> too<00:01:22.439> fast<00:01:22.799> for<00:01:22.950> something

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
because it's just too fast for something

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:37.260 
because it's just too fast for something
this<00:01:23.520> small<00:01:23.700> but

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.200 

it<00:01:38.270> appears<00:01:38.600> to<00:01:38.780> be<00:01:38.930> from<00:01:39.469> my<00:01:39.710> judgment<00:01:40.250> over

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
it appears to be from my judgment over

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.690 
it appears to be from my judgment over
40<00:01:41.509> miles<00:01:41.720> an<00:01:41.899> hour<00:01:41.990> it's<00:01:42.289> just<00:01:42.530> completely

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
40 miles an hour it's just completely

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.580 
40 miles an hour it's just completely
insane<00:01:44.320> crazy<00:01:45.320> crazy<00:01:45.950> fast<00:01:47.170> but<00:01:48.170> you<00:01:48.380> don't

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
insane crazy crazy fast but you don't

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.840 
insane crazy crazy fast but you don't
have<00:01:48.679> to<00:01:48.829> go<00:01:48.920> that<00:01:49.070> fast<00:01:49.310> I've<00:01:49.579> been<00:01:49.700> driving

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
have to go that fast I've been driving

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.039 
have to go that fast I've been driving
along<00:01:50.320> you<00:01:51.320> know<00:01:52.090> 15<00:01:53.090> miles<00:01:53.360> an<00:01:53.600> hour<00:01:53.689> probably

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
along you know 15 miles an hour probably

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.410 
along you know 15 miles an hour probably
the<00:01:54.350> tops<00:01:54.619> just<00:01:55.369> goofing<00:01:55.729> around<00:01:56.000> and<00:01:56.119> that's

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
the tops just goofing around and that's

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.779 
the tops just goofing around and that's
what<00:01:56.659> I<00:01:56.689> want<00:01:56.750> to<00:01:57.079> do<00:01:57.200> I<00:01:57.439> guess<00:01:58.069> my<00:01:58.280> next<00:01:58.340> step

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
what I want to do I guess my next step

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.859 
what I want to do I guess my next step
is<00:01:59.090> to<00:01:59.119> design<00:01:59.990> a<00:02:00.229> body<00:02:00.649> for<00:02:01.009> it<00:02:01.069> and<00:02:01.840> get<00:02:02.840> it

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
is to design a body for it and get it

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.440 
is to design a body for it and get it
all<00:02:03.079> in<00:02:03.319> clothes<00:02:03.740> I'll<00:02:04.579> be<00:02:05.000> a<00:02:05.030> while<00:02:05.060> doing

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
all in clothes I'll be a while doing

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.969 
all in clothes I'll be a while doing
that<00:02:05.569> but<00:02:05.869> that's<00:02:06.049> probably<00:02:06.289> my<00:02:06.500> next<00:02:06.770> step

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
that but that's probably my next step

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.889 
that but that's probably my next step
and<00:02:07.220> I<00:02:07.399> don't<00:02:07.970> know<00:02:08.060> when<00:02:08.420> I'll<00:02:08.569> get<00:02:08.720> to<00:02:08.869> that

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
and I don't know when I'll get to that

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.830 
and I don't know when I'll get to that
but<00:02:09.259> when<00:02:09.440> I<00:02:09.470> get<00:02:09.679> to<00:02:09.830> it<00:02:09.860> I<00:02:10.009> get<00:02:10.190> to<00:02:10.369> it<00:02:10.519> so<00:02:11.390> I'm

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
but when I get to it I get to it so I'm

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.809 
but when I get to it I get to it so I'm
tinning<00:02:12.260> from<00:02:12.380> mini<00:02:12.530> bowl<00:02:12.739> design<00:02:13.099> get<00:02:13.700> out

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
tinning from mini bowl design get out

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.240 
tinning from mini bowl design get out
