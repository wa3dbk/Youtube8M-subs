traction<00:00:34.280> to<00:00:35.280> slide<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.579> little<00:00:35.700> bit<00:00:35.989> like<00:00:36.989> I

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
traction to slide a little bit like I

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.959 
traction to slide a little bit like I
say<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.380> takes<00:00:37.559> practice<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:38.250> you<00:00:38.550> don't<00:00:38.879> just

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
say it takes practice it you don't just

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.840 
say it takes practice it you don't just
go<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:39.899> do<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.620> everybody<00:00:41.040> they<00:00:41.309> see<00:00:41.370> is

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
to get to the ground quicker to get on

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.299 
to get to the ground quicker to get on
the<00:00:53.850> gas<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.750> get<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> power<00:00:55.680> down<00:00:55.800> and

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
the gas to get the power down and

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.889 
the gas to get the power down and
because<00:00:56.789> when<00:00:56.940> you're<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.360> air<00:00:57.510> too<00:00:57.719> long

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
because when you're in the air too long

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.750 
because when you're in the air too long
is<00:00:58.410> when<00:00:58.680> you're<00:00:58.829> losing<00:00:59.010> time<00:00:59.399> when<00:00:59.670> you're

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
is when you're losing time when you're

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:10.260 
is when you're losing time when you're
on<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.940> ground<00:01:00.059> you're<00:01:00.750> going<00:01:00.899> faster
