00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.890
 hello girls today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.950
 a very simple recipe for you 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.090
 who want to strengthen their nails, right? 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.120
 hand line 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.449
 the type or the toenail that has the nails 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.609
 very weak that lives breaking you 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.010
 you can see that mine is uneven 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.970
 there are some great little ones that are 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:31.579
 small were that already burning but there 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.710
 I'll make the right use of it. 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:38.090
 using the base with garlic 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.420
 you will get a normal base but 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.739
 transparent 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:48.480
 They are nail polish and will get a 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:52.739
 garlic 1 garlic clove will sting him 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.500
 and put inside the glaze and leave there 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.850
 you can use it for three days. 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.149
 not mine 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.809
 That's very true. 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.000
 I came to talk about what works fine, I 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.100
 I do not know how to tell you guys, I'll try. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.330
 take the test because I can not take it anymore 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.390
 This is mine, my heart is breaking. 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.210
 I can not take it anymore then I'll do the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.119
 Garlic test at the base is that I already 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.119
 put right jap cheese put a dent 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.600
 diary and if you can see there are more 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:31.170
 or less than three days that is here right? 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:35.009
 that I left a lot to enjoy 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.829
 well the essence of garlic in the enamel and I 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.560
 I think it 's ready to use 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.740
 I'll test on my fingernail if it works 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.220
 I also inform you so that 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:50.280
 Do it too, but I'll give it to you 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.369
 the tip for whoever wants to already test already 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.670
 you can test until you see if it works 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.469
 and that's it people and I discovered a 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.500
 Also cool thing I'm going okay 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.500
 happening to you later in another video
