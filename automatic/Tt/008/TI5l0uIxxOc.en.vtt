want to try to avoid doing
parachute<00:03:47.409> enough<00:03:47.709> so<00:03:48.040> we<00:03:48.159> still<00:03:48.430> want<00:03:48.640> to

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670

keep our

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.070 
keep our
above<00:03:50.160> our<00:03:50.280> knees<00:03:50.520> if<00:03:51.239> we<00:03:51.450> want<00:03:51.629> to<00:03:51.690> catch<00:03:51.870> it

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
above our knees if we want to catch it

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.270 
above our knees if we want to catch it
with<00:03:52.200> our<00:03:52.349> feet<00:03:52.650> stopped<00:03:53.069> and<00:03:53.340> now

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
with our feet stopped and now

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.030 
with our feet stopped and now
why

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.430 

position<00:03:58.790> right<00:03:59.360> our<00:03:59.599> midline

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
position right our midline

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.990 
position right our midline
their<00:04:00.920> shoulders<00:04:01.430> above<00:04:01.670> our<00:04:01.880> knees

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.910 

there<00:04:07.510> we<00:04:07.570> go<00:04:07.720> a<00:04:07.990> little<00:04:08.290> bit<00:04:08.500> more<00:04:08.530> shoulder

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
there we go a little bit more shoulder

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:21.030 
there we go a little bit more shoulder
keys

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.950 

so<00:04:21.490> the<00:04:21.640> next<00:04:21.910> progression<00:04:22.090> for<00:04:22.570> this<00:04:22.720> is

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
so the next progression for this is

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.270 
so the next progression for this is
Maddie<00:04:23.230> here<00:04:23.560> is

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
Maddie here is

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:32.410 
Maddie here is
going<00:04:25.460> to<00:04:25.520> be<00:04:25.610> taken<00:04:26.000> away<00:04:26.210> this<00:04:26.690> farm<00:04:27.200> here

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.420 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.620 

he's<00:04:32.630> over<00:04:32.930> there<00:04:33.020> Taksim<00:04:33.560> and<00:04:33.770> she's<00:04:33.980> gonna

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
he's over there Taksim and she's gonna

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.800 
he's over there Taksim and she's gonna
here<00:04:35.200> you<00:04:35.770> see

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.410 

to<00:04:39.810> get<00:04:39.960> ourselves<00:04:40.340> to<00:04:41.340> get<00:04:41.730> the<00:04:41.880> ball<00:04:42.060> bounce

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
to get ourselves to get the ball bounce

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.460 
to get ourselves to get the ball bounce
right<00:04:42.840> between

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
right between

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.980 
right between
and<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:44.830> goal<00:04:45.040> is<00:04:45.310> to<00:04:45.340> get<00:04:46.270> about<00:04:46.660> right

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
and the goal is to get about right

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.770 
and the goal is to get about right
between<00:04:47.140> our<00:04:47.440> feet

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
between our feet

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.100 
between our feet
sometimes<00:04:49.560> it'll<00:04:49.890> bounce<00:04:50.040> too<00:04:50.670> far<00:04:50.940> front

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
sometimes it'll bounce too far front

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.850 
sometimes it'll bounce too far front
or<00:04:53.560> sometimes

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
or sometimes

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.480 
or sometimes
directly

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
directly

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.800 
directly
and<00:04:56.639> to<00:04:56.789> directly<00:04:57.210> that<00:04:57.330> means<00:04:57.539> you're<00:04:57.690> too

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
and to directly that means you're too

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.420 
and to directly that means you're too
close<00:04:58.050> to<00:04:58.229> the<00:04:58.380> ball<00:04:58.560> and<00:04:59.190> they<00:04:59.400> hit<00:04:59.550> bounce

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
close to the ball and they hit bounce

we're<00:05:10.130> also<00:05:10.280> going<00:05:10.580> to<00:05:10.670> emphasize<00:05:10.820> getting

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
we're also going to emphasize getting

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:18.950 
we're also going to emphasize getting
our<00:05:11.630> feet<00:05:11.870> stuck

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960

thanks doctor
still<00:05:21.780> enough<00:05:22.140> hopefully

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.800 

so<00:05:54.340> the<00:05:54.430> final<00:05:54.670> step<00:05:55.030> in<00:05:55.240> this<00:05:55.360> passive

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
so the final step in this passive

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:02.189 
so the final step in this passive
regression<00:05:56.290> is<00:05:56.410> out<00:05:56.560> in<00:05:56.710> the<00:05:56.740> platform<00:05:57.310> and

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:02.199 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:05.670 

our<00:06:02.259> passing<00:06:03.039> hole

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.800 

what's<00:06:06.220> the<00:06:06.400> ball<00:06:06.580> comes

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.149 

coaches<00:06:11.139> and<00:06:11.410> players<00:06:11.560> can<00:06:11.800> evaluate

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:14.159 
coaches and players can evaluate

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:19.790 
coaches and players can evaluate
if<00:06:14.219> their<00:06:14.429> feet<00:06:14.639> are<00:06:14.789> in<00:06:14.819> the<00:06:14.969> right<00:06:15.089> position

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.920 

so<00:06:20.129> ideally<00:06:20.580> our<00:06:20.819> platform<00:06:21.330> is<00:06:21.479> right<00:06:21.690> in<00:06:21.840> the

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:21.930 
so ideally our platform is right in the

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.480 
so ideally our platform is right in the
middle<00:06:21.990> up

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:25.490 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.379 

we're<00:06:25.610> going<00:06:25.729> to<00:06:25.789> pass<00:06:26.090> and<00:06:26.389> pull

we're going to pass and pull

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:31.640 
we're going to pass and pull
if<00:06:28.719> Maddie<00:06:29.020> you're<00:06:29.319> has<00:06:29.500> to<00:06:29.530> shuffle<00:06:29.949> to<00:06:30.280> her

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:31.650 
if Maddie you're has to shuffle to her

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.350 
if Maddie you're has to shuffle to her
we<00:06:31.830> want<00:06:32.070> her<00:06:32.220> hips<00:06:32.460> to<00:06:32.580> always<00:06:32.970> be<00:06:33.150> facing

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
we want her hips to always be facing

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.659 
we want her hips to always be facing
target

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:34.669 
target

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:36.379 
target
she<00:06:35.210> shuffles<00:06:35.659> to<00:06:35.810> her

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:36.389 
she shuffles to her

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:42.460 
she shuffles to her
when<00:06:36.539> she<00:06:36.719> passes<00:06:36.960> it

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:42.470 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.500 

and<00:06:42.620> so<00:06:42.770> her<00:06:42.980> hips<00:06:43.250> are<00:06:43.460> facing<00:06:43.940> back<00:06:44.120> too<00:06:44.300> busy

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:13.079 

it's<00:07:11.559> easy<00:07:11.769> as<00:07:12.009> if<00:07:12.219> we<00:07:12.309> just<00:07:12.459> passed<00:07:12.729> straight

00:07:13.079 --> 00:07:13.089
