00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.710
 yes think the friezes can can quite 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.090
 dangerous indeed, but yes 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.219
 are also imbued with I think 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.450
 but you must have my hamid from that 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.429
 you really want to win that competition 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.660
 a bit of a nice beautiful afternoon 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.340
 want to make 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.190
 yes then you have to 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.280
 yes anyway or for the bone 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.150
 motivated I think is so 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.580
 much at stake 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.130
 actually so beautiful in that respect 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.800
 contest but they will cheat 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.840
 or Rudy after competition or look up 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.949
 click to the left row 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.480
 it's actually want it to have 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:41.910
 a yes and quite bizarre west end that you 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.190
 that you still that yes that the 9th place still 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.970
 so close and that the place is 16 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.880
 yes lurking dangerously 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.590
 so that is very special 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.420
 but of course it must also guard that 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.920
 don't lose from roda jc because then you can 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.540
 the team still get into trouble because 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.130
 yes the last race competition rush 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.200
 against Feyenoord 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.730
 yes if i have a very awkward westra yes that 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.830
 he said the we don't want that we 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.399
 won't let it arrive it that seems 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.770
 clear to me 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:10.860
 so sin just wants to go 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.910
 decide that it must have just 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.700
 I think I click see no I see 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.800
 none feel like i see none 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.450
 not a lot of danger or so that concerns 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.220
 for us it is of course 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.869
 roda is just an ordinary difficult team 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.660
 to play against it is not that 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.819
 we are much better just us tomorrow 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.920
 bus or fidelity draw on the second 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:33.869
 season half and also with the 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.690
 home game ahead 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.950
 but you are not afraid of them like us 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.380
 look at the score so I get 5 points 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.940
 difference between nac railroad to it 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.399
 advantage of nac then you would say 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.720
 the pressure lies with the limburgers but can 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.060
 imagine that makes a difference 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.099
 feels busy at this competition of course 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.209
 it with us 

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:52.470
 why you see of course you know you 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:54.899
 either but you may not lose that 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:59.429
 match in that that also ensures 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:01.289
 busy with us and in the end is anyway 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.000
 who is the best with the pressure that you 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:04.619
 Sometimes you also need what has just been said 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.119
 sometimes you also have the feeling of 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.789
 that you really want to win and watch 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.929
 where you stand that can also be one 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.540
 positive effect on our have and 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.890
 I'm not sure either 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.300
 I have proof it is not leased by 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.960
 regards that I know how to handle such 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.170
 contest must start 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.970
 We must fall in on sessions 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.740
 to really do everything to 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.920
 win or you do that with a little bit 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.180
 Relaxation or with a lot of pressure 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.940
 everyone has to go for it on the boiler 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.800
 I think I decide for myself 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.620
 this competition and arco 1010 a kind 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.450
 and if you look at 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.150
 the whole season it can mean that 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.620
 a bad season is running or over 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.530
 reasonable season to maybe good 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.030
 when you get to the left row 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.930
 jana i finally watched you 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.960
 settled on the final position 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.370
 in the competition so that is 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.200
 all so close together so if you 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.940
 wins then it is one 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.620
 eventually you have a very strong one 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.020
 Sassoon cities themselves and if you 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.490
 one if you are no less then it is anyway 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.450
 a bit of it is still 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.770
 so pinching so close together and 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.140
 good to know for ourselves also wants that 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.720
 we have a decent second season itself 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.890
 have played and in which 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.450
 yes it did very well 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.670
 only various against roda is anyway 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.280
 ultimately everything decisive 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.080
 and then I also understand that at the end 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.210
 of the ride 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.560
 yes that those are not stories of yes 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.430
 but the second season itself was 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.190
 doing well 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.830
 it will not be in but I think 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.670
 yes that's why you just have to be an ordinary man 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.380
 and finish that competition well 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.270
 when do you give what you know 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.710
 will bring you a future 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.710
 will then stay at another club 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.680
 I think the end of the 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:50.290
 competition that I would do that and 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.930
 maybe come to the game earlier 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.370
 safety still plays then play 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.260
 you also get that could well be 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.239
 yes well i just have to be there myself and and 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.370
 car with nags we need a good one there 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:04.290
 moment for searching but the decision is 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.580
 understand now you are being taken 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.950
 no that has not been taken yet 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.819
 but time is running out and architect 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.950
 also yes 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.620
 all nice and nice grace live mouse 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.579
 and set a deadline that the 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:19.320
 I also understand a night should just be 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.329
 search 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.950
 to possible substitutes there I know 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.240
 Also that has also opposed but now I 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.260
 we say that I read everything in the 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.540
 just press 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.389
 communication with nac is really very open 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.729
 that is also very good on its own 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.590
 yes at the moment I unfortunately have one for that 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.000
 no news to you 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.500
 me taste what your words feel 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.970
 says you are leaving for 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.190
 Following the fact that so long 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.350
 takes time to make something known 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.930
 no no don't have that right 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.139
 tasted I think yes what I say I say 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.160
 only want to think about that and then yes 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.090
 maybe you can say what you are about 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.040
 doubts 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.790
 yes I have said so many times where I am 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.790
 doubts about it 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.639
 that's just these are very many things 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.250
 everyone can do that for you 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:06.720
 I think you think of yourself 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:10.169
 I know what I have at NAC and in particular 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.430
 the second sister had to do that all that 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.560
 is very good but you don't worry 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.910
 busy say that may later too 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.570
 replaced before you have access from kees 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:21.530
 nice namely but unfortunately no I may 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:24.570
 not then I don't worry because 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:27.450
 I stand behind my choice to go 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.370
 not yet to make that decision 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.600
 well i also know it's not that 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:35.490
 takes a long time, because that makes sense 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.130
 but yes no news at this time 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.750
 unfortunately I was telling you right now 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.490
 the chances that doctors leave 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.110
 Chances remains in the patient I am still 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.930
 far beside 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:50.010
 yes man maher may us go out you want 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:51.570
 talking about revenge yes no sure but there 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.880
 I know I do not I know that I 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.440
 still thinking about it within that 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.590
 it actually fluctuates with the 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.590
 day
