00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.900 
written out in three different places so
first<00:01:55.050> it's<00:01:55.259> just<00:01:55.289> a<00:01:55.860> melody<00:01:56.340> on<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.490> second

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
first it's just a melody on the second

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:06.880 
first it's just a melody on the second
string<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.240> would<00:01:57.330> be<00:01:57.420> like<00:01:57.599> this

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.050 

if<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.009> Sun<00:02:08.190> was<00:02:08.310> on<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.459> third<00:02:08.670> string<00:02:08.910> of

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
if the Sun was on the third string of

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.920 
if the Sun was on the third string of
the<00:02:09.119> sound<00:02:09.330> like<00:02:09.450> this<00:02:14.510> thumb<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.660> fourth

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
the sound like this thumb of the fourth

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.300 
the sound like this thumb of the fourth
string<00:02:16.050> would<00:02:16.230> be<00:02:16.380> like<00:02:16.530> this

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.530 

so<00:02:23.310> yeah<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.670> thumb<00:02:23.819> is<00:02:23.940> bouncing<00:02:24.390> to

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
so yeah the thumb is bouncing to

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.750 
so yeah the thumb is bouncing to
wherever<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.900> melody<00:02:25.170> note<00:02:25.319> is<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.800> the

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
wherever the melody note is and the

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.130 
wherever the melody note is and the
finger<00:02:27.060> just<00:02:27.239> keeps<00:02:27.480> going<00:02:27.720> on<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:27.959> first

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
finger just keeps going on that first

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.410 
finger just keeps going on that first
string<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:29.250> other<00:02:29.430> thing<00:02:29.910> besides<00:02:30.239> that

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
string the other thing besides that

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.699 
string the other thing besides that
basic<00:02:30.720> role<00:02:30.870> that<00:02:30.959> happens<00:02:31.260> a<00:02:31.319> lot<00:02:31.350> there's<00:02:31.680> a

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
basic role that happens a lot there's a

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.740 
basic role that happens a lot there's a
pinch<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.280> that's<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.120> first<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.569> fifth

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
pinch and that's the first and fifth

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.259 
pinch and that's the first and fifth
string<00:02:33.959> played<00:02:34.200> at<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.350> same<00:02:34.530> time<00:02:35.180> so<00:02:36.180> you

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
string played at the same time so you

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.199 
string played at the same time so you
might<00:02:36.390> get<00:02:36.510> a<00:02:36.569> melody<00:02:36.930> notes<00:02:37.110> and<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.620> pinch<00:02:38.209> and

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
might get a melody notes and a pinch and

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.640 
might get a melody notes and a pinch and
maybe<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.569> roll<00:02:39.750> after<00:02:39.959> that's<00:02:40.350> what<00:02:40.470> I<00:02:40.500> wrote

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
maybe a roll after that's what I wrote

00:02:40.650 --> 00:03:05.099 
maybe a roll after that's what I wrote
down<00:02:40.709> there<00:02:41.069> I<00:02:41.100> think

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:06.599 

and<00:03:05.319> then<00:03:05.439> sometimes<00:03:05.889> you<00:03:06.010> have<00:03:06.159> to<00:03:06.310> get<00:03:06.430> more

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
and then sometimes you have to get more

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.339 
and then sometimes you have to get more
melody<00:03:06.909> notes<00:03:07.090> in<00:03:07.299> so<00:03:07.629> you<00:03:07.689> don't<00:03:07.900> have<00:03:08.139> time

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
melody notes in so you don't have time

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.110 
melody notes in so you don't have time
to<00:03:08.500> get<00:03:08.620> up<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:08.769> the<00:03:08.889> fifth<00:03:09.099> string<00:03:09.370> so<00:03:10.030> you

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
to get up to the fifth string so you

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.520 
to get up to the fifth string so you
might<00:03:10.269> just<00:03:10.299> play<00:03:10.569> thumb<00:03:10.930> one<00:03:11.109> thumb<00:03:11.349> one

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
might just play thumb one thumb one

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:34.420 
might just play thumb one thumb one
thumb<00:03:11.799> one<00:03:12.010> with<00:03:12.310> a<00:03:12.340> melody<00:03:12.670> and<00:03:12.939> first<00:03:13.629> string

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.070 

so<00:03:35.430> just<00:03:35.670> um<00:03:35.850> one<00:03:36.060> thumb<00:03:36.240> one<00:03:36.450> it's<00:03:36.660> a<00:03:36.750> lot<00:03:36.900> like

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
so just um one thumb one it's a lot like

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.060 
so just um one thumb one it's a lot like
double<00:03:37.440> thumbing<00:03:37.830> in<00:03:38.430> climber<00:03:38.880> style<00:03:39.210> and<00:03:40.070> of

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
double thumbing in climber style and of

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.620 
double thumbing in climber style and of
course<00:03:41.340> we<00:03:41.550> can<00:03:41.730> add<00:03:41.970> in<00:03:42.150> hammer-ons

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
course we can add in hammer-ons

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.140 
course we can add in hammer-ons
pull-offs<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:43.830> slides<00:03:44.160> that's<00:03:44.880> when<00:03:45.060> it

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
pull-offs and slides that's when it

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.720 
pull-offs and slides that's when it
really<00:03:45.180> starts<00:03:45.600> to<00:03:45.690> sound<00:03:46.050> um<00:03:46.580> you<00:03:47.580> know

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
really starts to sound um you know

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.480 
really starts to sound um you know
old-timey<00:03:48.330> so<00:03:49.020> like<00:03:49.440> leave<00:03:49.950> you<00:03:50.040> hammer<00:03:50.280> on

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
old-timey so like leave you hammer on

00:03:50.490 --> 00:04:06.240 
old-timey so like leave you hammer on
the<00:03:50.700> fourth<00:03:51.360> string

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:33.779 

that<00:04:07.250> sort<00:04:07.489> of<00:04:07.550> thing<00:04:07.760> maybe<00:04:08.239> a<00:04:08.360> slide<00:04:18.549> blocks

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:33.789 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:36.580 

so<00:04:34.789> it<00:04:35.120> still<00:04:35.360> has<00:04:35.389> the<00:04:35.600> rhythm<00:04:35.990> of<00:04:36.139> clawhammer

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
so it still has the rhythm of clawhammer

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.110 
so it still has the rhythm of clawhammer
but<00:04:36.889> it's<00:04:37.009> got<00:04:37.130> a<00:04:37.160> little<00:04:37.280> more<00:04:37.490> Drive<00:04:37.789> because

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
but it's got a little more Drive because

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.309 
but it's got a little more Drive because
of<00:04:38.210> the<00:04:38.300> pics<00:04:38.600> but<00:04:39.199> it's<00:04:39.380> not<00:04:39.530> quite<00:04:40.039> so

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:41.319 
of the pics but it's not quite so

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:43.930 
of the pics but it's not quite so
syncopated<00:04:42.319> maybe<00:04:42.590> as<00:04:42.770> bluegrass<00:04:43.550> style

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
syncopated maybe as bluegrass style

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.700 
syncopated maybe as bluegrass style
scrub<00:04:44.300> style<00:04:44.949> it's<00:04:45.949> wonderful<00:04:46.550> for<00:04:47.349> tunes<00:04:48.349> and

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
scrub style it's wonderful for tunes and

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:54.100 
scrub style it's wonderful for tunes and
songs<00:04:48.770> um<00:04:49.370> so<00:04:50.360> I<00:04:52.330> think<00:04:53.330> I'm<00:04:53.599> going<00:04:53.870> to<00:04:53.900> put<00:04:54.050> up

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
songs um so I think I'm going to put up

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.620 
songs um so I think I'm going to put up
a<00:04:54.349> few<00:04:54.560> more<00:04:54.740> to<00:04:55.370> finger<00:04:55.669> style<00:04:55.849> videos<00:04:56.330> so<00:04:56.539> you
