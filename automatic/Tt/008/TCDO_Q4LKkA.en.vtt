00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
integrated tail lights that's why I

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.920 
integrated tail lights that's why I

why I didn't put the fender eliminator
ones<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.670> there<00:01:32.910> that's<00:01:33.840> right<00:01:36.650> this<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.830> left

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
ones on there that's right this is left

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.900 
ones on there that's right this is left
kinda<00:01:39.780> hard<00:01:40.050> to<00:01:40.140> see<00:01:40.380> but<00:01:41.070> that's<00:01:41.700> what<00:01:41.820> it

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
kinda hard to see but that's what it

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.880 
kinda hard to see but that's what it
looks<00:01:42.060> like<00:01:42.180> it's<00:01:42.930> pretty<00:01:43.050> bright<00:01:43.410> it's<00:01:43.710> hard

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
looks like it's pretty bright it's hard

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.310 
looks like it's pretty bright it's hard
to<00:01:44.040> tell<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.430> daytime<00:01:44.790> but<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:45.300> think<00:01:46.200> it'll

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
to tell in the daytime but I think it'll

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.260 
to tell in the daytime but I think it'll
be<00:01:46.380> good<00:01:46.620> and<00:01:47.310> then<00:01:47.580> one<00:01:47.670> thing<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.910> do<00:01:47.970> like<00:01:48.090> is

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
be good and then one thing I do like is

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.440 
be good and then one thing I do like is
it<00:01:48.570> has<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:48.990> warrant<00:01:49.880> blinks<00:01:50.880> when<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.240> first

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
it has a warrant blinks when you first

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.300 
it has a warrant blinks when you first
hit<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.690> brakes<00:01:51.960> kind<00:01:52.860> of<00:01:52.950> make<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.160> a<00:01:53.190> little

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
hit the brakes kind of make you a little

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.950 
hit the brakes kind of make you a little
bit<00:01:53.490> more<00:01:53.940> known<00:01:54.120> as<00:01:54.240> well<00:01:54.390> see<00:01:54.570> if<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.690> can<00:01:54.810> show
