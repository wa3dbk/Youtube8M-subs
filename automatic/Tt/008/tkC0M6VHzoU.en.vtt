00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
flat bed rock layer mod pretty cool the

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.379 
flat bed rock layer mod pretty cool the
more<00:00:10.139> that<00:00:10.380> essentially<00:00:11.130> what<00:00:11.309> it<00:00:11.340> does<00:00:11.550> is<00:00:11.880> as

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
craft generates the bed rock layers it's

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.970 
craft generates the bed rock layers it's
jelly<00:00:17.430> from<00:00:17.640> like<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.000> last<00:00:18.029> say<00:00:18.600> five<00:00:19.050> you

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
jelly from like the last say five you

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.820 
jelly from like the last say five you
know<00:00:20.039> from<00:00:20.220> level<00:00:20.460> 1<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.670> 5<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.359> just<00:00:21.539> generates

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
know from level 1 to 5 it just generates

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.130 
know from level 1 to 5 it just generates
randomly<00:00:22.830> bedrock<00:00:23.340> well<00:00:24.090> this<00:00:24.300> with<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:24.930> mod

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
randomly bedrock well this with this mod

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.630 
randomly bedrock well this with this mod
what<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.439> does<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.830> actually<00:00:25.890> just<00:00:26.279> makes<00:00:26.519> it

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
what it does it actually just makes it

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.359 
what it does it actually just makes it
the<00:00:26.820> lowest<00:00:27.090> possible<00:00:27.480> level<00:00:27.720> one<00:00:28.560> would<00:00:29.189> be

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
the lowest possible level one would be

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.420 
the lowest possible level one would be
the<00:00:29.640> only<00:00:29.820> bed<00:00:30.300> rock<00:00:30.570> layer<00:00:31.109> as<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.219> game

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
the only bed rock layer as in the game

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.830 
the only bed rock layer as in the game
but<00:00:32.969> it's<00:00:33.090> kind<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.270> cool<00:00:33.420> because<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.809> can

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
but it's kind of cool because you can

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.650 
but it's kind of cool because you can
sit<00:00:34.079> on<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.200> end<00:00:34.469> I'll<00:00:35.430> bring<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.730> up<00:00:35.880> as<00:00:36.570> you

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
sit on the end I'll bring it up as you

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.869 
sit on the end I'll bring it up as you
can<00:00:36.719> see<00:00:36.899> i'm<00:00:37.020> now<00:00:37.140> on<00:00:37.170> luck<00:00:37.590> on<00:00:37.829> why<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.460> 6

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
can see i'm now on luck on why of 6

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.580 
can see i'm now on luck on why of 6
that's<00:00:39.300> not<00:00:39.450> feet<00:00:39.660> up<00:00:39.809> man<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.140> guess<00:00:40.290> i<00:00:40.500> am

that's not feet up man you guess i am

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.080 
that's not feet up man you guess i am
doing<00:00:40.770> this<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:41.040> one<00:00:41.190> point<00:00:41.399> four<00:00:41.610> point<00:00:41.640> six

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
doing this in one point four point six

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.150 
doing this in one point four point six
per<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.840> mod<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.260> for<00:00:43.500> one<00:00:43.649> point<00:00:43.890> four<00:00:44.129> point

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
per the mod is for one point four point

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.930 
per the mod is for one point four point
seven<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.030> yeah<00:00:45.480> don't<00:00:45.809> over<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.460> but<00:00:47.460> yes<00:00:47.700> so

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
now you should be starting to see some

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.069 
now you should be starting to see some
bedrock<00:00:50.730> actually<00:00:51.149> appearing<00:00:51.510> well<00:00:51.960> I've<00:00:52.050> got

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
bedrock actually appearing well I've got

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.420 
bedrock actually appearing well I've got
this<00:00:52.230> little<00:00:52.410> room<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.680> clear<00:00:52.949> their<00:00:53.100> let's

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
this little room to clear their let's

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.040 
this little room to clear their let's
just<00:00:53.579> start<00:00:53.789> bashing<00:00:54.030> away<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.750> clearing

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
just start bashing away and clearing

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.110 
just start bashing away and clearing
some<00:00:55.230> smoke<00:00:55.530> away<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.940> should

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
some smoke away and you should

guess what you're not sooner so let's go

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.630 
guess what you're not sooner so let's go
down<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.160> little<00:01:02.190> bit<00:01:02.370> further<00:01:03.890> mm-hmm-hmm<00:01:04.890> d

down a little bit further mm-hmm-hmm d

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.840 
down a little bit further mm-hmm-hmm d
diggy<00:01:06.060> diggy<00:01:06.799> and<00:01:07.799> that's<00:01:07.920> from<00:01:08.100> dead<00:01:08.220> on<00:01:08.369> 23

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
diggy diggy and that's from dead on 23

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.740 
diggy diggy and that's from dead on 23
still<00:01:09.689> not<00:01:09.869> seeing<00:01:10.080> any<00:01:10.229> bedrock<00:01:11.390> do<00:01:12.390> not<00:01:12.570> see

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
still not seeing any bedrock do not see

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.539 
still not seeing any bedrock do not see
any<00:01:12.869> better<00:01:13.110> up<00:01:13.320> something<00:01:14.010> I<00:01:14.070> smell<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.400> all

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
any better up something I smell of all

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.820 
any better up something I smell of all
which<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.000> good<00:01:15.409> there's<00:01:16.409> probably<00:01:16.470> good

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
which is good there's probably good

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.280 
which is good there's probably good
thing<00:01:16.979> about<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.369> actual<00:01:17.640> were<00:01:18.110> about<00:01:19.110> this

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
thing about the actual were about this

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.140 
thing about the actual were about this
modestly<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.950> Kanak<00:01:20.280> see<00:01:20.400> now<00:01:20.549> can<00:01:20.970> make<00:01:21.119> a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
modestly the Kanak see now can make a

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.350 
modestly the Kanak see now can make a
lot<00:01:21.360> easy<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.659> actually<00:01:21.900> find<00:01:22.200> yours<00:01:23.000> and<00:01:24.000> if

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
lot easy to actually find yours and if

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.510 
lot easy to actually find yours and if
we<00:01:24.540> go<00:01:24.689> down<00:01:24.720> one<00:01:25.080> more<00:01:25.229> look<00:01:25.740> at<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.040> there

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
we go down one more look at that there

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.490 
we go down one more look at that there
is<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.030> bedrock<00:01:27.360> layer<00:01:27.780> because<00:01:28.290> I'm<00:01:28.409> gonna

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
is the bedrock layer because I'm gonna

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.840 
is the bedrock layer because I'm gonna
break<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.770> if<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.280> since<00:01:29.700> I'm<00:01:29.790> in

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
break that if I you since I'm in

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.719 
break that if I you since I'm in
creative<00:01:30.240> mode<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.600> be<00:01:31.110> careful<00:01:31.470> but<00:01:32.400> that's

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
creative mode so be careful but that's

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.149 
creative mode so be careful but that's
the<00:01:32.909> only<00:01:33.090> light<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.930> will<00:01:34.020> find<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:34.740> model

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
the only light you will find this model

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.530 
the only light you will find this model
on<00:01:35.250> us<00:01:35.340> again<00:01:35.460> it's<00:01:35.820> probably<00:01:36.030> obvious<00:01:36.150> by<00:01:36.509> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
on us again it's probably obvious by the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.289 
on us again it's probably obvious by the
name<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.049> mod<00:01:37.259> but<00:01:37.950> yes<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.970> just

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
name of the mod but yes it is just

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.080 
name of the mod but yes it is just
simply<00:01:39.659> one<00:01:40.380> level<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.280> plaza<00:01:41.640> possible

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
simply one level the plaza possible

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.240 
simply one level the plaza possible
level<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.780> will<00:01:42.899> actually<00:01:43.049> find<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.799> bedrock

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
level you will actually find the bedrock

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.030 
level you will actually find the bedrock
layer<00:01:44.520> which<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.299> kind<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.689> cool<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.200> this

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
layer which is a kind of cool and this

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.530 
layer which is a kind of cool and this
mod<00:01:47.280> also<00:01:47.399> actually<00:01:47.640> works<00:01:47.970> for<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.299> nether

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
mod also actually works for the nether

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.880 
mod also actually works for the nether
as<00:01:48.689> well<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.170> nether<00:01:49.350> obviously<00:01:49.680> having

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
as well so the nether obviously having

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.060 
as well so the nether obviously having
its<00:01:50.040> lowest<00:01:50.880> level<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.500> so<00:01:52.500> yeah<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.799> which<00:01:52.979> is

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
its lowest level and so yeah it which is

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.770 
its lowest level and so yeah it which is
kind<00:01:53.189> of<00:01:53.280> cool<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.700> take<00:01:54.329> your<00:01:54.479> those<00:01:54.630> in

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
kind of cool so take your those in

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.760 
kind of cool so take your those in
general<00:01:54.960> I'm<00:01:55.049> not<00:01:55.170> going<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.350> talk<00:01:55.470> too<00:01:55.530> much

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
general I'm not going to talk too much

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.380 
general I'm not going to talk too much
more<00:01:56.040> about<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.340> because<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:56.610> is<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:57.299> a

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
more about it because that is in a

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.990 
more about it because that is in a
nutshell<00:01:57.570> what<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.320> Mort<00:01:58.560> actually<00:01:58.860> does<00:01:59.100> so

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
nutshell what the Mort actually does so

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.060 
nutshell what the Mort actually does so
rather<00:02:00.299> than<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.659> quick<00:02:00.899> recap<00:02:01.229> but<00:02:01.500> lately

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
rather than the quick recap but lately

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.010 
rather than the quick recap but lately
simply<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.790> yet<00:02:03.210> rather<00:02:03.450> than<00:02:03.600> having<00:02:03.810> the

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
simply that yet rather than having the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.050 
simply that yet rather than having the
bedrock<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:05.280> know<00:02:05.369> spawning<00:02:05.759> anything

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
bedrock you know spawning anything

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.459 
bedrock you know spawning anything
anywhere<00:02:06.360> from<00:02:06.509> level<00:02:06.810> one<00:02:07.020> which<00:02:07.229> would<00:02:07.380> be

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
anywhere from level one which would be

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.930 
anywhere from level one which would be
the<00:02:07.619> flat<00:02:07.860> level<00:02:08.069> then<00:02:08.399> just<00:02:08.610> randomly

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
the flat level then just randomly

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.089 
the flat level then just randomly
spawning<00:02:09.330> for<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.599> next<00:02:09.840> say<00:02:10.590> three<00:02:10.830> or<00:02:10.890> four

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
spawning for the next say three or four

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.940 
spawning for the next say three or four
levels<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.910> is<00:02:12.270> now<00:02:12.540> solely<00:02:13.260> on

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
levels it is now solely on

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.080 
levels it is now solely on
the<00:02:14.129> bottom<00:02:14.580> level<00:02:14.790> agency<00:02:15.300> of<00:02:15.930> Y<00:02:16.349> of<00:02:16.709> one<00:02:17.250> so

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
the bottom level agency of Y of one so

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.580 
the bottom level agency of Y of one so
there<00:02:18.180> yeah<00:02:18.330> it's<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.930> pretty<00:02:19.050> cool<00:02:19.290> is<00:02:19.440> mode

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
there yeah it's a pretty cool is mode

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.050 
there yeah it's a pretty cool is mode
for<00:02:19.769> those<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.069> only<00:02:20.280> take<00:02:20.519> a<00:02:20.550> huge<00:02:20.790> fan<00:02:21.030> of

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
for those you only take a huge fan of

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.089 
for those you only take a huge fan of
the<00:02:21.390> bedrock<00:02:21.780> and<00:02:21.959> no<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.260> does<00:02:22.440> in<00:02:22.590> convention

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
the bedrock and no it does in convention

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.740 
the bedrock and no it does in convention
because<00:02:23.220> they<00:02:23.459> can<00:02:24.030> definitely<00:02:24.360> lose<00:02:24.510> some

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
because they can definitely lose some

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.080 
because they can definitely lose some
oils<00:02:25.170> from<00:02:25.950> underneath<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.519> bedrock<00:02:26.849> you<00:02:26.970> may

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
oils from underneath the bedrock you may

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.240 
oils from underneath the bedrock you may
not<00:02:27.209> you<00:02:27.450> may<00:02:27.480> never<00:02:27.780> be<00:02:27.959> able<00:02:27.989> to<00:02:28.170> get<00:02:28.319> to<00:02:28.440> but

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
not you may never be able to get to but

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.710 
not you may never be able to get to but
yeah<00:02:29.519> so<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.819> guys<00:02:29.970> jump<00:02:30.269> definitely<00:02:30.630> worth

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
yeah so the guys jump definitely worth

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.820 
yeah so the guys jump definitely worth
