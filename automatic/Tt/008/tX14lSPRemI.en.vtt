00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
top 5 even top 10 and that's where I

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.109 
top 5 even top 10 and that's where I
gotta<00:01:52.500> say<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.799> definitely<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.310> big<00:01:53.549> 3<00:01:53.909> is

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.330 
gotta say that definitely the big 3 is
pretty<00:01:54.420> much<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:54.899> say<00:01:55.170> broken<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.009> it

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
pretty much you can say broken and it

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.459 
pretty much you can say broken and it
needs<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.759> be<00:01:56.909> replaced<00:01:57.210> for<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.689> new<00:01:57.990> title<00:01:58.229> or

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
needs to be replaced for a new title or

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.660 
needs to be replaced for a new title or
something<00:01:58.619> for<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.979> new<00:01:59.070> popular<00:01:59.520> manga

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
because as far as Japan goes it hasn't

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.109 
because as far as Japan goes it hasn't
been<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.799> big<00:02:01.950> 3<00:02:02.159> for<00:02:02.310> actually<00:02:02.640> quite<00:02:02.880> some

the fact of the matter is at this

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.040 
the fact of the matter is at this
particular<00:02:08.580> point<00:02:09.000> it's<00:02:09.179> pretty<00:02:09.479> much<00:02:09.599> one

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
particular point it's pretty much one

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.670

piece<00:02:10.259> at<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.590> top<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.009> no

which finances fluctuated with more so

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:14.910 
which finances fluctuated with more so
bleach<00:02:13.480> diving<00:02:13.989> and<00:02:14.200> pretty<00:02:14.439> much<00:02:14.560> after<00:02:14.709> its

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
bleach diving and pretty much after its

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.949 
bleach diving and pretty much after its
anime<00:02:15.310> being<00:02:15.519> cancelled<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.390> sales<00:02:16.659> and

you<00:02:18.849> know<00:02:18.939> one<00:02:19.120> piece<00:02:19.329> stays<00:02:19.540> strong<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:20.019> also

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
you know one piece stays strong and also

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.929 
you know one piece stays strong and also

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:21.939 
just kind of fluctuates there because it

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:23.429 
just kind of fluctuates there because it
still<00:02:22.239> has<00:02:22.390> its<00:02:22.420> anime<00:02:22.959> and<00:02:23.049> it<00:02:23.109> still<00:02:23.290> has<00:02:23.409> its

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
success and notoriety but it just isn't

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.500 
success and notoriety but it just isn't
really<00:02:26.200> what<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.680> used<00:02:26.859> to<00:02:26.980> become<00:02:27.430> 2013<00:02:28.329> it's

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
really what it used to become 2013 it's

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.059 
really what it used to become 2013 it's

at least in the top two because it's

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:38.520

be<00:02:53.049> the<00:02:53.230> big<00:02:53.409> two<00:02:53.620> it<00:02:53.769> would<00:02:53.919> be<00:02:54.040> one<00:02:54.519> piece<00:02:54.760> and

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
be the big two it would be one piece and

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.849 
be the big two it would be one piece and
attack<00:02:55.269> on<00:02:55.480> Titan<00:02:55.810> there<00:02:56.109> are<00:02:56.290> other<00:02:56.590> manga

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
attack on Titan there are other manga

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:59.099 
attack on Titan there are other manga
that<00:02:57.069> have<00:02:57.370> tried<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:58.000> you<00:02:58.389> know<00:02:58.480> not<00:02:58.840> really

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
that have tried and you know not really

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:00.869 
that have tried and you know not really
succeeded<00:02:59.620> as<00:02:59.739> far<00:02:59.950> as<00:03:00.040> trying<00:03:00.250> to<00:03:00.340> take<00:03:00.519> that

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:00.879 
succeeded as far as trying to take that

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.429 
succeeded as far as trying to take that
third<00:03:01.090> slot<00:03:01.389> right<00:03:01.659> now<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:01.930> one<00:03:02.200> that<00:03:02.349> is

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:02.439 
third slot right now the one that is

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:04.289 
third slot right now the one that is
trying<00:03:02.769> I<00:03:02.889> would<00:03:02.980> say<00:03:03.159> it's<00:03:03.310> definitely<00:03:03.340> moggy

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
trying I would say it's definitely moggy

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:05.909 
trying I would say it's definitely moggy
because<00:03:04.840> it's<00:03:05.019> doing<00:03:05.200> very<00:03:05.290> well<00:03:05.560> away<00:03:05.889> from

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:05.919 
because it's doing very well away from

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:08.759 
because it's doing very well away from
some<00:03:06.489> 40,000<00:03:07.359> copies<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.870> now<00:03:08.019> in<00:03:08.230> two<00:03:08.560> weeks

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
some 40,000 copies to now in two weeks

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.020 
some 40,000 copies to now in two weeks
it<00:03:08.919> sold<00:03:09.099> almost<00:03:09.280> half<00:03:09.519> a<00:03:09.549> million<00:03:09.909> copies

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
it sold almost half a million copies

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.819 
it sold almost half a million copies
with<00:03:10.329> its<00:03:10.450> latest<00:03:10.719> volume<00:03:11.109> so<00:03:11.439> there<00:03:11.680> are

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
with its latest volume so there are

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:13.800 
with its latest volume so there are
manga<00:03:12.219> that<00:03:12.250> have<00:03:12.489> tried<00:03:12.760> but<00:03:13.180> it's<00:03:13.329> just<00:03:13.389> no

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
manga that have tried but it's just no

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.050 
manga that have tried but it's just no
manga<00:03:14.290> has<00:03:14.439> stuck<00:03:14.709> as<00:03:14.889> of<00:03:15.099> yet<00:03:15.400> again<00:03:15.819> moggy

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.369 
manga has stuck as of yet again moggy
could<00:03:16.359> be<00:03:16.449> a<00:03:16.479> possibility<00:03:16.870> but<00:03:17.109> there<00:03:17.229> are

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:17.379 
could be a possibility but there are

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:18.780 
could be a possibility but there are
other<00:03:17.560> manga<00:03:17.889> that<00:03:17.919> try<00:03:18.220> like<00:03:18.430> you<00:03:18.669> know

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
other manga that try like you know

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.939 
other manga that try like you know
hitman<00:03:19.180> reborn<00:03:19.209> try<00:03:19.900> but<00:03:20.169> it<00:03:20.260> came<00:03:20.409> and<00:03:20.560> went

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:20.949 
hitman reborn try but it came and went

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:22.680 
hitman reborn try but it came and went
fairytale<00:03:21.549> at<00:03:21.669> this<00:03:21.849> point<00:03:22.060> I<00:03:22.120> think<00:03:22.239> it<00:03:22.419> tried

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
fairytale at this point I think it tried

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.659 
fairytale at this point I think it tried
and<00:03:22.900> at<00:03:23.079> the<00:03:23.500> anime<00:03:23.829> it<00:03:24.099> left<00:03:24.340> that<00:03:24.430> it's

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:24.669 
and at the anime it left that it's

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:25.860 
and at the anime it left that it's
coming<00:03:24.970> back<00:03:25.090> but<00:03:25.329> I<00:03:25.359> don't<00:03:25.510> think<00:03:25.659> at<00:03:25.750> this

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
coming back but I don't think at this

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.539 
coming back but I don't think at this
point<00:03:26.049> that<00:03:26.139> fairytale<00:03:26.470> just<00:03:26.859> would<00:03:27.250> have<00:03:27.400> the

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
point that fairytale just would have the

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.339 
point that fairytale just would have the
power<00:03:27.729> to<00:03:28.120> take<00:03:28.269> over<00:03:28.479> as<00:03:28.689> part<00:03:28.959> of<00:03:29.049> the<00:03:29.139> big

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
power to take over as part of the big

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:30.780 
power to take over as part of the big
three<00:03:29.560> you<00:03:29.919> know<00:03:30.040> I<00:03:30.069> could<00:03:30.280> be<00:03:30.400> completely

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
three you know I could be completely

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.490 
three you know I could be completely
wrong<00:03:30.879> but<00:03:31.299> as<00:03:31.419> of<00:03:31.659> right<00:03:31.780> now<00:03:31.840> definitely<00:03:32.169> say

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
wrong but as of right now definitely say

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.740 
wrong but as of right now definitely say
that<00:03:32.530> fairy<00:03:32.829> tale<00:03:33.010> will<00:03:33.280> probably<00:03:33.970> not<00:03:34.510> be<00:03:34.720> a

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
that fairy tale will probably not be a

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.149 
that fairy tale will probably not be a
part<00:03:35.049> of<00:03:35.079> the<00:03:35.169> victory<00:03:35.500> at<00:03:35.620> least<00:03:35.799> for<00:03:36.069> the

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:36.159 
part of the victory at least for the

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.039 
part of the victory at least for the
foreseeable<00:03:36.310> future<00:03:36.729> and<00:03:37.269> then<00:03:37.569> as<00:03:37.689> well<00:03:37.900> as

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
foreseeable future and then as well as

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:39.599 
foreseeable future and then as well as
torkoal<00:03:38.560> has<00:03:38.709> tried<00:03:38.949> especially<00:03:39.430> in<00:03:39.519> Japan

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
torkoal has tried especially in Japan

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.179 
torkoal has tried especially in Japan
and<00:03:40.150> it's<00:03:40.750> pretty<00:03:40.959> much<00:03:41.049> never<00:03:41.829> really

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:42.189 
and it's pretty much never really

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:43.770 
and it's pretty much never really
gravitated<00:03:42.939> to<00:03:43.030> that<00:03:43.060> point<00:03:43.449> where<00:03:43.569> it's<00:03:43.689> just

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
gravitated to that point where it's just

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.050 
gravitated to that point where it's just
like<00:03:43.900> you<00:03:44.079> know<00:03:44.199> massive<00:03:44.859> while<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.699> anime

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
like you know massive while the anime

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.729 
like you know massive while the anime
actually<00:03:46.239> is<00:03:46.599> doing<00:03:46.840> pretty<00:03:47.049> well<00:03:47.139> but<00:03:47.560> mainly

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
actually is doing pretty well but mainly

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.949 
actually is doing pretty well but mainly
a<00:03:48.129> lot<00:03:48.459> of<00:03:48.549> people<00:03:48.790> speculate<00:03:49.090> as<00:03:49.389> due<00:03:49.629> to<00:03:49.659> it

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
a lot of people speculate as due to it

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.990 
a lot of people speculate as due to it
airing<00:03:50.290> directly<00:03:50.769> after<00:03:51.069> one<00:03:51.220> piece<00:03:51.489> Toriko

airing directly after one piece Toriko
airs<00:03:52.329> in<00:03:52.509> Japan<00:03:52.810> so<00:03:53.139> a<00:03:53.199> lot<00:03:53.319> of<00:03:53.349> people<00:03:53.620> say

haven't been up to the expectations of
what<00:03:57.939> it<00:03:57.970> should<00:03:58.209> be<00:03:58.359> when<00:03:58.599> considering<00:03:59.139> and

00:03:59.249 --> 00:03:59.259 
what it should be when considering and

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:01.080 
what it should be when considering and

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.969 
had what four crossovers with one piece
and<00:04:01.299> a<00:04:01.509> crossover<00:04:01.930> with<00:04:02.199> Dragon<00:04:02.500> Ball<00:04:02.650> Z<00:04:02.859> in

and a crossover with Dragon Ball Z in

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:04.890 
and a crossover with Dragon Ball Z in
one<00:04:03.159> piece<00:04:03.400> and<00:04:03.639> the<00:04:04.209> fact<00:04:04.419> that<00:04:04.569> matter<00:04:04.720> is

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
one piece and the fact that matter is

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.780 
one piece and the fact that matter is
it's<00:04:05.049> still<00:04:05.259> being<00:04:05.439> outsold<00:04:05.859> by<00:04:06.040> series<00:04:06.669> like

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
it's still being outsold by series like

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.099 
it's still being outsold by series like
bleach<00:04:07.090> and<00:04:07.419> even<00:04:07.629> moggy

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
bleach and even moggy

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:09.719 
bleach and even moggy
and<00:04:08.319> tons<00:04:08.769> of<00:04:08.859> other<00:04:09.009> different<00:04:09.340> series<00:04:09.609> as

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:09.729 
and tons of other different series as

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:11.309 
and tons of other different series as
well<00:04:09.879> so<00:04:10.329> a<00:04:10.359> lot<00:04:10.449> of<00:04:10.659> people<00:04:10.900> speculate<00:04:11.169> that

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
well so a lot of people speculate that

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.170 
well so a lot of people speculate that
you<00:04:11.859> know<00:04:11.949> these<00:04:12.099> series<00:04:12.489> they<00:04:12.609> came<00:04:12.879> and<00:04:13.120> they

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
you know these series they came and they

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.699 
you know these series they came and they
try<00:04:13.479> but<00:04:13.509> they<00:04:13.870> just<00:04:14.139> really<00:04:14.409> haven't

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
try but they just really haven't

is<00:05:30.440> the<00:05:30.560> moment<00:05:30.740> where<00:05:31.310> manga<00:05:31.790> and<00:05:32.000> anime<00:05:32.450> can

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
is the moment where manga and anime can

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.660

is your big three because I think at

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.409 
is your big three because I think at
this<00:07:36.530> particular<00:07:36.710> point<00:07:37.340> the<00:07:37.550> big<00:07:37.970> three<00:07:38.240> is

00:07:38.409 --> 00:07:38.419 
this particular point the big three is

00:07:38.419 --> 00:07:40.210 
this particular point the big three is
what<00:07:38.630> you<00:07:38.870> make<00:07:39.110> it<00:07:39.289> whether<00:07:39.470> it's<00:07:39.740> your<00:07:39.949> three

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:40.220 
what you make it whether it's your three

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.100 
what you make it whether it's your three
favorite<00:07:40.430> manga<00:07:40.820> whether<00:07:41.510> it's<00:07:41.720> the<00:07:41.870> three

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:42.110 
favorite manga whether it's the three

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:43.719 
favorite manga whether it's the three
that<00:07:42.289> are<00:07:42.410> you<00:07:42.710> know<00:07:42.830> what<00:07:43.010> you<00:07:43.099> consider<00:07:43.520> the

00:07:43.719 --> 00:07:43.729 
that are you know what you consider the

00:07:43.729 --> 00:07:45.310 
that are you know what you consider the
best<00:07:44.060> or<00:07:44.270> whatnot<00:07:44.599> because<00:07:44.720> at<00:07:44.990> this<00:07:45.110> point

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:45.320 
best or whatnot because at this point

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.839 
best or whatnot because at this point
the<00:07:45.500> victory<00:07:45.830> is<00:07:45.919> broken<00:07:46.160> and<00:07:46.430> I<00:07:46.460> think<00:07:46.699> that

00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:46.849 
the victory is broken and I think that

00:07:46.849 --> 00:07:48.610 
the victory is broken and I think that
it<00:07:47.030> just<00:07:47.360> makes<00:07:47.570> sense<00:07:47.780> to<00:07:47.990> say<00:07:48.139> the<00:07:48.260> victory

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:48.620 
it just makes sense to say the victory

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.080 
it just makes sense to say the victory
is<00:07:48.710> what<00:07:48.919> you<00:07:49.160> make<00:07:49.400> it<00:07:49.430> because<00:07:49.880> at<00:07:49.970> the<00:07:50.060> end

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:50.090 
is what you make it because at the end

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:51.370 
is what you make it because at the end
of<00:07:50.270> the<00:07:50.330> day<00:07:50.419> you<00:07:50.479> shouldn't<00:07:50.810> rank<00:07:50.990> manga

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:51.380 
of the day you shouldn't rank manga

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.810 
of the day you shouldn't rank manga
based<00:07:51.530> on<00:07:51.770> sales<00:07:52.039> and<00:07:52.159> whatnot<00:07:52.490> it<00:07:52.580> should<00:07:52.729> be

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:52.820 
based on sales and whatnot it should be

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:54.219 
based on sales and whatnot it should be
because<00:07:52.970> of<00:07:53.240> your<00:07:53.389> preference<00:07:53.840> and<00:07:53.990> what<00:07:54.110> you
