00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.130
 dream of knowing the 'chicharito' as 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:15.410
 how did this start that you wanted 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:17.150

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.810
 and you like how you like the 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.370
 'chicharito' of how he plays so that he does not 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:27.650
 makes mistakes 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:29.900
 this is very good playing 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.430
 and that kind of thing like celebrate your 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.579
 goals 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:42.809
 screaming goal as it runs 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:42.809
 nothing stops me and in the agent and I get 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.670
 Hector, how do you give that idea to your 

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:51.190

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.350
 I gave away a T-shirt and you see it only 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.109

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.449

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.980

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.530

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.600
