00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
of the Cusack's screamer this one I

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.100 
of the Cusack's screamer this one I
think<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.340> pretty<00:01:41.790> much<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.150> best<00:01:42.420> value<00:01:42.869> I

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
think is pretty much the best value I

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.210 
think is pretty much the best value I
think<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.380> retails<00:01:43.710> for<00:01:43.770> around<00:01:43.920> one<00:01:44.159> hundred

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
think it retails for around one hundred

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.760 
think it retails for around one hundred
fifty<00:01:44.520> dollars<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.720> can<00:01:45.899> do<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.320> search<00:01:46.590> on

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
fifty dollars and you can do a search on
