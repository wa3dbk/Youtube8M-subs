00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
electric start model Hughes so this was

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.160 
electric start model Hughes so this was

considered the real he-man Sportster and

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.429 
considered the real he-man Sportster and
these<00:01:40.170> were<00:01:40.350> known<00:01:40.560> in<00:01:40.590> their<00:01:41.040> day<00:01:41.219> is

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
these were known in their day is

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.660 
these were known in their day is
notoriously<00:01:43.439> hard<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.890> start<00:01:44.189> but<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.430> always

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
notoriously hard to start but I always

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.310 
notoriously hard to start but I always
considered<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.630> was<00:01:45.750> just<00:01:45.869> people<00:01:46.200> who

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
considered that that was just people who

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.529 
considered that that was just people who
didn't<00:01:46.590> understand<00:01:47.040> how<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.189> start<00:01:47.579> them<00:01:47.729> it's

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
didn't understand how to start them it's

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.480 
didn't understand how to start them it's
not<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.869> hard<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.170> start<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.710> little<00:01:49.979> little

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
not that hard to start a little little

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.889 
not that hard to start a little little
tricks<00:01:50.789> you<00:01:50.880> have<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.210> know<00:01:51.329> when<00:01:51.509> it's<00:01:51.659> cold

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
tricks you have to know when it's cold

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.120 
tricks you have to know when it's cold
and<00:01:52.110> then<00:01:52.289> when<00:01:52.439> it's<00:01:52.560> warm<00:01:52.799> it's<00:01:53.039> usually

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
and then when it's warm it's usually

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.130 
and then when it's warm it's usually
pretty<00:01:53.399> good<00:01:53.579> because<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.570> has<00:01:54.719> what's<00:01:54.930> called

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
pretty good because it has what's called

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.830 
pretty good because it has what's called
a<00:01:55.229> Tillotson<00:01:55.770> carburetor<00:01:56.450> Dolson<00:01:57.450> carburetor

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
doesn't have a float Bowl so there's no

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.590 
doesn't have a float Bowl so there's no

it<00:03:07.290> around<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:07.620> building<00:03:07.980> which<00:03:08.580> is<00:03:08.790> pretty

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
it around the building which is pretty

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.360 
it around the building which is pretty

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
close to the truth it had a few things

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.890 
close to the truth it had a few things
that<00:03:11.550> were<00:03:11.640> wrong<00:03:11.850> with<00:03:11.910> it<00:03:12.270> and<00:03:12.450> which<00:03:12.720> I

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
that were wrong with it and which I

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.420 
that were wrong with it and which I
fixed<00:03:13.350> since<00:03:13.860> then<00:03:14.130> and<00:03:15.590> he<00:03:16.590> kind<00:03:16.830> of<00:03:16.920> laments

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
fixed since then and he kind of laments

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.950 
fixed since then and he kind of laments
the<00:03:17.490> fact<00:03:17.820> that<00:03:17.970> he<00:03:18.120> sold<00:03:18.360> it<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.630> me<00:03:18.780> now<00:03:18.930> I

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
the fact that he sold it to me now I

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.230 
the fact that he sold it to me now I
think<00:03:19.140> because<00:03:19.680> it<00:03:19.800> gets<00:03:20.010> it<00:03:20.670> gets<00:03:20.850> a<00:03:20.940> lot<00:03:21.090> of

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
think because it gets it gets a lot of
