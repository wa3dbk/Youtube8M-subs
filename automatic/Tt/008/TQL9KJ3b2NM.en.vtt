00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 and how about youtubers this time 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.259
 I bring a tutorial which deals with what 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.710
 who are reading at this moment x 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.030
 good this serves for everything for example 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.880
 install some rom that now you do not 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.820
 like it because it's going very slow it serves to 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.830
 this and you're going to install a rom and you did 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.039
 something wrong for that reason and now it does not happen 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.240
 the logo of Samsung Galaxy Young serves 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.820
 for this the camera is no longer useful 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.710
 It serves for this well with a lot 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.450
 attention because here I show you how 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.450
 get it back we start kids 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.890
 given my case that install a rom the rom 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.260
 very well known perfection but does not have 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.060
 nothing perfect for me obviously already 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.070
 that maybe when installing it 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.320
 I did something wrong and he does not read my sign 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.450
 from the telcel operator good as well as 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.670
 I already mentioned this phrase or joker 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.739
 Apart from being very simple it is very easy 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.460
 well let's go to the computer to 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.460
 prepare the odin 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.040
 You will know that it will come in a file 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.590
 winrar click secondary extract here or in 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.900
 English extra here is worth a folder 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.760
 with six files two will be of hate nor 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.920
 the others the stock rom and all that 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.750
 we will use you I leave you in another folder 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.119
 called rice to make the superuser 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.979
 because unfortunately you lose it already 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.410
 you know you should execute the hate as 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.409
 administrator from windows vista up 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:33.050
 windows 8 1 on the pda button we will choose 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:35.240
 the file with the name obviously sticks 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.580
 on the phone button changes a little 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.690
 just by the name here we will choose the 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.510
 file with the name mode 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.400
 and as expected the file cst 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.570
 corresponds the file with the same 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.570
 csc name 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.049
 now we must put the phone in mode 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.880
 useful as we make it very easy to the 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.369
 same way as we enter the mode 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.680
 recovery the only thing that changes is the key 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.960
 of volume or I mean by those who 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.000
 they do not know how to enter the recovery for 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.100
 enter is the power button plus the 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.380
 home button plus the volume button towards 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.530
 down until the next one appears 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.530
 warning 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.180
 to enter deep mode I just pressed the 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.310
 volume button up and ready 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.310
 that's all we pass to the pc 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.459
 and to the computer what we will do is 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.490
 connect through uzb the cell phone up 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.410
 that recognizes it as knowing that already 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.990
 he recognized very simple the odin says to 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.120
 see and you put the rectangle yellow eye 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.190
 if you do not recognize it download the samsung 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.590
 kies and he installs the drivers for 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.870
 to recognize it that they must restart 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.610
 hatred or return to prepare after 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.620
 to connect and read the cell phone only 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.750
 press start to start flashing 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.440
 this takes a little while so be 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.440
 patients 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.420
 the phone will reboot and it will install 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.730
 the stock wheel and we wait a few 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.600
 minutes so everything is 100% 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.600
 functional vale 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.359
 there is the samsung galaxy 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:23.969
 young with the original stock rom is only 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:26.189
 issue of setting it up and it would be all 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:28.739
 The only thing I want to tell you is that 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:30.569
 I have a long time without uploading video but 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.939
 I hope to be more active since I have not 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:36.379
 could a great apology I hope you 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:36.379
 like and until the next bye
