 loved the color of techno came from this 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:30.070

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:31.869
 nude salmon and it's number 372 and then 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.490
 the others all because I have not opened them 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.590
 I can not tell them exactly how about 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:41.020
 the color with my skin or anything but it 's the 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:43.689
 number 541 by the number 522 and then 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.090
 also ordered accessories these are for 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:48.340

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.960
 hair and a wristband but that very 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.179
 pretty like pearls because she already knows 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.499
 What mesh does pearls love? 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:57.969

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.629
