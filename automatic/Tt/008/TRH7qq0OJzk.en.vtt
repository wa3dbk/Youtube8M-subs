00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.000
 and are welcome to a new video on 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.920
 this video I'm going to show you a secret or 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.389
 a trick that you can find in the 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.580
 marker or phone your 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.230
 Android devices in my case you can 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.279
 use these covers and nou 3 905 this 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.199
 trick works for all 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.350
 Android devices in the case that I 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:29.960
 I have tried on axis 2s 5 the nou 3 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.760
 and in that heart is marc 4 mini and has 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.110
 cooked years all devices each 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.390
 have a different software version 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.430
 and some have different roms 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.420
 with which it works automatically in 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.370
 all the trick is the following asterisk 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:47.250
 pad 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:50.190
 but asterisk and pad 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.080
 Once that's the trick it will take you to 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.900
 this new page you will find these 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.730
 sections each of these sections 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.890
 It has a different function and 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:06.360
 depending on the device you will have more or 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:08.250
 less windows the first is that it be a 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.310
 dead red pixel that are the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.530
 that more often then die in this case 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.850
 you move, they would all be perfect 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.850
 the next good green 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.410
 and the next one in blue that would go then 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.680
 the first three that the nou 3 brings 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.600
 we would get a reservation that would be for the 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.220
 emergent beep is tucked in and getting 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.100
 both a prayer vicars and the speaker 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.320
 is damaged for some reason what 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.590
 then the vibration 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:42.369
 for now I do not know if I 'll be listening 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.420
 [Music] 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.640
 the device is fighting a 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.820
 serial screen pound and to be of 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.740
 high is the next dining that serves 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.170
 to see the density of the colors without 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.020
 would be in touch if after dark 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:01.790
 touch then it's brighter to see the 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.890
 brightness shutter quality 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.420
 the next one would be the megafield that 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.220
 would be processed in the rear camera if 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.910
 has some failure to work and also 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:14.510
 you can take pictures 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.849
 [Music] 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.939
 these would be reflected once here 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.799
 or in the camera the next the sensor and 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:23.900
 if you are subscribers of my channel 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.439
 original scimitar main stand 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.329
 remix 

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:29.090
 I just uploaded a video of how to fix 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:31.720
 the sensor and that sensor once this 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.129
 it's broken you'll have something like this 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.080
 constantly like this once you enter the 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:38.210
 sensor screen will appear this 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.650
 and you have it fixed that is in the video 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.320
 but has dreamed how to repair you will not have 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.090
 something like this there is a drive information 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.160
 over the sensor the latitude proximity the 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.910
 gyroscope etcetera and once for is the 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.920
 hand then sensor 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.630
 his bookstore would start to vibrate already 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.850
 changing the green color would indicate that 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:58.640
 it only works perfectly then 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.640
 we would have everything that would be the system 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.160
 here you have that with your finger I do not know if 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.760
 I can see all the squares that 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.760
 appear on the screen 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.980
 to see if it works completely 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.300
 original and perfectly system 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.250
 touch of your device 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.060
 a disconnected person I will return to the 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.270
 Home Screen 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.600
 the other one would be the one that would be 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:28.540
 to use them without touching the screen 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.720
 extending and had works pretty 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.490
 pretty good let's do it yesterday I 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.720
 recommended doing it with spain since 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:39.710
 it would come out better let's do it I repeat it is 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.080
 Quick 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.270
 and so you will have to find out all 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.450
 the operations failures or errors that 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.710
 contain your android device 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.220
 situation slip to solve the 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.970
 lock and unlock buttons 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.120
 loudspeaker 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.170
 [Music] 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.280
 [Applause] 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.280
 [Music] 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:08.390
 the song is linen for all 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.150
 subway devices 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.010
 it would be 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.319
 this is also the same known as 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.610
 seen before the front camera that 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.350
 what you are visualizing would be 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.810
 the front camera you can also take out 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.030
 I'm going to open a camera 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.949
 would be in copyright another would be the 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.509
 led as you are seeing a red and you play 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:27.729
 green and touch this blue 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:30.039
 obviously you will have more colors than in 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:32.710
 others have more colors but these 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:34.270
 options by finding those three then 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.470
 we would have the wall context that would be 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.470
 to use it with the external 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:46.220
 yellows that are going to see yes 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.500
 and now perfectly put peace 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:52.820
 of pressing more I would have more and I would be 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:55.640
 completely done that you keep the led 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.820
 of air which etc. so this would be 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.220
 the little trick options that brings you the 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.290
 small marker think are want but 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.640
 three children the device then so 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.580
 you can see if there is any parameter of 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.320
 this device that does not work now 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.550
 well I say goodbye and we do not see in the next 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.550
 goodbye video
