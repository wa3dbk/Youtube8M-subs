00:00:07.234 --> 00:00:08.114
- hello everyone!

00:00:08.114 --> 00:00:11.209
it's the 2nd day of the group stage of the International tournament

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:12.522
now we'll talk to Na'Vi player

00:00:12.522 --> 00:00:14.469
Gleb Funn1k Lipatnikov

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:15.499
Hello, Gleb!

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:16.735
the 1st question is

00:00:16.735 --> 00:00:18.835
what do you think about this International?

00:00:18.835 --> 00:00:22.348
what is the difference between this one and the previous?

00:00:22.348 --> 00:00:23.608
what do you feel about it?

00:00:23.608 --> 00:00:24.358
- hello!

00:00:24.358 --> 00:00:28.374
only the group stage is different here

00:00:28.374 --> 00:00:33.438
the rest is the same as was the last year

00:00:33.438 --> 00:00:37.061
our hotel is comfortable enough but is was much more interesting

00:00:37.061 --> 00:00:43.593
to ramble in Valve office and there was much more free food there

00:00:46.665 --> 00:00:52.665
- I heard many guys saying that the tournaments held in the hotel

00:00:52.665 --> 00:00:57.539
is convenient but at the same time it makes players too relaxed

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.990
as everyone feels like at home here

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.177
what's your opinion?

00:00:59.053 --> 00:01:05.025
- well, I also feel too quaggy and there I felt like ready to play

00:01:05.025 --> 00:01:13.896
I support the opinion that some kind of tiredness is felt

00:01:16.121 --> 00:01:18.082
while playing  in the hotel

00:01:19.705 --> 00:01:23.729
- ok, let's talk about games which were held yesterday and today

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.884
what can you say about the teams? which ones you liked, which ones surprised or

00:01:27.884 --> 00:01:30.603
disappointed you after watching their games?

00:01:30.603 --> 00:01:32.981
- I was disappointed by Chinese teams

00:01:32.981 --> 00:01:34.743
LGD.international and TongFu

00:01:34.743 --> 00:01:38.821
I thought they would play much better and wouldn't lose their games

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:42.015
especially with the opponents they had

00:01:42.712 --> 00:01:45.650
Fnatic surprised me a lot

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.641
they are in the Top of the group

00:01:49.641 --> 00:01:54.683
as well as Team Dignitas which won LGD

00:01:55.341 --> 00:01:58.328
I didn't expect such a situation

00:02:00.165 --> 00:02:03.417
- ok, talking about the Chinese teams, let's mention for those,

00:02:03.417 --> 00:02:07.514
who didn't know that you were training in China for 2 weeks

00:02:07.514 --> 00:02:10.684
they have won more online tournaments

00:02:10.684 --> 00:02:16.837
what did you understand about the game for yourself for the time you spent in China?

00:02:16.837 --> 00:02:18.400
what about the team's mood?

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.211
Can you describe?

00:02:20.416 --> 00:02:25.619
- well, when we got there we had a great fall in the team

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:31.493
we lost a few games and start quarreling in the result

00:02:31.493 --> 00:02:33.275
our moral philosophy has suffered

00:02:33.275 --> 00:02:39.539
after that we got together and started to move up

00:02:39.745 --> 00:02:46.555
it was very interesting process, it was like new establishment of the team

00:02:47.993 --> 00:02:50.795
as for the things we understood about the game

00:02:50.795 --> 00:02:52.994
I think, we understood a lot

00:02:52.994 --> 00:02:57.995
in comparison with the Chinese team, we received much more than they did

00:02:57.995 --> 00:03:03.836
- are you talking about self-confidence or some playing issues?

00:03:03.836 --> 00:03:06.514
- I guess in gaming

00:03:06.514 --> 00:03:11.572
we got used to play with them in their China Dota 2

00:03:11.572 --> 00:03:13.774
we make special picks for them

00:03:13.774 --> 00:03:17.058
we gained also a moral philosophy as well

00:03:17.058 --> 00:03:20.790
we understood that Chinese teams aren't as strong as they used to be

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.433
we have a chance to win them

00:03:22.433 --> 00:03:28.367
- before leaving for Seattle you played in Kiev for a few days

00:03:28.367 --> 00:03:32.856
though you had a choice to stay in Barcelona or Lvov

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.423
why did you decide to go to Kiev?

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.282
- to tell the truth I guess it had no difference where to stay

00:03:41.282 --> 00:03:44.813
this bootcamp hadn't so much sense

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:49.892
everything that was so much necessary for us happened in China

00:03:50.221 --> 00:03:53.429
that's why we played in order to keep our gaming shape

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.760
- I think this question will be interesting for our fans

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.772
especially hose who have a compendium

00:03:59.772 --> 00:04:00.694
- do you have it?

00:04:00.694 --> 00:04:01.710
- sure!

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.099
- what about fantasy lineup?

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.306
have you already chosen anyone?

00:04:07.534 --> 00:04:09.267
- I can't tell you immediately

00:04:09.267 --> 00:04:17.705
I chose Hao, yyf, support.net and someone else

00:04:17.705 --> 00:04:20.161
I even can't remember who was that

00:04:20.161 --> 00:04:21.621
I didn't choose XBOCT for sure

00:04:21.877 --> 00:04:23.307
- for 4?

00:04:23.307 --> 00:04:24.892
- He has his 5 already!

00:04:24.892 --> 00:04:26.055
- that's great!

00:04:26.055 --> 00:04:29.720
what can you say about you playing performance as yesterday you wrote

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.220
that you hadn't shown your best

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.242
did it happen because you haven't got used yet or what's the point?

00:04:35.242 --> 00:04:37.410
- I even don't know how to explain

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.804
I think it's because of the flight

00:04:38.804 --> 00:04:40.830
I couldn't sleep well for a few days and

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:47.348
I feel I haven't used to this place yet

00:04:47.348 --> 00:04:56.973
today I feel much better and I think it will become better ad better

00:04:56.973 --> 00:04:58.196
- ok, thanks for the interview

00:04:58.196 --> 00:05:02.500
I think we'll talk on the Grand Final in Seattle and

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.410
you'll tell us something new about the tournament

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.094
thank you, see you, bye!
