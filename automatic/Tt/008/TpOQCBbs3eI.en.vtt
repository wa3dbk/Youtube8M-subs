00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.120 
just eating healthy I'm eating foods
that<00:02:40.150> I<00:02:40.270> want<00:02:40.630> I<00:02:40.840> do<00:02:41.200> have<00:02:41.470> my<00:02:41.650> cheat<00:02:41.890> meals

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
that I want I do have my cheat meals

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.240 
that I want I do have my cheat meals
every<00:02:42.610> two<00:02:42.790> weeks<00:02:43.060> but<00:02:43.660> this<00:02:44.020> ate<00:02:44.320> our<00:02:44.710> diet

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
every two weeks but this ate our diet

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.820 
every two weeks but this ate our diet
seems<00:02:45.940> pretty<00:02:46.570> interesting<00:02:47.230> so<00:02:47.590> basically

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
seems pretty interesting so basically

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.070 
seems pretty interesting so basically
what<00:02:48.010> it<00:02:48.040> is<00:02:48.130> is<00:02:48.490> that<00:02:48.670> you're<00:02:48.790> fasting<00:02:49.360> for<00:02:49.690> 16

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
what it is is that you're fasting for 16

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.470 
what it is is that you're fasting for 16
hours<00:02:50.230> out<00:02:50.590> of<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.770> day<00:02:50.860> and<00:02:51.220> you<00:02:51.850> only<00:02:52.150> have

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
hours out of the day and you only have

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.860 
hours out of the day and you only have
an<00:02:52.630> eight-hour<00:02:53.140> window<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:54.340> eat<00:02:54.780> so<00:02:55.780> I

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
an eight-hour window to eat so I

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.540 
an eight-hour window to eat so I
actually<00:02:56.290> kind<00:02:56.680> of<00:02:56.710> like<00:02:56.770> this<00:02:57.070> idea<00:02:57.370> i<00:02:57.460> think

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
actually kind of like this idea i think

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.760 
actually kind of like this idea i think
that<00:02:58.090> would<00:02:58.210> actually<00:02:58.270> work<00:02:58.690> for<00:02:59.020> me<00:02:59.350> but<00:02:59.680> like

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
that would actually work for me but like

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.800 
that would actually work for me but like
i<00:02:59.890> said<00:02:59.920> i<00:03:00.130> want<00:03:00.280> to<00:03:00.370> do<00:03:00.460> a<00:03:00.670> lot<00:03:01.150> more<00:03:01.210> research

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
i said i want to do a lot more research

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.620 
i said i want to do a lot more research
on<00:03:02.050> it<00:03:02.110> but<00:03:02.770> it's<00:03:02.800> funny<00:03:03.250> i<00:03:03.520> seen<00:03:04.030> in<00:03:04.210> actually
