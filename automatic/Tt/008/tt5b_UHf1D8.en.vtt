 gima network and welcome to this new one 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.710
 video in which I will explain how 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.870
 improve the technical sector 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.790
 registry of lost docs using a 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.230
 small program very easy to 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.840
 download and install e 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.020
 absolutely free called with her 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.020
 face 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.040
 as the most attentive of you yes 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.410
 will remember place was announced 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.540
 at the e3 of 2012 with a trailer that 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.879
 showed a technical sector 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.100
 absolutely amazing at the exit 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.480
 of the game of shops we are however found again 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.190
 in his hands the technical department e 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.199
 graphic that absolutely not 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.420
 mirrored what ubisoft had 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:52.489
 announced many comparison videos between 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.320
 Real quality trailer of the game have 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.000
 demonstrated a truly abysmal gap 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.129
 which made us think that it was a game 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.670
 absolutely by a graded however much 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.530
 regards the friars compartment to move 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.570
 like while at night the game 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.640
 has a graphic absolutely 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.979
 amazing sure not at the levels of 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.140
 trainer in the daytime sections the game 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.640
 both an almost embarrassing flatness that 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.430
 reminds almost of a game of the past 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.670
 ps3 and xbox 360 generation 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.009
 well in aid of pc players comes 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.590
 a small program called twitter 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.649
 fi that the most geeks surely 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.750
 will have already used for other games 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.970
 a small program defect or xvi from 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.890
 face that allows you to add many 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.990
 effects to the game and make it definitely 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.970
 much more pleasant to play 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.590
 the program is absolutely easy to 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.200
 install easy to download 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.550
 in this video I'll explain how it's done 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.229
 in're already seeing the substrate 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.349
 images that compare the 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.970
 As sweet fx with the actual quality 

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:52.310
 of the month game which are these balances of 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.190
 Extra quadrature here is that this area 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.750
 ago you can already see is a comparison 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.459
 right with the screen from the other two 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.679
 between the game played with the fixed sled 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:02.509
 mimmo in a moment surely there is a 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:03.800
 big difference especially in the 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.619
 color saturation e 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.170
 in lighting therefore how to download 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.510
 this little program for first 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.760
 what will you have to go on this web page 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.340
 is the one found in the description and is the 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.430
 page of a present of witech linz 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.390
 what I personally recommend 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.400
 use inside of 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.970
 boston because it's a good compromise 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.880
 between unbridled lighting and realism 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.080
 in short, it does not make the game ultra 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.330
 sbrilluccicoso you make a lot of colors 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.220
 Realistic known much darker than cases 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.480
 comparisons you are seeing once 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.580
 went to this page 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.459
 you will have to download not the present because 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.050
 37 should be installed on those who have 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.209
 already downloaded once on time 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.770
 you will have to download from this link 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.150
 I'm selecting right now 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.730
 which in any case you will find in 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.680
 description this small file rar one 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.209
 Once unpacked, these will appear 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.790
 here you simply have to file 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.830
 go to the main folder of the 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.959
 game enter the folder where it was 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.050
 there is the point watchdog executable file 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:04.730
 exe and simply copy all the files 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.720
 that you downloaded inside 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.040
 this folder 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.470
 once this is done, it will suffice 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.620
 started the game and here it will be 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.970
 accomplished the severe magic a great one 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.360
 push forward from the point of view 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.430
 thank you 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.090
 if you want to change something 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.489
 within the configuration of the 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:25.510
 game you can either edit via 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.980
 each case more top graphic settings 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.690
 in any case they can continue to be 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.400
 used if you can't go 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.920
 simply in the file on 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.019
 twitter phoenix settings and change 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.180
 one of the many voices you are 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.040
 seeing at this moment each of the 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.690
 what will be an actual change 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.970
 in the graphic quality of the game 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.160
 of course some changes will have 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.040
 more impact on game performance 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.690
 some changes less than the only thing a 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.120
 you will have to pay attention to 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.549
 given lysis if you activate the Athenians 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.590
 giving sweet hicks you wo n't be able to activate it 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.630
 from within the game because in that 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.150
 case the game we will crash 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.440
 the institution is not activated in this pre-set 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.150
 leasing then used 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.739
 quietly that of the game in 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.200
 right now you are seeing the graphic 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:12.049
 of the game with all the settings made at 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:14.150
 maximum I'm playing on a gtx 7 70 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:15.920
 when a moment the settings I am 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.070
 holding therefore this more or less is the 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:22.190
 technical department that you can obtain 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.930
 with a configuration of the kind said 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.940
 this I hope this little video
