00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
this thing was coming from China like

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.250 
this thing was coming from China like
probably<00:00:14.730> 90%<00:00:15.330> of<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.990> stuff<00:00:16.230> I<00:00:16.470> buy<00:00:16.650> on<00:00:16.980> eBay

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
probably 90% of the stuff I buy on eBay

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.710 
probably 90% of the stuff I buy on eBay
and<00:00:19.260> I<00:00:19.650> don't<00:00:19.710> mind<00:00:20.130> it's<00:00:20.369> cheap<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.359> stuff

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
and I don't mind it's cheap and stuff

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.460 
and I don't mind it's cheap and stuff
for<00:00:22.560> me<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.800> buy<00:00:22.980> this<00:00:23.250> around<00:00:23.609> here<00:00:24.090> would<00:00:24.470> be

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
for me to buy this around here would be

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.859 
for me to buy this around here would be
quite<00:00:25.680> expensive<00:00:26.099> and<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:27.119> can't<00:00:27.720> really

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
quite expensive and I can't really

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:39.830 
quite expensive and I can't really
afford<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.619> so

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.300 

they<00:00:40.840> use<00:00:41.020> some<00:00:41.350> good<00:00:41.500> tape<00:00:41.830> right<00:00:42.160> there

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.310 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.340 

alrighty<00:00:48.310> so<00:00:48.670> this<00:00:48.820> might<00:00:49.090> be<00:00:49.420> a<00:00:49.870> bit<00:00:50.140> of<00:00:50.260> a

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
alrighty so this might be a bit of a

00:00:50.350 --> 00:01:01.200 
alrighty so this might be a bit of a
hint<00:00:50.620> as<00:00:50.830> what<00:00:51.489> this<00:00:51.730> thing<00:00:52.030> is<00:01:00.120> there's<00:01:01.120> a

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.210 
hint as what this thing is there's a

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.750 
hint as what this thing is there's a
clamp<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:04.420> it's<00:01:04.600> one<00:01:04.900> of<00:01:05.020> those<00:01:05.310> boom<00:01:06.310> mic

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
clamp and it's one of those boom mic

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.040 
clamp and it's one of those boom mic
stands<00:01:07.210> I<00:01:07.690> hope<00:01:07.930> it's<00:01:08.140> got<00:01:08.290> the<00:01:08.470> right<00:01:08.619> I<00:01:10.050> don't

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
stands I hope it's got the right I don't

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.660 
stands I hope it's got the right I don't
think<00:01:11.229> that's<00:01:11.619> got<00:01:11.860> great<00:01:12.009> end<00:01:12.399> on<00:01:12.670> for<00:01:13.259> my<00:01:14.259> mic

think that's got great end on for my mic

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.730 
think that's got great end on for my mic
this<00:01:15.670> is<00:01:15.910> the<00:01:16.060> mic<00:01:16.240> I<00:01:16.420> want<00:01:16.660> to<00:01:16.750> put<00:01:16.930> on<00:01:17.110> it<00:01:17.140> the

this is the mic I want to put on it the
boot<00:01:18.040> snowball<00:01:20.040> yeah<00:01:21.040> I<00:01:21.220> guess<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:21.729> only<00:01:21.880> way

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
boot snowball yeah I guess the only way

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:29.900 
boot snowball yeah I guess the only way
to<00:01:22.180> know<00:01:22.509> is<00:01:23.130> try<00:01:27.720> this<00:01:28.720> thing<00:01:29.020> was<00:01:29.229> dirt<00:01:29.590> cheap

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
to know is try this thing was dirt cheap

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.830 
to know is try this thing was dirt cheap
and<00:01:30.910> the<00:01:31.660> quality<00:01:32.200> is<00:01:32.259> probably<00:01:32.560> gonna<00:01:33.840> gonna

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
and the quality is probably gonna gonna

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.830 
and the quality is probably gonna gonna
show<00:01:35.229> and<00:01:35.590> the<00:01:35.710> price<00:01:36.160> but<00:01:39.479> but<00:01:40.479> it<00:01:40.600> should

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
show and the price but but it should

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.469 
show and the price but but it should
work<00:01:40.869> for<00:01:41.380> what<00:01:41.530> I<00:01:41.560> need<00:01:41.890> it<00:01:42.039> for<00:01:42.280> it's<00:01:43.270> got

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
work for what I need it for it's got

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:46.530 
work for what I need it for it's got
quite<00:01:43.659> a<00:01:43.840> lot<00:01:43.990> of<00:01:44.020> tension<00:01:44.710> so<00:01:45.040> I<00:01:45.310> would<00:01:46.299> say

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
quite a lot of tension so I would say

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.990 
quite a lot of tension so I would say
should<00:01:46.600> hold<00:01:47.170> that<00:01:47.320> mic<00:01:47.740> with<00:01:48.310> a<00:01:48.340> too<00:01:48.760> much

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
should hold that mic with a too much

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.140 
should hold that mic with a too much
trouble<00:01:49.860> like<00:01:50.860> I<00:01:51.040> said<00:01:51.280> I<00:01:51.310> don't<00:01:51.549> think<00:01:51.760> that's

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
trouble like I said I don't think that's

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.330 
trouble like I said I don't think that's
gonna<00:01:52.390> I<00:01:52.840> don't<00:01:53.440> think<00:01:53.590> that's<00:01:53.860> going<00:01:54.070> to<00:01:54.130> work

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
gonna I don't think that's going to work

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.410 
gonna I don't think that's going to work

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
won't be using it because I'm using this

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.970

blue snowball but

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.220 
blue snowball but
it's<00:02:32.670> a<00:02:32.730> shame<00:02:32.970> because<00:02:33.270> I<00:02:33.480> really<00:02:33.810> like<00:02:34.020> the

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
it's a shame because I really like the

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.369 
it's a shame because I really like the
stand<00:02:34.590> that<00:02:35.390> comes<00:02:36.390> with<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.810> blue<00:02:36.989> snowball

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
stand that comes with the blue snowball

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.729 
stand that comes with the blue snowball
but<00:02:37.950> it's<00:02:38.160> just<00:02:38.370> not<00:02:38.610> convenient<00:02:39.180> for<00:02:39.780> my

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
but it's just not convenient for my

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.250 
but it's just not convenient for my
application<00:02:44.060> obviously<00:02:45.060> I'm<00:02:45.720> going<00:02:45.959> to<00:02:46.050> keep

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
application obviously I'm going to keep

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.920 
application obviously I'm going to keep
it<00:02:46.500> just<00:02:49.489> you<00:02:50.489> know<00:02:50.610> just<00:02:51.030> in<00:02:51.269> case<00:02:51.300> because

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
it just you know just in case because

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.080 
it just you know just in case because
you<00:02:52.319> never<00:02:52.440> know<00:02:52.739> I<00:02:52.769> might<00:02:53.690> break<00:02:54.690> this<00:02:55.019> old

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
you never know I might break this old

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.570 
you never know I might break this old
cheapy<00:02:57.090> thing<00:02:57.360> and<00:02:57.660> need<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.530> other<00:02:59.280> one

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
cheapy thing and need that other one

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:06.729 
cheapy thing and need that other one
someday<00:03:04.160> that<00:03:05.160> thing<00:03:05.370> will<00:03:05.519> definitely<00:03:06.120> hold

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
someday that thing will definitely hold

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.250 
someday that thing will definitely hold
so<00:03:07.739> this<00:03:07.860> a<00:03:07.890> little<00:03:08.310> flop<00:03:08.730> easy<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.930> got<00:03:10.110> to

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
so this a little flop easy you got to

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:17.420 
so this a little flop easy you got to
adjust<00:03:10.920> this<00:03:12.470> this<00:03:13.470> little<00:03:13.910> nut<00:03:14.910> here<00:03:15.329> so<00:03:16.430> that

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
adjust this this little nut here so that

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.309 
adjust this this little nut here so that
won't<00:03:17.640> go<00:03:17.849> anywhere<00:03:18.209> I<00:03:18.390> don't<00:03:18.720> think<00:03:19.049> once

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
won't go anywhere I don't think once

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.949 
won't go anywhere I don't think once
that<00:03:19.590> suggested<00:03:20.340> but<00:03:20.579> that's<00:03:21.269> something<00:03:21.750> I

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
that suggested but that's something I

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.309 
that suggested but that's something I
have<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.290> do<00:03:22.620> once<00:03:22.890> it's<00:03:23.099> on<00:03:23.310> my<00:03:23.489> desk<00:03:23.760> so<00:03:24.319> I'm

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
have to do once it's on my desk so I'm

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.559 
have to do once it's on my desk so I'm
gonna<00:03:25.470> go<00:03:25.709> over<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:26.069> do<00:03:26.640> that<00:03:26.880> right<00:03:27.120> now<00:03:27.180> and

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
gonna go over and do that right now and

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.670 
gonna go over and do that right now and
I'll<00:03:27.660> show<00:03:27.690> you<00:03:27.959> when<00:03:28.260> it's<00:03:28.290> all<00:03:28.590> set<00:03:28.920> up

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
I'll show you when it's all set up

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.819 
I'll show you when it's all set up
already<00:03:31.680> so<00:03:32.190> I<00:03:32.220> have<00:03:32.549> this<00:03:32.730> thing<00:03:32.790> set<00:03:33.120> up<00:03:33.829> it

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
already so I have this thing set up it

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.920 
already so I have this thing set up it
didn't<00:03:35.160> bother<00:03:35.310> getting<00:03:35.849> the<00:03:35.940> pop<00:03:36.180> filter<00:03:36.510> or

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
didn't bother getting the pop filter or

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.059 
didn't bother getting the pop filter or
anything<00:03:37.470> because<00:03:38.459> it's<00:03:39.450> got<00:03:39.720> to<00:03:39.810> be<00:03:40.069> a

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
anything because it's got to be a

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.979 
anything because it's got to be a
reasonable<00:03:42.060> distance<00:03:42.269> from<00:03:42.690> my<00:03:43.170> face<00:03:44.160> anyway

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
reasonable distance from my face anyway

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:49.280 
reasonable distance from my face anyway
I<00:03:45.989> have<00:03:46.620> my<00:03:46.650> computer<00:03:47.040> set<00:03:47.790> up<00:03:47.930> like<00:03:48.930> I<00:03:49.079> have<00:03:49.260> a

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
I have my computer set up like I have a

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.979 
I have my computer set up like I have a
small<00:03:49.530> apartment<00:03:50.100> so<00:03:50.639> there's<00:03:50.850> no<00:03:51.030> office<00:03:51.810> or

anything like that so I have my computer

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.240 
anything like that so I have my computer
set<00:03:55.319> up<00:03:55.350> here<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.870> my<00:03:57.870> cage<00:03:58.170> I'm<00:03:58.709> sitting<00:03:59.160> on

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
set up here and my cage I'm sitting on

set up here and my cage I'm sitting on
my<00:03:59.310> couch<00:03:59.609> right<00:03:59.940> now<00:04:01.250> it's<00:04:02.250> just<00:04:02.400> more

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
my couch right now it's just more

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.289 
my couch right now it's just more
convenient<00:04:03.420> and<00:04:04.370> Plus<00:04:05.370> this<00:04:05.639> is<00:04:05.850> really<00:04:06.180> the

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 
convenient and Plus this is really the

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:08.800 
convenient and Plus this is really the
only<00:04:06.480> spot<00:04:06.900> I<00:04:06.930> have<00:04:07.230> to<00:04:07.440> put<00:04:07.620> my<00:04:07.799> computer<00:04:08.400> so

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
only spot I have to put my computer so

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.729 
only spot I have to put my computer so
anyway<00:04:10.370> it's<00:04:11.370> pretty<00:04:12.030> decent<00:04:12.450> it's<00:04:13.350> a<00:04:13.470> little

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
anyway it's pretty decent it's a little

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.900 
anyway it's pretty decent it's a little
flimsy<00:04:14.100> but<00:04:14.700> it's<00:04:15.540> not<00:04:15.750> too<00:04:15.959> bad<00:04:16.579> it'll<00:04:17.579> work

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
flimsy but it's not too bad it'll work

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.469 
flimsy but it's not too bad it'll work
for<00:04:18.180> what<00:04:18.299> I<00:04:18.329> need<00:04:18.690> it<00:04:18.870> for<00:04:19.370> so<00:04:20.370> it's<00:04:20.910> not<00:04:21.030> too

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
for what I need it for so it's not too

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:26.900 
for what I need it for so it's not too
bad<00:04:23.060> it<00:04:24.060> could<00:04:24.599> stand<00:04:25.050> to<00:04:25.380> be<00:04:25.590> just<00:04:26.130> a<00:04:26.400> smidge

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
bad it could stand to be just a smidge

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.830 
bad it could stand to be just a smidge
longer<00:04:28.280> it's<00:04:29.280> a<00:04:29.370> little<00:04:29.849> short<00:04:30.300> but<00:04:30.660> then

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
longer it's a little short but then

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.400 
longer it's a little short but then
again<00:04:30.990> I'm<00:04:31.580> you<00:04:32.580> know<00:04:32.669> I'm<00:04:32.910> a<00:04:32.970> good<00:04:33.410> probably

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
again I'm you know I'm a good probably

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.950 
again I'm you know I'm a good probably
foot<00:04:35.070> and<00:04:35.220> a<00:04:35.250> half<00:04:35.460> two<00:04:35.849> feet<00:04:36.150> away<00:04:36.330> from<00:04:36.510> the

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
foot and a half two feet away from the

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.040 
foot and a half two feet away from the
from<00:04:37.800> the<00:04:37.919> desk<00:04:38.190> and<00:04:38.669> that<00:04:39.389> brings<00:04:39.750> me<00:04:39.900> to

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
from the desk and that brings me to

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.080 
from the desk and that brings me to
another<00:04:40.229> issue<00:04:41.039> and<00:04:42.050> that's<00:04:43.050> with<00:04:43.349> this

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
another issue and that's with this

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.890 
another issue and that's with this
little<00:04:45.090> clamp<00:04:45.479> thing<00:04:45.900> I<00:04:47.060> had<00:04:48.060> to<00:04:48.090> crazy<00:04:48.510> glue

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
little clamp thing I had to crazy glue

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.210 
little clamp thing I had to crazy glue
it<00:04:49.050> back<00:04:49.080> together<00:04:50.990> because<00:04:51.990> it<00:04:52.200> snapped<00:04:52.860> in

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
it back together because it snapped in

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.020 
it back together because it snapped in
not<00:04:54.120> in<00:04:54.450> half<00:04:54.990> but<00:04:55.530> this<00:04:55.890> piece<00:04:56.340> here<00:04:56.640> snapped

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
not in half but this piece here snapped

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.710 
not in half but this piece here snapped
off<00:04:57.360> I<00:04:58.159> couldn't<00:04:59.159> get<00:04:59.340> it<00:04:59.460> to<00:04:59.490> tighten<00:05:00.000> tight

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
off I couldn't get it to tighten tight

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.500 
off I couldn't get it to tighten tight
enough<00:05:01.080> to<00:05:01.500> actually<00:05:02.219> hold<00:05:02.760> this<00:05:02.969> thing<00:05:03.300> up

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
enough to actually hold this thing up

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.190 
enough to actually hold this thing up
and<00:05:03.719> when<00:05:04.680> I<00:05:04.710> tried<00:05:05.159> the<00:05:05.940> bottom<00:05:06.690> piece<00:05:06.930> here

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
and when I tried the bottom piece here

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.380 
and when I tried the bottom piece here
snapped<00:05:07.590> right<00:05:07.890> off<00:05:07.950> I<00:05:08.430> don't<00:05:08.940> know<00:05:09.180> if<00:05:09.240> you

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
snapped right off I don't know if you

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.459 
snapped right off I don't know if you
can<00:05:09.450> see<00:05:09.690> the<00:05:09.870> line<00:05:11.840> probably<00:05:12.840> can't<00:05:13.140> but

00:05:13.459 --> 00:05:13.469 
can see the line probably can't but

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:19.190 
can see the line probably can't but
anyway<00:05:13.950> it<00:05:15.050> broke<00:05:16.050> so<00:05:17.030> my<00:05:18.030> desk<00:05:18.330> is<00:05:18.659> pretty

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
anyway it broke so my desk is pretty

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.649 
anyway it broke so my desk is pretty
crappy<00:05:19.770> and<00:05:20.280> actually<00:05:20.909> I<00:05:20.940> don't<00:05:21.090> think<00:05:21.330> it's

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:21.659 
crappy and actually I don't think it's

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:25.640 
crappy and actually I don't think it's
even<00:05:22.080> really<00:05:22.620> a<00:05:22.650> desk<00:05:23.010> it's<00:05:23.849> more<00:05:24.150> like<00:05:24.390> a<00:05:24.650> sort

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
even really a desk it's more like a sort

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.260 
even really a desk it's more like a sort
of<00:05:25.770> an<00:05:25.890> entertainment<00:05:26.640> center<00:05:26.849> for<00:05:27.030> a

of an entertainment center for a
television<00:05:28.080> but<00:05:28.560> anyway<00:05:29.460> I<00:05:29.490> use<00:05:29.880> it<00:05:30.090> for<00:05:30.300> a

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
television but anyway I use it for a

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.380 
television but anyway I use it for a
desk<00:05:30.630> and<00:05:31.020> it's<00:05:31.169> not<00:05:31.919> in<00:05:32.099> the<00:05:32.219> best<00:05:32.400> shape<00:05:32.640> it's
