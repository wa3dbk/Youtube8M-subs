00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.870
 and then personal beauty rafael here all to 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.130
 you go out first online video and 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.049
 this tie will talk about that 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.910
 a subject that many people wanted to hear 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.890
 about m 16 to 3 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.769
 She's really watching power, how's it going? 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.449
 be the final version as that will be it 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.670
 Good, I can tell you. 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.920
 affirm 16 to 13 at the time she is well 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.109
 and even it is also easy to play with it 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.579
 obviously have to have a good life if 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.110
 marry her if you have the bad sights 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.880
 you will not get the enemies what 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.640
 It's obvious that you'll be able to kill him. 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.290
 so if you have a good life and you are 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.360
 much easier to play and they stayed 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.879
 tempted but not living is much more 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.440
 easy for you to play and is something that people 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.850
 does not retreat does not has 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.280
 practically no spread even in the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.930
 You talk about it, which makes it much easier. 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.239
 you take a long distance and gives 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.120
 enough shot to catch or kill the staff 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.010
 then this makes her the best in the 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.449
 beta version obviously a beta 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.770
 Guys, do you know what the people are saying? 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.899
 enough says in the past video 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.720
 the biggest fear of the gang is a well a field 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.909
 where everyone knows the young only me 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.159
 only with an equal weapon many say 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.470
 was the number was 3 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.659
 however I already think different is good 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.979
 of course I know it goes away but 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.500
 that gave advantage above all 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.670
 others the profile of number 23 is obvious not 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.920
 has much to say 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.830
 and that a good part of the players play with it 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.450
 however guys there have to see the following 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.860
 that all the guns of the game 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.400
 if you know how to use them the way 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.890
 right you can play even having a 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.439
 team playing with the sub 16 team and recalls 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:42.180
 that many matches it was I played 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:44.790
 as weapons as ssg as it is 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.710
 name of that image 3 to 3 that was slow 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.689
 or finding it higher and yet not 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.460
 could butt heads against 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.770
 staff told me three of them winning is 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.270
 in combat it happened it is not it is not 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.040
 impossible that happen 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.890
 obviously it is a bit difficult not to 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.590
 it was so easy but it's more of a challenge for 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.899
 I do not see the problem as much in the 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.909
 I do not really see any problem in beta 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.020
 that obviously I vibrate I would like it 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.610
 she was a little more complicated 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.160
 It's very easy, that's it. 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.599
 bothering a little bit even because you 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.830
 Can you pick the staff? 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.620
 getting killed, empty 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.910
 the map to kill snipper what 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.700
 Unfortunately I think it's not right. 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.080
 Even if you do not like a guy, it's not the right thing. 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.180
 do it yourself 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.770
 So thinking about that, I really do. 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.470
 What are they going to give a lot of people? 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.330
 already reported was on the forum and with 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.280
 sure will have an m-16 until you exit that 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.280
 It will actually be similar to what is 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.580
 currently the number one child of 3 years 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.020
 guys let's think as follows 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.170
 gps fps guns 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:46.710
 every kind of game I know every game 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:50.640
 I played played ps have a weapon 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:53.370
 it's heavier than the other is always me 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.090
 I do not know any games where all the 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.910
 weapons are used is also even 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.820
 in games like you, the frame is for one 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:05.250
 side because in the case or ctr 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.660
 even so scope to see sometimes more 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.400
 people playing with one another 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.680
 I do not know exactly what to say until a 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.320
 game swinging because good half like 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.750
 Me half likes to attack but see 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.880
 the field is a game but how to 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.980
 You have many guns and to pass more 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.720
 there is more difference then they can you 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.010
 can use the weapons and all that everyone 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.810
 the sides that are playing are big 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.110
 Russian and American and Chinese 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.910
 there you can use these weapons then no 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.950
 have as you do if they will separate the 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.390
 waters in the game and occurs than you 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.530
 release a weapon that is for all 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.570
 classes you can have all the 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.209
 classes sometimes not all squares in 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.430
 all new infections in January but 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.860
 you can see the factions and you will 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.989
 exactly use them, not all of them. 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.060
 final issues of the game but really 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.040
 As I said I think they will change. 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.120
 but hopefully Pack leaves a little 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.400
 more difficult for a little more 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.230
 difficulty playing with it and do not 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.930
 worry, people are probably going to have it 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.310
 open mound had little weapon but 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.769
 The final version will have a few more 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.630
 regions can play there and obviously I 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.370
 I'm going to play a lot from 6 to 3 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.670
 This you can be sure of but there are 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:11.190
 also vary playing with weapons like km 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.390
 and cw and the next areas that come there 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.700
 I do not know exactly which ones 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.709
 There was but I 'm sure I'll play with 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.919
 practically all of them will do number 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.630
 23 white of 36 games was a day and say 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:25.289
 three months the matches were more in 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.240
 to play the rather gt3 team from 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.130
 What 's your name again? 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.080
 number 24 throw enough weapons 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.210
 different groups of four and an example 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.280
 a good part of the players play arica 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.500
 and a lot of people complain about the house 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.050
 says that icca is how it is that is 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.120
 verbally he wants to stay in the club and 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.800
 that's something people tell me 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.330
 I do not think so but that is personal and 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.080
 also because a lot of the people play 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.210
 god 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.560
 in this competitive but I already know that 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.199
 have weapons that are more powerful 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.520
 example of how you loved her and what 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:55.020
 only then it is already a trap 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.190
 Some people also use it to take a little 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.669
 over far too an average 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.650
 distances and wcw there is but it is not as 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.539
 good so an average long distance 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.400
 So the house you end up being one of the 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:06.740
 the most commonly used weapons for public 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.090
 month when I see people playing 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.280
 hard to see someone you someone with cz 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.800
 another type of weapon, but that's it 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:17.039
 Ok I hope she'll understand a 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.259
 Bit there on my vision the ibm 16 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:21.810
 It's really like I said it's a little 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:23.699
 stronger than it should but it's as it says 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.590
 a beta version of the version by brow 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:27.750
 people have no weapons at all 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.430
 released there so we can not play 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.259
 It has how to release it has nothing lacked in the 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.940
 game and in the final version we will have 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:36.210
 several things to test various 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.979
 weapons to see if they are good can not be 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.520
 that appears more is better than me 16 to 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:40.800
 3 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.770
 a lot of people say that amy 4 16 is better 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.259
 that she is then only there when it comes to 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.820
 This is the game of life I 've seen, I guess. 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:50.460
 even though the two knock forward are 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.219
 good but it was 80 more than was the 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.900
 fight then I do not know let's do this 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:56.550
 final version and she was like this. 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.349
 my view that I have liked the 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.979
 A hug from tmz. 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:00.979
