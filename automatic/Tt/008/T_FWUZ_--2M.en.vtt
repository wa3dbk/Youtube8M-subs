heavy<00:00:50.899> of<00:00:51.899> course<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.320> have<00:00:52.500> your<00:00:52.530> easy

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
heavy of course you have your easy

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.439 
heavy of course you have your easy
natural<00:00:53.399> but<00:00:53.820> then<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.030> actually<00:00:54.180> have<00:00:54.420> a

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
natural but then you actually have a

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.840 
natural but then you actually have a
very<00:00:54.690> easy<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.320> access<00:00:55.710> third<00:00:56.100> natural<00:00:56.579> that

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
very easy to access third natural that

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.270 
very easy to access third natural that
has<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.270> few<00:00:57.660> less<00:00:57.840> minerals<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.680> gas<00:00:58.920> so

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
has a few less minerals and a gas so

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.490 
has a few less minerals and a gas so
sometimes<00:01:00.030> greedy<00:01:00.510> players<00:01:00.840> they'll

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
sometimes greedy players they'll

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.619 
sometimes greedy players they'll
actually<00:01:02.039> just<00:01:02.489> completely<00:01:02.820> skip<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.539> go

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
actually just completely skip it and go

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.649 
actually just completely skip it and go
for<00:01:03.960> this<00:01:04.580> riskier<00:01:05.580> third<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.330> basically

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
for this riskier third that is basically

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.960 
for this riskier third that is basically
a<00:01:06.780> full<00:01:07.140> base<00:01:07.380> with<00:01:08.100> all<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.400> minerals<00:01:08.580> and

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
a full base with all the minerals and

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.630 
a full base with all the minerals and
gas<00:01:09.210> but<00:01:10.110> it<00:01:10.260> puts<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> little<00:01:11.159> bit<00:01:11.280> out<00:01:11.490> in

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
gas but it puts you a little bit out in

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.310 
gas but it puts you a little bit out in
the<00:01:11.729> open<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.450> course<00:01:12.659> we<00:01:12.780> see<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.110> four

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
the open of course we see the four

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.490 
the open of course we see the four
Xel'Naga<00:01:13.830> towers<00:01:14.780> positioned<00:01:15.780> in<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.080> square

on<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.920> map<00:01:17.189> able<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.970> give<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.270> very<00:01:18.689> good

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
on the map able to give you very good

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.320 
on the map able to give you very good
view<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.320> what<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.680> going<00:01:19.979> on<00:01:20.130> not<00:01:20.820> at<00:01:21.000> getting

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
view of what is going on not at getting

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.090 
view of what is going on not at getting
a<00:01:21.420> bunker<00:01:21.780> at<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.140> front<00:01:22.439> might<00:01:22.680> be<00:01:22.830> looking

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
a bunker at the front might be looking

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.530 
a bunker at the front might be looking
at<00:01:23.189> getting<00:01:23.280> that<00:01:23.520> two<00:01:23.729> racks<00:01:23.939> pressure<00:01:24.240> it

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
at getting that two racks pressure it

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.350 
at getting that two racks pressure it
was<00:01:24.900> very<00:01:25.350> effective<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.950> Game<00:01:26.100> two<00:01:26.430> hopefully

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
was very effective in Game two hopefully

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.030 
was very effective in Game two hopefully
not<00:01:27.509> us<00:01:27.720> gonna<00:01:28.200> be<00:01:28.320> able<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.530> do<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.799> same

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
not us gonna be able to do the same

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.730 
not us gonna be able to do the same
morrow<00:01:29.700> we'll<00:01:30.000> see<00:01:30.180> if<00:01:30.390> he<00:01:30.600> takes<00:01:30.630> as<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.140> risky

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
morrow we'll see if he takes as a risky

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.609 
morrow we'll see if he takes as a risky
of<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:32.100> hatch<00:01:32.400> as<00:01:32.670> he<00:01:32.790> did<00:01:33.000> before<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.840> is<00:01:34.110> he<00:01:34.380> has

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
of a hatch as he did before it is he has

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.800 
of a hatch as he did before it is he has
gone<00:01:34.860> back<00:01:35.100> up<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.400> 16<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.180> he<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.509> still

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
gone back up to 16 so he is still

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.170 
gone back up to 16 so he is still
getting<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.079> 16<00:01:37.680> hatch<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.280> course<00:01:38.909> we<00:01:39.150> love

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
getting that 16 hatch of course we love

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.390 
getting that 16 hatch of course we love
the<00:01:39.540> supply<00:01:39.810> depot<00:01:39.960> at<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.409> bottom<00:01:40.770> prevents

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
the supply depot at the bottom prevents

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.039 
the supply depot at the bottom prevents
any<00:01:41.549> kind<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:41.850> bunkering<00:01:42.180> or<00:01:42.420> pylon<00:01:42.869> out

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
any kind of bunkering or pylon out

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.260 
any kind of bunkering or pylon out
really<00:01:43.710> makes<00:01:43.920> that<00:01:44.159> hatch<00:01:44.399> first<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:45.030> whole

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
really makes that hatch first a whole

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.179 
really makes that hatch first a whole
lot<00:01:45.450> more<00:01:45.570> feasible<00:01:45.810> even<00:01:46.470> against<00:01:46.829> protoss

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
lot more feasible even against protoss

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.649 
lot more feasible even against protoss
players<00:01:47.579> because<00:01:48.119> that's<00:01:48.299> what<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.420> have<00:01:48.600> to

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659

at doing this 2x pressure of course
nada<00:02:13.190> has<00:02:13.460> not<00:02:13.700> scouted<00:02:14.690> where<00:02:14.960> morrow<00:02:15.260> is<00:02:15.560> and

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
nada has not scouted where morrow is and

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.010 
nada has not scouted where morrow is and
so<00:02:16.190> hopefully<00:02:16.400> morrow<00:02:16.910> will<00:02:17.180> not<00:02:17.360> give<00:02:17.780> that

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
so hopefully morrow will not give that

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.470 
so hopefully morrow will not give that
away<00:02:18.380> by<00:02:18.620> running<00:02:19.010> back<00:02:19.160> to<00:02:19.370> his<00:02:19.490> base<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:20.060> so

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
away by running back to his base and so

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.850 
away by running back to his base and so
we'll<00:02:20.630> have<00:02:20.720> to<00:02:20.870> see<00:02:20.900> exactly<00:02:21.200> what<00:02:21.560> happens

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
we'll have to see exactly what happens

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.980 
we'll have to see exactly what happens
the<00:02:22.010> first<00:02:22.040> marine<00:02:22.550> is<00:02:22.760> out<00:02:23.030> that<00:02:23.420> should

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
the first marine is out that should

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.580 
the first marine is out that should
probably<00:02:24.230> be<00:02:24.470> making<00:02:24.890> its<00:02:25.010> way<00:02:25.100> over<00:02:25.640> tomorrow

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
probably be making its way over tomorrow

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.990 
probably be making its way over tomorrow
but<00:02:27.590> we'll<00:02:27.740> have<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:27.950> see<00:02:28.130> what<00:02:28.340> is<00:02:28.460> next<00:02:28.730> of

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
but we'll have to see what is next of

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.790 
but we'll have to see what is next of
course<00:02:29.120> we<00:02:29.300> do<00:02:29.420> see<00:02:29.630> a<00:02:29.660> pool<00:02:29.990> coming<00:02:30.410> up<00:02:30.560> for

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
course we do see a pool coming up for

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.430 
course we do see a pool coming up for
morrow<00:02:31.010> as<00:02:31.250> well<00:02:31.460> so<00:02:31.970> once<00:02:32.450> again<00:02:32.630> these<00:02:33.170> SUVs

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
morrow as well so once again these SUVs

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.900 
morrow as well so once again these SUVs
are<00:02:33.740> going<00:02:34.070> to<00:02:34.130> be<00:02:34.190> coming<00:02:34.220> to<00:02:34.490> the<00:02:34.580> base<00:02:34.730> I

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
are going to be coming to the base I

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.280 
are going to be coming to the base I
don't<00:02:35.180> know<00:02:35.330> why<00:02:35.480> morrow<00:02:35.780> is<00:02:35.990> actually

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
don't know why morrow is actually

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.370 
don't know why morrow is actually
leading<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.830> SV<00:02:37.160> directly<00:02:37.700> to<00:02:37.970> the<00:02:38.840> base<00:02:39.110> of

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
leading the SV directly to the base of

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.440 
leading the SV directly to the base of
morrow<00:02:39.650> of<00:02:39.860> course<00:02:40.100> this<00:02:40.190> SCV<00:02:40.790> checking

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
morrow of course this SCV checking

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.510 
morrow of course this SCV checking
things<00:02:41.570> out<00:02:41.780> not<00:02:42.350> quite<00:02:42.590> moved<00:02:42.800> their<00:02:43.220> egos

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
things out not quite moved their egos

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.480 
things out not quite moved their egos
and<00:02:43.730> so<00:02:44.560> not<00:02:45.560> quite<00:02:45.740> checked<00:02:46.130> for<00:02:46.310> cross

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
and so not quite checked for cross

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.400 
and so not quite checked for cross
positions<00:02:47.000> but<00:02:47.180> I'm<00:02:47.390> assuming<00:02:47.750> that<00:02:47.900> SUV<00:02:48.320> was

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
positions but I'm assuming that SUV was

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.140 
positions but I'm assuming that SUV was
probably<00:02:48.770> going<00:02:48.950> there<00:02:49.250> anyway<00:02:49.520> pool<00:02:50.120> is

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
probably going there anyway pool is

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.690 
probably going there anyway pool is
almost<00:02:50.570> up<00:02:50.810> hatches<00:02:51.410> almost<00:02:51.739> up<00:02:51.950> and<00:02:52.310> that's

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
almost up hatches almost up and that's

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.970 
almost up hatches almost up and that's
just<00:02:52.820> the<00:02:53.030> great<00:02:53.209> part<00:02:53.450> about<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.720> 6915<00:02:54.680> pool

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
just the great part about the 6915 pool

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.070 
just the great part about the 6915 pool
is<00:02:55.220> that<00:02:55.760> it<00:02:56.030> pretty<00:02:56.360> much<00:02:56.480> all<00:02:56.660> happens<00:02:56.989> at

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
is that it pretty much all happens at

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.570 
is that it pretty much all happens at
the<00:02:57.200> same<00:02:57.410> time<00:02:57.620> so<00:02:57.860> you<00:02:57.920> can<00:02:58.070> get<00:02:58.160> that<00:02:58.310> double

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
the same time so you can get that double

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.310 
the same time so you can get that double
queen<00:02:58.700> and<00:02:58.910> that's<00:02:59.390> when<00:02:59.720> you<00:02:59.810> needed<00:02:59.989> at<00:03:00.200> the

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
queen and that's when you needed at the

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.050 
queen and that's when you needed at the
very<00:03:00.500> beginning<00:03:00.620> is<00:03:01.040> getting<00:03:01.580> that<00:03:01.670> early

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
very beginning is getting that early

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.520 
very beginning is getting that early
spine<00:03:02.420> crawler<00:03:02.720> up<00:03:02.930> that's<00:03:03.200> going<00:03:03.350> to<00:03:03.410> help

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
spine crawler up that's going to help

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.530 
spine crawler up that's going to help
them<00:03:03.680> so<00:03:03.920> much<00:03:04.100> the<00:03:04.550> first<00:03:04.790> bunker<00:03:05.120> is<00:03:05.270> going

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
them so much the first bunker is going

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.260 
them so much the first bunker is going
down<00:03:05.690> rather<00:03:05.989> a<00:03:06.320> rather<00:03:07.010> outside<00:03:07.700> of<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.090> base

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:08.270 
down rather a rather outside of the base

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:10.300 
down rather a rather outside of the base
morrow<00:03:08.690> is<00:03:08.870> kind<00:03:09.080> of<00:03:09.140> searching<00:03:09.530> around<00:03:09.650> this

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
morrow is kind of searching around this

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.800 
morrow is kind of searching around this
is<00:03:10.430> a<00:03:10.459> great<00:03:10.760> spot<00:03:11.030> for<00:03:11.090> this<00:03:11.300> overlords<00:03:11.720> of

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
is a great spot for this overlords of

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.510 
is a great spot for this overlords of
course<00:03:11.989> he<00:03:12.080> sees<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.380> SUV<00:03:12.800> sees<00:03:13.070> the<00:03:13.220> Marines

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
course he sees the SUV sees the Marines

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.270 
course he sees the SUV sees the Marines
coming<00:03:13.790> in<00:03:13.970> but<00:03:14.390> this<00:03:14.810> backwards<00:03:15.530> a<00:03:15.709> bunker<00:03:16.160> is

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
coming in but this backwards a bunker is

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.310 
coming in but this backwards a bunker is
a<00:03:16.310> little<00:03:16.700> less<00:03:16.850> aggressive<00:03:17.480> but<00:03:17.989> it<00:03:18.140> can

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
a little less aggressive but it can

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.500 
a little less aggressive but it can
still<00:03:18.500> allow<00:03:18.950> you<00:03:19.010> a<00:03:19.220> place<00:03:19.640> to<00:03:19.670> get<00:03:20.000> up<00:03:20.120> on<00:03:20.239> and

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
still allow you a place to get up on and

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.360 
still allow you a place to get up on and
so<00:03:20.810> we<00:03:20.989> do<00:03:21.140> see<00:03:21.170> a<00:03:21.350> good<00:03:21.680> bit<00:03:21.860> of<00:03:21.890> links<00:03:22.130> coming

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
so we do see a good bit of links coming

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.190 
so we do see a good bit of links coming
here<00:03:22.519> the<00:03:22.670> bunker<00:03:22.970> is<00:03:23.090> not<00:03:23.330> done<00:03:23.630> is<00:03:23.810> more

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
here the bunker is not done is more

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.180 
here the bunker is not done is more
going<00:03:24.380> to<00:03:24.440> be<00:03:24.500> able<00:03:24.560> to<00:03:24.680> get<00:03:24.769> this<00:03:24.830> around<00:03:25.100> he

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
going to be able to get this around he

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.850 
going to be able to get this around he
needs<00:03:25.370> more<00:03:25.549> SUVs<00:03:26.420> and<00:03:26.450> Marines<00:03:27.260> on<00:03:27.470> the<00:03:27.680> way

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
needs more SUVs and Marines on the way

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.370 
needs more SUVs and Marines on the way
though<00:03:28.070> and<00:03:28.280> I<00:03:28.310> think<00:03:29.090> that<00:03:29.269> nada<00:03:29.900> is<00:03:30.140> gonna<00:03:30.320> be

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
though and I think that nada is gonna be

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.380 
though and I think that nada is gonna be
able<00:03:30.440> to<00:03:30.560> clean<00:03:30.739> this<00:03:30.860> up<00:03:31.040> very<00:03:31.489> easily<00:03:31.580> but

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
able to clean this up very easily but

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.750 
able to clean this up very easily but
actually<00:03:32.900> a<00:03:32.930> good<00:03:33.410> bit<00:03:33.620> of<00:03:33.650> SCV's<00:03:34.280> going<00:03:34.610> down

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
actually a good bit of SCV's going down

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.250 
actually a good bit of SCV's going down
there's<00:03:34.940> only<00:03:35.030> two<00:03:35.209> more<00:03:35.360> SUVs<00:03:35.690> now<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:35.900> Ford

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
to the top does look like he's going to

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.630 
to the top does look like he's going to
push<00:04:02.959> him<00:04:03.080> just<00:04:03.350> a<00:04:03.470> little<00:04:03.500> bit<00:04:03.980> further<00:04:04.310> i

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
push him just a little bit further i

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.250 
push him just a little bit further i
don't<00:04:04.940> know<00:04:05.000> if<00:04:05.120> that<00:04:05.150> wasn't<00:04:05.570> completely

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
don't know if that wasn't completely

don't know if that wasn't completely
necessary<00:04:06.580> it<00:04:07.580> might<00:04:07.790> have<00:04:07.880> been<00:04:08.000> nice<00:04:08.239> you'd

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
necessary it might have been nice you'd

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.840 
necessary it might have been nice you'd
like<00:04:09.350> to<00:04:09.410> think<00:04:09.560> to<00:04:09.890> go<00:04:10.040> from<00:04:10.310> one<00:04:10.459> side<00:04:10.670> of<00:04:10.700> the

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850 
like to think to go from one side of the

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.729 
like to think to go from one side of the
next<00:04:11.150> but<00:04:11.329> those<00:04:11.450> Marines<00:04:11.810> they'll<00:04:12.170> pick<00:04:12.470> any

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
next but those Marines they'll pick any

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.740 
next but those Marines they'll pick any
kind<00:04:13.190> of<00:04:13.280> side<00:04:13.459> that<00:04:13.640> they<00:04:13.760> can<00:04:14.000> of<00:04:14.209> course

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
kind of side that they can of course

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.840 
kind of side that they can of course

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:16.850 
this two racks pressur pressure goes

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.229 
this two racks pressur pressure goes
comfortably<00:04:17.510> into<00:04:17.720> an<00:04:18.220> expansion<00:04:19.220> and<00:04:20.030> then

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
comfortably into an expansion and then

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.180 
comfortably into an expansion and then
into<00:04:20.630> a<00:04:20.660> three<00:04:21.109> racks<00:04:21.349> probably<00:04:21.680> fourth<00:04:21.950> racks

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
into a three racks probably fourth racks

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.520 
into a three racks probably fourth racks
up<00:04:22.370> here<00:04:22.550> yep<00:04:22.910> there<00:04:23.210> it<00:04:23.300> is<00:04:23.419> both<00:04:23.930> refineries

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530

going down

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.340 
going down
probably<00:04:25.819> start<00:04:26.090> to<00:04:26.180> see<00:04:26.360> some<00:04:26.389> tech<00:04:26.810> labs<00:04:27.080> and

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
probably start to see some tech labs and

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.499 
probably start to see some tech labs and
reactors<00:04:28.039> once<00:04:28.280> that<00:04:28.460> finishes<00:04:28.610> and<00:04:29.000> that's

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:29.509 
reactors once that finishes and that's

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:31.270 
reactors once that finishes and that's
the<00:04:29.630> great<00:04:29.780> part<00:04:29.930> about<00:04:30.020> this<00:04:30.680> build<00:04:30.949> is<00:04:31.130> you

the great part about this build is you

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.800 
the great part about this build is you
can<00:04:31.699> really<00:04:32.030> get<00:04:32.180> those<00:04:32.330> early<00:04:32.630> production

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
can really get those early production

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
heavily behind this we can see the

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.800 
heavily behind this we can see the

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.529 
than he did in Game two and we'll have
to<00:04:45.979> see<00:04:46.190> what<00:04:46.430> kind<00:04:46.639> of<00:04:46.699> approach<00:04:47.000> does<00:04:47.270> morrow

front and so baneling bust not asked
feasible<00:04:55.880> as<00:04:56.030> it<00:04:56.180> does<00:04:56.389> take<00:04:56.690> a<00:04:56.720> good<00:04:57.169> bit<00:04:57.410> of

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
feasible as it does take a good bit of

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.350 
feasible as it does take a good bit of
failings<00:04:57.979> to<00:04:58.400> do<00:04:58.550> that<00:04:58.729> and<00:04:58.910> then<00:04:59.030> you've<00:04:59.210> got

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
failings to do that and then you've got

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.700 
failings to do that and then you've got
to<00:04:59.389> deal<00:04:59.570> with<00:04:59.690> the<00:04:59.780> marine<00:05:00.050> so<00:05:00.259> it<00:05:00.320> can<00:05:00.560> be

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
to deal with the marine so it can be

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.980 
to deal with the marine so it can be
very<00:05:00.740> difficult<00:05:01.070> we<00:05:01.639> do<00:05:01.820> see<00:05:02.030> 16<00:05:02.539> wings<00:05:02.780> out

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
very difficult we do see 16 wings out

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.080 
very difficult we do see 16 wings out
there<00:05:03.440> is<00:05:03.590> no<00:05:03.740> Bailey<00:05:04.070> nest<00:05:04.220> but<00:05:04.340> he<00:05:04.430> is<00:05:04.580> mining

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
there is no Bailey nest but he is mining

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.089 
there is no Bailey nest but he is mining
gas<00:05:05.360> so<00:05:05.780> might<00:05:06.199> be<00:05:06.320> looking<00:05:06.590> at<00:05:06.740> going<00:05:06.889> to<00:05:06.949> go

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099 
gas so might be looking at going to go

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:09.129 
gas so might be looking at going to go
ahead<00:05:07.160> and<00:05:07.280> get<00:05:07.400> a<00:05:07.460> layer<00:05:07.789> soon<00:05:08.180> or<00:05:08.389> maybe<00:05:08.810> some

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:09.139 
ahead and get a layer soon or maybe some

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:11.320 
ahead and get a layer soon or maybe some
roaches<00:05:09.410> I<00:05:09.800> really<00:05:10.550> don't<00:05:10.639> see<00:05:10.759> Mauro<00:05:11.060> use

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
roaches I really don't see Mauro use

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.740 
roaches I really don't see Mauro use
roaches<00:05:11.840> too<00:05:12.169> much<00:05:12.880> except<00:05:13.880> in<00:05:14.090> a<00:05:14.180> defensive

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
roaches too much except in a defensive

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.600 
roaches too much except in a defensive
posture<00:05:15.020> but<00:05:15.440> there<00:05:15.860> we<00:05:16.070> go<00:05:16.190> there's<00:05:16.430> the

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
posture but there we go there's the

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.290 
posture but there we go there's the
family<00:05:16.940> nest<00:05:17.150> so<00:05:17.360> we<00:05:17.509> might<00:05:17.720> be<00:05:17.930> seeing

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
family nest so we might be seeing

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.060 
family nest so we might be seeing
another<00:05:20.300> very<00:05:20.690> aggressive<00:05:21.229> kind<00:05:21.440> of<00:05:21.590> circling

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
another very aggressive kind of circling

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.460 
another very aggressive kind of circling
bailing<00:05:22.520> bus<00:05:22.669> that<00:05:22.849> we<00:05:22.909> saw<00:05:23.120> in<00:05:23.330> Game<00:05:23.360> one<00:05:23.599> but

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
bailing bus that we saw in Game one but

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.279 
bailing bus that we saw in Game one but
once<00:05:24.710> again<00:05:24.860> this<00:05:25.130> is<00:05:25.190> such<00:05:25.550> a<00:05:25.580> hard<00:05:26.080> wall<00:05:27.080> to

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:27.289 
once again this is such a hard wall to

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:28.540 
once again this is such a hard wall to
break<00:05:27.560> he's<00:05:27.800> going<00:05:27.949> to<00:05:28.009> have<00:05:28.130> to<00:05:28.159> catch<00:05:28.400> him

when the barracks is lifted off but this

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:32.110 
when the barracks is lifted off but this
is<00:05:30.349> so<00:05:30.620> many<00:05:30.830> Marines<00:05:31.130> we've<00:05:31.370> bring<00:05:31.940> up<00:05:32.030> the

up he needs to go and make a few

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
up he needs to go and make a few
banelings<00:05:59.539> that<00:05:59.990> is<00:06:00.199> so<00:06:00.620> many<00:06:00.979> Ling's<00:06:01.900> this<00:06:02.900> is

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
banelings that is so many Ling's this is

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.170 
banelings that is so many Ling's this is
gonna<00:06:03.259> be<00:06:03.500> a<00:06:03.530> completely<00:06:04.130> different<00:06:04.699> show
