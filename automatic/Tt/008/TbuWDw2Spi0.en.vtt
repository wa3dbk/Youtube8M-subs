00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
barrel we didn't even put a board on the

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.000 
barrel we didn't even put a board on the
front<00:00:18.720> or<00:00:18.840> nothing<00:00:19.109> we<00:00:19.199> just<00:00:19.380> clamped<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:19.890> on

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
front or nothing we just clamped it on

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.570 
front or nothing we just clamped it on
there<00:00:20.250> seems<00:00:20.630> seems<00:00:21.630> pretty<00:00:21.900> secure<00:00:22.460> and<00:00:23.460> when

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
there seems seems pretty secure and when

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.490 
there seems seems pretty secure and when
I<00:00:23.609> got<00:00:23.820> this<00:00:24.029> thing<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.630> lever<00:00:24.869> was<00:00:25.140> clear

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
I got this thing the lever was clear

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.980 
I got this thing the lever was clear
over<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.189> down<00:00:26.820> around<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.750> bottom

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
over and down around to the bottom

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.050 
over and down around to the bottom
that's<00:00:28.410> how<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.680> came<00:00:28.830> in<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.070> package<00:00:29.519> it

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
that's how it came in the package it

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.609 
that's how it came in the package it
wouldn't<00:00:30.390> go<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.660> way<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:30.929> I<00:00:31.109> assumed<00:00:31.470> it

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
wouldn't go that way so I assumed it

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.100 
wouldn't go that way so I assumed it
came<00:00:31.800> back<00:00:31.980> around<00:00:32.189> here<00:00:32.700> made<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.570> cable<00:00:33.960> all

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
came back around here made the cable all

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.860 
came back around here made the cable all
straight<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.969> it<00:00:35.969> doesn't<00:00:36.300> seem<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.630> lock

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
straight and it doesn't seem to lock

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.540 
straight and it doesn't seem to lock
down<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.410> just<00:00:37.559> seems<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.890> go<00:00:38.070> there<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.460> I

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
down it just seems to go there and I

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.389 
down it just seems to go there and I
guess<00:00:38.730> that's<00:00:39.000> okay<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:40.320> here<00:00:40.800> you'll<00:00:41.129> notice

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
guess that's okay in here you'll notice

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.700 
guess that's okay in here you'll notice
