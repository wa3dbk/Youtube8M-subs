00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.710
 hello you who are a beginner in the 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.450
 world of photography we know that you are 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.219
 looking for a battle chamber that does not 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.590
 depreciate quickly with the passing of 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.869
 time remember that you could sell it 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.689
 later to buy a team 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:22.570
 better today in photography workshop 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:26.970
 creative online we will answer the 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.970
 ask what camera should I buy 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.180
 the first thing you have to consider the 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.160
 when buying a camera is 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.460
 answer the question and what's going 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.710
 to use before this question the answers 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.050
 that we met were to load it 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.940
 everywhere and capture that pretty 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.220
 instant with family with friends 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.040
 to begin to delve into the 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.100
 wonderful world of photography without 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.280
 invest a lot of money and a third group 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.780
 we mention them what they want is 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.809
 guarantee the quality of the projects 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.509
 photographs taking advantage of the advances 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:08.300
 technological and once resolved this 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:10.580
 ask something very important and how much 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.800
 are you willing to invest respond to 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.110
 these two questions is fundamental before 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.550
 to buy your camera we will review 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.990
 some elements so you can 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.330
 compare the different types that 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.430
 there are the first of them is the size 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.619
 of the sensor remember that as many 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.200
 things in life the bigger is 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.300
 much better second is the size of the 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.090
 body and programmed modes 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.350
 automatic and manual and finally the 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.830
 optics quality 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.180
 even in optics there is level if your 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.070
 camera has interchangeable lenses 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.110
 that is going to open a range of 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.750
 possibilities although I already mentioned it and 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.840
 now they wonder and what is a sensor a 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.149
 sensor is nothing more than a chip 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.909
 with many photos cells sensitive to the 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.920
 light which when reacting what 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.960
 they transform into electrical signals for 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.149
 that can be stored 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.450
 do not be fooled by the amount of 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.009
 megapixels in a camera 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.289
 many megapixels in a sensor 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.119
 small size will not compete in 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.910
 quality with the same number of 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.550
 megapixels in a larger sensor and 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.160
 this why because the photocells are 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.260
 find more together and this is going to 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.650
 translate into a light reading with a lot 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.140
 noise 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.890
 The largest commercial sensor is the bus 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:28.650
 ring 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:32.040
 followed closely by the gps sensor h 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.709
 the most common sensor the psc used in the 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.300
 nikon pentax cameras and they are and is 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.360
 used in canon cameras 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.610
 slightly smaller and all these 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.230
 together with the micro four thirds have been 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.320
 empowered the market in the past 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.120
 years there are different models of 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.810
 cameras that we can divide 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:58.800
 in three categories 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:03:01.020
 ultracompact csc and slr cameras 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.120
 ultra compact are very thin and 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.800
 they have a very small sensor are cameras 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.200
 effective for those who do not want to enter 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.710
 complicated details and you are only interested 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.690
 record that nice memory without 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.360
 But there is a technology that comes 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:18.180
 pushing the ultra compact cameras and 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.800
 probably make them obsolete 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.410
 it's a technology that you've had in 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.690
 your hands surely if I'm talking 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:30.720
 photographic cameras 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:32.370
 smartphone compact cameras psc 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.710
 they have always been very supportive of the 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.890
 photographer because his vast majority counts 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:40.380
 with manual modes automatic modes and 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.090
 scenes besides owning a body not 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.430
 so ostentatious at the time of making the 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.820
 photographs the compact cameras are 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:51.120
 they divide their first 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.670
 low-end compact category are the 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.730
 the smallest and most economical of the market in 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.650
 the menu we will find options 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.049
 to control the sensitivity of 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.360
 ellison as well as some functions for 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:05.480
 the electronic flash are commonly 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.180
 known as travel zoom cameras 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.340
 second category compact cameras 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:13.549
 middle range have all modes 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.349
 Automatic and scene manuals are 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:19.100
 known as semi cameras 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:21.889
 Professional number 3 compact cameras 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.740
 high-end are cameras 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:26.930
 complete but in a small body in 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:31.370
 sometimes they have objectives 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:34.639
 interchangeable chambers 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:37.460
 are the most common and the market puts 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.590
 our disposition three categories for 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.540
 the students and the fans the 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.020
 market has cameras with sensor 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.669
 7 aps and up to more than 120 objectives 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.800
 interchangeable for photographers 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.720
 amateurs that require a better 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.100
 equipment but without investing large 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.620
 amounts of money 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:05:00.770
 the brands put at their disposal the 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:03.039
 h cameras of this lr which count 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.340
 with more than 120 interchangeable lenses 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:09.080
 better processors and more megapixels 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.240
 goal frame cameras come equipped 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.880
 with a more robust body a batch of 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.560
 More than 120 interchangeable lenses and 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.199
 a frame image sensor 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.720
 complete therefore the cameras by 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:22.789
 frame are the best of the best and this 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.449
 sounds great in theory but there are two 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:28.729
 small inconveniences are very expensive and 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:30.979
 some of them are big and heavy 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.849
 to finish and as curiosity 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.889
 I present the insurer 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:37.020
 two cameras used mainly 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:39.800
 for industry and research 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.800
