and took me and just sat me right back
down<00:03:33.990> again<00:03:34.050> west<00:03:34.650> I<00:03:34.920> was<00:03:35.070> standing<00:03:35.550> right

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910

next<00:03:36.570> to<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:36.840> steps<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.980> I<00:03:38.310> think<00:03:38.580> the<00:03:38.700> way

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
next to the steps and I think the way

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.790 
next to the steps and I think the way
Pierce<00:03:39.180> was<00:03:39.660> standing<00:03:40.110> next<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.500> me<00:03:40.590> or

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.280 
Pierce was standing next to me or
something<00:03:41.040> like<00:03:41.160> that<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:41.700> think<00:03:42.450> he<00:03:42.930> was

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
something like that I think he was

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.500 
something like that I think he was
expletive<00:03:44.010> and<00:03:44.280> mine<00:03:44.459> was<00:03:44.610> a<00:03:44.670> little<00:03:45.000> more<00:03:45.180> I'm

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
expletive and mine was a little more I'm

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.750 
expletive and mine was a little more I'm
like<00:03:46.200> yeah<00:03:46.650> I<00:03:46.680> think<00:03:46.890> skeet<00:03:47.250> burnings<00:03:47.580> never

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
gonna be the same again and I think I'm

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.260

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
started something like that things that

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.330 
started something like that things that
you<00:04:40.880> guys<00:04:41.060> were<00:04:41.300> doing<00:04:41.630> at<00:04:42.500> the<00:04:42.530> bottom<00:04:42.860> right

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
you guys were doing at the bottom right

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:44.860 
you guys were doing at the bottom right
line<00:04:43.880> or<00:04:44.120> when<00:04:44.240> we<00:04:44.360> were<00:04:44.450> playing<00:04:44.630> those<00:04:44.840> games

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
line or when we were playing those games

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.210 
line or when we were playing those games
that<00:04:45.230> would<00:04:45.320> come<00:04:45.470> out<00:04:45.560> of<00:04:45.620> just<00:04:45.890> nowhere

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
that would come out of just nowhere

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.159
