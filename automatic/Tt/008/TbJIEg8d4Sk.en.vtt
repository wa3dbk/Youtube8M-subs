00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
chords where we have some open notes

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.700 
chords where we have some open notes
play<00:01:40.470> so<00:01:41.220> for<00:01:41.400> instance<00:01:41.820> an<00:01:42.000> E<00:01:42.509> minor<00:01:42.810> chord

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.340 

an<00:01:47.190> E<00:01:47.340> minor<00:01:47.550> chord<00:01:48.000> I'm<00:01:48.260> fingering<00:01:49.260> these<00:01:49.860> two

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
an E minor chord I'm fingering these two

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.630 
an E minor chord I'm fingering these two
notes<00:01:52.350> but<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.130> rest<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.520> them

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
notes but the rest of them

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.160 
notes but the rest of them
those<00:01:56.640> notes<00:01:56.970> are<00:01:57.150> played<00:01:57.360> open<00:01:57.660> that's<00:01:58.020> why

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
those notes are played open that's why

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.390 
those notes are played open that's why
we<00:01:58.290> call<00:01:58.440> it<00:01:58.470> an<00:01:58.650> open<00:01:58.860> chord

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
we call it an open chord

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:07.949 
we call it an open chord
other<00:02:01.400> open<00:02:01.790> chord<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.270> D<00:02:02.830> C<00:02:04.180> G<00:02:05.180> a<00:02:05.810> minor<00:02:06.500> a<00:02:07.070> e

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959 
other open chord the D C G a minor a e

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:10.240 
other open chord the D C G a minor a e
so<00:02:08.959> there's<00:02:09.110> a<00:02:09.200> there's<00:02:09.679> a<00:02:09.770> few<00:02:09.920> of<00:02:10.039> them<00:02:10.130> out

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
so there's a there's a few of them out

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.070 
so there's a there's a few of them out
there<00:02:10.489> that<00:02:10.520> we<00:02:10.819> definitely<00:02:11.150> would<00:02:11.450> use<00:02:11.690> a<00:02:11.720> lot

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
there that we definitely would use a lot

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.100 
there that we definitely would use a lot
but<00:02:13.069> here's<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.880> technique<00:02:14.480> and<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.989> way

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
but here's the technique and the way

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.540 
but here's the technique and the way
that<00:02:15.290> you<00:02:15.380> want<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.680> approach<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.220> guitar

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
that you want to approach the guitar

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.979 
that you want to approach the guitar
when<00:02:16.790> you're<00:02:17.000> when<00:02:17.270> you're<00:02:17.300> playing<00:02:17.600> it<00:02:17.750> open

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
when you're when you're playing it open

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.070 
when you're when you're playing it open
chord<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:18.970> open<00:02:19.970> chords<00:02:20.239> are<00:02:20.330> typically<00:02:20.900> the

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
chord and open chords are typically the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.010 
chord and open chords are typically the
most<00:02:21.110> frustrating<00:02:21.860> thing<00:02:22.130> in<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.370> beginning

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
most frustrating thing in the beginning

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.590 
most frustrating thing in the beginning
as<00:02:24.020> a<00:02:24.080> choir<00:02:24.440> because<00:02:25.310> you<00:02:25.910> can't<00:02:26.180> get<00:02:26.300> all<00:02:26.480> the

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
as a choir because you can't get all the

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.300 
as a choir because you can't get all the
notes<00:02:26.840> out<00:02:27.080> and<00:02:27.290> you're<00:02:27.440> seeing<00:02:27.739> your<00:02:27.920> fingers

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
notes out and you're seeing your fingers

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.350 
notes out and you're seeing your fingers
down<00:02:28.459> their<00:02:28.810> plan<00:02:29.810> but<00:02:30.940> you're<00:02:31.940> not<00:02:32.090> hearing

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
down their plan but you're not hearing

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.420 
down their plan but you're not hearing
all<00:02:32.510> the<00:02:32.630> notes<00:02:32.890> so<00:02:33.890> here's<00:02:34.100> a<00:02:34.190> few<00:02:34.370> things

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
all the notes so here's a few things

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.430 
all the notes so here's a few things
that<00:02:34.970> I<00:02:35.510> want<00:02:35.810> you<00:02:36.080> to<00:02:36.230> think<00:02:36.440> about<00:02:36.560> one<00:02:36.950> point

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
that I want you to think about one point

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.199 
that I want you to think about one point
the<00:02:39.440> first<00:02:39.620> thing<00:02:39.920> is<00:02:40.100> when<00:02:40.910> you're<00:02:41.060> playing

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
the first thing is when you're playing

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.210 
the first thing is when you're playing
your<00:02:41.930> chords<00:02:42.140> in<00:02:42.350> the<00:02:42.410> beginning<00:02:42.769> I<00:02:42.830> want<00:02:43.100> you

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
your chords in the beginning I want you

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.400 
your chords in the beginning I want you
to<00:02:43.400> arpeggiate<00:02:43.880> through<00:02:44.600> the<00:02:44.690> chords<00:02:45.050> slowly

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
to arpeggiate through the chords slowly

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.550 
to arpeggiate through the chords slowly
so<00:02:46.160> an<00:02:46.489> arpeggio<00:02:47.330> is<00:02:47.630> when<00:02:47.900> you<00:02:48.050> instead<00:02:48.470> of

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
so an arpeggio is when you instead of

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.800 
so an arpeggio is when you instead of
strumming<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:49.069> chord<00:02:50.290> you<00:02:51.519> slowly

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.870 

go<00:02:55.410> through<00:02:55.650> each<00:02:55.800> note<00:02:56.190> now<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.520> reason<00:02:56.850> that

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
go through each note now the reason that

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.840 
go through each note now the reason that
we<00:02:57.030> do<00:02:57.330> that<00:02:57.540> is<00:02:57.750> because<00:02:58.459> if<00:02:59.459> I'm<00:02:59.640> just

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
we do that is because if I'm just

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.690 
we do that is because if I'm just
strumming<00:03:00.090> like<00:03:00.300> this<00:03:01.280> sounds<00:03:02.280> pretty<00:03:02.520> good

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
strumming like this sounds pretty good

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.400 
strumming like this sounds pretty good
then<00:03:03.180> if<00:03:03.270> I<00:03:03.360> analyze<00:03:03.600> it<00:03:03.990> here<00:03:04.170> with<00:03:04.319> an

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
then if I analyze it here with an

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:11.240 
then if I analyze it here with an
arpeggio<00:03:09.260> so<00:03:10.260> I've<00:03:10.319> got<00:03:10.500> two<00:03:10.680> notes<00:03:10.890> that<00:03:11.069> are

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
arpeggio so I've got two notes that are

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.610 
arpeggio so I've got two notes that are
not<00:03:11.400> even<00:03:11.550> sounding<00:03:12.090> because<00:03:12.959> of<00:03:13.470> my

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
not even sounding because of my

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.400 
not even sounding because of my
technique<00:03:14.190> okay<00:03:14.880> so<00:03:15.180> arpeggiating<00:03:15.930> allows<00:03:16.230> us

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
technique okay so arpeggiating allows us

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.880 
technique okay so arpeggiating allows us
to<00:03:16.530> hear<00:03:16.770> now<00:03:17.690> in<00:03:18.690> order<00:03:18.989> to<00:03:19.050> fix<00:03:19.380> that<00:03:19.620> what<00:03:19.860> I

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
to hear now in order to fix that what I

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.470 
to hear now in order to fix that what I
want<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.220> do<00:03:20.400> what<00:03:20.910> you<00:03:21.030> want<00:03:21.209> to<00:03:21.270> do<00:03:21.330> is<00:03:21.420> you

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
want to do what you want to do is you

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.270 
want to do what you want to do is you
want<00:03:21.630> to<00:03:21.660> have<00:03:21.810> curl<00:03:22.140> to<00:03:22.410> your<00:03:22.590> knuckles<00:03:23.010> to

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
want to have curl to your knuckles to

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.160 
want to have curl to your knuckles to
this<00:03:23.400> last<00:03:24.030> knuckle<00:03:24.390> right<00:03:24.660> here<00:03:24.870> not<00:03:25.050> this

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
this last knuckle right here not this

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.420 
this last knuckle right here not this
one<00:03:25.350> to<00:03:25.440> this<00:03:25.620> one<00:03:25.680> mainly<00:03:26.900> okay<00:03:27.950> you<00:03:28.950> can<00:03:29.160> drop

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
one to this one mainly okay you can drop

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.380 
one to this one mainly okay you can drop
your<00:03:29.640> shoulder

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
your shoulder

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.000 
your shoulder
get<00:03:30.570> your<00:03:30.720> hand<00:03:30.959> out<00:03:31.110> front<00:03:31.530> all<00:03:31.739> those

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010

get your hand out front all those
techniques<00:03:32.489> that<00:03:32.670> sometimes<00:03:33.180> you'll<00:03:33.360> hear

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
techniques that sometimes you'll hear

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.690 
techniques that sometimes you'll hear
people<00:03:33.570> say<00:03:33.840> but<00:03:34.050> ultimately<00:03:34.650> you<00:03:35.340> provide

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
people say but ultimately you provide

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.940 
people say but ultimately you provide
some<00:03:35.940> curl<00:03:36.209> to<00:03:36.360> these<00:03:36.510> to<00:03:37.080> that<00:03:37.110> top<00:03:37.470> knuckle

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
some curl to these to that top knuckle

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.490 
some curl to these to that top knuckle
you'll<00:03:38.430> get<00:03:38.730> what<00:03:39.300> you're<00:03:39.480> looking<00:03:39.810> for<00:03:40.050> which

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
you'll get what you're looking for which

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.410 
you'll get what you're looking for which
is<00:03:40.530> clearance<00:03:41.160> you<00:03:41.400> want<00:03:42.060> clearance

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
is clearance you want clearance

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.449 
is clearance you want clearance
underneath<00:03:43.019> here<00:03:43.880> so<00:03:44.880> that<00:03:45.300> your<00:03:45.930> finger<00:03:46.459> say

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
underneath here so that your finger say

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.920 
underneath here so that your finger say
this<00:03:47.850> finger<00:03:48.120> is<00:03:48.180> playing<00:03:48.420> here<00:03:48.690> it's<00:03:48.810> not

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
this finger is playing here it's not

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.350 
this finger is playing here it's not
laying<00:03:49.350> on<00:03:49.709> top<00:03:49.769> of<00:03:50.310> that<00:03:50.400> strength<00:03:50.819> that's

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
laying on top of that strength that's

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.280 
laying on top of that strength that's
what<00:03:51.540> you<00:03:51.690> don't<00:03:51.840> want<00:03:51.959> so

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.949 

then<00:03:55.860> you<00:03:55.980> get<00:03:56.069> nice<00:03:56.340> clear<00:03:57.290> chords<00:03:58.290> and

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
then you get nice clear chords and

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.380 
then you get nice clear chords and
basically<00:04:01.219> the<00:04:02.219> way<00:04:02.400> your<00:04:02.579> brain<00:04:02.790> works<00:04:02.849> is

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
basically the way your brain works is

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.569 
basically the way your brain works is
when<00:04:03.780> you<00:04:03.930> play<00:04:04.140> a<00:04:04.170> chord<00:04:04.319> and<00:04:04.920> you<00:04:05.370> mess<00:04:05.549> up

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
when you play a chord and you mess up

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.539 
when you play a chord and you mess up
and<00:04:06.120> you<00:04:06.379> take<00:04:07.379> note<00:04:07.680> of<00:04:07.709> it<00:04:07.950> by<00:04:08.250> doing<00:04:08.280> this

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
and you take note of it by doing this

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.390 
and you take note of it by doing this
arpeggio<00:04:09.090> and<00:04:09.269> you<00:04:09.780> adjust<00:04:09.900> your<00:04:10.560> brain<00:04:11.129> takes

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
arpeggio and you adjust your brain takes

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.390 
arpeggio and you adjust your brain takes
another<00:04:11.640> note<00:04:12.030> and<00:04:12.799> eventually<00:04:13.799> it'll<00:04:14.189> take

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
another note and eventually it'll take

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.890 
another note and eventually it'll take
enough<00:04:14.609> notes<00:04:14.849> to<00:04:15.060> where<00:04:15.209> you'll<00:04:15.540> just<00:04:15.689> grab

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
enough notes to where you'll just grab

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.680 
enough notes to where you'll just grab
the<00:04:16.169> chords<00:04:16.530> correctly<00:04:17.039> every<00:04:17.820> time<00:04:17.850> you<00:04:18.299> have

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
the chords correctly every time you have

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.249 
the chords correctly every time you have
to<00:04:18.870> are<00:04:19.109> Pesci

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:22.259 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:24.390 

normally<00:04:23.259> would<00:04:23.469> okay

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
normally would okay

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.349 
normally would okay
so<00:04:25.050> there<00:04:26.050> you<00:04:26.139> have<00:04:26.199> it
