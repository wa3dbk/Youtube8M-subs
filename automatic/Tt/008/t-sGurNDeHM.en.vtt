00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.740
 19 girls from female platoon of school 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.360
 training ensigns this year 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.519
 holiday meet at the service 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.920
 Why did they move to school for six months? 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:18.080
 center and for what they left the usual 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.080
 the way of life the cadets themselves say 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.349
 always how much I remember myself always 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.829
 really liked the fact that the girls go 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.629
 form in my family of course it is not 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:42.140
 very reacted that she is five 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:42.140
 I will leave months I have purposefully come here 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.670
 I always understood that on such 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.309
 girls 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.180
 this is my great responsibility 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.940
 the plot I do not know and it turns out a 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.850
 against me going though many 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.860
 discouraged me and I decided somehow I 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.049
 make it so that it becomes a military 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.840
 I want to get this post I want 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:14.759
 get on the rank of ensign to the address i 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:17.880
 so want mean so be i fine 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.259
 I realized that all the same I need 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.299
 still will be overcome somewhere 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.299
 I need to become stronger 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.770
 well, I still have a good battalion commander 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.890
 spoke and on you strongly to with everything 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.990
 I can handle it and I decided not to stop 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.700
 on the fact that I just need the military 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.820
 still move forward to something 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.610
 seeks well here steps were to 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.830
 get the ensigns and all my goals were 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.610
 sent for me to get the weather 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.430
 let it come hard somewhere 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.619
 have to step over myself 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:58.799
 but we go to get used to it was difficult 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:01.020
 6 am rise 10 minutes to the charges and here it is 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.890
 there is exactly the daily routine that is when 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.619
 are you at home 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.080
 you yourself plan your time here 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.549
 this is not something that is routine here 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.120
 which stick to 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:13.650
 you can not be there if there is no time will 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.870
 you can't walk there 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.409
 what is your business 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:24.640
 I remember when I came here was very 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:26.920
 a lot of people all that was still so all 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.650
 vanity this is all a location for me 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.330
 it was everything new is never 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.430
 barracks 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.200
 here at once such a sharp placement 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.489
 this is as it should be according to the statute 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:43.239
 the alphabet was generally something crazy 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:46.510
 plus everything else I stepped into the outfit to me 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:51.690
 it seemed that you would have to me all the same 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:54.370
 all your will in a fist clamp it to endure 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.250
 the first week was extremely difficult because 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.250
 what is this new environment new people 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:04.420
 new requirements some first week 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:08.180
 just head spinning just want to 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.970
 cry cry run write a report on 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.910
 deduction but the first impression is 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.680
 bright is when we were shown how 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.280
 beat the right bed that is for 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.520
 it seemed to cheer 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.700
 the bed repulsed well seemed much 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:29.709
 harder and the first day I realized 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.709
 what no it's probably not for me 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:37.970
 load here is a lot of physical 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:41.420
 so immediately we knew where we were going then 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.100
 have we been warned that on the physical 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:48.170
 preparation will pay big 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:51.920
 attention too so we all run around here 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:55.220
 about the game they are all prepared physically 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.110
 In general, I have always been in sports. 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.400
 engaged in the time of le bonomon therefore 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.030
 I always try to support myself 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.959
 form 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.390
 but no matter how hard I feel 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:07.370
 Well, the girl who came is weaker 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.459
 physically developed they are catching up 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:15.130
 catch up given this will always prove 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:19.000
 on the part that you are worse than someone else 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:22.420
 caused all the complexity because 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.640
 well here three requires much more like 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.620
 would we issue exams in the future 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.290
 graduations 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:33.310
 so do not want to be worse than someone 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:36.250
 other many occupations that is basically 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.590
 Of course this is a special training. 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.080
 probably the primary task that 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.680
 we really came here 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.320
 exactly 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:48.030
 specially trained physical 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:51.970
 ideological drill training 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.690
 1 shooting mine were very, I was very 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.470
 shocked 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.900
 I even wanted to cry 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:02.340
 the first shot was very hard of course 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:05.290
 this rumble is when it lays the ears 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.710
 Now for me it is natural 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:11.560
 work is absolutely all different absolutely 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:14.020
 in general, that is, if you take us like this 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.700
 put in a row that is, you can about 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.240
 each person's temperament 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:21.700
 say a lot with us and children 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.979
 probably it only unites this 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.750
 that we ourselves are now pleasantly gone 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:28.660
 time we sure yes we learned 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.720
 cut out this free time and you 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:34.479
 you know, even five extra minutes is for 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.970
 us as an hour from these 5 minutes you can 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:38.650
 It is to do a lot of thing 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.310
 The main thing is probably for a girl, what am I 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:44.229
 I learned how to get ready quickly 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.540
 good school very good mine 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:47.280
 life school 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:51.180
 so 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:53.670
 yes a lot of things and even some 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:58.440
 character changes the nature of views on 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:06:01.410
 life will increase my self-esteem rather 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.000
 all and I understand that this is not worth it 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:06.440
 stop worth going on and on 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.440
 maybe even an officer 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.900
 school ensigns he somehow gave 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.210
 some self-confidence that you 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:21.300
 can not just do you want can you 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:23.970
 achieve all that you want well 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:27.360
 and I understand what is probably like me 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:30.000
 I used to be no longer mom and dad 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.760
 I support me morally I want 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.650
 so they see it all come here 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:36.630
 to my release and so i really 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.850
 could the gathering get high 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:42.470
 head and say that's finally come true 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.470
 my dream I become the ensign hands
