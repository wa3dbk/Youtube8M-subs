00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.559
 the age is not an element 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.610
 essential to no biological function 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.420
 in humans in a belt 40 it's 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.220
 impossible 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.720
 I would like to convince you today 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.750
 that fluoridation of drinking water is 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.380
 a useless and harmful step for many 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.130
 people 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.439
 fluoride for the protection of teeth 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.920
 if you simply have to have the absolute 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:39.629
 certainty that yes it causes cancer that 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.139
 when cancer and bone it does not cause 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.550
 acceleration 

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:46.120
 it's like premature aging 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.249
 of the population the influx of crowding 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.199
 the buttocks in the arch is aimed but 

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:52.780
 also effects on the bones the gland 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.780
 thyroid and on the system and that 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.149
 increases the number of birth the child 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.260
 who suffer from congenital diseases 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.739
 I do not know if you're going 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.819
 but it's appalling 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.120
 and so that's how I took my 

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:06.120
 position 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.399
 and as 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.740
 there in fact they deliver since then in 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.380
 the theme for one that will touch the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.439
 class of sources of fluence that has in 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.929
 the whole environment the worst pop dance 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.560
 bose the fruits both leave an idea 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:36.810
 it was an excessive level two days 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.390
 but I found some inconsistencies 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.119
 and those occupying a position for 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.829
 the affirmation came because a priori 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.969
 like the other dentist I thought 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.609
 it's something that makes her 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:49.439
 I feel that the health director 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:50.220
 public is losing its 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.390
 credibility 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.869
 the abalone dati lists the daisy format 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.560
 paused honestly it only broadcasts by 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.110
 missionaries 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.090
 it's absolutely unacceptable 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.069
 public health measure this is the 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:15.000
 Forced medication anyway up 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:17.610
 $ 250 to the vinci foundation what is it 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.829
 a little tricky of skill a person 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.180
 we do not know a dose 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:23.400
 master not 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.130
 we come back in seven 7 of the charter 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.870
 Canadian Association of Rights and Freedoms and 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.290
 the Quebec Charter of Human Rights 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.389
 defense 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.790
 what will they put in the water after 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:35.209
 values ​​because people have too much 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.209
 nervous
