00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
from the landing pad so what I did this

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.439 
from the landing pad so what I did this
time<00:00:18.330> I'm<00:00:18.600> made<00:00:19.260> sure<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:19.529> engage<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.789> power<00:00:21.029> on

time I'm made sure I engage the power on
the<00:00:21.990> pad<00:00:22.680> itself<00:00:22.859> so<00:00:23.369> we're<00:00:23.490> going<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.670> go

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
the pad itself so we're going to go

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.660 
the pad itself so we're going to go
ahead<00:00:24.740> do<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.859> same<00:00:26.039> thing<00:00:26.250> we're<00:00:26.340> gonna<00:00:26.430> fly

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
it out and then I'll hit both these

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.240 
it out and then I'll hit both these
switches<00:00:29.670> down<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.449> we'll<00:00:30.869> see<00:00:31.800> how<00:00:31.859> close<00:00:32.070> I

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
switches down and we'll see how close I

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.150 
switches down and we'll see how close I
get<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.610> landing<00:00:33.030> pad<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.980> let's<00:00:34.980> go

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.840 
actually stolen under power this is a
quadcopter<00:03:11.080> and<00:03:11.560> what's<00:03:12.130> unique<00:03:12.250> with<00:03:12.580> this

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
quadcopter and what's unique with this

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.170 
quadcopter and what's unique with this
it<00:03:13.150> has<00:03:13.420> GPS<00:03:13.900> guidance<00:03:14.410> so<00:03:15.310> satellites

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
it has GPS guidance so satellites

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.900 
it has GPS guidance so satellites
control<00:03:16.660> this<00:03:16.870> so<00:03:17.110> when<00:03:17.290> I<00:03:17.320> fly<00:03:17.680> it<00:03:17.739> around<00:03:17.910> and
