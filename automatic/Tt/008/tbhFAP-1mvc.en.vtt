buddy Cory so what's the what's going on
with<00:00:22.970> the<00:00:23.060> dimples<00:00:23.509> we<00:00:23.660> got<00:00:23.810> some<00:00:24.020> some<00:00:24.289> new

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:24.439 
with the dimples we got some some new

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:26.380 
with the dimples we got some some new
action<00:00:24.890> there<00:00:25.070> some<00:00:25.520> big<00:00:25.669> changes<00:00:25.880> in<00:00:26.090> the<00:00:26.269> be

330<00:00:26.810> series<00:00:27.170> we<00:00:27.410> are<00:00:27.529> pleased<00:00:27.740> to<00:00:27.890> introduce

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
330 series we are pleased to introduce

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.400 
330 series we are pleased to introduce
new<00:00:28.760> dual<00:00:29.060> dimple<00:00:29.449> technology<00:00:30.050> which<00:00:30.260> is

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
new dual dimple technology which is

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.380 
new dual dimple technology which is
obviously<00:00:30.800> the<00:00:30.890> visible<00:00:31.400> change<00:00:31.699> to<00:00:32.239> these

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
obviously the visible change to these

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.850 
obviously the visible change to these
models<00:00:32.809> in<00:00:32.930> addition<00:00:33.290> to<00:00:33.379> the<00:00:33.500> changes<00:00:33.830> that

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
models in addition to the changes that

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.619 
models in addition to the changes that
have<00:00:34.010> occurred<00:00:34.070> inside<00:00:34.550> of<00:00:35.180> the<00:00:35.269> golf<00:00:35.449> ball

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:35.629 
have occurred inside of the golf ball

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:38.079 
have occurred inside of the golf ball
the<00:00:36.019> dual<00:00:36.199> dimple<00:00:36.650> as<00:00:37.100> you<00:00:37.309> may<00:00:37.460> recall<00:00:37.640> is

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:38.089 
the dual dimple as you may recall is

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:40.329 
the dual dimple as you may recall is
designed<00:00:38.540> to<00:00:38.900> control<00:00:39.680> the<00:00:39.830> Gulf<00:00:40.010> on<00:00:40.160> two

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:40.339 
designed to control the Gulf on two

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:42.340 
designed to control the Gulf on two
different<00:00:40.550> areas<00:00:40.970> one<00:00:41.269> the<00:00:41.750> inter<00:00:42.019> dimple

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
different areas one the inter dimple

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.229 
different areas one the inter dimple
will<00:00:42.470> help<00:00:42.680> to<00:00:42.949> get<00:00:43.580> the<00:00:43.729> golf<00:00:43.879> ball<00:00:44.000> to<00:00:44.120> his

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
will help to get the golf ball to his

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:45.759 
will help to get the golf ball to his
peak<00:00:44.390> trajectory<00:00:44.839> faster<00:00:45.229> it<00:00:45.320> creates<00:00:45.559> lift

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
peak trajectory faster it creates lift

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:46.990 
peak trajectory faster it creates lift
of<00:00:45.949> the<00:00:46.010> golf<00:00:46.190> ball<00:00:46.460> kind<00:00:46.670> of<00:00:46.729> like<00:00:46.879> an

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
of the golf ball kind of like an

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.820 
of the golf ball kind of like an
airplane<00:00:47.360> and<00:00:47.629> the<00:00:47.659> adjustment<00:00:48.409> of<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:48.500> flaps

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
airplane and the adjustment of the flaps

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.740 
airplane and the adjustment of the flaps
but<00:00:49.460> the<00:00:49.549> outer<00:00:49.729> dimples<00:00:50.150> designed<00:00:50.540> to<00:00:50.629> help

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
but the outer dimples designed to help

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.660 
but the outer dimples designed to help
shallow<00:00:51.110> out<00:00:51.379> landing<00:00:51.830> angle<00:00:52.129> you<00:00:52.519> can

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
shallow out landing angle you can

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.890 
shallow out landing angle you can
shallow<00:00:52.879> out<00:00:53.089> landing<00:00:53.449> angle<00:00:53.629> you're<00:00:53.780> going

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
shallow out landing angle you're going

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.810 
shallow out landing angle you're going
to<00:00:53.960> hit<00:00:54.019> the<00:00:54.080> turf<00:00:54.350> continue<00:00:55.159> running<00:00:55.369> again

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
to hit the turf continue running again

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:56.859 
to hit the turf continue running again
like<00:00:56.000> an<00:00:56.119> airplane<00:00:56.330> you<00:00:56.510> don't<00:00:56.659> want<00:00:56.809> an

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:56.869 
like an airplane you don't want an

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:58.539 
like an airplane you don't want an
airplane<00:00:57.140> to<00:00:57.229> come<00:00:57.379> in<00:00:57.500> at<00:00:57.619> 70<00:00:58.070> degrees<00:00:58.100> you

00:00:58.539 --> 00:00:58.549 
airplane to come in at 70 degrees you

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:00.160 
airplane to come in at 70 degrees you
wanted<00:00:58.760> to<00:00:58.850> come<00:00:58.970> in<00:00:59.030> maybe<00:00:59.420> it<00:00:59.570> more<00:00:59.720> like<00:00:59.869> 30

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
wanted to come in maybe it more like 30

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.140 
wanted to come in maybe it more like 30
degrees<00:01:00.320> put<00:01:01.129> the<00:01:01.220> wheels<00:01:01.369> down<00:01:01.580> keep<00:01:01.850> going

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:02.150 
degrees put the wheels down keep going

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.910 
degrees put the wheels down keep going
same<00:01:02.600> thing<00:01:02.809> with<00:01:02.900> a<00:01:02.960> golf<00:01:03.229> ball<00:01:03.470> primarily

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
same thing with a golf ball primarily

we offer within the RX limes both of
which<00:01:21.680> are<00:01:21.800> high-performance<00:01:22.040> golf<00:01:22.640> balls

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
which are high-performance golf balls

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:24.520 
which are high-performance golf balls
these<00:01:22.970> are<00:01:23.090> tour<00:01:23.300> performing<00:01:23.480> golf<00:01:23.900> balls<00:01:24.110> but

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
these are tour performing golf balls but

these for these two golf balls one it's

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.940 
these for these two golf balls one it's
a<00:03:12.150> thinner<00:03:12.360> cover<00:03:12.660> thinner<00:03:13.230> cover<00:03:13.530> on<00:03:13.740> both

models<00:03:14.190> means<00:03:14.610> increased<00:03:15.180> greenside

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
models means increased greenside

performance<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.620> second<00:03:16.980> thing<00:03:17.070> is<00:03:17.220> since

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
performance the second thing is since

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.190 
performance the second thing is since
you<00:03:17.550> can<00:03:17.700> shrink<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.120> size<00:03:18.360> of<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.600> cover<00:03:18.810> so

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
you can shrink the size of the cover so

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.990 
you can shrink the size of the cover so
you<00:03:19.290> can<00:03:19.380> expand<00:03:19.800> the<00:03:19.920> size<00:03:20.070> of<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.340> core<00:03:20.580> the

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
you can expand the size of the core the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.760 
you can expand the size of the core the
larger<00:03:21.330> core<00:03:21.510> is<00:03:21.630> generating<00:03:22.110> higher<00:03:22.320> initial

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
larger core is generating higher initial

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.440 
larger core is generating higher initial
velocity<00:03:23.280> which<00:03:23.490> means<00:03:23.730> greater<00:03:24.030> distance

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
velocity which means greater distance
