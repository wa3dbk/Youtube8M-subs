hey<00:00:13.930> everyone<00:00:14.200> this<00:00:14.230> is<00:00:14.410> Chris<00:00:14.740> with<00:00:15.010> light

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
hey everyone this is Chris with light

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.160 
hey everyone this is Chris with light
coalition<00:00:15.700> I<00:00:15.910> just<00:00:16.420> wanted<00:00:16.600> to<00:00:16.690> update<00:00:16.810> you<00:00:17.140> on

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
coalition I just wanted to update you on

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.410 
coalition I just wanted to update you on
the<00:00:17.560> little<00:00:17.830> conical<00:00:18.250> coils<00:00:18.580> then<00:00:18.970> I<00:00:19.060> started

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.420 
the little conical coils then I started

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.440 
the little conical coils then I started
to<00:00:19.570> wind<00:00:19.779> again<00:00:20.730> set<00:00:21.730> up<00:00:21.820> a<00:00:21.880> new<00:00:22.029> rig<00:00:22.210> as<00:00:22.330> you

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450 
to wind again set up a new rig as you

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:24.570 
to wind again set up a new rig as you
can<00:00:22.570> see<00:00:22.779> the<00:00:23.650> other<00:00:23.800> ridges<00:00:24.160> wouldn't<00:00:24.430> work

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
can see the other ridges wouldn't work

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.179 
can see the other ridges wouldn't work
because<00:00:25.060> the<00:00:25.810> gauge<00:00:26.050> of<00:00:26.349> wire<00:00:26.529> and<00:00:26.770> the<00:00:26.860> magnet

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189 
because the gauge of wire and the magnet

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:28.609 
because the gauge of wire and the magnet
wire<00:00:27.310> I'm<00:00:27.400> using<00:00:27.579> which<00:00:27.849> is<00:00:27.880> kind<00:00:28.210> of<00:00:28.270> bendy

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
wire I'm using which is kind of bendy

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.890 
wire I'm using which is kind of bendy
didn't<00:00:29.619> want<00:00:29.740> to<00:00:29.829> stay<00:00:30.070> and<00:00:30.369> I<00:00:31.360> had<00:00:31.509> to<00:00:31.599> do<00:00:31.750> this

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
didn't want to stay and I had to do this

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.360 
didn't want to stay and I had to do this
just<00:00:32.140> to<00:00:32.230> keep<00:00:32.380> a<00:00:32.470> little<00:00:32.560> tension<00:00:32.680> on<00:00:33.070> it<00:00:33.250> and

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
just to keep a little tension on it and

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.310 
just to keep a little tension on it and
have<00:00:33.520> something<00:00:33.760> that<00:00:33.910> would<00:00:34.090> spin<00:00:34.420> and<00:00:35.290> I

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
have something that would spin and I

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.860 
have something that would spin and I
kind<00:00:35.530> of<00:00:35.620> rigged<00:00:35.890> this<00:00:36.040> up<00:00:36.360> but<00:00:37.360> I'm<00:00:37.570> basically

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
kind of rigged this up but I'm basically

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.530 
kind of rigged this up but I'm basically
winding<00:00:38.560> these<00:00:38.710> on<00:00:39.040> some<00:00:39.880> funnels<00:00:40.300> that<00:00:40.450> I

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
winding these on some funnels that I

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.840 
winding these on some funnels that I
found<00:00:40.840> at<00:00:41.110> Harbor<00:00:41.530> Freight<00:00:41.560> but<00:00:42.550> basically

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
found at Harbor Freight but basically

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.020 
found at Harbor Freight but basically
this<00:00:43.180> size<00:00:43.359> here<00:00:43.840> and<00:00:44.170> I'm<00:00:45.010> able<00:00:45.340> to<00:00:45.489> wind<00:00:45.820> them

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
this size here and I'm able to wind them

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.500 
this size here and I'm able to wind them
in<00:00:46.359> a<00:00:46.539> conical<00:00:47.460> direction<00:00:48.460> here<00:00:48.760> and<00:00:49.149> get<00:00:49.359> the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
in a conical direction here and get the

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.509 
in a conical direction here and get the
cones<00:00:49.960> that<00:00:50.140> I<00:00:50.260> want<00:00:50.500> I<00:00:50.710> don't<00:00:50.859> I<00:00:51.219> didn't

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
cones that I want I don't I didn't

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.639 
cones that I want I don't I didn't
really<00:00:51.670> worry<00:00:51.879> about<00:00:51.940> the<00:00:52.269> angles<00:00:52.690> and<00:00:52.989> the

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
really worry about the angles and the

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.529 
really worry about the angles and the
base<00:00:53.890> versus<00:00:54.489> this<00:00:54.699> ratio<00:00:54.969> for<00:00:55.300> now<00:00:55.390> I<00:00:55.420> just

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
base versus this ratio for now I just

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:57.180 
base versus this ratio for now I just
want<00:00:55.809> to<00:00:55.839> test<00:00:56.109> some<00:00:56.320> things<00:00:56.350> on<00:00:56.769> it<00:00:56.800> so<00:00:57.070> I<00:00:57.100> just

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
want to test some things on it so I just

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.819 
want to test some things on it so I just
don't<00:00:57.850> want<00:00:58.059> them<00:00:58.239> pretty<00:00:58.420> quickly<00:00:58.660> and<00:00:59.079> then

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
don't want them pretty quickly and then

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.319 
don't want them pretty quickly and then
I<00:00:59.890> go<00:01:00.039> back<00:01:00.219> over<00:01:00.460> it<00:01:00.519> when<00:01:00.640> I'm<00:01:00.730> done<00:01:00.910> and

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
I go back over it when I'm done and

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.320 
I go back over it when I'm done and
finished<00:01:02.019> the<00:01:02.440> you<00:01:03.429> know<00:01:03.519> down<00:01:03.730> to<00:01:03.760> a<00:01:03.910> point<00:01:04.210> a

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
finished the you know down to a point a

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.300 
finished the you know down to a point a
little<00:01:04.510> better<00:01:04.690> but<00:01:05.019> I'm<00:01:05.680> not<00:01:05.800> sure<00:01:05.980> my<00:01:06.100> gauge

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
little better but I'm not sure my gauge

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.540 
little better but I'm not sure my gauge
this<00:01:06.520> is<00:01:06.640> I<00:01:06.730> forgot<00:01:07.030> but<00:01:07.210> it<00:01:07.300> is<00:01:07.630> magnet<00:01:08.050> wire

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
this is I forgot but it is magnet wire

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.399 
this is I forgot but it is magnet wire
and<00:01:09.550> what<00:01:09.670> I<00:01:09.700> found<00:01:09.909> to<00:01:10.090> be<00:01:10.180> helpful<00:01:10.330> is<00:01:10.840> duct

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:11.409 
and what I found to be helpful is duct

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.750 
and what I found to be helpful is duct
tape<00:01:11.650> and<00:01:12.690> some<00:01:13.690> superglue<00:01:14.080> which<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:15.640> know<00:01:15.730> I

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
tape and some superglue which you know I

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.830 
tape and some superglue which you know I
haven't<00:01:15.940> seen<00:01:16.120> a<00:01:16.210> whole<00:01:16.300> lot<00:01:16.360> of<00:01:16.450> videos<00:01:16.570> on

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
haven't seen a whole lot of videos on

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.470 
haven't seen a whole lot of videos on
YouTube<00:01:16.900> about<00:01:17.500> winding<00:01:18.340> conical<00:01:18.910> coils<00:01:19.240> and

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:19.480 
YouTube about winding conical coils and

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.640 
YouTube about winding conical coils and
they<00:01:19.660> were<00:01:19.810> kind<00:01:20.020> of<00:01:20.050> a<00:01:20.140> pain<00:01:20.320> in<00:01:20.410> the<00:01:20.440> butt<00:01:20.620> but

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
they were kind of a pain in the butt but

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.640 
they were kind of a pain in the butt but
I<00:01:21.190> finally<00:01:22.030> found<00:01:22.240> something<00:01:22.510> that<00:01:22.660> works<00:01:23.230> I'm

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
I finally found something that works I'm

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.760 
I finally found something that works I'm
basically<00:01:23.980> just<00:01:24.070> taking<00:01:24.400> this<00:01:24.670> funnel<00:01:25.180> and

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
basically just taking this funnel and

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.950 
basically just taking this funnel and
winding<00:01:26.770> it<00:01:26.890> up<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:28.270> give<00:01:28.450> me<00:01:28.480> some<00:01:28.720> slack

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
winding it up to give me some slack

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.580 
winding it up to give me some slack
there<00:01:29.230> at<00:01:29.320> the<00:01:29.410> end<00:01:29.560> to<00:01:30.040> finish<00:01:30.370> the<00:01:31.410> down<00:01:32.410> to<00:01:32.560> a

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
there at the end to finish the down to a

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.920 
there at the end to finish the down to a
point<00:01:32.890> and<00:01:33.370> then<00:01:33.880> I<00:01:33.940> kind<00:01:34.120> of<00:01:34.180> lock<00:01:34.330> it<00:01:34.480> in<00:01:34.570> here

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
point and then I kind of lock it in here

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.080 
point and then I kind of lock it in here
and<00:01:35.230> as<00:01:35.590> I<00:01:35.800> bring<00:01:35.860> it<00:01:36.130> through<00:01:36.430> then<00:01:36.730> I<00:01:36.850> duct

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
and as I bring it through then I duct

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.820 
and as I bring it through then I duct
tape<00:01:37.240> it<00:01:37.420> down<00:01:37.600> and<00:01:37.960> I<00:01:38.020> put<00:01:38.230> this<00:01:38.350> big<00:01:38.560> bulge

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
tape it down and I put this big bulge

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.490 
tape it down and I put this big bulge
here<00:01:39.130> because<00:01:39.610> if<00:01:40.360> you<00:01:40.570> don't<00:01:40.810> even<00:01:41.200> with<00:01:41.410> the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
here because if you don't even with the

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.770 
here because if you don't even with the
duct<00:01:41.680> tape<00:01:41.860> it'll<00:01:42.220> try<00:01:42.730> to<00:01:42.760> cinch<00:01:43.120> up<00:01:43.270> and

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
duct tape it'll try to cinch up and

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.780 
duct tape it'll try to cinch up and
actually<00:01:44.080> ruin<00:01:44.410> all<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.370> windings<00:01:45.550> that

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
actually ruin all the windings that

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.610 
actually ruin all the windings that
you've<00:01:45.910> done<00:01:46.120> and<00:01:46.450> just<00:01:46.480> come<00:01:46.870> into<00:01:47.020> you<00:01:47.500> know

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
you've done and just come into you know

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.830 
you've done and just come into you know
kind<00:01:47.950> of<00:01:48.010> a<00:01:48.130> ball<00:01:48.730> here<00:01:49.000> instead<00:01:49.330> of<00:01:49.390> actually

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
kind of a ball here instead of actually

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.490 
kind of a ball here instead of actually
winding<00:01:50.940> correctly<00:01:51.940> like<00:01:52.480> you<00:01:52.600> see<00:01:52.810> you<00:01:53.380> can

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
winding correctly like you see you can

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.200 
winding correctly like you see you can
see<00:01:53.650> here<00:01:53.860> where<00:01:54.460> it<00:01:54.580> did<00:01:54.730> it<00:01:54.850> just<00:01:54.880> a<00:01:55.090> little

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
see here where it did it just a little

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.870 
see here where it did it just a little
bit<00:01:55.360> which<00:01:55.720> is<00:01:55.900> why<00:01:56.080> I'm<00:01:56.830> learning<00:01:57.280> to<00:01:57.700> put

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
bit which is why I'm learning to put

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.760 
bit which is why I'm learning to put
more<00:01:58.030> of<00:01:58.090> a<00:01:58.210> bulge<00:01:58.420> here<00:01:58.840> so<00:01:59.290> it'll<00:01:59.440> continue

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
more of a bulge here so it'll continue

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.080 
more of a bulge here so it'll continue
to<00:01:59.920> go<00:02:00.310> down<00:02:01.140> but<00:02:02.140> I<00:02:02.200> basically<00:02:02.500> just<00:02:02.620> took

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
to go down but I basically just took

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.650 
to go down but I basically just took
some<00:02:04.320> duct<00:02:05.320> tape<00:02:05.410> just<00:02:06.250> double-sided<00:02:06.850> it<00:02:07.120> all

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
some duct tape just double-sided it all

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.869 
some duct tape just double-sided it all
the<00:02:07.930> way<00:02:08.050> around<00:02:08.379> and<00:02:08.709> kind<00:02:09.190> of<00:02:09.220> columns<00:02:09.670> and

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
the way around and kind of columns and

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.540 
the way around and kind of columns and
then<00:02:10.000> put<00:02:10.239> duct<00:02:11.019> tape<00:02:11.080> this<00:02:11.349> way<00:02:11.560> and<00:02:12.280> that<00:02:12.430> way

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
then put duct tape this way and that way

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.880 
then put duct tape this way and that way
I<00:02:12.580> can<00:02:12.819> kind<00:02:12.910> of<00:02:13.030> just<00:02:13.209> sit<00:02:13.390> it<00:02:13.480> here<00:02:13.750> and<00:02:14.650> I<00:02:14.709> can

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
I can kind of just sit it here and I can

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.339 
I can kind of just sit it here and I can
wind<00:02:15.129> pretty<00:02:15.790> quickly<00:02:16.000> I<00:02:16.360> can<00:02:17.050> kind<00:02:17.230> of<00:02:17.260> just

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
wind pretty quickly I can kind of just

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.560 
wind pretty quickly I can kind of just
grab<00:02:17.650> it<00:02:17.680> from<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:17.890> bottom<00:02:18.250> here<00:02:18.459> and<00:02:18.670> just

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
grab it from the bottom here and just

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.790 
grab it from the bottom here and just
spin<00:02:19.900> it<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:21.390> hold<00:02:22.390> a<00:02:22.450> little<00:02:22.660> slack<00:02:23.350> on<00:02:23.530> it<00:02:23.680> like

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
spin it a hold a little slack on it like

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.570 
spin it a hold a little slack on it like
that

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
that

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.950 
that
and<00:02:24.940> as<00:02:25.030> you<00:02:25.180> can<00:02:25.270> see<00:02:25.330> it<00:02:25.600> just<00:02:25.750> kind<00:02:25.870> of

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
and as you can see it just kind of

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.630 
and as you can see it just kind of
builds<00:02:26.200> up<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.680> it's<00:02:26.800> sticking<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.460> duct

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
builds up and it's sticking to the duct

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.880 
builds up and it's sticking to the duct
tape<00:02:27.880> because<00:02:28.180> I'm<00:02:28.440> pressing<00:02:29.440> down<00:02:29.470> on<00:02:29.620> it

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
tape because I'm pressing down on it

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.670 
tape because I'm pressing down on it
pretty<00:02:30.010> hard<00:02:30.360> so<00:02:31.360> it<00:02:31.570> does<00:02:31.960> kind<00:02:32.440> of<00:02:32.530> wear<00:02:32.650> out

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
pretty hard so it does kind of wear out

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.950 
pretty hard so it does kind of wear out
your<00:02:32.890> fingers<00:02:33.130> a<00:02:33.190> little<00:02:33.280> bit<00:02:33.450> but<00:02:34.450> I've<00:02:34.780> done

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
your fingers a little bit but I've done

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.650 
your fingers a little bit but I've done
two<00:02:35.470> tonight<00:02:35.830> so<00:02:36.270> maybe<00:02:37.270> I'll<00:02:37.450> feel<00:02:37.630> it

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
two tonight so maybe I'll feel it

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.870 
two tonight so maybe I'll feel it
tomorrow<00:02:37.900> but<00:02:38.680> anyways<00:02:38.920> as<00:02:39.070> you<00:02:39.190> can<00:02:39.310> see<00:02:39.490> it's

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
tomorrow but anyways as you can see it's

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.770 
tomorrow but anyways as you can see it's
starting<00:02:40.120> to<00:02:40.300> go<00:02:40.540> and<00:02:40.950> once<00:02:41.950> I<00:02:42.160> get<00:02:42.220> probably

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
starting to go and once I get probably

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.890 
starting to go and once I get probably
maybe<00:02:43.780> 25<00:02:44.410> lines<00:02:44.880> then<00:02:45.880> that's<00:02:46.630> when<00:02:46.810> I'll

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
maybe 25 lines then that's when I'll

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.290 
maybe 25 lines then that's when I'll
come<00:02:47.020> in<00:02:47.140> with<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.760> superglue<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:49.030> kind<00:02:49.240> of

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
come in with the superglue and kind of

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.740 
come in with the superglue and kind of
drip<00:02:50.110> down<00:02:50.290> each<00:02:50.500> side<00:02:50.800> just<00:02:50.830> to<00:02:51.550> keep<00:02:52.000> what

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
drip down each side just to keep what

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.330 
drip down each side just to keep what
I've<00:02:52.870> already<00:02:53.170> done<00:02:53.380> and<00:02:53.740> then<00:02:53.950> you<00:02:54.220> know

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
I've already done and then you know

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.030 
I've already done and then you know
finish<00:02:54.850> it<00:02:54.970> off<00:02:55.060> in<00:02:55.090> sections<00:02:55.630> so<00:02:56.040> that's

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
finish it off in sections so that's

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.160 
finish it off in sections so that's
really<00:02:57.250> about<00:02:57.370> it<00:02:57.430> as<00:02:57.730> you<00:02:58.330> can<00:02:58.420> see<00:02:58.480> the

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
really about it as you can see the

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.140 
really about it as you can see the
superglue<00:02:59.530> one<00:02:59.710> here<00:02:59.890> it's<00:02:59.980> actually<00:03:00.150> pretty

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
superglue one here it's actually pretty

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.530 
superglue one here it's actually pretty
sturdy<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:03.030> that's<00:03:04.030> kind<00:03:04.240> of<00:03:04.270> where<00:03:04.390> I'm<00:03:04.450> at

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
sturdy and that's kind of where I'm at

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.540 
sturdy and that's kind of where I'm at
right<00:03:04.720> now<00:03:04.780> and<00:03:05.110> then<00:03:05.260> once<00:03:06.010> these<00:03:06.220> are<00:03:06.370> built

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
right now and then once these are built

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.950 
right now and then once these are built
I'll<00:03:06.850> do<00:03:06.940> some<00:03:07.120> more<00:03:07.150> testing<00:03:07.510> like<00:03:07.720> I<00:03:07.810> have

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
I'll do some more testing like I have

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.840 
I'll do some more testing like I have
with<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.200> bigger<00:03:08.350> vortex<00:03:08.770> coils<00:03:09.130> but<00:03:09.730> it

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
with the bigger vortex coils but it

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.580 
with the bigger vortex coils but it
gives<00:03:10.030> gives<00:03:10.480> me<00:03:10.600> a<00:03:10.630> little<00:03:10.750> more<00:03:10.930> play<00:03:11.170> as<00:03:11.380> far

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
gives gives me a little more play as far

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.280 
gives gives me a little more play as far
as<00:03:11.710> angles<00:03:12.130> and<00:03:12.310> things<00:03:12.400> like<00:03:12.610> that<00:03:12.790> so<00:03:13.290> that's

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
as angles and things like that so that's

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.570 
as angles and things like that so that's
it<00:03:14.500> quick<00:03:14.740> and<00:03:14.890> easy<00:03:14.980> much<00:03:15.970> love<00:03:16.210> see<00:03:16.510> you
