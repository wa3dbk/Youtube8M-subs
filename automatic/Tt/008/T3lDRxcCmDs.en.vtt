for<00:00:07.740> Sierra<00:00:08.189> Designs<00:00:08.340> equipment<00:00:08.970> I'm<00:00:09.090> here

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
for Sierra Designs equipment I'm here

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.960 
for Sierra Designs equipment I'm here
today<00:00:09.810> to<00:00:09.900> talk<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.230> you<00:00:10.350> about<00:00:10.470> the<00:00:10.800> 2013<00:00:11.550> Cal

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:11.970 
today to talk to you about the 2013 Cal

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.330 
today to talk to you about the 2013 Cal
and<00:00:12.300> close<00:00:12.570> sleeping<00:00:12.960> bags<00:00:13.170> dry<00:00:13.920> down<00:00:13.980> really

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
and close sleeping bags dry down really

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.400 
and close sleeping bags dry down really
revolutionized<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.150> down<00:00:15.360> industry<00:00:15.900> because

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
revolutionized the down industry because

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.100 
revolutionized the down industry because
we<00:00:16.890> remove<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.670> one<00:00:18.090> negative<00:00:18.330> aspect<00:00:18.960> of

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.110 
we remove the one negative aspect of

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.630 
we remove the one negative aspect of
down<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.590> that's<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.010> fact<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.490> loses

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
down and that's the fact that it loses

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.250 
down and that's the fact that it loses
its<00:00:20.940> ability<00:00:21.030> to<00:00:21.360> insulate<00:00:21.810> when<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.050> becomes

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
its ability to insulate when it becomes

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.010 
its ability to insulate when it becomes
wet<00:00:22.620> so<00:00:23.460> what<00:00:23.640> we<00:00:23.730> do<00:00:23.880> with<00:00:24.240> our<00:00:24.420> dry<00:00:24.630> down<00:00:24.690> is

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
wet so what we do with our dry down is

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.690 
wet so what we do with our dry down is
the<00:00:25.140> treatment<00:00:25.440> process<00:00:25.710> where<00:00:26.310> we<00:00:26.460> take

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:26.700 
the treatment process where we take

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.240 
the treatment process where we take
regular<00:00:27.570> down<00:00:27.780> we<00:00:28.560> treat<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:28.950> with<00:00:29.190> a

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
regular down we treat it with a

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.490 
regular down we treat it with a
molecular<00:00:29.789> level<00:00:29.820> polymer<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.750> what<00:00:31.350> that

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
molecular level polymer and what that

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.530 
molecular level polymer and what that
does<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:32.039> creates<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.489> hydrophobic<00:00:33.000> finish

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
does is it creates a hydrophobic finish

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.080 
does is it creates a hydrophobic finish
to<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.230> down<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.070> essentially<00:00:35.550> repels

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
to the down so that essentially repels

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.490 
to the down so that essentially repels
water<00:00:37.970> dry<00:00:38.970> down<00:00:39.120> stays<00:00:39.450> dry<00:00:39.720> are<00:00:39.870> 10<00:00:40.200> times

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
water dry down stays dry are 10 times

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.590 
water dry down stays dry are 10 times
longer<00:00:40.770> than<00:00:40.980> untreated<00:00:41.220> down<00:00:41.730> dry<00:00:42.540> down

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
longer than untreated down dry down

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.479 
longer than untreated down dry down
retains<00:00:43.140> one<00:00:43.500> hundred<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:43.890> seventy<00:00:44.310> percent

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489

retains one hundred and seventy percent
more<00:00:45.210> loft<00:00:45.540> than<00:00:45.899> untreated<00:00:46.050> down<00:00:46.620> when

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
more loft than untreated down when

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.460 
more loft than untreated down when
exposed<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.670> moisture<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:48.149> humidity<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.690> it

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
exposed to moisture and humidity and it

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.590 
exposed to moisture and humidity and it
dries<00:00:49.710> thirty<00:00:50.190> three<00:00:50.489> percent<00:00:50.520> faster<00:00:51.149> in

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
dries thirty three percent faster in

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.799 
dries thirty three percent faster in
order<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.350> hit<00:00:52.980> our<00:00:53.190> target<00:00:53.850> weight<00:00:54.059> goals<00:00:54.329> we

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
order to hit our target weight goals we

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.319 
order to hit our target weight goals we
did<00:00:54.989> three<00:00:55.320> things<00:00:55.489> first<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.640> all<00:00:56.760> we<00:00:56.910> used<00:00:57.149> an

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
did three things first of all we used an

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.130 
did three things first of all we used an
800<00:00:57.840> fill<00:00:58.140> goose<00:00:59.100> down<00:00:59.399> that's<00:01:00.149> very<00:01:00.570> light

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
800 fill goose down that's very light

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.110 
800 fill goose down that's very light
very<00:01:01.170> compressible<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.489> second<00:01:02.850> thing<00:01:02.969> we

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
very compressible the second thing we

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.319 
very compressible the second thing we
did<00:01:03.329> was<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:04.170> use<00:01:04.469> a<00:01:04.769> 10<00:01:05.039> denier<00:01:05.429> nylon<00:01:05.489> fabric

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:06.329 
did was to use a 10 denier nylon fabric

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:08.599 
did was to use a 10 denier nylon fabric
the<00:01:06.959> third<00:01:07.170> thing<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.409> we<00:01:07.619> did<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:08.069> we<00:01:08.340> used<00:01:08.490> a

00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:08.609 
the third thing that we did is we used a

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:10.370 
the third thing that we did is we used a
patented<00:01:09.060> technology<00:01:09.630> called<00:01:09.840> in<00:01:10.049> Sutekh

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
patented technology called in Sutekh

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.590 
patented technology called in Sutekh
flow<00:01:10.679> and<00:01:11.429> what<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.729> does<00:01:11.969> is<00:01:11.999> you<00:01:12.270> can<00:01:12.420> see

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
flow and what that does is you can see

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.419 
flow and what that does is you can see
on<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.810> bag<00:01:12.959> these<00:01:13.170> long<00:01:13.590> vertical<00:01:13.950> lines

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:14.429 
on the bag these long vertical lines

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:16.580 
on the bag these long vertical lines
these<00:01:15.119> are<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.389> long<00:01:15.539> vertical<00:01:15.779> baffle

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
these are the long vertical baffle

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.949 
these are the long vertical baffle
chambers<00:01:17.039> and<00:01:17.639> what<00:01:17.789> we<00:01:17.880> did<00:01:18.209> by<00:01:18.420> using<00:01:18.659> this

00:01:18.949 --> 00:01:18.959 
chambers and what we did by using this

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:21.109 
chambers and what we did by using this
technology<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:20.069> reduce<00:01:20.219> the<00:01:20.729> number<00:01:21.090> of

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
technology is to reduce the number of

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.599 
technology is to reduce the number of
baffles<00:01:21.840> on<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.079> bag<00:01:22.259> in<00:01:23.100> terms<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.399> comfort

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:23.609 
baffles on the bag in terms of comfort

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:24.709 
baffles on the bag in terms of comfort
what<00:01:23.850> we<00:01:23.909> were<00:01:23.999> trying<00:01:24.149> to<00:01:24.270> do<00:01:24.420> when<00:01:24.569> we

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:24.719 
what we were trying to do when we

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:26.569 
what we were trying to do when we
designed<00:01:25.109> to<00:01:25.229> develop<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.499> bag<00:01:25.770> was<00:01:26.399> to

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:26.579 
designed to develop the bag was to

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:28.699 
designed to develop the bag was to
really<00:01:26.759> try<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:26.939> balance<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:28.079> size<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.679> shape

00:01:28.699 --> 00:01:28.709 
really try to balance the size the shape

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:30.709 
really try to balance the size the shape
and<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.219> weight<00:01:29.459> of<00:01:29.609> the<00:01:29.670> bag<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.509> long

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:30.719 
and the weight of the bag the long

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:32.899 
and the weight of the bag the long
vertical<00:01:30.929> baffles<00:01:31.399> basically<00:01:32.399> mirror<00:01:32.759> the

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
vertical baffles basically mirror the

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.639 
vertical baffles basically mirror the
contour<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.389> the<00:01:33.450> body<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:34.170> length<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
contour of the body the length and the

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:37.099 
contour of the body the length and the
arms<00:01:34.979> in<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.340> length<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.759> legs<00:01:35.999> so<00:01:36.779> when

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:37.109

around you additionally within Sutekh

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:43.659 
around you additionally within Sutekh
flow<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.389> get<00:01:42.569> more<00:01:42.779> even<00:01:43.109> heat<00:01:43.349> distribution

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:43.669 
flow you get more even heat distribution

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:46.309 
flow you get more even heat distribution
because<00:01:44.669> your<00:01:45.299> core<00:01:45.569> your<00:01:45.599> body<00:01:45.929> is<00:01:46.109> where<00:01:46.259> you

the right amount of down into that area

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:17.979 
the right amount of down into that area
to<00:02:16.280> keep<00:02:16.459> that<00:02:16.670> from<00:02:16.879> happening<00:02:16.910> we're<00:02:17.870> asked
