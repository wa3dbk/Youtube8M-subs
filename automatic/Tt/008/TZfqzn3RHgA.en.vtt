it taut so it doesn't unravel it looks

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.190 
it taut so it doesn't unravel it looks
more<00:01:43.000> complicated<00:01:43.150> than<00:01:43.630> it<00:01:43.720> is<00:01:43.750> I<00:01:44.020> promise

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
more complicated than it is I promise

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.300 
now I'll do the same thing with the back
section<00:01:49.509> twisting<00:01:50.140> it<00:01:50.229> towards<00:01:50.649> the<00:01:50.800> back<00:01:51.070> of

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
section twisting it towards the back of

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.930 
section twisting it towards the back of
my<00:01:51.580> head<00:01:51.820> same<00:01:52.300> direction<00:01:53.580> making<00:01:54.580> sure<00:01:54.820> to

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
my head same direction making sure to

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.999 
my head same direction making sure to
hold<00:01:55.030> it<00:01:55.240> taut<00:01:55.450> here's<00:01:56.410> both<00:01:56.619> sections

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
hold it taut here's both sections

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.770 
hold it taut here's both sections
twisted<00:01:57.429> and<00:01:57.610> then<00:01:57.940> I<00:01:57.970> take<00:01:58.149> the<00:01:58.270> back<00:01:58.479> section

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
twisted and then I take the back section

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.779 
twisted and then I take the back section
over<00:01:59.619> the<00:01:59.800> front<00:02:00.009> section<00:02:00.399> and<00:02:00.550> start

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
over the front section and start

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.980 
over the front section and start
twisting<00:02:01.210> down<00:02:01.360> I<00:02:01.649> like<00:02:02.649> to<00:02:03.660> quarter<00:02:04.660> turn<00:02:04.840> my

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
twisting down I like to quarter turn my

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.410 
twisting down I like to quarter turn my
hand<00:02:05.259> every<00:02:05.770> time<00:02:05.950> I<00:02:06.250> cross<00:02:06.729> the<00:02:06.880> strands<00:02:07.179> I

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
hand every time I cross the strands I

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.660 
hand every time I cross the strands I
think<00:02:08.170> if<00:02:08.259> it<00:02:08.440> is<00:02:08.739> a<00:02:08.769> tighter<00:02:09.130> twist<00:02:09.489> at<00:02:09.640> the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
think if it is a tighter twist at the

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.350 
think if it is a tighter twist at the
top<00:02:09.910> and<00:02:10.810> then<00:02:10.989> I<00:02:11.019> start<00:02:11.440> loosely<00:02:11.920> twisting

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
top and then I start loosely twisting

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:22.770 
top and then I start loosely twisting
towards<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.510> bottom<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:14.050> the<00:02:14.350> twist<00:02:21.780> keep

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
towards the bottom of the twist keep

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.420 
towards the bottom of the twist keep
twisting<00:02:23.200> all<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.650> way<00:02:23.709> to<00:02:23.769> the<00:02:23.980> bottom<00:02:24.310> of

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
twisting all the way to the bottom of

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.479 
twisting all the way to the bottom of
the<00:02:24.610> hair<00:02:24.850> and<00:02:25.200> then<00:02:26.200> make<00:02:26.769> it<00:02:26.920> stay<00:02:27.130> it's<00:02:27.280> easy

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
here's one that's pretty grown out but

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.180 
here's one that's pretty grown out but
it's<00:02:37.720> still<00:02:37.810> not<00:02:38.049> magic<00:02:38.410> see<00:02:38.560> how<00:02:38.620> easily<00:02:38.920> you

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
it's still not magic see how easily you

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.520 
it's still not magic see how easily you
can<00:02:39.340> see<00:02:39.489> my<00:02:39.579> finger<00:02:39.880> through<00:02:40.090> my<00:02:40.239> hair<00:02:40.530> but

can see my finger through my hair but

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.430 
can see my finger through my hair but

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
then this one is pretty mad at probably

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.630 
then this one is pretty mad at probably
because<00:02:44.620> it's<00:02:44.739> towards<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.010> back<00:02:45.190> of<00:02:45.220> my<00:02:45.430> head

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
because it's towards the back of my head

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.910 
because it's towards the back of my head
where<00:02:45.880> I<00:02:45.910> sleep<00:02:46.209> you<00:02:47.140> can<00:02:47.290> see<00:02:47.500> it's<00:02:47.650> really

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
where I sleep you can see it's really

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.650 
where I sleep you can see it's really
dense<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:48.640> you<00:02:48.820> can't<00:02:49.060> see<00:02:49.209> my<00:02:49.329> fingers

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
dense and you can't see my fingers

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.420 
dense and you can't see my fingers
through<00:02:49.870> my<00:02:49.900> hair<00:02:50.019> so<00:02:51.010> we're<00:02:51.130> going<00:02:51.220> to<00:02:51.310> fix

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.280 
that first I take all the hair that I'm
not<00:02:55.360> going<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.600> be<00:02:55.660> dealing<00:02:55.780> with<00:02:55.930> and<00:02:56.170> just

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
not going to be dealing with and just

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.770 
not going to be dealing with and just
keep<00:02:56.829> it<00:02:56.950> out<00:02:57.040> of<00:02:57.100> the<00:02:57.160> way<00:02:57.280> with<00:02:57.489> a<00:02:57.519> hair<00:02:57.700> tie

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
keep it out of the way with a hair tie

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.390 
keep it out of the way with a hair tie
that<00:02:58.780> way<00:02:58.900> I<00:02:58.930> can<00:02:59.140> work<00:02:59.260> easily<00:02:59.530> with<00:02:59.799> the<00:03:00.250> one

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
that way I can work easily with the one

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.270 
that way I can work easily with the one
that<00:03:00.610> is<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:00.970> problem<00:03:01.299> which<00:03:01.480> is<00:03:01.600> this<00:03:01.750> one<00:03:02.280> so

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
that is the problem which is this one so

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.830 
that is the problem which is this one so
I'll<00:03:03.400> start<00:03:03.640> unraveling<00:03:04.000> like<00:03:04.239> I<00:03:04.570> did<00:03:04.720> before

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
I'll start unraveling like I did before

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.619 
I'll start unraveling like I did before
gently<00:03:05.530> towards<00:03:06.100> the<00:03:06.220> top

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.880 

now<00:03:11.629> again<00:03:11.870> when<00:03:12.079> you<00:03:12.140> get<00:03:12.260> to<00:03:12.379> the<00:03:12.500> top<00:03:12.709> be

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
now again when you get to the top be

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.709 
now again when you get to the top be
really<00:03:13.340> careful<00:03:13.730> it<00:03:13.909> might<00:03:14.120> be<00:03:14.269> more<00:03:14.510> tangled

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:14.719

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:16.720 
really careful it might be more tangled
because<00:03:15.140> your<00:03:15.290> hair<00:03:15.409> is<00:03:15.439> matted<00:03:15.650> but<00:03:16.430> just<00:03:16.609> be

I'm gently brushing through the mat and

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.849 
I'm gently brushing through the mat and
the<00:04:05.629> reason<00:04:05.900> why<00:04:05.959> you<00:04:06.019> get<00:04:06.200> mats<00:04:06.439> to<00:04:06.650> begin

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:06.859 
the reason why you get mats to begin

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:08.770 
the reason why you get mats to begin
with<00:04:07.010> is<00:04:07.159> because<00:04:07.489> your<00:04:07.669> head<00:04:07.909> naturally

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
with is because your head naturally

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.110 
with is because your head naturally
sheds<00:04:09.319> hair<00:04:09.650> but<00:04:10.430> since<00:04:10.669> your<00:04:10.760> hair<00:04:10.909> is<00:04:11.000> and

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
sheds hair but since your hair is and

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.360 
sheds hair but since your hair is and
twists<00:04:11.540> that<00:04:11.810> shed<00:04:12.169> hair<00:04:12.440> can't<00:04:12.799> go<00:04:12.979> anywhere

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
twists that shed hair can't go anywhere

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.729 
twists that shed hair can't go anywhere
it<00:04:13.489> gets<00:04:13.639> stuck<00:04:13.970> up<00:04:14.840> at<00:04:14.989> the<00:04:15.079> top<00:04:15.290> where<00:04:15.500> the

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
it gets stuck up at the top where the

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.129 
it gets stuck up at the top where the
twist<00:04:15.979> meets<00:04:16.250> your<00:04:16.370> hair<00:04:16.609> and<00:04:16.870> so<00:04:17.870> we<00:04:17.989> just<00:04:18.079> got
