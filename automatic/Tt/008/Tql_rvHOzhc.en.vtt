00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.540
 I think I'll show everyone during the day 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.240
 little 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.620
 so create a video guide how to configure 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.740
 Maincraft server 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.400
 many ask this question why 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.869
 them login login writes when they go to 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.150
 server and why 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:26.070
 and minimum fast log in 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.410
 it will quickly log in i will say 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.130
 Immediately try to create a text 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.510
 document 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.770
 there already write the register password twice 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.440
 copy and paste immediately on 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:43.489
 server and immediately find register 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:50.750
 so on so now about baht login 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:56.070
 I will help you set up a command block there 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:59.910
 152 over there is still there so let's get started 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.850
 many beginnings of the online mod are set by this 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:09.380
 question they go to the server and now 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.380
 he writes bad login he even put 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:19.189
 saving now I will start the server and me 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.189
 tank will write login 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.550
 and I will tell you the solution to this problem. 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.420
 Now run on close to the flour 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.540
 and again means clinic 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.470
 that's how 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:56.050
 the server turned on we connect it 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.660
 here it is here it is it error code 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.110
 battle 1 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:06.390
 why is such a problem yes all because 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:08.080
 that when you started your server 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.730
 normal service up 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:16.810
 example is the word gift 1 online here 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:22.150
 letter online here need to put 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:26.230
 fous for the server to work just under 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.770
 a pirated version of minecraft here we are 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.670
 set files 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.670
 we start the server and 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.930
 and now everything will work for us 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:59.569
 and voila you calmly go to the server 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:04.860
 loading the world that's me on the server 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:07.280
