00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.539
 good 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.540
 the fuzz works very very full 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.909
 it sounds saturated but it does not sound like 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.909
 pasty sounds like well defined 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.070
 it is also very difficult to find a food 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.549
 that sounds good with gua and this one could 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.100
 to be 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.990
 maksimir in heaven is just as I have 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.090
 made to order does not have the 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.000
 two modes the vintage be a little 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.159
 more medium and as tight as with a 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.560
 little bit of gate for not so tight 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.420
 and the modern has a little more than more 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.920
 open the treble and a little more 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.450
 saturation what comes out a bit more the 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.250
 clean also because it is putting the 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.719
 two level controls something curious is 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.759
 that also many others are 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:55.119
 playing and you can leave the sound there 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:58.770
 type as a filter not because here sounds more 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.770
 serious since you could leave 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.580
 and 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.200
 as a serious means you can leave it type 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:14.420
 common as in some of the lows that 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.940
 there is in that they have instead of tone a 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.160
 filter that realize that that's not what 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.440
 you can leave right there where certain 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.870
 frequencies of this enhancement and it was already 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:28.490
 will make you sound a little bit 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.230
 more nasal more sharper for everything there is 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.730
 tomorrow I do not remember that in which I 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.130
 It was because you're playing and nothing more 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.790
 grid that consumes many times is 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:40.190
 turn off is not the fuzz sounds sounds very good 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.350
 for my benefit it complements the others 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.390
 two that I have then I do not have to 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.320
 draw none for the fans about 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.360
 everything to the clicking sound you do not need more 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.480
 just as here is the sound above all 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:58.000
 of those of the classic riffs new that 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.000
 if it is that the anesthesia solo 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.950
 the intro of facundo everton 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.430
 here come all this sounds 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.250
 is made to last like this is 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.870
 made so metal other gourds already 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.750
 proven part that have a very range 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.580
 Limited the opening of the water is very 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.930
 small that yes they have it 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.180
 it will be for the same design 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.180
 mechanic have you have more more 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.190
 just as the wind is more than ever 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.650
 you have more range I do not think more 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.250
 expressiveness gives you more the acute but it is 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.510
 a sharp musical is not a sharp yes as 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.730
 annoyed me for me there really is no or 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.290
 there is no option not always always I 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.290
 the morley ones 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.720
 all of him 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.720
 and another one 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.209
 life 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.209
 do not
