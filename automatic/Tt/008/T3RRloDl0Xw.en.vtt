00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
six a very low-scoring game i'm looking

six a very low-scoring game i'm looking
at<00:00:17.220> this<00:00:17.279> i<00:00:17.609> think<00:00:18.000> we're<00:00:18.090> going<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.270> see

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
at this i think we're going to see

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.150 
at this i think we're going to see
roughly<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.930> repeat<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.529> would<00:00:19.740> lean<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.130> the

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
roughly a repeat I would lean to the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.010 
roughly a repeat I would lean to the
under<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.699> probably<00:00:21.180> if<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.390> had<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.630> make<00:00:21.720> any

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
under and probably if I had to make any

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.500 
under and probably if I had to make any
bet<00:00:22.289> my<00:00:22.619> favorite<00:00:23.010> bet<00:00:23.189> might<00:00:23.760> be<00:00:23.789> LSU<00:00:24.359> on<00:00:24.480> a

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
bet my favorite bet might be LSU on a

teaser<00:00:24.750> now<00:00:24.990> you're<00:00:25.109> not<00:00:25.230> supposed<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.619> tease

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
teaser now you're not supposed to tease

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.470 
teaser now you're not supposed to tease
college<00:00:26.220> games<00:00:26.490> but<00:00:26.760> this<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.029> almost<00:00:27.150> like<00:00:27.300> an

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
college games but this is almost like an

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.620 
college games but this is almost like an
NFL<00:00:27.689> game<00:00:27.900> 40<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.560> very<00:00:28.769> low<00:00:28.980> total<00:00:29.220> for<00:00:29.789> for

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
NFL game 40 is a very low total for for

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.110 
NFL game 40 is a very low total for for
a<00:00:30.660> college<00:00:30.900> game<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:32.489> know<00:00:32.610> I<00:00:32.820> think

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
a college game and I you know I think

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.670 
a college game and I you know I think
we're<00:00:33.329> going<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.510> see<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.690> same<00:00:33.719> thing<00:00:34.079> tight

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
we're going to see the same thing tight

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.040 
we're going to see the same thing tight
low-scoring<00:00:35.040> very<00:00:35.820> very<00:00:36.059> close<00:00:36.329> goes<00:00:36.660> down<00:00:36.870> to

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
low-scoring very very close goes down to

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.569 
low-scoring very very close goes down to
the<00:00:37.079> wire<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.620> think<00:00:37.890> if<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.040> tease<00:00:38.219> Alice<00:00:38.489> are

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
the wire I think if you tease Alice are

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.069 
the wire I think if you tease Alice are
you<00:00:38.640> up<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.090> know<00:00:39.210> seven<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.719> half<00:00:39.750> or

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
you up to you know seven and a half or

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.930 
you up to you know seven and a half or
so<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.710> might<00:00:40.860> be<00:00:40.980> getting<00:00:41.100> some<00:00:41.370> good<00:00:41.520> value

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
so you might be getting some good value

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.090 
so you might be getting some good value
other<00:00:42.210> than<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:42.510> again<00:00:42.870> Eileen<00:00:43.320> under<00:00:43.620> steve

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
other than that again Eileen under steve

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.040 
other than that again Eileen under steve

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
what's your take on this game well we

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.229 
what's your take on this game well we
have<00:00:46.230> we've<00:00:46.680> seen<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.190> game<00:00:47.430> before<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:48.149> we

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
have we've seen this game before and we

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.270 
have we've seen this game before and we
talked<00:00:48.510> about<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:49.020> before<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.860> first<00:00:50.070> time

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
talked about it before the first time

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.369 
talked about it before the first time
they<00:00:50.430> played<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.149> I<00:00:51.780> said<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.230> these

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
they played and and I said that these

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.340 
they played and and I said that these
teams<00:00:52.680> were<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.129> close<00:00:53.820> as<00:00:54.120> everyone<00:00:54.750> believed

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
teams were so close as everyone believed

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.470 
teams were so close as everyone believed
going<00:00:55.620> into<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:55.949> game<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.699> felt<00:00:57.360> that

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
going into that game that I felt that

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.689 
going into that game that I felt that
the<00:00:58.199> game<00:00:58.469> would<00:00:58.620> come<00:00:58.829> down<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.010> special<00:00:59.520> team

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
the game would come down to special team

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.119 
the game would come down to special team
and<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.570> turns<00:01:00.870> out<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.379> pretty<00:01:01.680> much<00:01:01.890> did

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
and it turns out that it pretty much did

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.860 
and it turns out that it pretty much did
come<00:01:02.340> down<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.609> special<00:01:02.969> teams<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.329> have<00:01:03.750> no

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
come down to special teams I have no

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.359 
come down to special teams I have no
reason<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.320> believe<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.589> things<00:01:05.070> have

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
reason to believe that things have

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.490 
reason to believe that things have
changed<00:01:06.030> all<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.210> much<00:01:06.479> going<00:01:07.140> into<00:01:07.350> this

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
changed all that much going into this

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.000 
changed all that much going into this
game<00:01:07.650> if<00:01:08.010> anything<00:01:09.020> LSU<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.140> playing<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.680> little

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
game if anything LSU is playing a little

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.840 
game if anything LSU is playing a little
bit<00:01:11.340> better<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.939> think<00:01:12.720> perhaps<00:01:13.400> the<00:01:14.400> better

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
bit better I think perhaps the better

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.020 
bit better I think perhaps the better
play<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:16.140> rather<00:01:16.500> than<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.830> side<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.490> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
play in this rather than a side is the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.320 
play in this rather than a side is the
under<00:01:18.479> with<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.590> total<00:01:20.009> being<00:01:20.400> at<00:01:20.610> forty<00:01:21.060> here

under with the total being at forty here

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.719 
under with the total being at forty here
and<00:01:21.570> these<00:01:21.960> are<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.320> two<00:01:22.619> best<00:01:23.040> scoring

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
and these are the two best scoring

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.300 
and these are the two best scoring
defense<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.570> bar<00:01:24.840> none<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.650> country<00:01:26.130> I

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.640 
defense is bar none in the country I
cannot<00:01:27.000> imagine<00:01:27.210> how<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:27.930> game<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.229> going<00:01:28.560> to

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
cannot imagine how this game is going to

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.370 
cannot imagine how this game is going to
get<00:01:28.860> over<00:01:29.610> 40<00:01:30.150> points<00:01:30.630> with<00:01:30.780> these<00:01:30.960> two<00:01:31.140> teams

where this game is going to be played I

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.030 
where this game is going to be played I
don't<00:01:42.450> necessarily<00:01:43.320> think<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.619> gives<00:01:43.890> them

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
don't necessarily think that gives them

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.700 
don't necessarily think that gives them
a<00:01:44.189> huge<00:01:44.430> edge<00:01:44.909> however<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.409> it's

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
a huge edge however it is it's

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.310 
a huge edge however it is it's

ratings<00:01:49.829> we<00:01:50.009> believe<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.340> LSU<00:01:50.850> should<00:01:51.780> be

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
ratings we believe that LSU should be

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.649 
ratings we believe that LSU should be
favored<00:01:52.500> by<00:01:52.680> about<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.040> field<00:01:53.490> goal<00:01:53.729> since<00:01:54.420> this

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
both kind of see this game as similar to

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.089 
both kind of see this game as similar to
the<00:02:08.819> first<00:02:09.030> game<00:02:09.270> slight<00:02:09.810> edge<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.020> LSU<00:02:10.649> likely

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
the first game slight edge to LSU likely

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.949 
the first game slight edge to LSU likely
to<00:02:11.190> be<00:02:11.280> low<00:02:11.430> scoring<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.090> go<00:02:12.480> under<00:02:12.750> is<00:02:12.840> that

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
to be low scoring and go under is that

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.400 
to be low scoring and go under is that
how<00:02:13.080> you<00:02:13.140> do

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
how you do

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.850 
how you do
be<00:02:13.470> with<00:02:13.590> us<00:02:13.710> ah<00:02:14.510> I<00:02:15.510> guess<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.320> agree<00:02:16.410> on<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.680> one

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
be with us ah I guess I agree on the one

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.320 
be with us ah I guess I agree on the one
part<00:02:17.130> but<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.280> actually<00:02:17.490> think<00:02:17.730> this<00:02:18.060> is<00:02:18.180> gonna

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
part but I actually think this is gonna

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.510 
part but I actually think this is gonna
get<00:02:18.540> high<00:02:18.660> scoring<00:02:19.050> game<00:02:19.170> really<00:02:19.800> you<00:02:20.310> look

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
get high scoring game really you look

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.510 
get high scoring game really you look
historically<00:02:20.990> when<00:02:21.990> you<00:02:22.080> have<00:02:22.260> rematches<00:02:23.160> the

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
historically when you have rematches the

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.680 
historically when you have rematches the
the<00:02:24.270> first<00:02:24.540> game<00:02:24.810> gives<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:25.890> really<00:02:26.340> no

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
the first game gives you really no

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.610 
the first game gives you really no
indication<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:27.720> what<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:27.900> second<00:02:28.350> game<00:02:28.500> is

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
indication of what the second game is

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.170 
indication of what the second game is
going<00:02:28.740> to<00:02:28.830> be<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.160> many<00:02:29.280> times<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.880> second

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
going to be and many times the second

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.690 
going to be and many times the second
game<00:02:30.330> is<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.510> complete<00:02:30.900> opposite<00:02:31.410> mm-hmm<00:02:31.980> and

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
game is a complete opposite mm-hmm and

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.880 
game is a complete opposite mm-hmm and
there's<00:02:33.660> several<00:02:33.840> points<00:02:34.110> in<00:02:34.290> fact<00:02:34.590> in<00:02:34.770> that

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
there's several points in fact in that

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.560 
there's several points in fact in that
first<00:02:35.190> game<00:02:35.340> you<00:02:36.030> know<00:02:36.090> even<00:02:36.240> though<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.480> was

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
first game you know even though it was

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.180 
first game you know even though it was
nine<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:37.020> six<00:02:38.720> you<00:02:39.720> know<00:02:39.780> Alabama<00:02:40.380> was<00:02:40.830> able<00:02:41.130> to

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
nine to six you know Alabama was able to

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.420 
nine to six you know Alabama was able to
move<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.400> ball<00:02:41.550> against<00:02:42.120> LSU<00:02:42.270> they<00:02:42.810> had

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.210 
drives posted 40 or more yards on four
more<00:02:54.030> and<00:02:54.330> six<00:02:55.110> of<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.350> drives<00:02:55.620> had<00:02:55.950> at<00:02:56.100> least

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
more and six of the drives had at least

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.430 
more and six of the drives had at least

six offensive plays and for them had at
least<00:02:58.560> seven<00:02:59.060> so<00:03:00.060> there<00:03:00.450> was<00:03:00.570> very<00:03:00.870> few

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
least seven so there was very few

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.280 
least seven so there was very few
three-and-outs<00:03:02.240> by<00:03:03.240> Alabama<00:03:03.780> in<00:03:03.930> that<00:03:04.050> game

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
three-and-outs by Alabama in that game

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.020 
three-and-outs by Alabama in that game
and<00:03:04.530> obviously<00:03:04.770> there<00:03:05.100> was<00:03:05.250> very<00:03:05.490> few<00:03:05.580> three

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
and obviously there was very few three

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.090 
and obviously there was very few three
announced<00:03:06.360> by<00:03:06.480> LSU<00:03:06.810> in<00:03:07.080> that<00:03:07.230> game<00:03:07.440> keep<00:03:07.950> in

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
announced by LSU in that game keep in

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.100 
announced by LSU in that game keep in
mind<00:03:08.130> too<00:03:08.520> that<00:03:08.550> Alabama<00:03:09.090> attempted<00:03:09.660> six

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
mind too that Alabama attempted six

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.870 
mind too that Alabama attempted six
field<00:03:10.470> goals<00:03:10.560> in<00:03:10.860> that<00:03:11.010> game<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:11.460> obviously

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
field goals in that game and obviously

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.150 
field goals in that game and obviously
missed<00:03:12.420> I<00:03:12.690> forget<00:03:13.320> how<00:03:13.470> many<00:03:13.650> they<00:03:13.740> missed<00:03:13.980> but

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
missed I forget how many they missed but

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.420 
missed I forget how many they missed but
it<00:03:14.190> was<00:03:14.400> they<00:03:14.700> missed<00:03:14.940> too<00:03:15.090> many<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:16.650> those<00:03:17.010> in

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
it was they missed too many and those in

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.210 
it was they missed too many and those in
a<00:03:17.580> game<00:03:17.790> like<00:03:17.820> this<00:03:18.030> I<00:03:18.300> can<00:03:18.840> see<00:03:19.050> those<00:03:19.290> red

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
a game like this I can see those red

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.280 
a game like this I can see those red
zone<00:03:20.459> situations<00:03:21.209> now<00:03:21.450> turning<00:03:21.780> into<00:03:22.050> touched

opposition and I do believe even though
these<00:03:51.750> are<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:52.080> second<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:52.500> third<00:03:52.620> best

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
these are the second and third best

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.729 
these are the second and third best
defenses<00:03:53.640> in<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.760> country<00:03:53.840> that<00:03:54.840> they're<00:03:55.530> the

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
defenses in the country that they're the

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:56.960 
defenses in the country that they're the
ones<00:03:55.920> they're<00:03:56.070> going<00:03:56.190> to<00:03:56.250> be<00:03:56.370> sucking<00:03:56.670> air

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
ones they're going to be sucking air

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.300 
ones they're going to be sucking air
come<00:03:57.300> the<00:03:57.420> third<00:03:57.630> quarter<00:03:58.080> yo<00:03:58.470> moreover<00:03:58.860> the

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
come the third quarter yo moreover the

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.590 
come the third quarter yo moreover the
defenses<00:03:59.820> are<00:03:59.880> capable<00:04:00.090> of<00:04:00.300> forcing

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
defenses are capable of forcing

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.600 
defenses are capable of forcing
turnovers<00:04:00.959> too<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:01.800> some<00:04:02.190> of<00:04:02.280> those<00:04:02.370> could<00:04:02.580> be

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
turnovers too and some of those could be

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:07.640 
turnovers too and some of those could be
pick<00:04:02.940> sixes<00:04:04.310> so<00:04:05.310> I<00:04:05.340> guess<00:04:05.880> my<00:04:06.050> thinking<00:04:07.050> Peter

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
pick sixes so I guess my thinking Peter

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.890 
pick sixes so I guess my thinking Peter
steve<00:04:08.040> is<00:04:08.250> is<00:04:08.489> I'm<00:04:08.880> not<00:04:09.150> going<00:04:09.420> to<00:04:09.480> make<00:04:09.570> a<00:04:09.630> bet

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
steve is is I'm not going to make a bet

steve is is I'm not going to make a bet
on<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.110> under<00:04:10.640> simple<00:04:11.640> because<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:11.910> first

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
on the under simple because the first

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.940 
on the under simple because the first
game<00:04:12.480> was<00:04:12.600> at<00:04:12.720> nine<00:04:12.900> to<00:04:13.050> six<00:04:13.320> score<00:04:13.680> and

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
especially when you look at the detail

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.250 
especially when you look at the detail
the<00:04:15.900> first<00:04:16.169> game<00:04:16.470> that<00:04:16.739> could<00:04:17.459> have<00:04:17.580> been<00:04:17.730> a

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:18.260 
the first game that could have been a

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.080 
the first game that could have been a
24-21<00:04:19.260> game<00:04:19.590> yeah<00:04:20.250> I<00:04:20.280> mean<00:04:20.489> I<00:04:20.549> mean<00:04:20.790> it<00:04:20.910> is<00:04:20.940> kind

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
24-21 game yeah I mean I mean it is kind

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.520

of<00:04:21.330> like<00:04:21.419> I<00:04:21.570> do<00:04:21.630> feel<00:04:21.870> a<00:04:21.930> little<00:04:21.989> bit<00:04:22.169> like<00:04:22.320> out

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
of like I do feel a little bit like out

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.440 
of like I do feel a little bit like out
like<00:04:22.560> at<00:04:22.919> the<00:04:23.070> typical<00:04:23.580> public<00:04:24.000> square

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
like at the typical public square

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.680 
like at the typical public square
analysis<00:04:24.750> being<00:04:25.320> like<00:04:25.470> well<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:26.070> scoring

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
analysis being like well the scoring

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:27.820 
analysis being like well the scoring
game<00:04:26.810> was<00:04:26.960> nine<00:04:27.110> to<00:04:27.290> six<00:04:27.500> so<00:04:27.590> what<00:04:27.710> do<00:04:27.770> you

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830

I really do not feel like it's a trap in
this<00:04:44.630> case<00:04:44.930> looking<00:04:45.710> at<00:04:45.800> these<00:04:45.950> two<00:04:46.190> defenses
