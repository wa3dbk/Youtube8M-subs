00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
hey guys Declan here so today I'm going

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.390 
hey guys Declan here so today I'm going
to<00:00:12.719> be<00:00:12.780> showing<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.320> how<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.530> do<00:00:13.769> some<00:00:14.009> acid

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
to be showing you how to do some acid

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.330 
to be showing you how to do some acid
etching<00:00:15.740> I'm<00:00:16.740> going<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:16.980> do<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.130> in<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.220> few

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
etching I'm going to do it in a few

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.680 
etching I'm going to do it in a few
different<00:00:17.640> steps<00:00:17.789> obviously<00:00:18.270> because<00:00:18.510> it's<00:00:18.660> a

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
different steps obviously because it's a

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.779 
different steps obviously because it's a
waiting<00:00:18.960> process<00:00:19.109> with<00:00:19.529> actually<00:00:20.369> dipping<00:00:20.699> it

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
waiting process with actually dipping it

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.450 
waiting process with actually dipping it
in<00:00:20.850> acid<00:00:21.380> but<00:00:22.380> we'll<00:00:22.529> start<00:00:22.769> with<00:00:22.830> those<00:00:23.039> first

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
in acid but we'll start with those first

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.460 
in acid but we'll start with those first
steps<00:00:23.640> and<00:00:24.060> go<00:00:24.150> on<00:00:24.330> from<00:00:24.420> there

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
steps and go on from there

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.259 
steps and go on from there
I'll<00:00:25.890> show<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.130> how<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.220> do<00:00:26.430> positive<00:00:27.060> and

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
I'll show you how to do positive and

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.220 
I'll show you how to do positive and
negative<00:00:27.930> etching<00:00:28.230> as<00:00:28.349> well<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:29.570> so<00:00:30.570> we've<00:00:31.050> got

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
negative etching as well so so we've got

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.500 
negative etching as well so so we've got
two<00:00:31.380> more<00:00:31.560> knives<00:00:31.769> here<00:00:32.120> I've<00:00:33.120> already<00:00:33.390> done

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
two more knives here I've already done

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
up to Chi and giving yourself a bit of

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.760 
up to Chi and giving yourself a bit of
like<00:00:51.949> borders<00:00:52.949> not<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.309> stay<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:54.289> so<00:00:55.289> on<00:00:55.590> this

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
like borders not to stay in so on this

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.700 
like borders not to stay in so on this
one<00:00:55.949> I'm<00:00:56.070> going<00:00:56.250> for<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.489> splattered<00:00:56.910> effect

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
one I'm going for the splattered effect

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.369 
one I'm going for the splattered effect
one<00:00:58.710> quick<00:00:59.160> real<00:00:59.870> important<00:01:00.870> tip<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.260> do

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
one quick real important tip that you do

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.579 
one quick real important tip that you do
first<00:01:01.649> make<00:01:02.579> sure<00:01:02.820> that<00:01:03.000> you<00:01:03.180> go<00:01:03.420> on<00:01:03.750> the

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
first make sure that you go on the

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.950 
first make sure that you go on the
cutting<00:01:05.250> edge<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.299> tip<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.780> knife

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
cutting edge and the tip of the knife

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.710 
cutting edge and the tip of the knife
first<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.460> give<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.210> more<00:01:09.360> than<00:01:09.540> one

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
first and you give it more than one

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.500 
first and you give it more than one
layer<00:01:09.930> because<00:01:10.380> if<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:11.189> if<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.119> acid

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
layer because if you if the acid

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.450 
layer because if you if the acid
actually<00:01:12.659> leaks<00:01:13.020> through<00:01:13.290> that<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:14.130> you

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
actually leaks through that and you

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.820 
actually leaks through that and you
start<00:01:14.729> etching<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.540> cutting<00:01:16.229> edge<00:01:16.350> or<00:01:16.619> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
start etching the cutting edge or the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.719 
start etching the cutting edge or the
point

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
point

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.580 
point
Yuliya<00:01:18.299> where<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.630> material<00:01:19.080> really<00:01:19.229> fast

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
Yuliya where the material really fast

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.950 
Yuliya where the material really fast
and<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.009> will<00:01:20.280> have<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.580> regrind<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.930> I

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
and you will have to regrind it so I

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.660 
and you will have to regrind it so I
always<00:01:22.290> go<00:01:22.439> over<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:23.100> cutting<00:01:23.340> edge<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:23.580> a

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
always go over the cutting edge in a

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.300 
always go over the cutting edge in a
point<00:01:23.880> more<00:01:24.180> than<00:01:24.360> once<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.680> way<00:01:25.830> you

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
point more than once and that way you

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.280 
point more than once and that way you
just<00:01:26.369> basically<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.299> bit<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.540> extra<00:01:27.810> protection

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
just basically a bit of extra protection

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.120 
just basically a bit of extra protection
so<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.680> don't<00:01:28.950> have<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.220> rewind<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.729> blade<00:01:31.130> so

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
so you don't have to rewind the blade so

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.130 
so you don't have to rewind the blade so
yes<00:01:32.369> I'm<00:01:32.549> going<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.850> start<00:01:33.060> off<00:01:33.150> by<00:01:33.329> doing<00:01:34.049> the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
yes I'm going to start off by doing the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.080 
yes I'm going to start off by doing the
splatter<00:01:34.409> effect<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:34.979> one<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.790> what<00:01:36.030> you

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
splatter effect on this one and what you

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.289 
splatter effect on this one and what you
do<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.509> get<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:37.430> brush<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:39.240> you

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
do is you get the brush and you

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.319 
do is you get the brush and you
basically<00:01:39.570> put<00:01:40.079> big<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.189> little<00:01:41.520> size<00:01:41.939> dubs

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
basically put big and little size dubs

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.080 
basically put big and little size dubs
like<00:01:45.329> so<00:01:46.280> all<00:01:47.280> over<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.549> blade<00:01:47.729> I'll<00:01:47.880> do<00:01:48.000> it

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
like so all over the blade I'll do it

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.399 
like so all over the blade I'll do it
down<00:01:48.210> here<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.810> show<00:01:49.470> you

so this takes a few minutes so I'll do
is<00:01:55.689> I'll<00:01:55.840> cut<00:01:56.079> the<00:01:56.170> record<00:01:56.530> in<00:01:56.649> here<00:01:57.070> and<00:01:57.689> bring

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
so as you can see over obviously put

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.380 
so as you can see over obviously put
lots<00:02:04.509> and<00:02:04.659> lots<00:02:04.810> of<00:02:04.930> spots<00:02:05.259> on<00:02:05.590> there<00:02:06.270> so<00:02:07.270> now

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
lots and lots of spots on there so now

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.940 
lots and lots of spots on there so now
what<00:02:07.509> I<00:02:07.570> would<00:02:07.689> do<00:02:07.810> is<00:02:07.929> basically<00:02:08.110> go<00:02:08.560> over<00:02:08.590> the

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
what I would do is basically go over the

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.580 
what I would do is basically go over the
edge<00:02:09.099> again<00:02:09.280> and<00:02:09.640> but<00:02:10.509> I'm<00:02:10.599> just<00:02:10.780> using<00:02:10.989> the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
edge again and but I'm just using the

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.339 
edge again and but I'm just using the
next<00:02:11.890> step<00:02:12.069> and<00:02:12.510> make<00:02:13.510> sure<00:02:13.840> you<00:02:14.080> don't<00:02:14.170> forget

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
next step and make sure you don't forget

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:16.199 
next step and make sure you don't forget
to<00:02:14.830> do<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.069> spine<00:02:15.340> so<00:02:15.610> in<00:02:15.700> this<00:02:15.819> case<00:02:16.030> I'm

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
to do the spine so in this case I'm

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.120 
to do the spine so in this case I'm
having<00:02:16.450> this<00:02:16.569> blur<00:02:16.810> effect<00:02:17.230> so<00:02:18.010> I'll

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
having this blur effect so I'll

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.580 
having this blur effect so I'll
basically<00:02:18.220> just<00:02:18.670> run<00:02:18.880> down<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.209> spine<00:02:19.590> doing

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
basically just run down the spine doing

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.880 
basically just run down the spine doing
a<00:02:20.650> couple<00:02:20.980> of<00:02:21.099> dots<00:02:21.310> some<00:02:21.610> big<00:02:21.849> some<00:02:22.269> small

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
a couple of dots some big some small

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.910 
a couple of dots some big some small
same<00:02:23.890> sort<00:02:24.190> of<00:02:24.360> principle<00:02:25.440> just<00:02:26.440> so<00:02:26.590> that<00:02:26.739> when

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
same sort of principle just so that when

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.259 
same sort of principle just so that when
you've<00:02:27.099> actually<00:02:27.280> finished<00:02:27.790> a<00:02:27.910> knife<00:02:28.060> it

00:02:28.259 --> 00:02:28.269 
you've actually finished a knife it

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:29.729 
you've actually finished a knife it
doesn't<00:02:28.569> sort<00:02:28.810> of<00:02:28.900> like<00:02:29.019> our<00:02:29.170> place<00:02:29.410> on<00:02:29.650> the

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
doesn't sort of like our place on the

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.740 
doesn't sort of like our place on the
spine<00:02:30.690> so<00:02:31.690> just<00:02:31.900> a<00:02:31.989> few<00:02:32.140> dabs<00:02:32.349> like<00:02:32.890> so<00:02:33.750> just

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
spine so just a few dabs like so just

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.089 
spine so just a few dabs like so just
want<00:02:34.900> to<00:02:35.019> quickly<00:02:35.170> shoot<00:02:35.380> before<00:02:35.680> we<00:02:35.799> do<00:02:35.950> pick

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
want to quickly shoot before we do pick

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.610 
want to quickly shoot before we do pick
ice<00:02:36.280> that<00:02:36.610> I've<00:02:36.790> put<00:02:37.120> my<00:02:37.239> logo<00:02:37.599> there<00:02:37.989> in<00:02:38.170> red

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
ice that I've put my logo there in red

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.710 
ice that I've put my logo there in red
so<00:02:38.799> you<00:02:38.830> can<00:02:39.010> obviously<00:02:39.250> see<00:02:39.519> it<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:40.000> that's

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
so you can obviously see it and that's

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.080 
so you can obviously see it and that's
just<00:02:40.930> so<00:02:41.080> that<00:02:41.110> when<00:02:41.380> we<00:02:41.950> etch<00:02:42.310> it<00:02:42.580> you<00:02:42.790> still

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
just so that when we etch it you still

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.250 
just so that when we etch it you still
get<00:02:43.180> my<00:02:43.299> logo<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:45.340> now<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:45.519> next<00:02:45.730> part<00:02:46.200> is<00:02:47.200> the

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
get my logo so now the next part is the

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:56.460 
get my logo so now the next part is the
dip<00:02:47.650> in<00:02:50.040> is<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.910> acid<00:02:54.540> I'll<00:02:55.540> put<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.930> link<00:02:56.170> in

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
dip in is the acid I'll put the link in

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.190 
dip in is the acid I'll put the link in
the<00:02:56.620> description<00:02:57.250> for<00:02:57.810> where<00:02:58.810> you<00:02:58.900> can<00:02:59.049> get

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
the description for where you can get

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.349 
the description for where you can get
this<00:02:59.319> acid<00:02:59.709> and<00:02:59.980> also<00:03:00.549> the<00:03:00.670> name<00:03:00.910> of<00:03:00.940> it<00:03:01.180> and

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
this acid and also the name of it and

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.870 
this acid and also the name of it and
then<00:03:02.079> basically<00:03:02.470> what<00:03:02.650> you'll<00:03:02.799> do<00:03:02.980> is<00:03:03.190> this

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
then basically what you'll do is this

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.470 
then basically what you'll do is this
handle<00:03:04.390> is<00:03:04.540> plastic<00:03:05.350> so<00:03:05.799> the<00:03:06.190> material<00:03:06.880> will

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
handle is plastic so the material will

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.569 
handle is plastic so the material will
naturally<00:03:07.720> be<00:03:08.079> and<00:03:08.350> by<00:03:08.500> this<00:03:08.560> acid<00:03:09.040> set<00:03:09.310> only

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
naturally be and by this acid set only

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:14.819 
naturally be and by this acid set only
effects<00:03:10.139> now<00:03:11.880> so<00:03:12.880> you<00:03:12.940> then<00:03:13.150> basically<00:03:13.829> dip

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
effects now so you then basically dip

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.160 
effects now so you then basically dip
this<00:03:15.100> into<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.519> acid<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.209> leave<00:03:16.750> it<00:03:16.930> hanging

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
this into the acid and leave it hanging

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.400 
this into the acid and leave it hanging
I<00:03:18.540> normally<00:03:19.540> leave<00:03:19.630> it<00:03:19.780> for<00:03:19.930> about<00:03:20.049> five

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
I normally leave it for about five

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.979 
I normally leave it for about five
minutes<00:03:20.880> when<00:03:21.880> it<00:03:22.090> started<00:03:22.510> to<00:03:22.630> be<00:03:22.750> a<00:03:22.780> little

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
minutes when it started to be a little

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.990 
minutes when it started to be a little
bit<00:03:23.170> older<00:03:23.319> the<00:03:23.650> acid<00:03:23.950> you<00:03:24.100> obviously<00:03:24.459> will

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
bit older the acid you obviously will

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.099 
bit older the acid you obviously will
need<00:03:25.180> to<00:03:25.299> leave<00:03:25.420> it<00:03:25.569> a<00:03:25.630> little<00:03:25.750> bit<00:03:25.930> longer

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
need to leave it a little bit longer

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.259 
need to leave it a little bit longer
just<00:03:26.290> to<00:03:26.680> make<00:03:27.340> sure<00:03:27.370> that<00:03:27.579> you<00:03:27.700> get<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:27.970> nice

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
just to make sure that you get the nice

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:32.729 
just to make sure that you get the nice
edge<00:03:29.609> so<00:03:30.630> that's<00:03:31.630> the<00:03:31.840> next<00:03:31.989> step<00:03:32.260> for<00:03:32.530> that

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
edge so that's the next step for that

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.330 
edge so that's the next step for that
knife<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:33.220> I'll<00:03:34.590> grab<00:03:35.590> the<00:03:35.739> other<00:03:35.769> knife<00:03:36.040> and

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
knife and I'll grab the other knife and

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.360 
knife and I'll grab the other knife and
show<00:03:37.150> you<00:03:37.209> that<00:03:37.389> one<00:03:37.859> right<00:03:38.859> guy<00:03:38.980> so<00:03:39.130> I'm<00:03:39.280> about

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
show you that one right guy so I'm about

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.090 
show you that one right guy so I'm about
to<00:03:39.639> dip<00:03:39.910> this<00:03:40.569> one<00:03:40.810> and<00:03:41.319> I<00:03:41.500> just<00:03:41.680> want<00:03:41.799> to<00:03:41.859> cheer

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
to dip this one and I just want to cheer

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.610 
to dip this one and I just want to cheer
this<00:03:42.190> one<00:03:42.370> before<00:03:42.700> it's<00:03:42.880> finished<00:03:43.319> as<00:03:44.319> you<00:03:44.500> can

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
this one before it's finished as you can

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.170 
this one before it's finished as you can
see<00:03:44.739> there's<00:03:44.920> music<00:03:45.220> notes<00:03:45.459> and<00:03:45.790> on<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.090> other

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
see there's music notes and on the other

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.960 
see there's music notes and on the other
side<00:03:46.560> music<00:03:47.560> notes<00:03:47.769> with<00:03:48.069> my<00:03:49.230> wolf<00:03:50.230> claw<00:03:50.500> logo

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
side music notes with my wolf claw logo

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.660 
side music notes with my wolf claw logo
some<00:03:51.970> more<00:03:52.090> music<00:03:52.329> notes<00:03:53.190> so<00:03:54.190> basically<00:03:54.489> guys

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
some more music notes so basically guys

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.190 
some more music notes so basically guys
the<00:03:54.849> reason<00:03:55.090> I'm<00:03:55.180> doing<00:03:55.299> it<00:03:55.480> this<00:03:55.660> way<00:03:55.720> is<00:03:56.139> to

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 
the reason I'm doing it this way is to

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.660 
the reason I'm doing it this way is to
show<00:03:56.530> you<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.739> difference<00:03:57.040> between<00:03:57.099> positive

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
show you the difference between positive

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.599 
show you the difference between positive
and<00:03:57.970> negative<00:03:58.200> because<00:03:59.200> all<00:04:00.040> of<00:04:00.069> the<00:04:00.310> shiny

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
and negative because all of the shiny

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.620 
and negative because all of the shiny
areas<00:04:01.000> that<00:04:01.180> are<00:04:01.500> visible<00:04:02.500> here<00:04:03.340> will<00:04:04.150> be

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
areas that are visible here will be

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.940 
areas that are visible here will be
etched<00:04:05.049> by<00:04:05.739> the<00:04:05.799> acid

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
etched by the acid

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.610 
etched by the acid
and<00:04:07.069> it<00:04:07.340> will<00:04:07.430> be<00:04:07.520> the<00:04:07.730> biggest<00:04:08.420> area<00:04:08.780> shiny

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
and it will be the biggest area shiny

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.280 
and it will be the biggest area shiny
and<00:04:10.069> on<00:04:10.550> this<00:04:10.819> one<00:04:11.120> it's<00:04:11.569> the<00:04:11.630> opposite<00:04:11.989> so

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
and on this one it's the opposite so

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.559 
and on this one it's the opposite so
you'll<00:04:13.010> get<00:04:13.220> all<00:04:13.430> of<00:04:13.610> the<00:04:13.700> little<00:04:13.910> dots<00:04:14.209> will

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
you'll get all of the little dots will

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.390 
you'll get all of the little dots will
be<00:04:14.660> very<00:04:15.080> very<00:04:15.290> shiny<00:04:15.530> and<00:04:15.650> the<00:04:15.950> rest<00:04:16.100> in<00:04:16.250> life

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
be very very shiny and the rest in life

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.629 
be very very shiny and the rest in life
will<00:04:16.579> be<00:04:16.609> sort<00:04:17.060> of<00:04:17.090> a<00:04:17.239> dark<00:04:17.510> faded<00:04:17.930> color<00:04:18.139> and

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
will be sort of a dark faded color and

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.560 
will be sort of a dark faded color and
and<00:04:19.639> that's<00:04:20.180> the<00:04:20.239> difference<00:04:20.510> between

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
and that's the difference between

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.200 
and that's the difference between
positive<00:04:20.989> and<00:04:21.320> negative<00:04:21.970> so<00:04:22.970> this<00:04:23.120> is

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
positive and negative so this is

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:28.090 
positive and negative so this is
basically<00:04:23.600> dipping<00:04:24.290> them<00:04:26.560> I'm<00:04:27.560> just<00:04:27.620> using<00:04:27.980> my

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
basically dipping them I'm just using my

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.580 
basically dipping them I'm just using my
kitchen<00:04:28.580> so<00:04:28.760> idea<00:04:29.030> as<00:04:29.210> a<00:04:29.360> little<00:04:29.660> rig<00:04:29.870> to<00:04:30.169> hold

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
kitchen so idea as a little rig to hold

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:42.400 
kitchen so idea as a little rig to hold
the<00:04:31.310> blade<00:04:32.350> and<00:04:33.350> I'll<00:04:33.500> lower<00:04:33.680> it<00:04:33.800> in<00:04:38.950> and<00:04:41.410> tie

find the light engraving than none

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:10.920 
find the light engraving than none
I<00:06:07.729> think<00:06:08.330> that<00:06:08.419> looks<00:06:08.570> bad<00:06:08.780> but<00:06:09.020> it's<00:06:09.260> wrong

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
I think that looks bad but it's wrong

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:18.279 
I think that looks bad but it's wrong
and<00:06:11.930> then<00:06:12.290> once<00:06:12.500> you've<00:06:12.650> given<00:06:12.770> this<00:06:12.979> and<00:06:17.289> this

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:18.289 
and then once you've given this and this

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:19.900 
and then once you've given this and this
also<00:06:18.500> polishes<00:06:19.039> the<00:06:19.160> rest<00:06:19.280> of<00:06:19.370> later<00:06:19.580> so<00:06:19.789> if

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:19.910 
also polishes the rest of later so if

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.310 
also polishes the rest of later so if
you're<00:06:20.060> using<00:06:20.210> a<00:06:20.419> very<00:06:20.630> fine<00:06:20.870> grit<00:06:21.080> like<00:06:21.169> the
