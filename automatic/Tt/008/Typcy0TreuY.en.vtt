understand<00:00:47.280> these<00:00:47.460> new<00:00:47.520> materials<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:48.510> that

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
understand these new materials so that

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.020 
understand these new materials so that

with<00:03:41.920> that<00:03:42.100> technique<00:03:43.080> we<00:03:44.080> use<00:03:44.260> thermal

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
with that technique we use thermal

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.340 
with that technique we use thermal
analysis<00:03:45.220> an<00:03:45.610> umbrella<00:03:46.060> term<00:03:46.390> that<00:03:46.660> describes

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
any number of techniques that measure

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.810 
any number of techniques that measure
some<00:03:50.080> property<00:03:50.620> of<00:03:50.710> a<00:03:50.800> sample<00:03:51.220> as<00:03:51.400> you<00:03:51.550> heat<00:03:51.790> it

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
some property of a sample as you heat it

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.600 
some property of a sample as you heat it
up<00:03:52.090> so<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:53.230> one<00:03:53.380> that<00:03:53.560> we've<00:03:53.740> used<00:03:54.010> most<00:03:54.310> is

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
up so the one that we've used most is

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.420 
up so the one that we've used most is
thermo<00:03:55.360> mechanical<00:03:55.960> analysis<00:03:56.530> we<00:03:57.160> take<00:03:57.400> a

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
thermo mechanical analysis we take a

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.850 
thermo mechanical analysis we take a
small<00:03:57.790> sliver<00:03:58.120> of<00:03:58.210> paint<00:03:58.600> we<00:03:59.260> put<00:03:59.590> it<00:03:59.710> inside

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
small sliver of paint we put it inside

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.100 
small sliver of paint we put it inside
of<00:04:00.100> a<00:04:00.310> tiny<00:04:00.520> furnace<00:04:01.060> and<00:04:01.270> then<00:04:01.720> we<00:04:01.870> measure

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
of a tiny furnace and then we measure

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.720 
of a tiny furnace and then we measure
the<00:04:02.230> height<00:04:02.530> of<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.740> sample<00:04:03.250> as<00:04:03.340> we<00:04:03.460> heat<00:04:03.610> it

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
the height of the sample as we heat it

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.930 
the height of the sample as we heat it
up<00:04:03.880> as<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:04.930> paint<00:04:05.410> medium<00:04:05.740> gets<00:04:05.920> warmer<00:04:06.370> the

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
up as the paint medium gets warmer the

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.330 
up as the paint medium gets warmer the
plastic<00:04:07.510> starts<00:04:07.840> to<00:04:07.960> soften<00:04:08.230> and<00:04:08.650> deform<00:04:09.070> and

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
plastic starts to soften and deform and

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.080 
plastic starts to soften and deform and
so<00:04:09.790> we<00:04:09.940> can<00:04:10.180> register<00:04:10.810> that<00:04:11.320> as<00:04:11.620> a<00:04:12.430> change<00:04:12.880> in

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
so we can register that as a change in

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.110 
so we can register that as a change in
sample<00:04:13.510> height<00:04:13.660> on<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:13.960> ground
