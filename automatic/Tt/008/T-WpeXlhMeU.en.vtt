00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
once you get it installed there's some

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.110 
once you get it installed there's some
two<00:00:37.770> options<00:00:38.160> here<00:00:38.309> on<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.460> bottom<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:39.000> have

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
two options here on the bottom we have

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.299 
two options here on the bottom we have
the<00:00:39.510> regular<00:00:40.350> crack<00:00:40.590> shot<00:00:40.859> and<00:00:41.070> then<00:00:41.160> there's

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
the regular crack shot and then there's

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.209 
the regular crack shot and then there's
multi<00:00:42.059> crack<00:00:42.300> shot<00:00:42.539> as<00:00:42.660> well<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.949> single

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
multi crack shot as well so the single

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.950 
multi crack shot as well so the single
crack<00:00:44.430> shot<00:00:44.640> obviously<00:00:44.969> takes<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.510> single<00:00:45.780> shot

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
crack shot obviously takes a single shot

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.410 
crack shot obviously takes a single shot
and<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.980> multi<00:00:47.250> crack<00:00:47.489> shot<00:00:47.730> takes<00:00:48.210> multiple

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
and the multi crack shot takes multiple

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.500 
and the multi crack shot takes multiple
shots<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.079> kind<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.410> have<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:50.000> arm<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.329> app

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
shots so you kind of have to arm the app

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.110 
shots so you kind of have to arm the app

jump<00:01:36.840> in<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.050> browser<00:01:37.260> now<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.740> can<00:01:37.950> do<00:01:38.130> the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
jump in the browser now you can do the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.610 
jump in the browser now you can do the
menu<00:01:38.430> one<00:01:38.640> from<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:38.940> browser<00:01:39.120> here<00:01:39.420> but<00:01:39.690> for

from<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.360> app<00:01:42.540> switcher<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:43.080> we<00:01:43.140> hold<00:01:43.290> down

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380

crack<00:01:45.540> shot<00:01:45.750> icon<00:01:46.080> there<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.830> we<00:01:46.920> go<00:01:47.010> ahead<00:01:47.100> and

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
crack shot icon there so we go ahead and

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.640 
crack shot icon there so we go ahead and

take the shot save to our media card and
we're<00:01:52.800> done<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.490> now<00:01:53.580> you<00:01:53.610> can<00:01:53.820> see<00:01:54.150> the<00:01:54.720> crack

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
we're done and now you can see the crack

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.690

shot<00:01:55.290> icon<00:01:55.560> disappears<00:01:55.680> after<00:01:56.160> that<00:01:56.400> so<00:01:56.580> that

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
shot icon disappears after that so that

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.090 
shot icon disappears after that so that
was<00:01:56.790> just<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:57.030> single<00:01:57.300> shot<00:01:57.920> but<00:01:58.920> we'll<00:01:59.010> go

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
was just a single shot but we'll go

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.410 
was just a single shot but we'll go
ahead<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.280> try<00:01:59.400> the<00:01:59.490> multi<00:01:59.820> shot<00:02:00.000> here<00:02:00.270> so

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
ahead and try the multi shot here so

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.500 
ahead and try the multi shot here so
this<00:02:00.540> basically<00:02:00.900> arms<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.860> again<00:02:02.760> but<00:02:03.420> this

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
this basically arms it again but this

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.970 
this basically arms it again but this
lets<00:02:03.690> you<00:02:03.780> take<00:02:03.960> multiple<00:02:04.320> shots<00:02:04.380> until<00:02:04.890> you

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
lets you take multiple shots until you

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.410 
lets you take multiple shots until you
disable<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.550> you<00:02:05.670> do<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:05.880> by<00:02:06.030> clicking

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
disable it and you do that by clicking

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.540 
disable it and you do that by clicking
the<00:02:06.510> other<00:02:06.630> crack<00:02:06.990> shot<00:02:07.200> icon<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:08.310> we'll<00:02:08.429> jump

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
the other crack shot icon so we'll jump

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.209 
the other crack shot icon so we'll jump
back<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.940> browser<00:02:09.439> use<00:02:10.439> our<00:02:10.590> app<00:02:10.739> switcher

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:11.219 
back in the browser use our app switcher

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:11.940 
back in the browser use our app switcher
and

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
and

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.690 
and
have<00:02:12.099> our<00:02:12.250> multi<00:02:12.760> screenshot<00:02:13.300> here<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.860> you

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
have our multi screenshot here and you

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.740 
have our multi screenshot here and you
can<00:02:15.849> see<00:02:16.030> this<00:02:16.150> time<00:02:16.450> oh<00:02:18.480> try<00:02:19.480> that<00:02:19.599> one<00:02:19.720> more

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
can see this time oh try that one more

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.170 
can see this time oh try that one more
time<00:02:19.900> there<00:02:20.500> we<00:02:20.620> go<00:02:20.769> so<00:02:21.220> it<00:02:21.370> stays<00:02:21.610> in<00:02:21.819> there

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
time there we go so it stays in there

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.199 
time there we go so it stays in there
so<00:02:22.300> we<00:02:22.360> can<00:02:22.480> take<00:02:22.599> multiple<00:02:22.780> shots<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:24.209> it's

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
so we can take multiple shots and it's

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.089 
so we can take multiple shots and it's
opposed<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.599> just<00:02:25.750> a<00:02:25.900> single<00:02:26.110> shot<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.709> then

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
opposed to just a single shot and then

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:28.440 
opposed to just a single shot and then
to<00:02:27.250> get<00:02:27.340> rid<00:02:27.400> of<00:02:27.550> that<00:02:27.700> we<00:02:27.910> click<00:02:28.060> on<00:02:28.209> the<00:02:28.300> other

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
to get rid of that we click on the other

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.570 
to get rid of that we click on the other
icon<00:02:28.840> tells<00:02:29.349> us<00:02:29.500> that<00:02:29.620> it's<00:02:29.800> disabled<00:02:30.370> and

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
we're rock solid and then we'll check
