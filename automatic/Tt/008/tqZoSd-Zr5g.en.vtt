00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.530 
do it the other way then my hands will
be<00:03:03.540> blocking<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.410> way<00:03:04.500> I<00:03:04.530> twist<00:03:04.920> so<00:03:05.849> I'm

the knots make sure they're all

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.050 
the knots make sure they're all
unraveled<00:05:40.560> by<00:05:41.220> twisting<00:05:41.700> them<00:05:41.850> in<00:05:42.000> the

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
unraveled by twisting them in the

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.940 
unraveled by twisting them in the
opposite<00:05:42.450> direction<00:05:42.600> that<00:05:43.169> you<00:05:43.320> twisted<00:05:43.800> them

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950 
opposite direction that you twisted them

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.210 
opposite direction that you twisted them
up<00:05:44.130> very<00:05:44.750> simple<00:05:45.830> once<00:05:46.830> they're<00:05:47.040> all

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
up very simple once they're all

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.600 
up very simple once they're all
untwisted<00:05:48.710> you<00:05:49.710> start<00:05:49.980> to<00:05:50.070> take<00:05:50.250> out<00:05:50.430> your

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
untwisted you start to take out your

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.430 
untwisted you start to take out your
twists<00:05:51.060> and<00:05:52.610> there's<00:05:53.610> no<00:05:53.910> special<00:05:54.270> way<00:05:55.050> to<00:05:55.080> do

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
twists and there's no special way to do

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.909 
twists and there's no special way to do
this<00:05:55.650> just<00:05:56.520> be<00:05:56.760> careful<00:05:57.060> not<00:05:57.540> to<00:05:57.900> comb<00:05:58.560> out

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
this just be careful not to comb out

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:02.890 
this just be careful not to comb out
your<00:05:59.070> hair<00:05:59.580> as<00:05:59.790> you<00:06:00.270> separate<00:06:00.750> the<00:06:00.870> twist<00:06:01.169> so

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
your hair as you separate the twist so

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.320 
your hair as you separate the twist so
usually<00:06:03.900> you<00:06:04.229> can<00:06:04.560> even<00:06:04.740> unravel<00:06:05.490> it<00:06:05.610> like<00:06:06.060> you

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
usually you can even unravel it like you

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.540 
usually you can even unravel it like you
were<00:06:06.570> twisting<00:06:07.140> it<00:06:07.260> together

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
were twisting it together

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.250 
were twisting it together
that<00:06:08.940> will<00:06:09.120> really<00:06:09.450> make<00:06:09.690> sure<00:06:09.990> you<00:06:10.080> don't

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.260 
that will really make sure you don't

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.780 
that will really make sure you don't
separate<00:06:10.830> it<00:06:10.980> too<00:06:11.190> much<00:06:11.400> where<00:06:11.670> you're

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:11.790 
separate it too much where you're

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
separate it too much where you're
combing<00:06:12.060> entirely<00:06:12.690> out<00:06:41.330> now<00:06:42.330> I'm<00:06:42.600> all

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:42.810 
combing entirely out now I'm all

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.500 
combing entirely out now I'm all
untwisted<00:06:43.560> I<00:06:43.740> take<00:06:44.400> my<00:06:44.580> hands<00:06:45.060> and<00:06:45.150> I<00:06:45.240> kind<00:06:45.480> of

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:45.510 
untwisted I take my hands and I kind of

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.020 
untwisted I take my hands and I kind of
create<00:06:45.870> a<00:06:45.900> wide<00:06:46.290> tooth<00:06:46.710> comb<00:06:46.770> with<00:06:47.430> my<00:06:47.580> fingers

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.030 
create a wide tooth comb with my fingers

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.690 
create a wide tooth comb with my fingers
and<00:06:48.240> kind<00:06:48.420> of<00:06:48.480> break<00:06:48.930> the<00:06:49.620> roots<00:06:49.890> and<00:06:50.100> uplift

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:50.700 
and kind of break the roots and uplift

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.940 
and kind of break the roots and uplift
to<00:06:50.790> the<00:06:50.910> roots<00:06:51.210> of<00:06:51.360> my<00:06:51.510> hair<00:06:51.540> to<00:06:52.020> disguise<00:06:52.590> the

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:52.950 
to the roots of my hair to disguise the

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.070 
to the roots of my hair to disguise the
parts<00:06:53.250> that<00:06:53.340> were<00:06:53.580> there<00:06:53.790> and<00:06:54.000> I<00:06:54.660> just<00:06:54.900> kind<00:06:55.050> of

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 
parts that were there and I just kind of

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.810 
parts that were there and I just kind of
play<00:06:55.260> around<00:06:55.290> with<00:06:55.590> the<00:06:55.680> shape<00:06:55.890> sometimes

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:56.820 
play around with the shape sometimes

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.520 
play around with the shape sometimes
since<00:06:57.030> the<00:06:57.240> bantu<00:06:57.600> knots<00:06:57.810> were<00:06:57.990> really<00:06:58.230> tight

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:58.530 
since the bantu knots were really tight

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.650 
since the bantu knots were really tight
kind<00:06:59.280> of<00:06:59.370> forms<00:06:59.700> a<00:06:59.790> weird<00:07:00.000> shape<00:07:00.240> at<00:07:00.420> the<00:07:00.510> end

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:00.660 
kind of forms a weird shape at the end

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.350 
kind of forms a weird shape at the end
of<00:07:00.780> the<00:07:00.900> hair<00:07:01.110> so<00:07:01.380> I<00:07:01.410> just<00:07:01.650> kind<00:07:01.950> of<00:07:02.120> pull<00:07:03.120> it

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360
