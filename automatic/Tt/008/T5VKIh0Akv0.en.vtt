00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:31.169
 well i am very close to them 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.840
 Portuguese swan of red manager 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:39.180
 sox and I will introduce you to the car 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.719
 in 10th it's the new car of 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:48.059
 healthworks it's a car in 10th and 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.440
 the 4.4 tricks and who met who 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.800
 comes for the markets in the bottom of 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:59.040
 July this nature 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:01.899
 certainly an innovative car there has been 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.960
 I can see you this is the first 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:08.159
 with a ticket with molds the system 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.860
 started in French this decline on hard 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.479
 it's really a derivative a tenth of 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.119
 what we use in eighths at the end of 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.729
 account that's what the designer 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.390
 sought to do it's miniaturization 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.090
 of our car 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.800
 in all that is so much 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.200
 aesthetic triangulation that mechanical to 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.539
 inside and normal differentials 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.450
 as his eighth identive transmission 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.789
 we have an implementation very close to this 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:40.080
 that we recognize our soul etienne 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:45.190
 an impressive wealth for the 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:47.140
 6th and the car well away from box with 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.850
 two different bodies one 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.759
 bodywork can be because the car 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:57.399
 is prepared for two types of bacteria 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:01.119
 marc workshops and outings and arteritis 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:04.330
 slut and a good body for one 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.979
 the output materials is another 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.700
 our different bodywork for the 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.890
 miss that but the cars well with the 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.650
 body data and we turn 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:19.110
 another piece a round that's 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:21.280
 the rear wing is not vexing it's 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.270
 as completely different adrien 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.110
 it's indestructible it's identical 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.860
 will use what I like is the same 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.709
 thing but it's completely 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.560
 indestructible and it's a car 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.970
 we have already tested and it is a 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.319
 car completely different from all 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.989
 the cars that are in the markets 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.989
 but it's a car very very very 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:49.270
 fast very fast and we have deaths 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:52.810
 on the track from small tunes 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:57.280
 border diplomas is going very well and 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:00.010
 he has me as well in the teeth in 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.269
 the East is ethical of the particularity 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.610
 of this design is that it 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.380
 will be able to perform as well 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.600
 to the waters than on the synthetic and 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.940
 all that recognized models of the market 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.480
 but also by its design close to the 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.660
 our 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.090
 it will work better on the all over 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.250
 which was nothing I was alter canio 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.930
 all this too high or because 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.290
 depreciation was no longer working 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.940
 more careful than are the systems 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.490
 current 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:31.240
 it's a very very muslim car 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.980
 very fast and he will have two 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.220
 versions this version it's the bush 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:39.000
 and bridge printing and we have to 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.810
 see also the losses adventure and a Kenyan 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.520
 seized this madam blah 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:47.270
 never does not come with crampons and 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:50.120
 it was the atmosphere will be left for the 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.330
 sports and aluminum parts is 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.060
 well with the complete maria turner engine 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.540
 complete with bacteria and researchers 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.940
 etc. 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.910
 the car was tightened available 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:05.239
 I think will be available only in the middle 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.819
 rights this car is available 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:10.090
 of the end of the jury which will allow us 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:14.450
 as to the question of a certain one 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.459
 surfer to present it I think 60 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.410
 years but maybe or so to make a 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.230
 race or 2 by the end of the year 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.740
 in France that's okay I you 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.750
 thank 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:29.490
 and here we are waiting for the salting out 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.680
 and take a picture we will wait for the air 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.930
 earth to make a presentation in 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.260
 photo I thank you for it under the 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.260
 power
