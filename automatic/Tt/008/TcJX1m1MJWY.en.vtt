like every day especially night and

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.939 
like every day especially night and
supercell<00:00:21.539> synthase<00:00:21.930> that's<00:00:22.140> one<00:00:22.350> too

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
supercell synthase that's one too

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.040 
supercell synthase that's one too
the<00:00:23.519> work<00:00:23.670> that<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:23.910> will<00:00:24.029> see<00:00:24.269> in<00:00:24.390> game<00:00:24.600> Amy

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
the work that you will see in game Amy

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.880 
the work that you will see in game Amy
you<00:00:25.230> know<00:00:25.410> in<00:00:25.859> dayz<00:00:26.250> is<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:27.029> loss<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.869> size<00:00:28.140> now

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
you know in dayz is a loss in size now

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.320 
you know in dayz is a loss in size now
that's<00:00:29.519> obvious<00:00:29.820> if<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:29.910> doing<00:00:30.119> something

wrong<00:00:30.539> it's<00:00:30.750> easier<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.140> it's<00:00:31.650> easy<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.040> lose

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
wrong it's easier to it's easy to lose

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.130 
wrong it's easier to it's easy to lose
sizes<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:33.149> put<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.420> on<00:00:33.540> everybody<00:00:33.809> knows<00:00:33.989> that

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
sizes to put it on everybody knows that

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.119 
sizes to put it on everybody knows that
well<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:35.010> your<00:00:35.160> case<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.579> said<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:37.129> what

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
um if protein breakdown is higher than

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.330 
um if protein breakdown is higher than
protein<00:00:45.750> sentences<00:00:46.260> first<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:47.010> three<00:00:47.219> days

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
protein sentences first so in three days

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.430 
protein sentences first so in three days
I<00:00:47.550> don't<00:00:47.700> notice<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.000> changes<00:00:48.390> but<00:00:48.750> after

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.200 
losing signs that fast it's not as you
lose<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.159> muscles<00:01:11.520> because<00:01:11.760> you're<00:01:11.909> losing

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
lose the muscles because you're losing

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.179 
lose the muscles because you're losing
obviously<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.600> increase<00:01:12.930> your<00:01:13.080> volume<00:01:13.260> and

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
obviously you increase your volume and

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.980 
obviously you increase your volume and
I'm<00:01:14.310> gonna<00:01:14.400> read<00:01:14.610> experience<00:01:15.600> your<00:01:15.750> training

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
I'm gonna read experience your training

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.179 
I'm gonna read experience your training
problems<00:01:16.290> now<00:01:16.409> you're<00:01:16.560> doing<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.799> body<00:01:16.979> part

bustle calories help build muscle but
what<00:03:04.319> really<00:03:04.530> builds<00:03:04.920> muscle<00:03:05.400> is<00:03:05.549> the

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
what really builds muscle is the

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.520 
what really builds muscle is the
nitrogen<00:03:05.909> Depot<00:03:06.480> table<00:03:06.870> so<00:03:07.349> if<00:03:07.439> you're

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
nitrogen Depot table so if you're

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.929 
nitrogen Depot table so if you're
trading<00:03:07.680> homes<00:03:07.920> everyday<00:03:08.280> or<00:03:08.370> anybody<00:03:08.760> for

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:08.939 
trading homes everyday or anybody for

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:10.369 
trading homes everyday or anybody for
every<00:03:09.150> day<00:03:09.269> increase<00:03:09.719> your<00:03:09.870> protein<00:03:10.019> intake

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
every day increase your protein intake

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.080 
every day increase your protein intake
because<00:03:11.099> by<00:03:11.250> training<00:03:11.459> arms<00:03:11.670> every<00:03:11.849> day<00:03:11.969> you

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
because by training arms every day you

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.550 
because by training arms every day you
stimulate<00:03:12.540> inputs<00:03:12.810> instead<00:03:13.049> it's<00:03:13.170> every<00:03:13.439> day

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
stimulate inputs instead it's every day

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.050 
stimulate inputs instead it's every day
and<00:03:14.040> you<00:03:14.219> also<00:03:14.459> increase<00:03:14.730> your<00:03:14.939> protein

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
and you also increase your protein

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.280 
and you also increase your protein
breakdown<00:03:15.420> depending<00:03:16.049> how<00:03:16.109> your<00:03:16.230> energy

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
breakdown depending how your energy

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.170 
breakdown depending how your energy
level<00:03:16.739> is<00:03:16.890> so<00:03:17.489> make<00:03:17.670> sure<00:03:17.700> your<00:03:17.909> nitrogen

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
level is so make sure your nitrogen

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.819 
level is so make sure your nitrogen
balance<00:03:18.390> is<00:03:18.599> always<00:03:18.930> you<00:03:19.109> know<00:03:19.140> up<00:03:19.439> supposed

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
balance is always you know up supposed

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.140 
balance is always you know up supposed
to<00:03:19.950> training<00:03:20.340> right<00:03:20.519> I<00:03:20.549> hope<00:03:20.700> that<00:03:20.909> helps

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
to training right I hope that helps

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.210 
to training right I hope that helps
right<00:03:21.299> we<00:03:21.810> sure<00:03:21.989> it's<00:03:22.620> not<00:03:22.769> your<00:03:22.890> training
