00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.700
 the giant turrialba of 3200 meters of 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.950
 height continues to increase its 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.080
 temperature amazing with his strength 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.320
 eruptive and showing the impressive 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.619
 colors of their activity the first 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.880
 symptoms of his awakening were earthquakes 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.700
 accompanied by steam eruptions 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.830
 water and ashes in 2010 then they came 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.050
 Cracks and gases with components 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.530
 toxic sulfur that began to 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.290
 border the mountain between 2011 and 2014 and 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.719
 for 10 days the volcano showed something 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.149
 little seen a new sign of his 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.460
 heating now there are signs of fire 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.440
 internal a news team re 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.929
 presence inside the crater and the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.670
 surroundings of the turrialba the colors 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:49.980
 of the turrialba volcano do not stop 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.739
 impress in the center of the crater great 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.289
 variety of greens and yellows product 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.780
 of the action of sulfur on the north side 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.059
 there are oranges in the vegetation because 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.309
 has not been burned in its entirety has 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.979
 South side in the panorama is gloomy 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.530
 completely black and gray by the action 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.140
 from the ashes and at night 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.020
 crater becomes even more impressive 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.360
 the crater of the volcano widens to great 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.979
 speed a variety of greens and 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.170
 yellows are given product of the 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.670
 accumulation of sulfur dioxide 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.670
 they eject the constant eruptions 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.800
 At nightfall appears the most recent 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.800
 volcano sign 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.830
 it's about this incandescent crack in 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.360
 one of the hidden walls of the crater 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.170
 that was found by scientists 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.780
 10 days ago it measures between 12 and 15 meters 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.909
 long and has about 50 centimeters of 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.560
 wide the red color is given by the 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.380
 increase in temperature in 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.090
 stones that make it up in a few days 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.110
 temperatures have been recorded up to 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:02.290
 650 degrees centigrade seen from that 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.110
 distance seems magma cool without 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.899
 But this is not the case, they are very high gases 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.440
 temperature that reach the surface and 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:14.260
 that heat pre-existing rock that what 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.160
 what it means is that probably the 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.160
 magmatic body is at some point 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:23.620
 under the volcano and that keeps high 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.989
 temperatures the behavior of 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.560
 Turrialba is similar to the Poás Volcano 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.900
 in 2011 this wall of fire was captured 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.959
 by a news team repretel in 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.819
 an expedition to the crater of the volcano the 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.969
 experts believe that in a few months like this 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:45.829
 to see the crater of the volcano Turrialba there 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:48.889
 nights that for reasons of optics 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.810
 reasons of darkness as the 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:53.180
 Incandescence is greater but on the other 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.219
 side of the volcano on a second visit to 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.680
 colossus we enter one of the 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:03:00.620
 farms most affected by the action of 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.859
 the gases like this the farm the silvia 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.689
 to the south of the turrialba volcano crater 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:08.719
 until here come the constant gases 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:11.239
 the action of the pen has destroyed up 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:13.459
 the earth we are scarce two kilometers 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.260
 of the volcano's main crater 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.980
 turrialba in the extreme south 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.389
 this forest looks like a ghost forest 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.030
 completely burned by the activity 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:25.969
 of the gases and also of the sulfur here 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.560
 there are no insects or birds and one of 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:30.260
 the things that strikes us 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.450
 in the large number of trees that 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.849
 they were ripped from the root 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.519
 the weakness of the south wall of the volcano 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.560
 it is remarkable in the distance there is ground 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.660
 unstable that has generated avalanches that 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.030
 fall on this farm that was 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.459
 evicted at any time could 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.739
 drop more material generating new 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.230
 landslides in the community of the 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.849
 central only two families live and it is 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.849
 visited every day by 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:59.250
 ranger of the volcano cattle no longer 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.630
 can live in the southern area of ​​the crater and 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.400
 scientists hope that the 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:05.069
 volcano behavior follow 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.799
 increasing volcanic activity 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:10.470
 should not generate fear but rather 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.540
 education in the population with their 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.180
 colors and the show the turrialba 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.880
 live a historical moment from which you 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.010
 and I am witnesses changes that we 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.320
 can leave many lessons and a 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.320
 nice memory in our eyes
