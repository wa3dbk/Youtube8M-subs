here<00:05:22.439> is<00:05:22.590> a<00:05:22.620> problem<00:05:23.159> with<00:05:23.370> the<00:05:23.550> whole<00:05:23.879> idea

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
here is a problem with the whole idea

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.010 
here is a problem with the whole idea
the<00:05:25.860> man<00:05:26.189> could<00:05:26.550> have<00:05:26.759> just<00:05:27.090> took<00:05:27.330> the<00:05:27.719> rope

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
the man could have just took the rope

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.230 
the man could have just took the rope
and<00:05:28.289> that<00:05:29.159> is<00:05:29.400> a<00:05:29.430> flaw<00:05:30.650> see<00:05:31.650> man<00:05:32.639> cannot<00:05:32.969> help

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
and that is a flaw see man cannot help

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.939 
and that is a flaw see man cannot help
himself<00:05:34.020> out<00:05:34.500> of<00:05:34.530> his<00:05:34.770> sin<00:05:35.069> so<00:05:36.379> for<00:05:37.379> the<00:05:37.530> man<00:05:37.740> to

himself out of his sin so for the man to

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:39.800 
himself out of his sin so for the man to
have<00:05:38.069> an<00:05:38.250> ability<00:05:38.490> to<00:05:38.879> take<00:05:39.090> the<00:05:39.240> rope

when his cast down is flawed the makers

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.249 
when his cast down is flawed the makers
of<00:05:44.400> this<00:05:44.669> video<00:05:45.060> should<00:05:45.389> have<00:05:45.599> had<00:05:45.840> the<00:05:46.050> man
