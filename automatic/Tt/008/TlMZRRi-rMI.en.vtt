00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:17.630
If you listen I'll sing you a sweet little song 
Of a flower that's now drooped and dead, 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:27.050
Yet dearer to me, yes than all of its mates, 
Though each holds aloft its proud head. 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:34.160
‘Twas given to me by a girl that I know, 
Since we've met, faith I've known no

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.200
repose. 
She is dearer by far than the world's

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.800
brightest star, 
And I call her my wild Irish Rose.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:55.100
My wild Irish Rose, the sweetest flower
that grows.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.500
You may search ev’ry where, but none
can compare 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:11.800
with my wild Irish Rose. 
My wild Irish Rose, the dearest flower that

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.700
grows, 
And someday for my sake, she may let me

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.000
take 
The bloom from my wild Irish Rose.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.800
They may sing of their roses, which by
other names, 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:36.200
Would smell just as sweetly, they say. 
But I know that my Rose would never

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.900
consent 
To have that sweet name taken away. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:51.200
Her glances are shy when e'er I pass by 
The bower where my true love grows, 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.000
And my one wish has been that someday I
may win 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.700
The heart of my wild Irish Rose. 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:09.900
My wild Irish Rose, the sweetest flower
that grows. 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.700
You may search ev’ry where, but none
can compare

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:26.800
with my wild Irish Rose.
My wild Irish Rose, the dearest flower that

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.500
grows, 
And someday for my sake, she may let me

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.070
take
The bloom from my wild Irish Rose. 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:24.900
My wild Irish Rose, the sweetest flower
that grows. 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.900
You may search ev’ry where, but none
can compare

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:41.800
with my wild Irish Rose.
My wild Irish Rose, the dearest flower that

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.600
grows, 
And someday for my sake, she may let me

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:54.500
take
The bloom from my wild Irish Rose.
