okay so all the aircraft kids for best
glide<00:02:07.789> speed<00:02:07.899> like<00:02:08.899> a<00:02:08.929> landing<00:02:09.379> area<00:02:09.910> we<00:02:10.910> pick

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
glide speed like a landing area we pick

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.670 
glide speed like a landing area we pick
the<00:02:11.209> landing<00:02:11.569> area<00:02:11.660> now<00:02:12.019> now<00:02:12.319> I<00:02:12.349> can<00:02:12.440> do<00:02:12.650> a

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
the landing area now now I can do a

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.890 
the landing area now now I can do a
little<00:02:12.860> bit<00:02:13.010> of<00:02:13.099> troubleshooting<00:02:13.720> make<00:02:14.720> sure

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
little bit of troubleshooting make sure

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.410 
little bit of troubleshooting make sure

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
since now we cannot actually start the

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.530 
since now we cannot actually start the
aircraft

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
aircraft

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.899 
aircraft
we're<00:02:27.810> gonna<00:02:27.930> say<00:02:28.200> we're<00:02:29.099> gonna<00:02:29.220> announce<00:02:29.670> our

we're gonna say we're gonna announce our
position<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:30.930> that<00:02:31.019> would<00:02:31.200> be<00:02:31.379> a<00:02:31.920> Carson

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
position and that would be a Carson

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.570 
position and that would be a Carson
traffic<00:02:33.239> I've<00:02:33.420> made<00:02:33.629> a<00:02:34.129> let's<00:02:35.129> board<00:02:35.280> tried

traffic I've made a let's board tried

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.449 
traffic I've made a let's board tried
five<00:02:36.030> miles<00:02:36.360> northwest<00:02:37.290> wash<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.799> leg<00:02:37.980> engine

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
five miles northwest wash a leg engine

five miles northwest wash a leg engine
out<00:02:38.670> request<00:02:39.390> assistance

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.100 

we're<00:02:45.490> gonna<00:02:45.610> always<00:02:45.970> try<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:46.420> set<00:02:46.720> up<00:02:46.840> into

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
we're gonna always try and set up into

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.530 
we're gonna always try and set up into
the<00:02:47.200> wind

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.270 

usually<00:02:50.200> we<00:02:50.319> have<00:02:50.349> a<00:02:50.440> south<00:02:50.739> wind<00:02:50.980> blowing

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
usually we have a south wind blowing

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.610 
usually we have a south wind blowing
here<00:02:51.550> all<00:02:51.640> of<00:02:51.670> us<00:02:51.879> knowing<00:02:52.120> today<00:02:52.450> we're<00:02:53.349> going

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
here all of us knowing today we're going

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.600 
here all of us knowing today we're going
to<00:02:53.830> set<00:02:54.129> up<00:02:54.250> here<00:02:54.459> for<00:02:55.830> now<00:02:56.830> it<00:02:57.010> is<00:02:57.099> best<00:02:57.370> if<00:02:57.549> you

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
to set up here for now it is best if you

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.729 
to set up here for now it is best if you
don't<00:02:57.760> find<00:02:58.000> glide<00:02:58.450> too<00:02:58.720> far<00:02:59.049> but<00:02:59.290> right<00:02:59.620> now

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
don't find glide too far but right now

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.410 
don't find glide too far but right now
make<00:02:59.920> it<00:03:00.099> the<00:03:00.250> best<00:03:00.430> if<00:03:00.610> you<00:03:00.700> can<00:03:00.879> pick<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.090> spot

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
make it the best if you can pick a spot

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.899 
make it the best if you can pick a spot
down<00:03:01.690> here<00:03:02.049> and<00:03:02.709> then<00:03:02.950> do<00:03:03.129> your<00:03:03.340> do<00:03:03.640> a<00:03:03.670> nice

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
down here and then do your do a nice

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:08.030 
down here and then do your do a nice
pattern<00:03:04.299> and<00:03:04.989> be<00:03:05.379> able<00:03:05.680> to

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.020 

essentially<00:03:09.040> a<00:03:09.070> circle<00:03:09.400> around<00:03:09.490> so<00:03:09.880> you<00:03:09.940> don't

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
essentially a circle around so you don't

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.660 
essentially a circle around so you don't
get<00:03:10.270> too<00:03:10.450> far<00:03:10.690> down<00:03:10.900> or<00:03:11.140> too<00:03:11.260> far<00:03:11.440> away<00:03:11.670> that

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
get too far down or too far away that

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.160 
get too far down or too far away that
way<00:03:12.850> you're<00:03:13.030> only<00:03:13.270> sure<00:03:13.600> you<00:03:13.690> can<00:03:13.870> make<00:03:13.990> your

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
way you're only sure you can make your

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.770 
way you're only sure you can make your
landing<00:03:14.610> so<00:03:15.610> in<00:03:15.730> a<00:03:15.820> nice<00:03:16.030> pet<00:03:16.300> aircraft

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
landing so in a nice pet aircraft

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:28.520 
landing so in a nice pet aircraft
pattern<00:03:17.170> here<00:03:17.350> left<00:03:17.590> pattern

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:36.140 

for<00:03:28.710> ended<00:03:29.190> landing<00:03:29.580> area

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.670 

yeah<00:03:36.299> we've<00:03:36.450> got<00:03:36.510> a<00:03:36.629> nice<00:03:36.870> place<00:03:37.140> here<00:03:37.440> it's

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
yeah we've got a nice place here it's

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.500 
yeah we've got a nice place here it's
very<00:03:37.950> close<00:03:38.220> close<00:03:38.849> to<00:03:38.879> the<00:03:39.060> road<00:03:39.239> with<00:03:39.420> this

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
very close close to the road with this

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:46.200 
very close close to the road with this
entire<00:03:39.900> tract

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.210 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.520 

keep<00:03:46.600> plenty<00:03:46.900> of<00:03:46.990> speed<00:03:47.730> and<00:03:48.730> as<00:03:49.120> we<00:03:49.500> go<00:03:50.500> out

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
keep plenty of speed and as we go out
