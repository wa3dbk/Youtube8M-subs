the<00:00:10.500> nerf<00:00:10.710> balls<00:00:10.980> uka<00:00:11.429> i<00:00:11.460> got<00:00:11.700> it<00:00:11.820> in<00:00:11.880> a<00:00:11.969> lot<00:00:12.210> and

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:12.889 
the nerf balls uka i got it in a lot and

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.910 
the nerf balls uka i got it in a lot and
despite<00:00:13.889> coming<00:00:14.280> from<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:15.080> 1994<00:00:16.080> line<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.680> is

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
despite coming from the 1994 line it is

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.160 
despite coming from the 1994 line it is
reasonably<00:00:17.670> inexpensive<00:00:17.970> it's<00:00:18.510> not<00:00:18.690> super

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
reasonably inexpensive it's not super

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.109 
reasonably inexpensive it's not super
super<00:00:19.859> crazy<00:00:20.250> even<00:00:20.580> though<00:00:20.670> it<00:00:20.760> has<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.880> nice

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
super crazy even though it has a nice

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.849 
super crazy even though it has a nice
sized<00:00:21.390> plunger<00:00:21.840> tube<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.199> i<00:00:22.350> think<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.650> cool

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
sized plunger tube and i think a cool

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.769 
sized plunger tube and i think a cool
shell<00:00:23.189> i<00:00:23.460> actually<00:00:24.060> don't<00:00:24.240> like<00:00:24.390> how<00:00:24.600> in

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
shell i actually don't like how in

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.710 
shell i actually don't like how in
strike<00:00:25.109> blasters<00:00:25.619> these<00:00:25.830> days<00:00:26.070> have<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.730> really

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
strike blasters these days have a really

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.810 
strike blasters these days have a really
like<00:00:27.900> monopolized<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.740> nerf<00:00:29.010> kind<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.519> design

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
like monopolized the nerf kind of design

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.550 
like monopolized the nerf kind of design
everything<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.539> tactical<00:00:31.080> everything<00:00:31.410> as<00:00:31.529> a

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
everything is tactical everything as a

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.770 
everything is tactical everything as a
stock<00:00:31.890> everything<00:00:32.250> as<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.520> clip<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:33.090> really<00:00:33.600> like

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
stock everything as a clip I really like

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.110 
stock everything as a clip I really like
the<00:00:33.960> old-school<00:00:34.380> bright<00:00:34.829> colors<00:00:35.309> wacky

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
the old-school bright colors wacky

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.940 
the old-school bright colors wacky
colors<00:00:36.450> doesn't<00:00:36.870> look<00:00:36.989> like<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.230> gun<00:00:37.500> it's<00:00:37.710> very

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
colors doesn't look like a gun it's very

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.090 
colors doesn't look like a gun it's very
clearly<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.460> toy<00:00:38.760> shoots<00:00:39.600> unique<00:00:40.350> ammunition<00:00:41.040> I

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
clearly a toy shoots unique ammunition I

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.709 
clearly a toy shoots unique ammunition I
just<00:00:41.280> think<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.610> like<00:00:41.760> old-school<00:00:41.969> blasters

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
balls Lucas and the ripsaw blaster that

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.440 
balls Lucas and the ripsaw blaster that
they<00:01:07.470> sell<00:01:07.710> at<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.100> goodwill<00:01:08.580> occasionally

they sell at a goodwill occasionally

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:10.609 
they sell at a goodwill occasionally
you'll<00:01:09.600> find<00:01:09.659> them<00:01:09.960> there<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.260> then<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.500> old

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
you'll find them there and then the old

you'll find them there and then the old
atom<00:01:11.010> shot<00:01:11.310> but<00:01:11.909> uh<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.330> think<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.170> a

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
atom shot but uh I think that it's a

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.100 
atom shot but uh I think that it's a
really<00:01:13.530> neat<00:01:13.799> blaster<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.490> have<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.119> really<00:01:15.479> poor

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
really neat blaster I have a really poor

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.570 
really neat blaster I have a really poor
barrel<00:01:16.530> fit<00:01:16.710> with<00:01:16.890> these<00:01:17.040> green<00:01:17.310> balls

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
barrel fit with these green balls

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.770 
barrel fit with these green balls
they're<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.820> little<00:01:17.970> bit<00:01:18.150> larger<00:01:18.600> than<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
they're a little bit larger than the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.600 
they're a little bit larger than the
yellow<00:01:18.990> ones<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.409> then<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.680> addition<00:01:20.159> this

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
yellow ones and then in addition this

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.240 
yellow ones and then in addition this
plunger<00:01:21.119> tube<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.780> got<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.470> pretty<00:01:22.799> bad<00:01:22.950> air

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
plunger tube is is got a pretty bad air

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.490 
plunger tube is is got a pretty bad air
seal<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:23.790> I'm<00:01:23.880> hoping<00:01:24.270> that<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.479> can<00:01:24.540> get<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.990> few

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
seal so I'm hoping that I can get a few

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.350 
seal so I'm hoping that I can get a few
of<00:01:25.560> these<00:01:25.830> shots<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.400> kind<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.729> go<00:01:26.939> off<00:01:27.150> it

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
of these shots to kind of go off it

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.240 
of these shots to kind of go off it
holds<00:01:27.630> 15<00:01:28.049> 3<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.530> each<00:01:28.650> cylinder<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.159> the

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
holds 15 3 in each cylinder and the

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.969 
holds 15 3 in each cylinder and the
shoot<00:01:29.520> one<00:01:29.700> at<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.909> time<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.600> rotates<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:31.439> the

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
shoot one at a time it rotates on the

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.789 
shoot one at a time it rotates on the
prime<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.060> that's<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:34.020> extent<00:01:34.290> of<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.590> draw

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
prime and that's the extent of the draw

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.740 
prime and that's the extent of the draw
and<00:01:35.009> then<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.340> push<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.850> forward<00:01:36.240> really<00:01:36.450> hard

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
and then you push it forward really hard

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.469 
and then you push it forward really hard
to<00:01:36.869> fire<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:37.380> I'm<00:01:37.470> going<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.710> try<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.479> I

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
to fire it so I'm going to try and I

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.080 
to fire it so I'm going to try and I
probably<00:01:40.170> went<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.530> solid<00:01:40.950> 15<00:01:41.400> feet<00:01:41.670> maybe<00:01:41.700> a

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
probably went a solid 15 feet maybe a

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.460 
probably went a solid 15 feet maybe a
little<00:01:42.270> bit<00:01:42.450> more<00:01:42.600> so<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:42.840> was<00:01:43.079> pretty<00:01:43.290> cool

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
little bit more so that was pretty cool

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.990 
little bit more so that was pretty cool
and<00:01:43.649> then<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.770> can<00:01:44.009> see<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.430> chambers

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
and then you can see that it chambers

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.060 
and then you can see that it chambers
the<00:01:45.360> next<00:01:45.689> one<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.850> I'll<00:01:47.850> try<00:01:48.090> again<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:49.070> so

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
the next one and I'll try again and so

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.950 
the next one and I'll try again and so
it's<00:01:50.460> it's<00:01:50.820> not<00:01:50.909> an<00:01:51.119> accurate<00:01:51.479> blaster<00:01:51.930> you

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
it's it's not an accurate blaster you

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.380 
it's it's not an accurate blaster you
can<00:01:52.140> see<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.380> there<00:01:52.500> curving<00:01:52.920> pretty<00:01:53.390> wildly

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
can see it there curving pretty wildly

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.660 
can see it there curving pretty wildly
but<00:01:54.689> it's<00:01:54.960> it's<00:01:55.530> still<00:01:55.770> I<00:01:55.799> think<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.159> very<00:01:56.399> neat

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
but it's it's still I think a very neat

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.609 
but it's it's still I think a very neat
blaster<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.270> think<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.659> it's<00:01:57.810> very<00:01:58.020> cool<00:01:58.409> it's

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
blaster I think that it's very cool it's

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.550 
blaster I think that it's very cool it's
a<00:01:58.860> revolver<00:01:59.790> type<00:02:00.030> blaster<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.840> I'll<00:02:01.229> try<00:02:01.469> and

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
a revolver type blaster and I'll try and

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.620 
a revolver type blaster and I'll try and
get<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.710> another<00:02:02.280> kind<00:02:02.579> of<00:02:02.729> vintage<00:02:02.909> video<00:02:03.420> up

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
get a another kind of vintage video up

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.310
