00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.760 

there<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.880> go

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
there you go

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.709 
there you go
and<00:01:41.310> then<00:01:41.520> obviously<00:01:41.640> only<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.180> send<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.600> one

back and then with this third one there
is<00:01:47.820> no<00:01:47.969> real<00:01:48.210> need<00:01:48.420> for<00:01:48.560> this<00:01:49.560> lever<00:01:49.890> because

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
is no real need for this lever because

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.929 
is no real need for this lever because
it's<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.759> last<00:01:50.969> one<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.390> their<00:01:51.600> system<00:01:52.939> it's

thing the return thing so that's no

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.800 
thing the return thing so that's no
that's<00:01:59.310> not<00:01:59.579> really<00:01:59.909> needed<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.329> one<00:02:00.569> book

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810
