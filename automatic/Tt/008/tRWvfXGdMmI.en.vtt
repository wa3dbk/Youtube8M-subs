00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.880
 those dolls 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.040
 I stopped for a moment I almost had a heart attack 

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:12.889
 took in 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:15.329
 one meter and 20 meters high 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:20.300
 made by the guy who created the original point guard of his last movie of the month 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.880
 coach behind him still I'm here with reindeer who has imported this 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.760
 bringing you over will have a wonderful 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.950
 I'll show you slowly what he brought up because the bet of him 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:33.280
 brought - collectors 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.850
 It's like this market today is a collector everywhere, the hatchet 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.420
 it's worth bringing those pieces that should probably cost 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.060
 rally skull 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.120
 so the market is a niche yet the very strong new face out there is 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.440
 trying to enter 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.790
 and that strengthens the market here in Brazil earlier the collectors here do not 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.660
 they should not 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.210
 the processors from outside have wonderful collections in brazil 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.840
 and these larger, more limited people like this were the man who is 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.610
 made so very unique 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.799
 It was the first piece they produced to make a real 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.310
 pot 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.150
 are few that impoverished asphalt 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.460
 we have seven eight feet 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.480
 but the people who press the same picture outside and end up buying shares 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.700
 and how to that collector's market 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.660
 is very much of what I saw here tapuio market so still aimed at the child 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.890
 Are you going against the current? 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.310
 toy producer for big people 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.100
 and if this is a market that is suddenly worth exploring 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.179
 so here in Brazil there is a fair that is like checking 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:41.780
 in the United States the size of the fair that we have here 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.100
 really opens 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.180
 in which he participates in sponsoring his son's 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.720
 It's a wild beast to come back to but it does not have one. 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.640

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.080
 we are accustomed to value with which they do not understand why they are expensive 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.109
 which are limited 

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:10.339
 but the tapestry market 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:12.209
 I like to work 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.040

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.710
 Do you have a store? Yes. 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.859
 how I spent here right then, actually 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:25.539
 they do not have a showroom that only goes back to term shopkeepers as well as squeeze 

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:27.359
 new things things 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:29.779
 but the staff wants to know or buy 

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:32.399

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:46.659
 the use of the city here 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:50.760
