all the way down to touch your butt on
the<00:00:44.640> bench<00:00:44.879> but<00:00:45.000> you're<00:00:45.329> not<00:00:45.450> coming<00:00:45.809> all<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
the bench but you're not coming all the

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.330 
the bench but you're not coming all the
way<00:00:46.110> up<00:00:46.230> you're<00:00:46.590> doing<00:00:46.800> about<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.039> three

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
way up you're doing about a three

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.029 
way up you're doing about a three
quarter<00:00:47.640> rep<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.140> really<00:00:49.469> makes<00:00:49.800> them

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
quarter rep so that really makes them

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.459 
quarter rep so that really makes them
burn<00:00:50.309> it's<00:00:50.969> at<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.180> little<00:00:51.449> bit<00:00:51.629> faster<00:00:52.170> pace

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
burn it's at a little bit faster pace

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.580 
burn it's at a little bit faster pace
too<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.449> again<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.809> really<00:00:55.079> good<00:00:55.379> for

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
too and again this is really good for

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.459 
too and again this is really good for
your<00:00:55.800> quads<00:00:56.270> and<00:00:57.270> when<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.600> set<00:00:57.870> your<00:00:57.899> feet<00:00:58.260> up

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469

your quads and when you set your feet up
on<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:59.570> bar<00:01:00.649> you<00:01:01.649> want<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.859> make<00:01:01.920> sure<00:01:01.980> that

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
on the bar you want to make sure that

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.000 
on the bar you want to make sure that
you<00:01:02.399> don't<00:01:02.520> get<00:01:02.670> your<00:01:02.850> heel<00:01:03.210> back<00:01:03.480> too<00:01:03.870> far

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
you don't get your heel back too far

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.859 
you don't get your heel back too far
especially<00:01:05.010> if<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:05.820> bad<00:01:06.210> knees<00:01:06.510> or

especially if you have bad knees or

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.969 
especially if you have bad knees or
short<00:01:07.530> feet<00:01:08.720> that<00:01:09.720> could<00:01:09.990> put<00:01:10.260> pressure<00:01:10.650> on

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
short feet that could put pressure on

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.469 
short feet that could put pressure on
your<00:01:11.250> knees<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.850> want<00:01:12.000> to<00:01:12.090> scoot<00:01:12.299> your

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
your knees so you want to scoot your

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.620 
your knees so you want to scoot your

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
feet your heels to the very end and

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.660 
feet your heels to the very end and
you're<00:01:16.530> when<00:01:16.890> you're<00:01:17.009> squatting<00:01:17.310> you're

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
you're when you're squatting you're

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.399 
you're when you're squatting you're
keeping<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.119> pressure<00:01:18.330> back<00:01:18.720> towards<00:01:19.259> your

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
keeping the pressure back towards your

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.800 
keeping the pressure back towards your
heels<00:01:19.909> so<00:01:20.909> when<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.180> get<00:01:21.299> them<00:01:21.390> back<00:01:21.540> too<00:01:21.780> far

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
heels so when you get them back too far

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.390 
heels so when you get them back too far
like<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:23.540> again<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:25.439> might<00:01:25.740> put<00:01:26.070> extra

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
like this again it might put extra

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.850 
like this again it might put extra
pressure<00:01:26.640> on<00:01:27.150> your<00:01:27.600> knees<00:01:27.930> so<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.350> have<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.740> be

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
pressure on your knees so you have to be

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.010 
pressure on your knees so you have to be
careful<00:01:29.070> with<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.430> especially<00:01:30.329> if<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.810> have

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
careful with that especially if you have

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.960 
careful with that especially if you have
short<00:01:31.049> feet<00:01:31.680> because<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.220> really<00:01:32.520> makes<00:01:32.820> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
short feet because it really makes the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.560 
short feet because it really makes the
angle<00:01:33.299> really<00:01:33.600> high<00:01:33.950> so<00:01:34.950> get<00:01:35.729> your<00:01:35.909> heels<00:01:36.270> just

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
angle really high so get your heels just

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.450 
angle really high so get your heels just
right<00:01:36.930> on<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.229> edge<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:39.890> again<00:01:40.890> when<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.280> do

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
right on the edge and again when you do

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.859 
right on the edge and again when you do
this<00:01:41.610> you're<00:01:41.880> using<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.299> end<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.720> bench

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
this you're using the end of the bench

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.810 
this you're using the end of the bench
to<00:01:43.049> come<00:01:43.530> down<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.890> touch<00:01:44.070> your<00:01:44.310> butt<00:01:44.549> and

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
to come down and touch your butt and

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.300 
to come down and touch your butt and
you're<00:01:45.659> doing<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.990> three-quarter<00:01:46.619> squat<00:01:47.070> so

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
you're doing a three-quarter squat so

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.859 
you're doing a three-quarter squat so
you're<00:01:47.460> not<00:01:47.579> you're<00:01:47.970> not<00:01:48.000> going<00:01:48.329> all<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.750> way

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
you're not you're not going all the way

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.359 
you're not you're not going all the way
up<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.140> locking<00:01:49.560> out<00:01:49.680> you're<00:01:49.890> just<00:01:50.070> going

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
up and locking out you're just going

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.770 
up and locking out you're just going
three-quarters<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.119> way<00:01:51.240> up<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.720> then

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
three-quarters of the way up and then

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.620 
three-quarters of the way up and then
right<00:01:52.140> back<00:01:52.320> down<00:01:52.590> again<00:01:52.850> so<00:01:53.850> they're<00:01:54.360> meant

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
right back down again so they're meant

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.709 
right back down again so they're meant
to<00:01:54.720> be<00:01:54.899> at<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.350> shorter<00:01:56.219> faster<00:01:56.700> pace<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.299> create

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
to be at a shorter faster pace to create

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.749 
to be at a shorter faster pace to create
a<00:01:57.750> burn<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.469> again<00:01:59.280> you<00:01:59.430> want<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.610> make<00:01:59.729> sure

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
a burn and again you want to make sure

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.399 
a burn and again you want to make sure
you<00:02:00.000> keep<00:02:00.149> your<00:02:00.210> chin<00:02:00.570> nice<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.020> high<00:02:01.170> and
