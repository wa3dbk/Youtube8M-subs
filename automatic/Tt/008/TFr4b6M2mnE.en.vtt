reggae vibe mixed all in one so the
blues<00:00:18.119> part<00:00:18.930> is<00:00:19.140> just<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.470> swung<00:00:19.980> down<00:00:23.240> you're

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
blues part is just the swung down you're

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.060 
blues part is just the swung down you're
just<00:00:24.359> going<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.570> go<00:00:24.660> down<00:00:24.869> up<00:00:25.140> down<00:00:25.350> ups<00:00:25.680> just

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
just going to go down up down ups just

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.349 
just going to go down up down ups just
consistently<00:00:26.760> like<00:00:27.000> that<00:00:27.240> swung<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:29.359> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
consistently like that swung and the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.690 
consistently like that swung and the
hard<00:00:30.660> part<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.230> reggae<00:00:31.560> part<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:32.099> just<00:00:32.610> to

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
hard part the reggae part is just to

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.440 
hard part the reggae part is just to
accent<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.770> Texan<00:00:34.880> accent<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.090> you'll<00:00:36.270> go

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
accent the Texan accent so you'll go

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.869 
accent the Texan accent so you'll go
down<00:00:36.690> up<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.410> then<00:00:37.890> your<00:00:38.040> next<00:00:38.309> down<00:00:38.579> will<00:00:38.790> be

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
down up and then your next down will be

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.900 
down up and then your next down will be
an<00:00:38.969> absence<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.719> down<00:00:40.190> accent<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.670> when<00:00:41.820> you

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
an absence it down accent and when you

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.389 
an absence it down accent and when you
accent<00:00:42.480> just<00:00:42.690> make<00:00:42.840> sure<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.290> strum<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> little

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
accent just make sure you strum a little

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:51.319 
accent just make sure you strum a little
bit<00:00:44.489> harder<00:00:48.800> and<00:00:49.800> I'm<00:00:49.950> not<00:00:50.160> using<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.610> pick<00:00:50.940> just

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
bit harder and I'm not using a pick just

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.200 
bit harder and I'm not using a pick just
to<00:00:51.800> minimize<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.039> attack<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.789> get<00:00:53.910> just<00:00:54.149> more

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
to minimize the attack and get just more

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:02.569 
to minimize the attack and get just more
of<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:55.280> organic<00:00:56.280> less<00:00:56.910> attack<00:00:57.360> feel<00:01:01.190> and<00:01:02.190> I'm

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
of that organic less attack feel and I'm

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.860 
of that organic less attack feel and I'm
just<00:01:02.760> kind<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.030> pretending<00:01:03.420> like<00:01:03.449> I'm<00:01:03.690> holding

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
just kind of pretending like I'm holding

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.679 
just kind of pretending like I'm holding
a<00:01:04.080> pick<00:01:05.960> and<00:01:07.700> just<00:01:08.700> strumming<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.360> like<00:01:09.540> I

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
a pick and just strumming it like I

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.770
