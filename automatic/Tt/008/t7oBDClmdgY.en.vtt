00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.540
 or very good people we are all a 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.610
 video more and we will learn to be a 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.330
 party because I already work the end being 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.340
 of ramp and some subscribers me 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.770
 they wrote saying that good better than 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.900
 take out an equal because we 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.630
 had it out on ramp of such is it so 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.930
 good today I bring you a bolivar end and os 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:33.020
 I'll start with an explanation so that 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.050
 see how it is very similar to being the 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.840
 ramp but with the difference that we're 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.370
 in what is the public 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.930
 good to publish is the same thing you have 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.489
 what to do is a good pretty 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.730
 we have to have learned how they think 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.199
 have that leave a son and we have 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.780
 that learning is going to be quite high 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:53.579
 as high as possible 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.720
 we jump very pop 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.970
 more or less we know about here 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.550
 we have to throw the bar and end to 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.700
 drop it 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.910
 try to take the tactic of vale 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.240
 come out lift up well this is a little bit 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.240
 backwards 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.659
 it's very similar to ramp talent the 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.539
 movement is the same thing that 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:21.400
 we have to be ordained in a son 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:24.640
 with the 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.060
 what is life has to be a pull 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.060
 of unique arms and we know here 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.650
 at the end it was something like that more or less 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.860
 I will leave in several videos so you see 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.860
 they 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.490
 and 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.400
 ah 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.840
 good as you see the pull that I hit is 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.890
 a strong pull back unique 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.739
 I would see it then when I 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.209
 I have davis since I already have up 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.459
 controlled we do not want it 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.319
 when we see it go up and throw it away because 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:35.519
 it's very fast and it's going to stay here 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:37.590
 the key is let's say a good boom and ok no 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.379
 throw them out of olic that I threw it at you like that 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.049
 and it was very bad for me to learn it like that because 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.609
 he had pulled on oli voucher to jump 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.930
 with the wheels and then it cost me 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.939
 get used to your level is that you do not 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.489
 do so well do it right from this 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:53.189
 site so that then you have good well 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.769
 caught what is good 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:57.780
 the key is what I tell you to throw well 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:05.419
 here when you have altima with signal 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:05.419
 strong and then leave it like that 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:15.230
 is a trick in which you can jump and 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.780
 always be with skip 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.400
 choose the legs a little bit to 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.400
 be able to lift more 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.000
 let's do 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.580
 let's roll the wheel back and I have more or 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.580
 less around here 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.130
 then the claw of the hands would be like 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:48.650
 being ramp to throw it with this hand 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.380
 until 3 and this is quickly going 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.060
 much faster in trap because 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.459
 we are on the ground and there is less height and 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.560
 less space than the fan pull 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.840
 general at the same time less space to zero 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.330
 Boundless have to be as fast 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.280
 ok have a good and well high and therefore 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.850
 clear again more time for 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:11.000
 so that the wheel turns to make 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.740
 a very high we know that we are going to 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.030
 help us 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.030
 we have to shoot the bullying 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.480
 Y 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:33.020
 and comment the favorites you already know that 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.370
 you write you are not if you like the 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.470
 channel like provoke sacks 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.449
 and subscribe to all the law 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.360
 videos and so I hope to keep going up 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.229
 videos and move on with the channel 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.340
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.340
 the next video bye bye
