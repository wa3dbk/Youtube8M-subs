00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.820
 field changes d difference already 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.860

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.360
 després conceded ground to lopez 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.980
 and spoke first about auto stéphane 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.790
 peterhansel and the mini team 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.790
 low on the general 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.040
 it had been two years since we had 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.870
 not seen marc coma at the arrival of a 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.130
 special on the dakar absent the year 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.450
 last Spanish comes back with 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.190
 desire for victory on this new 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.690
 edition the first day there maybe 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.430
 comforted in his ambitions anyway 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.210
 he finished in front of his best enemy 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.500
 his rival if price is still a 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.030
 times today the two big favorites 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.620
 motorcycle did not leave a 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.180
 inner tube on arrival 20 seconds 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.860
 of gap and coma is always in front of 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.660
 price and the race she went over 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.460
 quick 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.290
 oh yeah not a 4 coma was always 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.820
 in the glow of joan barreda borte but 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.620
 the end of the special has completely 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.360
 upset the motorcycle race on arrival a 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.500
 surprise the british sam sunderland 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.630
 on his honda in front of what they have and 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.890
 only one participation 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.090
 so for him an abandonment from the 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.860
 third step in 2012 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.869
 a lot of revenge and big gaps in 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.979
 the arrival he goes ahead chaleco lopez to 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.869
 less than a minute and joan barreda 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.550
 portal 2 minutes catalan on her honda 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.289
 the most regular since yesterday takes the 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.910
 General orders in front of chaleco 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:22.890
 and sam sunderland so who does the right 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.780
 day operation marc coma and cyril 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.369
 després who dropped ends 9th and 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.479
 10th today have therefore conceded more 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.850
 eight minutes on the winner 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.619
 bang your head I saw a few 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:37.110
 stars but the worst is my pocket 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.960
 of cameras that broke out and so that 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.350
 made five years that I have more water so 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.909
 thirsty 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.170
 the two men coma and prices are going 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.520
 now move forward masked in this 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.470
 race unlike French on his 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.939
 sherco alain duclos again in 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.530
 the top 5 and which concerns all the same 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.400
 almost six minutes to the finish he is 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.400
 4th of the general 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.540
 in cars the special was a little bit more 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.490
 433 km long and has already made it possible 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.930
 skimming in the ranking the 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.760
 minis have held their rank the competition 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.649
 she sank only carlos healthy on her 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.090
 buggy and giniel de villiers came 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.860
 stand in the ranking and have held 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.950
 head of stéphane peterhansel winner of 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.180
 step 27e to more than 15 minutes from the 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.920
 race leader this morning giniel de 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.660
 villiers on his toyota realized a good 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.890
 shot a little over five minutes all of 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.350
 even late on arrival but has 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.760
 close to the overall ranking people 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.220
 follow each other and are not alike for 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.810
 souza on his downside problems of 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.640
 turbo from kilometer 33 and long 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.489
 minutes abandoned just like hopes 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.380
 from podium on arrival to valparaiso our 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.420
 downstream piloted by christian lavieille 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.980
 managed to get into the top 10 a 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.980
 reward for the French who finally 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.570
 a sinn steering wheel and can express itself 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.010
 on the mini side that dominates this beginning of 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.360
 dakar nasser al attiyah could have 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.250
 hope better than this fifth place 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.290
 of the day more than 7 minutes from his 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.000
 teammate fart russell to say he 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.420
 was unlucky in breaking three 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.220
 occasions 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.450
 finally on this stage room one 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.590
 Twenty drivers succeeded 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.489
 today to finish at less than one 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.230
 winner time 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.230
 this second step left traces 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.150
 a thought for kurt caselli at the start 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.560
 from this dakar 2014 the ktm pilots will have 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.180
 all a sticker on their motorcycles in 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.410
 tribute to the broken American read in 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.640
 place in two as last year has 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.290
 found death at only 30 years old in 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.950
 Last November during the crowbar 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.950
 in Mexico 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.540
 in the motorcycle ranking the first three 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.430
 of the day we find them at the three 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.080
 first places in the general they already have 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.569
 dug a little gap marc coma 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.310
 complete the top 5 but he already has seven 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.440
 minutes late on the race leader 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.000
 stephane peterhansel him blow 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.069
 double during this second stage he 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.959
 takes orders from the general and mini 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.940
 place four cars in the top 5 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.500
 only carlos healthy for the moment is in 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.530
 able to stand up to the mark 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.730
 German 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.380
 place at the third stage tomorrow between 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.430
 san rafael and sandres on one of the most 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.959
 short of this dakar 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.610
 the special she will still be 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.190
 consequent a little longer for the 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:57.319
 motorcycles 373 km against 320 for trucks 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.549
 and cars not yet sand or 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.660
 dunes but peaks we will spend the 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:00.829
 three thousand meters above sea level 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.900
 we leave ourselves on these beautiful images 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:05.560
 present-day 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.560
