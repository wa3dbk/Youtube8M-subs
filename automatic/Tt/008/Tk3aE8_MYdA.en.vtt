 get real as medical students learn to save lives still in school 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:18.820
 the electronic patient gives strength to medical students 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.560
 of a university of são paulo and the technology allied with education, see 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.449
 cover story is the polito 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:26.509
 kaka 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:27.890
 is the guy 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.919
 inspiration for and to the medical staff and 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.329
 time is short to save a life and every procedure is fundamental 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.100
 massage 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.450
 the Arabs 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.260
 who works 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.770
 life depends on the technique and precision with which the maneuvers are 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.510
 performed only in this case 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.940
 You can make a lot of mistakes. 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.879
 to venezuela while future doctors try to reverse a cardiac arrest 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:56.889
 on the other side 

00:00:56.889 --> 00:01:00.299
 in a secondary room the 'teacher' control a robot 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:06.060
 from here it is possible to tinker in every sense of the machine the computer 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.520
 circulation 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.000

 everything to bring or milk 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.770
 as real as possible the good part of a new laboratory that is being used 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.570
 a university in são paulo 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.630
 the methodology brought from Israel reproduces critical situations through the doll 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.880
 I've never seen the ball roll with him. 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.280
 every 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.630
 the dunga team during the procedures 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.830
 same method 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.390
 he simulates 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.880
 the human being 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.970
 not only percent but it simulates 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.720
 we can expect new skills 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.730
 training the doctor's training with this hole 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.320
 nothing in the world julia harris will be the doctor in less than a week 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.210
 when they finish the medical course use the simulator within a few days of the performance 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.030
 of the real according to her is determinant her parents here what we wanted with her 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.750
 in conversations they are holding us patient until treatments in monaco 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.900
 are present is also part of the work in Dakar 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:10.979
 access to all this technology 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.980
 passes from half a million reais until theft the baby used as adult doll 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.430
 with which all human physiological reactions but the investment is worth 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.610
 is chance equal way to execute what you learned in the classroom with the 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.760
 possibility of making mistakes and discussing with colleagues as many times as 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.049
 realistic simulation search trained to exhaustion to all conditions 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.149
 clinics 

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:37.549
 they will meet at the emergency room 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.049
 what matters in their day-to-day work then to working together 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.909
 with a multidisciplinary team so they can be recycled 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:50.209
 with all the situations and able to have calm 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.230
 experience in power since each patient
