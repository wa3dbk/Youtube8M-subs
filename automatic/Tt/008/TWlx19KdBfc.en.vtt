00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.000 
going over the MD find command which

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.760 
going over the MD find command which
just<00:00:16.390> basically<00:00:16.509> searches<00:00:17.140> your<00:00:17.259> system<00:00:17.619> for

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
just basically searches your system for

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:22.119 
going to search for just a and it's

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:23.279 
going to search for just a and it's
going<00:00:22.150> to<00:00:22.300> bring<00:00:22.450> back<00:00:22.570> a<00:00:22.630> lot<00:00:22.810> of<00:00:22.869> results

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
going to bring back a lot of results

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.429 
going to bring back a lot of results
because<00:00:24.220> a<00:00:25.110> is<00:00:26.110> in<00:00:26.470> a<00:00:26.559> lot<00:00:26.710> of<00:00:26.739> things<00:00:27.180> I

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
because a is in a lot of things I

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.479 
because a is in a lot of things I
haven't<00:00:29.439> actually<00:00:29.529> got<00:00:29.680> that<00:00:29.890> many<00:00:30.040> files<00:00:30.279> on

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:30.489 
haven't actually got that many files on

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.690 
haven't actually got that many files on
here<00:00:30.610> so<00:00:31.860> but<00:00:32.860> let's<00:00:33.100> say<00:00:33.219> you<00:00:33.280> wanted<00:00:33.550> to

here so but let's say you wanted to
search<00:00:33.910> for<00:00:34.300> a<00:00:34.630> specific<00:00:35.260> file<00:00:36.149> M<00:00:37.149> defined

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
search for a specific file M defined

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:47.390 
search for a specific file M defined
I've<00:00:38.110> got<00:00:42.330> and<00:00:43.380> by<00:00:44.380> default<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:46.120> searches<00:00:46.780> for

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
I've got and by default it searches for

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.550 
I've got and by default it searches for
it<00:00:48.400> searches<00:00:48.880> in<00:00:49.120> your<00:00:49.600> entire<00:00:49.990> computer<00:00:50.200> so

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:50.560 
it searches in your entire computer so

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.569 
it searches in your entire computer so
it's<00:00:50.710> going<00:00:50.800> to<00:00:50.890> search<00:00:51.040> the<00:00:51.190> whole<00:00:51.280> thing<00:00:51.460> so

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
it's going to search the whole thing so

it's going to search the whole thing so
if<00:00:51.700> you've<00:00:51.790> got<00:00:51.970> a<00:00:52.000> lot<00:00:52.210> of<00:00:52.239> files<00:00:52.570> it's<00:00:52.989> gonna

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
if you've got a lot of files it's gonna

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.020 
if you've got a lot of files it's gonna
take<00:00:53.530> a<00:00:53.560> long<00:00:53.829> time<00:00:54.130> to<00:00:54.400> churn<00:00:54.610> through<00:00:54.640> them

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
thing you can do is MD find and you can

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.099 
thing you can do is MD find and you can
do<00:01:18.460> search<00:01:19.090> for<00:01:19.299> whatever<00:01:19.450> so<00:01:19.810> I'm<00:01:19.899> going<00:01:20.049> to

and then wherever you want to search for
so<00:01:28.240> I'm<00:01:28.389> going<00:01:28.509> to<00:01:28.569> search<00:01:28.749> for<00:01:28.780> a<00:01:30.270> only<00:01:31.270> in

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.709 

applications<00:01:40.409> now<00:01:42.420> there's<00:01:43.420> a<00:01:43.539> few

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:43.719 
applications now there's a few

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:45.510 
applications now there's a few
applications<00:01:44.319> that<00:01:44.529> have<00:01:44.679> a<00:01:44.859> unit<00:01:45.159> I<00:01:45.340> think

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
applications that have a unit I think

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.260 
applications that have a unit I think
they<00:01:45.819> all<00:01:45.969> will<00:01:46.179> because<00:01:46.539> dot<00:01:46.749> app<00:01:48.090> so<00:01:49.090> yeah

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
they all will because dot app so yeah

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.449 
they all will because dot app so yeah
there's<00:01:49.479> a<00:01:49.509> lot<00:01:49.659> of<00:01:49.719> stuff<00:01:49.869> there<00:01:50.099> but<00:01:51.099> that's

00:01:51.449 --> 00:01:51.459 
there's a lot of stuff there but that's

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:53.489 
there's a lot of stuff there but that's
how<00:01:51.670> you<00:01:51.729> search<00:01:51.999> in<00:01:52.299> a<00:01:52.509> specific<00:01:52.689> folder<00:01:53.139> so

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:53.499 
how you search in a specific folder so

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:55.379 
how you search in a specific folder so
if<00:01:53.590> I<00:01:53.709> wanted<00:01:53.889> to<00:01:53.950> search<00:01:54.219> for<00:01:54.549> pick<00:01:54.969> tail<00:01:55.149> lamp

00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:55.389 
if I wanted to search for pick tail lamp

00:01:55.389 --> 00:02:04.469 
if I wanted to search for pick tail lamp
I<00:01:55.599> could<00:01:55.779> search<00:01:55.990> for<00:01:56.020> it<00:01:56.380> in<00:01:57.279> the<00:02:01.770> only<00:02:02.770> in<00:02:03.479> and

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
I could search for it in the only in and

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.910 
I could search for it in the only in and
then<00:02:04.599> we'll<00:02:04.719> search<00:02:04.869> for<00:02:04.899> in<00:02:07.920> applications

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
then we'll search for in applications

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.160 
then we'll search for in applications
and<00:02:11.490> it<00:02:12.490> returns<00:02:12.849> nothing<00:02:13.090> because<00:02:13.630> it's<00:02:13.959> not

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
and it returns nothing because it's not

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.149 
and it returns nothing because it's not
in<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.380> applications<00:02:14.920> it's<00:02:15.069> in<00:02:15.280> my<00:02:17.159> users

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:18.159 
in the applications it's in my users

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:20.589 
in the applications it's in my users
slash<00:02:18.879> downloads<00:02:19.450> whatever

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
slash downloads whatever
