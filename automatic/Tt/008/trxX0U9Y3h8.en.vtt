00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.792
 Harry, stay safe 

00:00:07.542 --> 00:00:08.958
 Be strong. 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.500
 EVERY MOMENT THAT LIVED 

00:00:13.708 --> 00:00:14.958
 Harry Potter ... 

00:00:20.433 --> 00:00:21.474
 IT HAS TAKEN THIS 

00:00:25.516 --> 00:00:27.349
 ..you fought with value 

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:33.198
 Now, join me 

00:00:33.198 --> 00:00:35.031
 and face your destiny 

00:00:39.281 --> 00:00:42.198
 Did you keep him alive because he could die at the right time? 

00:00:42.323 --> 00:00:43.364
 Bring it to me! 

00:00:45.531 --> 00:00:46.448
 Let's find out where it is 

00:00:48.964 --> 00:00:50.297
 If we find it, we can finish it 

00:00:50.547 --> 00:00:51.214
 I say you jump ... 

00:00:51.422 --> 00:00:51.839
 ..NOW! 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.714
 THIS YEAR 

00:00:55.797 --> 00:00:57.297
 Hogwarts is in danger! 

00:00:59.964 --> 00:01:01.922
 Guard the borders! Protect us! 

00:01:02.422 --> 00:01:03.021
 EVERYTHING WILL END 

00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:04.896
 I have to go back, right? 

00:01:05.188 --> 00:01:06.646
 It's a suicide .. 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:07.771
 WHERE EVERYTHING HAS STARTED 

00:01:11.021 --> 00:01:12.188
 The boy who survived 

00:01:14.271 --> 00:01:15.188
 he comes to die. 

00:01:23.703 --> 00:01:24.953
 Tell everyone what happened that night 

00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:26.620
 how you looked into your eyes 

00:01:27.036 --> 00:01:28.411
 a man who trusted you 

00:01:28.745 --> 00:01:29.620
 and you killed him 

00:01:32.411 --> 00:01:34.386
 I never wanted one of you to die for me 

00:01:38.177 --> 00:01:39.052
 Will you stay with me? 

00:01:39.052 --> 00:01:39.969
 Always. 

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:40.760
 Until the end. 

00:01:45.261 --> 00:01:47.680
 Come on Tom, let's finish it as we started ... 

00:01:47.927 --> 00:01:48.720
 ...TOGETHER! 

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.980
 THE FINAL BATTLE 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.900
 IT'S HERE 

00:02:07.292 --> 00:02:09.960
 Only I can live forever
