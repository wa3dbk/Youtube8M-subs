best<00:00:58.129> tricks<00:00:58.489> is<00:00:58.699> how<00:00:58.850> it<00:00:59.000> turns<00:01:00.250> it<00:01:01.250> turns

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
best tricks is how it turns it turns

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.939 
best tricks is how it turns it turns
very<00:01:01.820> flat<00:01:02.239> but<00:01:02.600> boy<00:01:03.289> you<00:01:03.350> can<00:01:03.590> just<00:01:03.769> keep

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
very flat but boy you can just keep

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:10.060 
very flat but boy you can just keep

Mercury Verado Pro now the Verano Pro
has<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.590> little<00:01:47.190> bit<00:01:47.310> bigger<00:01:47.690> gear<00:01:48.690> case

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
has a little bit bigger gear case

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.139 
has a little bit bigger gear case
diameter<00:01:49.619> than<00:01:49.800> the<00:01:49.830> standard<00:01:50.369> Verado<00:01:50.759> and

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
diameter than the standard Verado and

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.919 
diameter than the standard Verado and
for<00:01:51.869> me<00:01:52.050> bigger<00:01:52.680> gear<00:01:52.950> case<00:01:53.190> is<00:01:53.399> always<00:01:53.700> better

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
for me bigger gear case is always better

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:56.660 
for me bigger gear case is always better
now<00:01:54.929> back<00:01:55.200> here<00:01:55.440> we<00:01:55.560> have<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.950> seagrass<00:01:56.369> mat
