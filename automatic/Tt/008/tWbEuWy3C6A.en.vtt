00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
actually use one because I found mine on

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.240 
actually use one because I found mine on
Amazon<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.960> was<00:00:49.110> about<00:00:49.260> 35<00:00:49.829> dollars

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
Amazon it was about 35 dollars

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.529 
Amazon it was about 35 dollars
personally<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:50.850> think<00:00:50.969> it's<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.329> worthwhile

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
personally I think it's a worthwhile

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.660 
personally I think it's a worthwhile
investment<00:00:52.110> because<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.890> know<00:00:52.949> I'll<00:00:53.219> be<00:00:53.250> using

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
investment because I know I'll be using

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.549 
investment because I know I'll be using
it<00:00:53.789> for<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:54.059> long<00:00:54.149> long<00:00:54.390> time<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.289> think<00:00:55.500> you

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
it for a long long time and I think you

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.869 
it for a long long time and I think you
could<00:00:55.680> take<00:00:55.860> really<00:00:56.160> good<00:00:56.309> care<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.760> it

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
could take really good care of it it

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.700 
could take really good care of it it
should<00:00:56.910> last<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.420> for<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> very<00:00:57.719> long<00:00:58.140> time<00:00:58.199> and

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
should last you for a very long time and

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.099 
should last you for a very long time and
now<00:00:58.770> it<00:00:58.920> comes<00:00:59.100> with<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.730> bunch<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.149> attachments

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
now it comes with a bunch of attachments

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.750 
now it comes with a bunch of attachments
with<00:01:01.469> different<00:01:01.890> sizes<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.399> things<00:01:02.640> like

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
why I wanted to share a tutorial with

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.280 
why I wanted to share a tutorial with
you<00:01:30.030> guys<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.600> if<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.810> don't<00:01:31.049> know<00:01:31.110> how<00:01:31.200> to

helpful<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.450> without<00:01:33.930> further<00:01:34.259> ado<00:01:34.710> let's<00:01:34.979> get

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
helpful so without further ado let's get

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.920 
helpful so without further ado let's get
started<00:01:35.549> here's<00:01:35.970> what<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.329> looks<00:01:36.479> like<00:01:36.659> and

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
started here's what it looks like and

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.960 
started here's what it looks like and
here<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.799> blade<00:01:38.040> attachment<00:01:38.400> that<00:01:38.790> just

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
here is the blade attachment that just

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.030 
here is the blade attachment that just
kind<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.240> goes<00:01:39.420> just<00:01:40.200> kind<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.439> hooks<00:01:40.650> on<00:01:40.799> to

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
kind of goes just kind of hooks on to

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.980 
kind of goes just kind of hooks on to
here<00:01:41.400> I<00:01:41.549> have<00:01:41.790> used<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.180> previously<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.840> make

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
here I have used it previously to make

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.990 
here I have used it previously to make
these<00:01:43.290> zucchinis<00:01:43.560> here<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:44.490> it's<00:01:44.610> really<00:01:44.670> easy

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
these zucchinis here so it's really easy

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.969 
these zucchinis here so it's really easy
just<00:01:45.119> attach<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.780> onto<00:01:45.899> there<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.530> does<00:01:46.770> come

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
just attach it onto there it does come

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.620 
just attach it onto there it does come
with<00:01:47.009> other<00:01:47.369> attachments<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.210> haven't

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
with other attachments I haven't

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.389 
with other attachments I haven't
actually<00:01:48.750> used<00:01:48.960> any<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.619> them<00:01:49.829> this<00:01:50.070> one<00:01:50.250> just

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
actually used any of them this one just

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.490 
actually used any of them this one just
I<00:01:50.549> think<00:01:50.610> will<00:01:50.970> give<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.240> bigger<00:01:51.509> size<00:01:51.960> which

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
I think will give you bigger size which

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.050 
I think will give you bigger size which
is<00:01:52.649> fine<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:53.100> don't<00:01:53.310> really<00:01:53.460> need<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.700> use<00:01:53.909> it

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
is fine I don't really need to use it

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.149 
is fine I don't really need to use it
but<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.630> can<00:01:54.810> experiment<00:01:55.229> once<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.920> know<00:01:56.009> how

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
but you can experiment once you know how

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.069 
but you can experiment once you know how
to<00:01:56.219> use<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.820> then<00:01:57.390> there's<00:01:57.600> also<00:01:57.780> another

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
to use it and then there's also another

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.020 
to use it and then there's also another
one<00:01:58.290> which<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.560> think<00:01:58.590> just<00:01:58.979> gives<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.430> slices

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
one which I think just gives you slices

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.910 
one which I think just gives you slices
this<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.810> where<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.229> vegetable<00:02:01.710> gets

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
this is where the vegetable gets

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.290 
this is where the vegetable gets
attached<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.119> the

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.300 
attached to this is the

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.850 
attached to this is the
part<00:02:03.480> that<00:02:03.690> kind<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.960> moves<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.380> everything

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
part that kind of moves it everything

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.010 
part that kind of moves it everything
gets<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.640> attached<00:02:05.970> which<00:02:06.300> is<00:02:06.450> easy<00:02:06.690> to<00:02:06.780> clean

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
gets the attached which is easy to clean

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.530 
gets the attached which is easy to clean
like<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:07.590> part<00:02:08.010> comes<00:02:08.250> out<00:02:08.430> this<00:02:09.000> part<00:02:09.330> comes

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
like this part comes out this part comes

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.910 
like this part comes out this part comes
out<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.020> then<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.229> can<00:02:10.350> just<00:02:10.500> kind<00:02:10.680> of<00:02:10.710> wipe

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
out and then you can just kind of wipe

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.830 
out and then you can just kind of wipe
everything<00:02:11.280> else<00:02:11.580> off<00:02:11.820> and<00:02:12.090> this<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.600> where

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
everything else off and this is where

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.570 
everything else off and this is where
the<00:02:13.110> noodle<00:02:13.440> comes<00:02:13.710> out<00:02:13.890> off<00:02:14.070> and<00:02:14.250> then<00:02:14.400> what<00:02:14.550> I

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
the noodle comes out off and then what I

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.910 
the noodle comes out off and then what I
also<00:02:14.730> like<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.150> has<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.450> little<00:02:15.840> rubber<00:02:16.230> legs

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
also like it has the little rubber legs

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.190 
also like it has the little rubber legs
which<00:02:17.220> helps<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.730> keep<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.450> Machine<00:02:18.780> stable

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
which helps to keep the Machine stable

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.780 
which helps to keep the Machine stable
or<00:02:19.320> the<00:02:19.350> tool<00:02:19.650> stable<00:02:20.070> when<00:02:20.250> you're<00:02:20.370> working

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
or the tool stable when you're working

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.640 
or the tool stable when you're working
so<00:02:20.940> for<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.150> purposes<00:02:21.570> of<00:02:21.630> this<00:02:22.020> video<00:02:22.290> and
