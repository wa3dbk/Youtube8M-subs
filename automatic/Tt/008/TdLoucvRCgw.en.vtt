with<00:00:09.400> my<00:00:09.549> three<00:00:09.820> rosettes<00:00:10.270> completed<00:00:11.190> I'm<00:00:12.190> all

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:12.429 
with my three rosettes completed I'm all

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:13.980 
with my three rosettes completed I'm all
set<00:00:12.639> to<00:00:12.790> move<00:00:12.940> to<00:00:13.150> the<00:00:13.269> background<00:00:13.750> pattern

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990 
set to move to the background pattern

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.429 
set to move to the background pattern
that<00:00:14.259> I<00:00:14.320> drew<00:00:14.740> if<00:00:15.240> you<00:00:16.240> like<00:00:16.509> this<00:00:16.720> pattern<00:00:17.200> for

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:17.439 
that I drew if you like this pattern for

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.050 
that I drew if you like this pattern for
yourself<00:00:17.830> if<00:00:18.009> you'd<00:00:18.130> rather<00:00:18.279> not<00:00:18.520> draw<00:00:18.849> your

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
yourself if you'd rather not draw your

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.300 
yourself if you'd rather not draw your
own<00:00:19.119> you<00:00:20.050> can<00:00:20.080> get<00:00:20.380> this<00:00:20.590> by<00:00:20.800> becoming<00:00:21.130> a

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
own you can get this by becoming a

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.310 
own you can get this by becoming a
member<00:00:21.520> at<00:00:21.790> my<00:00:22.000> chip<00:00:22.270> carving<00:00:22.300> and<00:00:22.869> I'll

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
member at my chip carving and I'll

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.269 
member at my chip carving and I'll
provide<00:00:23.500> the<00:00:23.649> pattern<00:00:24.099> for<00:00:24.309> you<00:00:24.489> there<00:00:26.279> these

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
provide the pattern for you there these

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:28.859 
provide the pattern for you there these
are<00:00:27.489> the<00:00:27.579> chips<00:00:27.820> that<00:00:27.970> i'll<00:00:28.090> remove<00:00:28.390> i'm<00:00:28.720> going

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
are the chips that i'll remove i'm going

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.370 
are the chips that i'll remove i'm going
to<00:00:28.930> draw<00:00:29.140> dots<00:00:29.500> at<00:00:29.890> the<00:00:29.950> center<00:00:30.700> of<00:00:31.079> the<00:00:32.079> chips

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:32.380 
to draw dots at the center of the chips

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.040 
to draw dots at the center of the chips
i'll<00:00:32.559> be<00:00:32.710> taking<00:00:32.890> out<00:00:33.280> the<00:00:34.180> dot<00:00:34.420> represents

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
i'll be taking out the dot represents

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.200 
i'll be taking out the dot represents
the<00:00:35.110> deepest<00:00:35.500> point<00:00:35.710> of<00:00:35.860> the<00:00:35.920> chip<00:00:36.190> so<00:00:37.059> i'll<00:00:37.120> be

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
the deepest point of the chip so i'll be

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.849 
the deepest point of the chip so i'll be
taking<00:00:37.359> these<00:00:37.719> out<00:00:37.960> same<00:00:38.320> thing<00:00:38.589> on<00:00:38.710> the

00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:38.859 
taking these out same thing on the

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:41.069 
taking these out same thing on the
opposite<00:00:39.309> side<00:00:39.579> and<00:00:39.940> I'll<00:00:40.510> work<00:00:40.690> my<00:00:40.870> way<00:00:41.050> down

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
opposite side and I'll work my way down

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.340 
opposite side and I'll work my way down
the<00:00:41.469> edge<00:00:41.789> with<00:00:42.789> this<00:00:42.999> one<00:00:43.300> and<00:00:43.570> this<00:00:43.870> one<00:00:43.929> and

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
the edge with this one and this one and

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.979 
the edge with this one and this one and
so<00:00:45.070> on<00:00:45.100> all<00:00:45.550> the<00:00:45.640> way<00:00:46.149> down<00:00:48.210> as<00:00:49.210> a<00:00:49.269> right-hander

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
so on all the way down as a right-hander

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:51.569 
so on all the way down as a right-hander
I<00:00:50.050> like<00:00:50.199> to<00:00:50.350> work<00:00:50.469> right<00:00:50.710> to<00:00:50.920> left<00:00:51.129> so<00:00:51.399> I'll

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
I like to work right to left so I'll

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.669 
I like to work right to left so I'll
start<00:00:51.820> with<00:00:51.999> this<00:00:52.179> chip<00:00:52.480> and<00:00:52.690> here<00:00:53.289> and<00:00:53.409> work

00:00:53.669 --> 00:00:53.679 
start with this chip and here and work

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:55.950 
start with this chip and here and work
my<00:00:53.859> way<00:00:53.890> around<00:00:54.190> I<00:00:54.699> want<00:00:55.359> to<00:00:55.390> take<00:00:55.569> this<00:00:55.600> with

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
my way around I want to take this with

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.439 
my way around I want to take this with
the<00:00:56.109> grain<00:00:56.319> cut<00:00:56.589> first<00:00:56.920> and<00:00:57.179> one<00:00:58.179> thing<00:00:58.359> I

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
the grain cut first and one thing I

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.270 
the grain cut first and one thing I
realized<00:00:58.839> real<00:00:59.170> quickly<00:00:59.440> when<00:00:59.739> I<00:00:59.800> was<00:00:59.920> carving

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
realized real quickly when I was carving

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.279 
realized real quickly when I was carving
these<00:01:00.429> rosettes<00:01:00.879> was<00:01:01.659> that<00:01:01.839> it<00:01:01.960> sure<00:01:02.140> is

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
these rosettes was that it sure is

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:04.770 
these rosettes was that it sure is
helpful<00:01:02.829> to<00:01:03.039> have<00:01:03.640> something<00:01:04.089> of<00:01:04.180> equal<00:01:04.510> width

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
helpful to have something of equal width

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.410 
helpful to have something of equal width
along<00:01:05.500> the<00:01:05.650> edge<00:01:05.860> of<00:01:06.100> this<00:01:06.280> of<00:01:06.520> this<00:01:06.970> wine

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
along the edge of this of this wine

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.290 
along the edge of this of this wine
bottle<00:01:07.780> holder<00:01:07.810> to<00:01:08.560> rest<00:01:08.770> my<00:01:08.980> hand<00:01:09.220> on<00:01:09.490> now<00:01:10.210> if

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
bottle holder to rest my hand on now if

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.970 
bottle holder to rest my hand on now if
you<00:01:10.390> don't<00:01:10.540> have<00:01:10.720> the<00:01:10.840> luxury<00:01:10.990> of<00:01:11.470> having

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:11.980 
you don't have the luxury of having

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.460 
you don't have the luxury of having
another<00:01:12.310> wine<00:01:12.610> bottle<00:01:12.640> holder<00:01:13.060> handy<00:01:13.840> go

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
another wine bottle holder handy go

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.080 
another wine bottle holder handy go
ahead<00:01:14.710> and<00:01:14.740> find<00:01:15.070> some<00:01:15.280> boards<00:01:15.610> are<00:01:15.730> the<00:01:15.850> same

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
ahead and find some boards are the same

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.660 
ahead and find some boards are the same
thickness<00:01:16.390> as<00:01:16.720> yours<00:01:17.190> so<00:01:18.190> let<00:01:18.310> you<00:01:18.460> have<00:01:18.640> a

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
thickness as yours so let you have a

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.510 
thickness as yours so let you have a
firm<00:01:19.120> base<00:01:19.420> for<00:01:19.690> your<00:01:19.810> hand<00:01:20.050> to<00:01:20.170> rest<00:01:20.380> on<00:01:20.620> so

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
firm base for your hand to rest on so

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.710 
firm base for your hand to rest on so
I'm<00:01:21.580> going<00:01:21.610> to<00:01:21.760> take<00:01:21.820> out<00:01:21.970> this<00:01:22.150> chip<00:01:22.420> here<00:01:22.630> and

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
I'm going to take out this chip here and

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.140 
I'm going to take out this chip here and
I<00:01:22.750> want<00:01:22.900> to<00:01:22.960> show<00:01:23.080> you<00:01:23.140> a<00:01:23.230> little<00:01:23.410> trick<00:01:24.150> these

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
I want to show you a little trick these

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.030 
I want to show you a little trick these
chips<00:01:25.420> are<00:01:25.600> a<00:01:25.660> little<00:01:25.840> large<00:01:26.230> so<00:01:26.740> I'm<00:01:26.830> going<00:01:27.010> to

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
chips are a little large so I'm going to

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.530 
chips are a little large so I'm going to
take<00:01:27.220> out<00:01:27.460> a<00:01:27.790> smaller<00:01:28.750> chip<00:01:29.200> in<00:01:30.120> the<00:01:31.120> center

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
take out a smaller chip in the center

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.750 
take out a smaller chip in the center
first<00:01:31.960> you<00:01:32.620> don't<00:01:32.770> have<00:01:32.890> to<00:01:33.010> be<00:01:33.070> real<00:01:33.280> accurate

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
first you don't have to be real accurate

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.980 
first you don't have to be real accurate
with<00:01:34.060> this<00:01:34.680> just<00:01:35.680> take<00:01:35.920> out<00:01:36.160> a<00:01:36.630> smaller<00:01:37.630> chip

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
with this just take out a smaller chip

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.400 
with this just take out a smaller chip
in<00:01:38.140> the<00:01:38.230> middle<00:01:38.530> and<00:01:39.510> that<00:01:40.510> relieves<00:01:40.990> some<00:01:41.260> of

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
in the middle and that relieves some of

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.170 
in the middle and that relieves some of
the<00:01:41.500> internal<00:01:41.980> pressures<00:01:42.460> of<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:42.670> wood<00:01:42.970> and

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
the internal pressures of the wood and

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.900 
the internal pressures of the wood and
makes<00:01:43.810> it<00:01:43.990> much<00:01:44.140> easier<00:01:44.200> to<00:01:44.950> remove<00:01:45.520> a<00:01:45.700> large

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
makes it much easier to remove a large

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.250 
makes it much easier to remove a large
chip<00:01:46.360> so<00:01:47.020> I<00:01:47.080> start<00:01:47.350> shallow<00:01:48.720> go<00:01:49.720> down<00:01:49.930> and<00:01:50.140> get

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
chip so I start shallow go down and get

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:56.040 
chip so I start shallow go down and get
my<00:01:50.470> depth<00:01:50.770> and<00:01:51.660> draw<00:01:52.660> the<00:01:52.720> knife<00:01:52.990> out<00:01:55.020> turn<00:01:56.020> the

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
my depth and draw the knife out turn the

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.320 
my depth and draw the knife out turn the
board

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.800 

again<00:02:00.330> from<00:02:00.600> shallow<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.850> deep<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:03.450> can<00:02:03.600> see

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
again from shallow to deep you can see

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.950 
again from shallow to deep you can see
how<00:02:04.520> that<00:02:05.520> small<00:02:05.940> chip<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.330> the<00:02:06.420> center<00:02:06.720> makes

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
how that small chip in the center makes

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.480 
how that small chip in the center makes
it<00:02:07.140> easier<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:08.240> make<00:02:09.240> my<00:02:09.450> depth<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:10.490> finally

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
it easier to make my depth and finally

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:18.160 
it easier to make my depth and finally
I'll<00:02:11.610> remove<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.180> chip<00:02:12.800> with<00:02:13.800> this<00:02:14.040> cut<00:02:16.100> and

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
I'll remove the chip with this cut and

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.770 
I'll remove the chip with this cut and
there<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.320> have<00:02:19.350> it<00:02:20.270> okay<00:02:21.270> so<00:02:21.330> that's<00:02:21.540> one

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
there you have it okay so that's one

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.230 
there you have it okay so that's one
little<00:02:22.050> trick<00:02:22.320> on<00:02:22.590> removing<00:02:23.130> larger<00:02:23.940> chips

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
little trick on removing larger chips

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.570 
little trick on removing larger chips
next<00:02:24.900> one<00:02:25.170> I'll<00:02:25.290> take<00:02:25.470> out<00:02:25.650> this<00:02:25.830> one<00:02:28.280> again<00:02:29.280> my

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
next one I'll take out this one again my

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.480 
next one I'll take out this one again my
first<00:02:29.880> cut<00:02:30.120> away<00:02:30.930> from<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.350> previous<00:02:31.770> chip<00:02:32.070> so

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
first cut away from the previous chip so

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.400 
first cut away from the previous chip so
I'll<00:02:32.610> start<00:02:32.850> here<00:02:33.209> plunge<00:02:33.600> down<00:02:33.900> from<00:02:34.260> my

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
I'll start here plunge down from my

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.100 
I'll start here plunge down from my
depth<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:37.470> draw<00:02:37.980> it<00:02:38.130> out<00:02:38.450> again<00:02:39.450> if<00:02:39.600> I<00:02:39.720> want<00:02:39.930> I

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
depth and draw it out again if I want I

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.570 
depth and draw it out again if I want I
could<00:02:40.170> have<00:02:40.380> taken<00:02:40.500> out<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.740> smaller<00:02:41.100> chip<00:02:41.400> in

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
could have taken out a smaller chip in

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:53.449 
could have taken out a smaller chip in
the<00:02:41.670> center<00:02:50.120> and<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:51.330> probably<00:02:51.600> should've<00:02:52.459> cuz

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
the center and I probably should've cuz

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.280 
the center and I probably should've cuz
that's<00:02:53.640> pretty<00:02:53.940> hard<00:02:54.240> across<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.870> grain<00:02:55.110> to

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
that's pretty hard across the grain to

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:13.910 
that's pretty hard across the grain to
get<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.590> depth<00:02:55.830> I<00:02:56.070> need

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:43.270 

so<00:03:14.920> I've<00:03:14.980> got<00:03:15.130> a<00:03:15.160> little<00:03:15.190> cleanup<00:03:15.550> to<00:03:15.760> do<00:03:15.880> there

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.130 

and<00:03:43.370> next<00:03:44.030> I'll<00:03:44.180> remove<00:03:44.209> these<00:03:44.540> chips<00:03:44.870> in<00:03:45.020> the

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
and next I'll remove these chips in the

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.470 
and next I'll remove these chips in the
same<00:03:45.350> manner<00:03:45.590> so<00:03:46.580> I<00:03:46.610> won't<00:03:46.790> stay<00:03:47.000> on<00:03:47.030> camera

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
same manner so I won't stay on camera

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.210 
same manner so I won't stay on camera
the<00:03:47.600> whole<00:03:47.720> time<00:03:47.780> I'll<00:03:48.650> just<00:03:48.830> go<00:03:48.980> ahead<00:03:49.100> and

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
the whole time I'll just go ahead and

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.430 
the whole time I'll just go ahead and
take<00:03:49.430> one<00:03:49.640> of<00:03:49.730> these<00:03:49.819> out<00:03:50.030> and<00:03:50.270> then<00:03:51.110> I'll<00:03:51.200> fast

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
take one of these out and then I'll fast

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.870 
take one of these out and then I'll fast
forward<00:03:51.560> til<00:03:51.980> I<00:03:52.069> get<00:03:52.130> done<00:03:52.459> but<00:03:52.610> you<00:03:52.760> can

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
forward til I get done but you can

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.940 
forward til I get done but you can
follow<00:03:53.090> us<00:03:53.180> around<00:03:53.420> all<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:53.930> way<00:03:53.959> around<00:03:54.020> the

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
follow us around all the way around the

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.800 
follow us around all the way around the
outside<00:03:54.980> of<00:03:55.400> your<00:03:55.670> your<00:03:56.180> wine<00:03:56.420> bottle<00:03:56.780> holder

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
outside of your your wine bottle holder

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.360 
outside of your your wine bottle holder
I<00:03:57.350> think<00:03:58.250> I'll<00:03:58.340> take<00:03:58.550> out<00:03:58.670> some<00:04:00.010> smaller<00:04:01.010> chips

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
I think I'll take out some smaller chips

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.949 
I think I'll take out some smaller chips
in<00:04:01.520> the<00:04:01.610> center<00:04:01.970> here<00:04:02.120> to<00:04:02.270> make<00:04:02.420> it<00:04:02.569> easier<00:04:02.870> on

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
in the center here to make it easier on

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:14.650 
in the center here to make it easier on
myself

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.720 

you
