realizing this will give it a more of a
natural<00:01:31.750> look

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.660 

now<00:01:36.170> once<00:01:36.380> you're<00:01:36.560> done<00:01:36.710> doing<00:01:36.770> this<00:01:37.219> you<00:01:37.460> just

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
now once you're done doing this you just

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.539 
now once you're done doing this you just
have<00:01:37.789> to<00:01:37.939> let<00:01:38.060> it<00:01:38.119> dry<00:01:38.649> it<00:01:39.649> won't<00:01:39.860> dry<00:01:40.070> too<00:01:40.130> long

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
have to let it dry it won't dry too long

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
it won't take too long and then we can

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.789 
it won't take too long and then we can
