year and I ended up hatching out just
two<00:00:17.560> boys<00:00:17.770> and<00:00:18.310> I've<00:00:18.910> never<00:00:19.120> hatch<00:00:19.330> doubt

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:24.160 
before and so I ended up having just two

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.130 
before and so I ended up having just two
hatch<00:00:24.430> and<00:00:24.790> I<00:00:24.910> actually<00:00:25.090> had<00:00:25.360> to<00:00:25.450> help<00:00:25.600> them<00:00:25.810> so

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
hatch and I actually had to help them so

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.130 
hatch and I actually had to help them so
I<00:00:26.410> now<00:00:27.130> have<00:00:27.160> learned<00:00:27.790> after<00:00:28.240> a<00:00:28.480> year<00:00:28.930> that

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
I now have learned after a year that

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.410 
I now have learned after a year that
duck<00:00:29.740> eggs<00:00:29.980> are<00:00:30.250> harder<00:00:30.700> to<00:00:30.850> hatch<00:00:31.030> and<00:00:31.390> you

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
duck eggs are harder to hatch and you

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.619 
duck eggs are harder to hatch and you
need<00:00:32.259> to<00:00:32.590> give<00:00:32.890> them<00:00:33.040> more<00:00:33.190> moisture<00:00:33.790> towards

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:34.629 
need to give them more moisture towards

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:37.170 
need to give them more moisture towards
the<00:00:34.780> hatch<00:00:34.960> date<00:00:35.350> so<00:00:36.130> I<00:00:36.160> believe<00:00:36.700> I<00:00:36.820> only<00:00:36.970> got

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
the hatch date so I believe I only got

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.550 
the hatch date so I believe I only got
the<00:00:37.360> twelve<00:00:37.660> eggs

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:38.560

them exactly the way they were put in so
if<00:01:37.090> you<00:01:37.119> take<00:01:37.359> an<00:01:37.509> egg<00:01:37.659> out<00:01:37.840> and<00:01:37.990> you<00:01:38.049> know<00:01:38.170> this

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
if you take an egg out and you know this

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.889

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.050 
is the top put it back into its spot and
the<00:01:41.350> reason<00:01:41.590> why<00:01:41.649> is<00:01:41.709> because<00:01:41.799> usually<00:01:42.700> the

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
the reason why is because usually the

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.330 
the reason why is because usually the
shipper<00:01:43.630> knows<00:01:44.139> that<00:01:44.380> this<00:01:44.529> is<00:01:44.709> the<00:01:44.889> point

facing upwards but what you need to do

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.419 
facing upwards but what you need to do
if<00:01:54.789> possible<00:01:55.359> leave<00:01:55.630> them<00:01:55.899> set<00:01:56.380> for<00:01:56.590> 24<00:01:57.069> hours

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
if possible leave them set for 24 hours

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.919 
if possible leave them set for 24 hours
that<00:01:58.389> way<00:01:58.689> you<00:01:58.749> can<00:01:59.789> get<00:02:00.789> the<00:02:00.969> air<00:02:01.240> sac<00:02:01.539> to<00:02:01.719> kind

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
that way you can get the air sac to kind

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:03.959 
that way you can get the air sac to kind
of<00:02:02.020> redevelop<00:02:02.560> again<00:02:02.859> on<00:02:03.039> the<00:02:03.279> very<00:02:03.459> top<00:02:03.669> there

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
of redevelop again on the very top there

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:07.409 
of redevelop again on the very top there
