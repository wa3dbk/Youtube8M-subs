00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
Festa and this week we'll create one of

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.689 
Festa and this week we'll create one of
the<00:00:19.020> most<00:00:19.199> common<00:00:19.619> fancy<00:00:20.070> transition<00:00:20.580> out

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
the most common fancy transition out

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.390 
the most common fancy transition out
there<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.510> glow<00:00:21.720> transition<00:00:22.350> this<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:23.039> what

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
there the glow transition this is what

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
there the glow transition this is what
it<00:00:23.519> looks<00:00:23.699> like<00:00:26.660> whoa<00:00:28.880> make<00:00:29.880> sense<00:00:30.150> in<00:00:30.330> a

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
it looks like whoa make sense in a

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.470 
it looks like whoa make sense in a
flashback<00:00:30.869> situation<00:00:31.710> like<00:00:31.890> this<00:00:32.300> the<00:00:33.300> guy

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
flashback situation like this the guy

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.990 
flashback situation like this the guy
sitting<00:00:33.840> down<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.469> are<00:00:34.620> thinking<00:00:35.070> back<00:00:35.670> to

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
sitting down and are thinking back to

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.479 
sitting down and are thinking back to
the<00:00:36.570> situation<00:00:36.780> with<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.649> girlfriend<00:00:38.309> for

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
the situation with this girlfriend for

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.240 
the situation with this girlfriend for
example<00:00:39.050> okay<00:00:41.149> so<00:00:42.149> let's<00:00:43.110> start<00:00:43.410> with<00:00:43.920> the

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
example okay so let's start with the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.920 
example okay so let's start with the
fresh<00:00:45.050> sequence<00:00:46.050> we<00:00:46.469> have<00:00:46.680> our<00:00:46.950> two<00:00:47.399> shots<00:00:47.930> now

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
fresh sequence we have our two shots now

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.930 
fresh sequence we have our two shots now
first<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.289> all<00:00:49.379> we'll<00:00:49.620> use<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> effect<00:00:50.730> from

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
first of all we'll use a effect from

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.040 
first of all we'll use a effect from
Baris<00:00:51.390> continuum<00:00:51.960> complete<00:00:52.410> called<00:00:52.739> glow<00:00:53.100> and

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
Baris continuum complete called glow and

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.189 
Baris continuum complete called glow and
this<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.170> not<00:00:55.350> actually<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.190> transition<00:00:56.910> effect

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
this is not actually a transition effect

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.779 
this is not actually a transition effect
so<00:00:58.199> we'll<00:00:58.440> have<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.770> apply<00:00:58.800> two<00:00:59.129> effects<00:00:59.640> one

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
so we'll have to apply two effects one

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.150 
so we'll have to apply two effects one
to<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.480> outgoing<00:01:00.629> clip<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.440> one<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.829> the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
to the outgoing clip and one to the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.080 
to the outgoing clip and one to the
incoming<00:01:02.670> clip<00:01:03.860> to<00:01:04.860> make<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.129> look<00:01:05.309> like<00:01:06.060> a

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
incoming clip to make it look like a

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.140 
incoming clip to make it look like a
transition<00:01:06.830> in<00:01:07.830> order<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.549> do<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.850> we'll

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
transition in order to do that we'll

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.460 
transition in order to do that we'll
have<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.479> overlap<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.470> two<00:01:10.580> clips<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:12.470> let's

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
have to overlap the two clips so let's

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.539 
have to overlap the two clips so let's
move<00:01:13.680> one<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.070> them

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
move one of them

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:22.660 
move one of them
2<00:01:15.270> vo<00:01:15.479> track<00:01:15.600> 2<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:17.960> have<00:01:18.960> them<00:01:19.170> overlap<00:01:21.140> say

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670 
2 vo track 2 and have them overlap say

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:29.719 
2 vo track 2 and have them overlap say
30<00:01:23.670> frames<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:26.420> trim<00:01:27.420> them<00:01:27.659> 15<00:01:28.049> frames<00:01:28.579> to<00:01:29.579> each

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
30 frames so trim them 15 frames to each

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.850 
30 frames so trim them 15 frames to each
side<00:01:30.090> and<00:01:30.890> then<00:01:31.970> create<00:01:32.970> edit<00:01:33.479> points<00:01:35.630> in

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
side and then create edit points in

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.679 
side and then create edit points in
order<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.040> create<00:01:38.520> segments<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.299> we<00:01:39.450> can

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
order to create segments that we can

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.639 
order to create segments that we can
apply<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.740> effect<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.930> so<00:01:42.930> now<00:01:43.200> let's<00:01:43.439> go<00:01:43.619> to

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
apply the effect to so now let's go to

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.149 
apply the effect to so now let's go to
tools<00:01:44.930> FAC<00:01:45.930> Polad<00:01:46.290> go<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.340> BCC<00:01:47.970> effects<00:01:48.750> and

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
tools FAC Polad go to BCC effects and

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:56.090 
tools FAC Polad go to BCC effects and
apply<00:01:50.750> PTC<00:01:51.750> glow<00:01:52.399> to<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.670> upper<00:01:53.909> track<00:01:55.100> they

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
apply PTC glow to the upper track they

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.139 
apply PTC glow to the upper track they
can<00:01:56.280> see<00:01:56.490> she<00:01:57.329> starts<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.810> glow<00:01:57.930> immediately

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
can see she starts to glow immediately

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.899 
can see she starts to glow immediately
so<00:02:00.149> let's<00:02:00.329> go<00:02:00.479> on<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.780> effect<00:02:01.020> editor<00:02:01.909> it

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
so let's go on to the effect editor it

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.790 
so let's go on to the effect editor it
opens<00:02:04.219> the<00:02:05.219> VCC<00:02:05.670> glow<00:02:05.850> parameters

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.460 

we<00:02:10.610> need<00:02:10.760> to<00:02:10.880> create<00:02:11.180> keyframes<00:02:11.840> at<00:02:12.350> the

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
we need to create keyframes at the

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.910 
we need to create keyframes at the
beginning<00:02:12.770> and<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.220> end<00:02:13.370> of<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:14.240> effect<00:02:14.540> and

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
beginning and the end of the effect and

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.890 
beginning and the end of the effect and
to<00:02:15.920> make<00:02:16.070> it<00:02:16.100> all<00:02:16.310> simpler<00:02:16.820> we'll<00:02:17.210> add<00:02:17.420> them<00:02:17.750> to

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
to make it all simpler we'll add them to

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
to make it all simpler we'll add them to
all<00:02:18.080> parameters<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:20.390> beginning<00:02:20.750> or<00:02:20.990> the<00:02:21.050> end

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
all parameters the beginning or the end

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.320 
all parameters the beginning or the end
even<00:02:22.100> though<00:02:22.310> we<00:02:22.430> don't<00:02:22.610> need<00:02:22.790> all<00:02:23.060> parameters

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
even though we don't need all parameters

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.250 
even though we don't need all parameters
as<00:02:24.460> you<00:02:25.460> can<00:02:25.670> see<00:02:25.850> now<00:02:26.060> there's<00:02:26.540> a<00:02:26.630> steady<00:02:27.080> glow

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
as you can see now there's a steady glow

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.760 
as you can see now there's a steady glow
applied<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.300> effect<00:02:29.540> but<00:02:29.720> as<00:02:29.960> this<00:02:30.320> is<00:02:30.560> the

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
applied to the effect but as this is the

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.660 
applied to the effect but as this is the
incoming<00:02:31.540> clip<00:02:32.540> we<00:02:32.960> need<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:34.190> start<00:02:34.400> with<00:02:34.640> a

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
incoming clip we need to start with a

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.790 
incoming clip we need to start with a
strong<00:02:35.060> blow<00:02:35.330> and<00:02:35.690> fade<00:02:36.020> it<00:02:36.170> out<00:02:36.260> completely

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
strong blow and fade it out completely

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.750 
strong blow and fade it out completely
so<00:02:37.190> that<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.520> ends<00:02:38.210> with<00:02:38.450> no<00:02:38.720> glow<00:02:38.990> at<00:02:39.230> all<00:02:39.760> so

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
so that it ends with no glow at all so

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.450 
so that it ends with no glow at all so
let's<00:02:41.030> start<00:02:41.270> with<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.620> beginning<00:02:43.480> and

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
let's start with the the beginning and

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.770 
let's start with the the beginning and
the<00:02:46.460> parameters<00:02:47.000> we<00:02:47.270> need<00:02:47.960> to<00:02:48.110> use<00:02:48.460> here<00:02:49.460> our

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
the parameters we need to use here our

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.090 
the parameters we need to use here our
glow<00:02:50.780> intensity<00:02:51.410> and<00:02:52.900> glow<00:02:53.900> threshold<00:02:54.560> you

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
glow intensity and glow threshold you

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.220 
glow intensity and glow threshold you
can<00:02:55.280> play<00:02:55.670> with<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.060> other<00:02:56.210> parameters<00:02:57.020> as

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
can play with the other parameters as

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.070 
can play with the other parameters as
well<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:57.740> achieve<00:02:58.400> different<00:02:58.580> results<00:02:59.080> but

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
well and achieve different results but

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.140 
well and achieve different results but
we'll<00:03:00.440> stick<00:03:00.740> with<00:03:01.070> the<00:03:01.340> glow<00:03:01.490> intensity<00:03:02.030> and

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
we'll stick with the glow intensity and

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.260 
we'll stick with the glow intensity and
low<00:03:02.420> threshold<00:03:02.780> for<00:03:03.380> now<00:03:03.580> so<00:03:04.580> let's<00:03:04.610> crank<00:03:05.060> up

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
low threshold for now so let's crank up

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.520 
low threshold for now so let's crank up
the<00:03:05.420> intensity<00:03:05.450> at<00:03:06.080> the<00:03:06.200> beginning<00:03:08.440> as<00:03:09.440> you

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
the intensity at the beginning as you

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.620 
the intensity at the beginning as you
can<00:03:09.650> see<00:03:09.770> that<00:03:09.980> is<00:03:10.100> not<00:03:10.250> enough<00:03:10.550> we<00:03:10.820> want<00:03:11.000> glow

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
can see that is not enough we want glow

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.520 
can see that is not enough we want glow
all<00:03:11.960> over<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:12.740> image<00:03:14.020> so<00:03:15.020> let's<00:03:15.050> turn<00:03:15.500> down

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
all over the image so let's turn down

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:22.120 
all over the image so let's turn down
the<00:03:15.770> threshold<00:03:19.900> until<00:03:20.900> pretty<00:03:21.200> much<00:03:21.440> the

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
the threshold until pretty much the

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:30.370 
the threshold until pretty much the
whole<00:03:22.280> image<00:03:22.640> is<00:03:22.850> white<00:03:26.740> and<00:03:28.420> at<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:29.570> end<00:03:29.720> the

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
whole image is white and at the end the

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.320 
whole image is white and at the end the
intensity<00:03:30.860> needs<00:03:31.430> to<00:03:31.640> go<00:03:31.790> to<00:03:32.140> zero<00:03:34.090> can<00:03:35.090> still

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
intensity needs to go to zero can still

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.730 
intensity needs to go to zero can still
turn<00:03:35.540> out<00:03:35.720> down<00:03:36.110> the<00:03:36.380> threshold<00:03:37.100> a<00:03:37.250> little<00:03:38.740> but

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
turn out down the threshold a little but

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.290 
turn out down the threshold a little but
we<00:03:39.890> wouldn't<00:03:40.190> need<00:03:40.280> to<00:03:40.340> do<00:03:40.550> that<00:03:43.030> now<00:03:44.030> we<00:03:44.090> need

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 
we wouldn't need to do that now we need

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.060 
we wouldn't need to do that now we need
to<00:03:44.420> apply<00:03:44.540> pretty<00:03:44.959> much<00:03:45.110> the<00:03:45.260> same<00:03:45.440> effect<00:03:45.620> to

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
to apply pretty much the same effect to

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.110 
to apply pretty much the same effect to
the<00:03:46.310> video<00:03:46.640> track<00:03:47.060> below<00:03:47.709> only<00:03:48.709> with<00:03:49.459> the

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
the video track below only with the

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.400 
the video track below only with the
effect<00:03:50.420> reversed<00:03:50.810> right<00:03:51.550> so<00:03:52.550> let's<00:03:53.170> drag<00:03:54.170> and

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
effect reversed right so let's drag and

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.630 
effect reversed right so let's drag and
drop<00:03:54.620> the<00:03:54.830> effect<00:03:54.860> icon<00:03:55.870> to<00:03:56.870> the<00:03:56.900> layer<00:03:57.170> below

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
drop the effect icon to the layer below

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.610 
drop the effect icon to the layer below
copies<00:03:58.640> the<00:03:58.880> effect<00:03:59.240> layer<00:03:59.810> below<00:04:00.020> let's

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
copies the effect layer below let's

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.610 
copies the effect layer below let's
watch<00:04:00.920> that<00:04:01.190> layer<00:04:01.400> as<00:04:01.610> well<00:04:01.850> and<00:04:02.440> as<00:04:03.440> you<00:04:03.530> can

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
watch that layer as well and as you can

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.280 
watch that layer as well and as you can
see<00:04:03.940> it<00:04:04.940> works<00:04:05.209> just<00:04:05.330> the<00:04:06.020> same<00:04:06.280> way<00:04:08.020> but<00:04:09.020> let's

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
see it works just the same way but let's

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.010 
see it works just the same way but let's
copy<00:04:09.650> all<00:04:10.040> the<00:04:10.760> parameters<00:04:11.390> from<00:04:11.630> the<00:04:11.720> first

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
copy all the parameters from the first

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:18.219 
copy all the parameters from the first
keyframe<00:04:13.330> and<00:04:15.730> paste<00:04:16.730> them<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.930> last

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
keyframe and paste them the last

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:21.469 
keyframe and paste them the last
keyframe

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.120 

and<00:04:22.479> of<00:04:22.600> course<00:04:22.840> the<00:04:23.259> first<00:04:23.470> keyframe<00:04:23.710> the

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
and of course the first keyframe the

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.469 
and of course the first keyframe the
intensity<00:04:24.639> has<00:04:24.940> got<00:04:25.270> to<00:04:25.419> be<00:04:25.539> zero<00:04:26.050> and<00:04:27.479> the

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
intensity has got to be zero and the

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:32.510 
intensity has got to be zero and the
threshold<00:04:28.750> should<00:04:29.620> be<00:04:29.889> more<00:04:30.490> than<00:04:31.289> twenty

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
threshold should be more than twenty

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.840 
threshold should be more than twenty
something<00:04:33.520> like<00:04:33.610> this<00:04:34.320> and<00:04:35.320> I<00:04:35.410> can<00:04:35.590> see<00:04:36.240> yeah

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
something like this and I can see yeah

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.820 
something like this and I can see yeah
it's<00:04:39.850> starting<00:04:40.180> to<00:04:40.419> glow<00:04:40.630> big-time<00:04:41.289> well<00:04:41.650> we

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
it's starting to glow big-time well we

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.879 
it's starting to glow big-time well we
can<00:04:41.949> even<00:04:42.100> crank<00:04:42.550> down<00:04:43.150> the<00:04:43.690> the<00:04:44.169> threshold<00:04:44.710> at

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
can even crank down the the threshold at

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.379 
can even crank down the the threshold at
the<00:04:45.009> last<00:04:45.630> frame<00:04:46.630> at<00:04:46.900> the<00:04:46.930> last<00:04:47.199> keyframe

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
the last frame at the last keyframe

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.290 
the last frame at the last keyframe
something<00:04:49.389> like<00:04:49.539> this<00:04:50.759> there<00:04:51.759> we<00:04:51.880> go<00:04:52.060> we<00:04:52.270> can

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
something like this there we go we can

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:58.710 
something like this there we go we can
see<00:04:52.690> in<00:04:53.349> the<00:04:53.710> preview<00:04:54.780> whoa<00:04:57.539> it's<00:04:58.539> glowing

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
see in the preview whoa it's glowing

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.409 
see in the preview whoa it's glowing
strong<00:05:01.979> okay<00:05:02.979> if<00:05:03.250> we<00:05:03.520> watch<00:05:03.789> the<00:05:04.030> effect<00:05:04.240> in

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
strong okay if we watch the effect in

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:07.140 
strong okay if we watch the effect in
preview<00:05:04.840> now<00:05:05.220> by<00:05:06.220> scrubbing<00:05:06.520> through<00:05:06.940> the

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
preview now by scrubbing through the

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.290 
preview now by scrubbing through the
timeline<00:05:08.220> this<00:05:09.220> is<00:05:09.370> not<00:05:09.550> what<00:05:09.759> we<00:05:09.880> want<00:05:10.090> right

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
timeline this is not what we want right

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:17.490 
timeline this is not what we want right
it<00:05:11.070> cuts<00:05:13.380> to<00:05:14.380> her<00:05:14.620> D<00:05:15.220> glowing<00:05:16.349> instead<00:05:17.349> of

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.500 
it cuts to her D glowing instead of

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.580 
it cuts to her D glowing instead of
transitioning<00:05:18.570> well<00:05:19.570> again<00:05:19.900> that<00:05:20.139> is<00:05:20.289> because

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
transitioning well again that is because

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.830 
transitioning well again that is because
the<00:05:21.340> effects<00:05:21.699> are<00:05:21.789> not<00:05:21.910> actually<00:05:22.360> transition

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
the effects are not actually transition

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.060 
the effects are not actually transition
effects<00:05:23.259> but<00:05:24.990> we<00:05:25.990> can<00:05:26.260> remedy<00:05:26.530> this<00:05:26.770> pretty

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
effects but we can remedy this pretty

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.570 
effects but we can remedy this pretty
easily

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
easily

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.529 
easily
we<00:05:28.539> want<00:05:28.780> the<00:05:29.740> shot<00:05:29.979> of<00:05:30.099> her<00:05:30.250> in<00:05:30.490> the<00:05:30.610> cafe<00:05:31.030> to

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:31.539 
we want the shot of her in the cafe to

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:35.430 
we want the shot of her in the cafe to
fade<00:05:31.810> in<00:05:32.050> right<00:05:33.449> so<00:05:34.449> let's<00:05:34.870> go<00:05:34.990> to<00:05:35.050> the<00:05:35.229> first

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
fade in right so let's go to the first

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.860 
fade in right so let's go to the first
keyframe<00:05:35.620> and<00:05:36.159> turn<00:05:36.340> the<00:05:36.669> opacity<00:05:37.240> of<00:05:37.810> that

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
keyframe and turn the opacity of that

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:44.279 
keyframe and turn the opacity of that
layer<00:05:38.940> effect<00:05:39.940> layer<00:05:40.120> opacity<00:05:40.949> to<00:05:41.949> zero<00:05:43.289> do

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.289 
layer effect layer opacity to zero do

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:48.360 
layer effect layer opacity to zero do
the<00:05:44.470> same<00:05:44.680> thing<00:05:46.380> with<00:05:47.380> the<00:05:47.530> effect<00:05:47.860> on<00:05:48.039> track

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
the same thing with the effect on track

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.469 
the same thing with the effect on track
one<00:05:48.729> just<00:05:50.130> it's<00:05:51.130> going<00:05:51.550> to<00:05:51.639> end<00:05:51.820> with<00:05:52.360> an

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
one just it's going to end with an

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:55.200 
one just it's going to end with an
opacity<00:05:52.780> of<00:05:53.259> zero<00:05:53.620> so<00:05:54.340> go<00:05:54.820> to<00:05:54.880> the<00:05:55.060> last

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
opacity of zero so go to the last

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:02.249 
opacity of zero so go to the last
keyframe<00:05:55.539> turn<00:05:56.530> the<00:05:56.680> opacity<00:05:56.949> down<00:06:01.020> now<00:06:02.020> all

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:02.259 
keyframe turn the opacity down now all

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:05.010 
keyframe turn the opacity down now all
you<00:06:02.440> have<00:06:02.470> to<00:06:02.650> do<00:06:03.180> let's<00:06:04.180> render<00:06:04.479> the<00:06:04.810> upper
