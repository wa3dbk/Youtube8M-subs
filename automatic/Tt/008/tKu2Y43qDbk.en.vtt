kind of the main reasons they use these

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.250 
kind of the main reasons they use these
ones<00:00:59.400> so<00:01:00.650> the<00:01:01.650> point<00:01:01.860> of<00:01:01.950> this<00:01:02.010> test<00:01:03.199> it's<00:01:04.199> just

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
ones so the point of this test it's just

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.840 
ones so the point of this test it's just
to<00:01:04.409> give<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.619> an<00:01:04.710> idea<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:05.010> what<00:01:05.159> Wilke<00:01:05.519> sound

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
to give you an idea of what Wilke sound

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.669 
to give you an idea of what Wilke sound
like<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.659> we're<00:01:06.899> going<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.049> do<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.229> bit<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.469> a

00:01:07.669 --> 00:01:07.679 
like so we're going to do a bit of a

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:10.340 
like so we're going to do a bit of a
type<00:01:08.369> test<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:09.509> just<00:01:09.990> want<00:01:10.109> to<00:01:10.170> draw<00:01:10.289> attention

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
type test I just want to draw attention

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.620 
type test I just want to draw attention
as<00:01:10.679> well<00:01:10.829> to<00:01:10.979> well<00:01:11.820> people<00:01:12.000> ask<00:01:12.179> about<00:01:12.329> the

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
as well to well people ask about the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.139 
as well to well people ask about the
kind<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.899> the<00:01:12.960> prints<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.770> keys<00:01:14.039> so<00:01:14.759> you

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
kind of the prints on the keys so you

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:16.730 
kind of the prints on the keys so you
can<00:01:15.299> see<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.509> these<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.810> Muslera<00:01:16.170> tests<00:01:16.530> around

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
can see on these a Muslera tests around

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.340 
can see on these a Muslera tests around
the<00:01:16.859> W<00:01:17.729> snd<00:01:18.149> keys<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.780> some<00:01:19.109> of<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.229> other

the W snd keys and some of the other
keys<00:01:19.530> where<00:01:19.770> they've<00:01:19.890> kind<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.159> rubbed<00:01:20.399> off<00:01:20.609> so

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
keys where they've kind of rubbed off so

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.149 
keys where they've kind of rubbed off so
she<00:01:21.149> compared<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.539> the<00:01:21.600> media<00:01:21.929> keys<00:01:22.159> which

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
she compared to the media keys which

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.330 
she compared to the media keys which
aren't<00:01:23.399> used<00:01:23.490> as<00:01:23.729> much<00:01:24.259> and<00:01:25.259> although<00:01:26.070> they've

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
aren't used as much and although they've

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.660 
aren't used as much and although they've
kind<00:01:26.609> of<00:01:26.759> slightly<00:01:28.189> rubbed<00:01:29.189> off<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.340> little<00:01:29.520> bit

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
kind of slightly rubbed off a little bit

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.249 
kind of slightly rubbed off a little bit
they're<00:01:29.820> still<00:01:30.030> there<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.509> this<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:30.749> after

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
they're still there and this is after

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.520 
they're still there and this is after
about<00:01:31.530> I<00:01:31.829> don't<00:01:32.280> know<00:01:32.399> eight<00:01:32.640> months<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.030> use

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
about I don't know eight months of use

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.160 
about I don't know eight months of use
that's<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.619> good<00:01:34.770> indication<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:35.819> keys<00:01:36.170> and

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
that's a good indication of the keys and

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.289 
that's a good indication of the keys and
what<00:01:37.289> they<00:01:37.380> do<00:01:37.490> so<00:01:38.490> we'll<00:01:38.850> just<00:01:38.969> start<00:01:39.179> off<00:01:39.270> by

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
what they do so we'll just start off by

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.069 
what they do so we'll just start off by
doing<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.960> couple<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.189> light<00:01:41.399> tests<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.869> each

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
doing a couple of light tests on each

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.679 
doing a couple of light tests on each
key<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:44.719> then<00:01:45.719> like<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.929> string<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.350> text<00:01:46.590> and

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
key and then like a string of text and

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.270 
key and then like a string of text and
we<00:01:48.689> can<00:01:48.960> tell<00:01:49.469> the<00:01:49.590> difference<00:01:49.859> between<00:01:49.979> the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
we can tell the difference between the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.260 
we can tell the difference between the
different<00:01:50.520> keys<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:50.789> we'll<00:01:50.909> start<00:01:51.060> with<00:01:51.149> the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
different keys so we'll start with the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:02:10.860 
different keys so we'll start with the
Blues<00:01:51.450> here

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:10.870 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.449 

okay<00:02:11.870> so<00:02:12.560> now<00:02:12.680> we're<00:02:12.830> going<00:02:12.980> to<00:02:13.069> move<00:02:13.190> on<00:02:13.340> to

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
okay so now we're going to move on to

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:36.559 
okay so now we're going to move on to
the<00:02:14.209> brown<00:02:14.420> switches

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.330 

okay<00:02:37.569> and<00:02:37.810> now<00:02:37.930> we're<00:02:38.140> going<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.380> move<00:02:39.190> on<00:02:39.310> to

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
okay and now we're going to move on to

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.760 
okay and now we're going to move on to
the<00:02:39.640> other<00:02:40.000> side<00:02:40.239> to<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.720> chair<00:02:41.290> next<00:02:41.440> blacks

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
the other side to the chair next blacks

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.770 
the other side to the chair next blacks
which<00:02:42.010> is<00:02:43.200> so<00:02:44.200> this<00:02:44.380> side<00:02:44.620> is<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.830> non

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
which is so this side is the non

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.360 
which is so this side is the non
feedback<00:02:46.780> side<00:02:47.080> keyboards<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:47.950> this<00:02:48.069> is<00:02:48.190> the

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
feedback side keyboards and this is the

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.180 
feedback side keyboards and this is the
feedback<00:02:49.150> side<00:02:49.540> so<00:02:50.200> you<00:02:50.260> get<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.650> Blues<00:02:50.860> which

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
feedback side so you get the Blues which

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.860 
feedback side so you get the Blues which
have<00:02:51.340> got<00:02:51.459> the<00:02:51.520> full<00:02:51.700> feedback<00:02:52.300> with<00:02:52.780> the

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
have got the full feedback with the

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.430 
have got the full feedback with the
click<00:02:53.850> Browns<00:02:54.850> are<00:02:55.060> kind<00:02:55.180> of<00:02:55.269> bump<00:02:55.510> and

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
click Browns are kind of bump and

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.370 
click Browns are kind of bump and
they're<00:02:56.590> kind<00:02:56.830> of<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:57.099> good<00:02:57.580> solid<00:02:57.819> feedback

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
they're kind of a good solid feedback

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.520 
they're kind of a good solid feedback
but<00:02:59.380> not<00:02:59.530> as<00:02:59.620> much<00:02:59.709> noise<00:02:59.950> blacks<00:03:00.819> and<00:03:01.150> reds

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
but not as much noise blacks and reds

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.759 
but not as much noise blacks and reds
kind<00:03:02.530> of<00:03:02.650> not<00:03:03.550> really<00:03:03.730> any<00:03:03.910> feedback<00:03:04.209> at<00:03:04.330> all

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
kind of not really any feedback at all

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.309 
kind of not really any feedback at all
and<00:03:05.769> the<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.700> Reds<00:03:06.940> are<00:03:07.180> lighter<00:03:07.420> more<00:03:08.140> much

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
and the the Reds are lighter more much

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.350 
and the the Reds are lighter more much
lighter<00:03:08.590> switch<00:03:08.890> compared<00:03:09.250> to<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.400> black<00:03:09.610> so

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
lighter switch compared to the black so

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:36.350 
lighter switch compared to the black so
we'll<00:03:10.510> just<00:03:10.660> go<00:03:10.750> with<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.959> blacks<00:03:11.350> now

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.890 

okay<00:03:37.360> well<00:03:37.989> now<00:03:38.440> finally<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.430> chair<00:03:40.390> mix<00:03:40.599> red

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
okay well now finally the chair mix red

00:03:40.900 --> 00:04:07.410 
okay well now finally the chair mix red
switches<00:03:41.260> on<00:03:41.470> this<00:03:41.650> case<00:03:41.860> 60<00:04:06.299> so<00:04:07.299> that's

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
switches on this case 60 so that's

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.020 
switches on this case 60 so that's
pretty<00:04:07.690> much<00:04:07.870> I<00:04:08.230> think<00:04:09.010> what<00:04:09.400> most<00:04:09.760> people

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
pretty much I think what most people

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.119 
pretty much I think what most people
were<00:04:10.150> interested<00:04:10.420> in<00:04:10.690> the<00:04:10.840> hearing<00:04:11.290> the

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
were interested in the hearing the

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:14.789 
were interested in the hearing the
different<00:04:12.430> switch<00:04:12.970> types<00:04:13.299> you<00:04:13.989> can<00:04:14.230> see<00:04:14.440> on<00:04:14.590> on

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
different switch types you can see on on

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:18.240 
different switch types you can see on on
all<00:04:14.920> the<00:04:15.040> keyboards<00:04:15.489> the<00:04:16.769> the<00:04:17.769> spacebar

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
all the keyboards the the spacebar

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.490 
all the keyboards the the spacebar
definitely<00:04:18.639> has<00:04:18.760> a<00:04:18.789> different<00:04:19.239> kind<00:04:20.139> of<00:04:20.289> feel

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
definitely has a different kind of feel

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:28.050 
definitely has a different kind of feel
and<00:04:20.919> sound<00:04:21.459> so<00:04:22.360> if<00:04:22.419> you<00:04:22.539> over<00:04:22.630> the<00:04:22.780> blue<00:04:26.700> so<00:04:27.700> you

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
and sound so if you over the blue so you

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.640 
and sound so if you over the blue so you
can<00:04:28.240> hear<00:04:28.360> the<00:04:28.450> difference<00:04:28.690> is<00:04:28.810> there<00:04:28.990> and<00:04:29.200> a

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
can hear the difference is there and a

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:30.570 
can hear the difference is there and a
lot<00:04:29.740> of<00:04:29.830> people<00:04:30.039> obviously<00:04:30.130> you're<00:04:30.400> going<00:04:30.520> to

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
lot of people obviously you're going to

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.100 
lot of people obviously you're going to
use<00:04:30.700> them<00:04:30.820> at<00:04:30.910> spacebar<00:04:31.300> a<00:04:31.330> lot<00:04:31.539> if<00:04:31.780> you<00:04:31.870> can<00:04:31.960> do

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
use them at spacebar a lot if you can do

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.969 
use them at spacebar a lot if you can do
typing<00:04:32.650> so<00:04:33.060> yeah<00:04:34.060> the<00:04:34.560> different<00:04:35.560> keys<00:04:35.740> will

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
typing so yeah the different keys will

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:38.219 
typing so yeah the different keys will
obviously<00:04:36.190> be<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.960> different

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
obviously be the different

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:41.400 
obviously be the different
implementation<00:04:38.889> of<00:04:39.130> the<00:04:39.310> switch<00:04:39.520> and<00:04:39.760> and<00:04:40.410> the

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
implementation of the switch and and the

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.800 
implementation of the switch and and the
metal<00:04:42.130> brace<00:04:42.340> on<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:42.639> Neath<00:04:42.760> the<00:04:42.789> key<00:04:43.090> but

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
metal brace on the Neath the key but

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.870 
metal brace on the Neath the key but
hopefully<00:04:44.080> that's<00:04:44.200> a<00:04:44.289> video<00:04:44.800> showing<00:04:45.310> you<00:04:45.580> the

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
hopefully that's a video showing you the

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.390 
hopefully that's a video showing you the
different<00:04:46.150> types<00:04:46.180> of<00:04:46.479> switch<00:04:46.950> how<00:04:47.950> they<00:04:48.099> sound

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
different types of switch how they sound

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.700 
different types of switch how they sound
and<00:04:49.260> hopefully<00:04:50.669> what's<00:04:51.669> best<00:04:52.120> for<00:04:52.240> you<00:04:52.710> have

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
and hopefully what's best for you have

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.350 
and hopefully what's best for you have
this<00:04:53.860> is<00:04:54.039> kind<00:04:54.220> of<00:04:54.250> showed<00:04:54.490> that<00:04:54.789> the<00:04:55.060> reds<00:04:55.270> are

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
this is kind of showed that the reds are

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.520 
this is kind of showed that the reds are
kind<00:04:55.570> of<00:04:55.599> in<00:04:55.780> my<00:04:55.810> opinion<00:04:55.960> are<00:04:56.260> kind<00:04:56.410> of<00:04:56.440> the

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
kind of in my opinion are kind of the

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.230 
kind of in my opinion are kind of the
quietest<00:04:56.950> if<00:04:57.250> you<00:04:57.490> can<00:04:57.639> say<00:04:57.820> that<00:04:58.000> I<00:04:58.030> mean<00:04:58.120> all

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
quietest if you can say that I mean all

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.279 
quietest if you can say that I mean all
mechanical<00:04:58.690> switches<00:04:58.840> are<00:04:58.990> going<00:04:59.110> to<00:04:59.169> make

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 
mechanical switches are going to make

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.219 
mechanical switches are going to make
new<00:04:59.440> is<00:05:00.330> the<00:05:01.330> fact<00:05:01.570> is<00:05:01.720> the<00:05:01.870> Blues<00:05:02.050> are<00:05:02.200> the

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
new is the fact is the Blues are the

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.200 
new is the fact is the Blues are the
loudest<00:05:02.380> and<00:05:02.950> it's<00:05:03.729> kind<00:05:03.910> of<00:05:03.940> irrelevant

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
loudest and it's kind of irrelevant

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.570 
loudest and it's kind of irrelevant
really<00:05:05.010> you<00:05:06.010> know<00:05:06.099> they're<00:05:06.250> all<00:05:06.400> going<00:05:06.490> to

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
really you know they're all going to

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.860 
really you know they're all going to
make<00:05:06.669> some<00:05:07.389> noise<00:05:08.490> the<00:05:09.490> brown<00:05:09.729> is<00:05:09.970> probably<00:05:10.300> in

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
make some noise the brown is probably in

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.500 
make some noise the brown is probably in
my<00:05:10.900> opinion<00:05:11.130> one<00:05:12.130> of<00:05:12.160> the<00:05:12.280> would<00:05:13.150> be<00:05:13.180> a<00:05:13.300> good

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
my opinion one of the would be a good

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.480 
my opinion one of the would be a good
interim<00:05:14.010> keyboard<00:05:15.010> if<00:05:15.070> you<00:05:15.160> know<00:05:15.310> use

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
interim keyboard if you know use

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.779 
interim keyboard if you know use
mechanical<00:05:16.410> but<00:05:17.410> reds<00:05:18.130> are<00:05:18.310> kind<00:05:18.490> of<00:05:18.580> the<00:05:18.639> hot

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
mechanical but reds are kind of the hot

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:19.830 
mechanical but reds are kind of the hot
new<00:05:18.820> thing<00:05:18.940> the<00:05:19.240> moment<00:05:19.419> they're<00:05:19.720> a<00:05:19.750> little

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
new thing the moment they're a little

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.360 
new thing the moment they're a little
bit<00:05:19.990> more<00:05:20.139> expensive<00:05:20.380> to<00:05:20.860> put<00:05:21.010> me<00:05:21.130> the<00:05:21.250> red

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
bit more expensive to put me the red

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.770 
bit more expensive to put me the red
switches<00:05:21.610> because<00:05:21.970> they<00:05:22.150> do<00:05:22.210> cost<00:05:22.539> more<00:05:22.720> for

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
switches because they do cost more for

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.640 
switches because they do cost more for
the<00:05:22.990> manufacturers<00:05:23.530> to<00:05:23.560> produce<00:05:24.330> and<00:05:25.500> this<00:05:26.500> is

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
the manufacturers to produce and this is

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.680 
the manufacturers to produce and this is
