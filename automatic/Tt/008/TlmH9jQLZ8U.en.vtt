saw<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.090> was<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.300> first<00:00:42.510> thing<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.690> was<00:00:42.780> using

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
saw that was the first thing I was using

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.690 
saw that was the first thing I was using
a<00:00:43.170> bit<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.469> sweaty<00:00:43.860> premier<00:00:44.340> league<00:00:44.460> team

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
a bit of a sweaty premier league team

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.459 
a bit of a sweaty premier league team
I'm<00:00:44.910> look<00:00:45.600> at<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:45.780> nice<00:00:45.960> little<00:00:46.079> control

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
I'm look at that nice little control

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.049 
I'm look at that nice little control
from<00:00:46.590> Ramires<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.190> then<00:00:47.309> backs<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.940> off

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
from Ramires and then backs it off

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.910 
from Ramires and then backs it off
straight<00:00:48.750> for<00:00:48.930> Daniel<00:00:49.200> Sturridge<00:00:49.469> for<00:00:49.770> the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
straight for Daniel Sturridge for the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.340 
straight for Daniel Sturridge for the
sweaty<00:00:50.550> ish<00:00:50.879> kind<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.329> goal<00:00:51.510> or<00:00:51.809> point<00:00:52.199> of<00:00:52.289> the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
sweaty ish kind of goal or point of the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.740 
sweaty ish kind of goal or point of the
series<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.160> basically<00:00:53.520> what<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.120> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
series so basically what it is is the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.479 
series so basically what it is is the
team<00:00:54.960> has<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.260> be<00:00:55.379> under<00:00:55.680> 100k<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:58.340> you<00:00:59.340> have

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
team has to be under 100k and you have

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.099 
team has to be under 100k and you have
to<00:00:59.640> have<00:00:59.789> as<00:01:00.030> if<00:01:00.239> they<00:01:00.329> make<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.539> as<00:01:00.629> sweaty<00:01:00.960> as

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
to have as if they make it as sweaty as

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.039 
to have as if they make it as sweaty as
you<00:01:01.260> can<00:01:01.440> but<00:01:01.620> that's<00:01:01.770> not<00:01:02.010> necessarily<00:01:03.049> the

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
you can but that's not necessarily the

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.679 
you can but that's not necessarily the
point<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.920> has<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.280> be<00:01:05.309> under<00:01:05.519> 100k<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.420> can<00:01:06.600> be

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
point it has to be under 100k it can be

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.719 
point it has to be under 100k it can be
beastly<00:01:07.140> which<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.680> nothing<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.490> do<00:01:08.580> with

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
beastly which is nothing to do with

sweat that's how I keep the word beast
in<00:01:11.340> my<00:01:11.490> mind<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:12.270> can<00:01:12.510> be<00:01:12.659> like<00:01:12.890> you<00:01:13.890> know<00:01:13.920> when

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
in my mind it can be like you know when

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.620 
in my mind it can be like you know when
you<00:01:14.250> think<00:01:14.280> sweat<00:01:14.640> you're<00:01:14.790> thinking<00:01:15.030> Pacey<00:01:15.330> or

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.520 
you think sweat you're thinking Pacey or
something<00:01:15.840> like<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:15.960> doesn't<00:01:16.229> have<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.439> be

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
something like that doesn't have to be

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.710 
something like that doesn't have to be
anything<00:01:17.040> beastly<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.640> can<00:01:17.790> be<00:01:17.939> like<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.299> most

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
anything beastly it can be like the most

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.270 
anything beastly it can be like the most
slowest<00:01:19.200> team<00:01:19.350> in<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.560> world<00:01:19.740> but<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.159> could

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
slowest team in the world but it could

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.310 
slowest team in the world but it could
be<00:01:20.400> beastly<00:01:20.700> or<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.390> could<00:01:21.570> move<00:01:21.720> for<00:01:21.990> more<00:01:22.229> of

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
be beastly or you could move for more of

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.960 
be beastly or you could move for more of
a<00:01:22.409> sweat<00:01:22.650> team<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.950> have<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.070> really<00:01:23.340> Pacey

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
a sweat team and have a really Pacey

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.740 
a sweat team and have a really Pacey
team<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:25.460> then<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.580> can<00:01:26.729> just<00:01:26.850> have<00:01:27.060> an<00:01:27.270> Opie

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
team and then you can just have an Opie

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.060 
team and then you can just have an Opie
team<00:01:27.990> which<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.320> combination<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.920> this

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
team which is a combination of this

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.240 
team which is a combination of this
sweat<00:01:29.659> beastliness<00:01:30.659> that's<00:01:31.590> combined<00:01:32.009> with

sweat beastliness that's combined with

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.039 
sweat beastliness that's combined with
overpowered<00:01:32.909> pneus<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.360> makes<00:01:33.509> no<00:01:33.780> sense
