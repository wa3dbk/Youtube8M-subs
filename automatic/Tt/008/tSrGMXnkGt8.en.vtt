00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
they had at the very end about

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.869 
they had at the very end about
doflamingo<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.899> his<00:00:37.050> possible<00:00:37.680> lineage<00:00:38.250> he

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
doflamingo and his possible lineage he

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.180 
doflamingo and his possible lineage he
might<00:00:39.059> actually<00:00:39.239> be<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> celestial<00:00:40.350> dragon<00:00:40.950> or

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
might actually be a celestial dragon or

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.979 
might actually be a celestial dragon or
he<00:00:41.399> might<00:00:41.550> be<00:00:41.730> related<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.390> celestial

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
he might be related to a celestial

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.500 
he might be related to a celestial
dragon<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:43.530> some<00:00:43.800> way<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.789> all<00:00:44.969> sort<00:00:45.420> of

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
dragon in some way and that all sort of

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.670 
dragon in some way and that all sort of
makes<00:00:45.809> sense<00:00:46.050> when<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.379> see<00:00:46.559> how<00:00:46.649> this

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
makes sense when you see how this

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.680 
makes sense when you see how this
episode<00:00:47.250> works<00:00:47.579> because<00:00:48.239> they<00:00:48.360> give<00:00:48.510> us<00:00:48.600> a

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
episode works because they give us a

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.510 
episode works because they give us a
little<00:00:48.809> insight<00:00:49.050> into<00:00:49.710> why<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.920> kingdom<00:00:50.430> is

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
little insight into why the kingdom is

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.700 
little insight into why the kingdom is
not<00:00:50.579> freaking<00:00:51.180> out<00:00:51.270> anymore<00:00:51.600> over<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.500> fact

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
not freaking out anymore over the fact

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.670 
not freaking out anymore over the fact
that<00:00:52.800> doflamingo<00:00:53.190> has<00:00:53.699> left<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.090> throne

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
that doflamingo has left the throne

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.590 
that doflamingo has left the throne
basically<00:00:55.680> cp0<00:00:56.219> arrived<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.270> they<00:00:57.390> actually

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
basically cp0 arrived and they actually

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.110 
basically cp0 arrived and they actually
get<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.170> speak<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:58.739> one<00:00:58.980> dude<00:00:59.219> who<00:00:59.789> has<00:00:59.969> the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
get to speak that one dude who has the

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.760 
get to speak that one dude who has the
white<00:01:00.329> face<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.840> actually<00:01:01.020> thought<00:01:01.379> that<00:01:01.620> was<00:01:01.739> a

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
white face I actually thought that was a

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.410 
white face I actually thought that was a
mask<00:01:02.129> but<00:01:02.460> believe<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.059> or<00:01:03.120> not<00:01:03.239> it's

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
mask but believe it or not it's

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.850 
mask but believe it or not it's
apparently<00:01:03.780> like<00:01:03.989> face<00:01:04.290> painting<00:01:04.619> he's<00:01:04.769> able

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
apparently like face painting he's able

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.080 
apparently like face painting he's able
to<00:01:04.979> talk<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.400> them<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.610> he<00:01:05.700> lets<00:01:05.880> them<00:01:06.030> know

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
guess that makes fujitora the ugly but I

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.789 
guess that makes fujitora the ugly but I
cannot<00:01:45.509> wait<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:45.990> see<00:01:46.320> where<00:01:46.500> this<00:01:46.530> is<00:01:46.680> going

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
cannot wait to see where this is going

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.249 
cannot wait to see where this is going
it's<00:01:47.250> gonna<00:01:47.369> be<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:47.820> fun<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.899> fact<00:01:49.110> that

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
it's gonna be so fun and the fact that

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.859 
it's gonna be so fun and the fact that
freakin<00:01:49.799> doflamingo<00:01:50.579> might<00:01:51.119> be<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.329> celestial

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
dragon makes a lot of sense I guess

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.819 
dragon makes a lot of sense I guess
that's<00:01:53.700> why<00:01:53.790> he<00:01:53.820> was<00:01:54.149> able<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.869> get<00:01:54.960> cp0<00:01:55.470> to

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
that's why he was able to get cp0 to

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.350 
that's why he was able to get cp0 to
come<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.399> island<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.880> everything<00:01:57.240> and

dawned<00:03:17.310> on<00:03:17.430> me<00:03:17.489> in<00:03:17.669> this<00:03:17.760> episode<00:03:18.120> is<00:03:18.540> with<00:03:18.750> all

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
dawned on me in this episode is with all

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.509 
dawned on me in this episode is with all
the<00:03:19.109> new<00:03:19.230> characters<00:03:19.709> they're<00:03:19.919> introducing

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
the new characters they're introducing

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.089 
the new characters they're introducing
there<00:03:21.150> are<00:03:21.329> a<00:03:21.389> lot<00:03:21.900> of<00:03:21.930> new<00:03:22.230> candidates<00:03:22.829> for

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
there are a lot of new candidates for

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:25.430 
there are a lot of new candidates for
the<00:03:23.220> straw<00:03:23.430> hat<00:03:23.639> pirate<00:03:24.060> crew<00:03:24.329> and<00:03:24.599> I<00:03:25.199> think

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
the straw hat pirate crew and I think

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.839 
the straw hat pirate crew and I think
that's<00:03:25.620> something<00:03:25.769> we<00:03:26.250> need<00:03:26.489> to<00:03:26.519> get<00:03:26.669> back

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
that's something we need to get back

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.250 
that's something we need to get back
into<00:03:27.090> because<00:03:27.510> it's<00:03:27.629> been<00:03:27.690> a<00:03:27.750> long<00:03:27.989> time<00:03:28.230> since

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
into because it's been a long time since

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.289 
into because it's been a long time since

images and mouths moving but the

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.470 
images and mouths moving but the
interesting<00:04:52.430> at<00:04:52.700> the<00:04:52.760> beginning<00:04:53.030> with<00:04:53.150> sanji

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
fighting was pretty damn awesome and

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
fighting was pretty damn awesome and
it's<00:04:55.280> pretty<00:04:55.370> obvious<00:04:55.790> we're<00:04:55.910> going<00:04:56.030> to<00:04:56.090> have

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
it's pretty obvious we're going to have

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.790 
it's pretty obvious we're going to have
a<00:04:56.210> really<00:04:56.450> big<00:04:56.720> fight<00:04:56.870> coming<00:04:57.110> so<00:04:57.650> they'll
