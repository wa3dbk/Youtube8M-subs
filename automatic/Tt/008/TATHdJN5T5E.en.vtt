00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:08.220
 it guys okay with you today 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.450
 again I'll talk about a resource 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:15.420
 camera present here on galaxy s 4g 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:19.369
 exclusive of the city ​​in this device that is 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.869
 a world action 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:27.800
 This photo and moderation 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:30.660
 she makes a movement as if the 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.000
 imagining as if it were a 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.489
 photo in slow motion as if it were 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.969
 those effects we see in movies 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.719
 in slow motion but he takes it and 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.480
 take a picture of the movement in action 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.570
 this kind of photo is best made if you 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:53.219
 catch the moving object in the event 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.500
 profile and she will make a 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:59.129
 consequently increasing photos and 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.870
 putting this is the object is sequenced 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.539
 the way he passed in front of the 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.110
 camera and simulates a camera effect 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.060
 slow is very interesting and I went 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.100
 in an avenue close to home enough 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.670
 Many cars are passing by and 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.229
 I went to do a simulation and I'm going to 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.320
 here now in the sequence the video for 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.080
 you see how the resource works 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.689
 and if you have any doubts 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.549
 contact with android look at our 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.590
 comment area like help android 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.920
 What are we going to help with what you 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.350
 who now need to stretch the 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.869
 video I did on the avenue 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.540
 let's find the photo mode now 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.220
 action or choose the mode I will choose 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.520
 action 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.380
 It's a shock in the corner. We're here. 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.710
 on the avenue with many cars passing by 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.330
 I'm going to photograph the passage at that moment. 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.150
 of a car 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.310
 the picture was made process now 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.950
 Image 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.930
 note that it does a sequence in the same 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.330
 photo a sequence of movements where 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.380
 to be thus of points that the car 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:10.310
 passed and makes an assembly with all 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.960
 positions that the car did in that 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.209
 course on that stretch 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.890
 you can do some will look 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.550
 second, but it stimulates a 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.430
 move a moving photo a 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.850
 very interesting resource is also that 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:29.620
 was now included in the no. 4 galaxy with 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.620
 android 4.2.1 2
