00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
speeds it up even more so this is the

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.060 
speeds it up even more so this is the

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
alternative and it's a really good

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.530 
alternative and it's a really good
alternative<00:05:54.610> it's<00:05:54.760> the<00:05:54.940> one<00:05:55.120> that<00:05:55.240> i<00:05:55.330> actually

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:55.540 
alternative it's the one that i actually

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.530 
alternative it's the one that i actually
did<00:05:56.130> about<00:05:57.130> a<00:05:57.160> year<00:05:57.310> and<00:05:57.669> a<00:05:57.729> half<00:05:57.760> ago<00:05:58.090> when<00:05:58.419> i

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:58.540 
did about a year and a half ago when i

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.440 
did about a year and a half ago when i
got<00:05:58.720> my<00:05:58.750> 99<00:05:59.410> herb<00:05:59.620> lore<00:05:59.830> I<00:06:00.280> didn't<00:06:01.060> have<00:06:01.210> the

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 
got my 99 herb lore I didn't have the

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:04.350 
got my 99 herb lore I didn't have the
money<00:06:01.630> to<00:06:01.960> invest<00:06:02.440> in<00:06:02.740> overloads<00:06:03.340> so<00:06:04.030> this<00:06:04.210> was

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
money to invest in overloads so this was

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.190 
money to invest in overloads so this was
the<00:06:04.390> method<00:06:04.690> that<00:06:04.930> I<00:06:05.020> chose<00:06:05.320> to<00:06:05.620> do<00:06:05.820> so<00:06:06.990> this<00:06:07.990> is

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:08.200 
the method that I chose to do so this is

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.380 
the method that I chose to do so this is
maybe<00:06:08.560> the<00:06:08.710> method<00:06:09.190> for<00:06:09.430> schoolers<00:06:09.850> and<00:06:10.150> other

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:10.390 
maybe the method for schoolers and other

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:12.060 
maybe the method for schoolers and other
people<00:06:10.780> that<00:06:10.960> don't<00:06:11.229> have<00:06:11.320> quite<00:06:11.680> as<00:06:11.770> much

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
people that don't have quite as much

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.969 
people that don't have quite as much
money<00:06:12.600> and<00:06:13.600> a<00:06:13.720> few<00:06:13.900> people<00:06:14.320> will<00:06:14.470> probably<00:06:14.650> be

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:14.979 
money and a few people will probably be

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:16.010 
money and a few people will probably be
wondering<00:06:15.370> why<00:06:15.520> i<00:06:15.550> haven't<00:06:15.729> mentioned

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020
