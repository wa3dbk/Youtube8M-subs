00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.670
 Because I eat as a snack, I do not 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.900
 I have a rule of nothing like that. 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.910
 every day i can eat a little 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.000
 different but usually when I 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.279
 I'll give you half a bottle of it. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.119
 or even further down here fasting water 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.580
 same route awarded lives as a fruit 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.920
 finally it's rolling a little until really 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.380
 drink coffee later I drink normal coffee 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.439
 as well as the integral with cheese with 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.960
 coffee even by drinker and in the middle of the 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.600
 morning cm hungry again I with another 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.250
 fruit is usually banana i love banana 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.590
 It's the fruit I prefer, the fruit I 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.930
 I find it more versatile so the banana debate 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.149
 new terminal is hot you eat it 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.700
 pure drivers and mass along with 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.739
 old is a delight if you make music with 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.989
 she is biased is a good fruit 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.960
 So sweet everything you do with 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.420
 she dispenses sugar dispenses 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.340
 finally sweeten a banana in the 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.039
 My lunch feeding my wand 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.229
 many I usually make a grateful ox 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.420
 which can usually be with rice 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.390
 full in case of already have there 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.650
 plenty of time for everything brown rice or 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.770
 When was the last time you ate rice? 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.009
 white is the one can not be a potato 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.110
 for I love you potato in the potato can be 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.600
 by law may be the way I was 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.460
 I love potatoes so no carbohydrate and 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.710
 this makes brown rice usually makes 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.939
 beans I love beans also in beans 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.790
 black or whatever you have and I choose one 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.740
 protein, we generally do not 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.900
 eat meat at home we bought 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.240
 a lot of soy protein that 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.270
 textured protein or we do 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.610
 omelette with eggs or we use meat 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.040
 in the case there we do a lot 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.979
 chicken at home the same breast as you 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.680
 make the steaks and finally grill with a 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.790
 little tv and anyway everyone is very 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.070
 extravagant and day feeding 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.050
 it is a fairly simple rate but 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.020
 fresh natural nutrient and the rest of 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.630
 Dish people fills with big vegetables 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.890
 salads at home can even keep 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.660
 suddenly one day you get to that 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.790
 surprise may even not have ready food 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.130
 but you can look in the refrigerator have a good 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.140
 large salad that we is not 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.360
 without commas we do not have the habit of 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.950
 take nothing while eating that inclusive 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.420
 It's a habit I want to go through. 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.300
 My children I do not want them to have 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.250
 that dependence of the south to eat right 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.650
 so we do not eat do not take anything from 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.450
 a lot of thinking usually focused and 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.440
 I'm in the water even with a bottle 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.330
 each having each one has a 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.700
 so that's usually what the 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.350
 people take if need be I felt 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.780
 willingness to take something during the 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.180
 from there in the middle of the afternoon I 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.220
 like something to train then in the 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.470
 mid-afternoon button really intends 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.570
 I make a small meal as if 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.520
 It was an afternoon coffee and up to 200 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.340
 calories that I like the most 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.340
 training is half learn the skim with 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.930
 fruit and a little grain is what I 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.480
 tomo is usually one more meal 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.060
 Cheap cockroach because that's one thing. 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.269
 I cherish a lot during the training does not 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.250
 as nothing that the workout is fast then the 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.680
 12 I do it during training and I 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.930
 hydrate like crazy I take a 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.510
 normal workout a bottle of water 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.340
 Then the way was to get colder and here 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.080
 has 750 ml 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.120
 so in this car we breathe 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.640
 very naturally then there is a loss 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.230
 liquid there then you have to 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.739
 replace the liquid that comes out naturally 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.900
 with sweat and also the sweat of training is that 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.790
 It's an intense sweat so I always have 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.709
 the concern to hydrate me a lot 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.780
 during training after training and 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.549
 took a shower and then I go to the 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.540
 cook prepare one and I liked one 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:39.850
 small meal 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.130
 usually I eat a small portion of the 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.750
 which I eat at lunchtime because the lunch 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.940
 it is by itself a very 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.709
 balanced after training as needed 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.810
 of a little carbohydrate protein 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.120
 bit of everything to replace and to 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.690
 help a century recover I do 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.130
 a small meal of the 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.870
 I ate at lunch and we'll put a 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.060
 a little of that carbohydrate 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.310
 bit of the guinea of â€‹â€‹that greenery and 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.400
 a slightly larger amount of protein 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.040
 which can be a month with three clearings can 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.500
 be very respectful at all. 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.510
 that day, not having that one 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.940
 lunch so I can say it again he does not 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.700
 I can practice, I simply do 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.739
 two eggs cooked one toast 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.810
 Finally, I always try 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.880
 to balance this protein thing 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.700
 carbohydrate with the vegetable this is my 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.710
 night worry if you have food from 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.350
 I'm going to have dinner, I'm in the class that 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.660
 had dinner from the group that prefers or 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.730
 hunger than talking I will not go 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.380
 the whole night pinching and opening the 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.380
 refrigerator a thousand times to see what you have 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:42.020
 To comment, dinner killed my hunger. 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.610
 hence in the middle of the night he before bedtime 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.170
 if we go lets go with fruits 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.510
 we always face as a result of 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:49.510
 then intervals the banana and arrives
