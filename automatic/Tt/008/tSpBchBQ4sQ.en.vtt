need<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.840> wide<00:01:52.259> viewing<00:01:52.710> angle<00:01:53.009> so<00:01:53.130> that

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
need a wide viewing angle so that

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.830 
need a wide viewing angle so that
everybody<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.790> room<00:01:53.820> gets<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.659> same

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
everybody in the room gets the same

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.080 
everybody in the room gets the same
picture<00:01:55.170> quality<00:01:55.500> again<00:01:55.649> this<00:01:56.130> LG<00:01:56.729> actually

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
picture quality again this LG actually

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.740 
picture quality again this LG actually
features<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.600> true<00:01:58.759> 178<00:01:59.759> degree<00:02:00.210> viewing<00:02:00.509> angle

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
features a true 178 degree viewing angle

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.429 
features a true 178 degree viewing angle
okay

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
okay

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.620 
okay
still<00:02:01.829> giving<00:02:02.159> inconsistent<00:02:02.939> contrast<00:02:03.450> and

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
still giving inconsistent contrast and

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.999 
still giving inconsistent contrast and
color<00:02:03.960> throughout<00:02:04.320> even<00:02:04.590> if<00:02:04.770> you're<00:02:04.860> sitting

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
at the most extreme angles everybody's

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.369 
at the most extreme angles everybody's
getting<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.649> same<00:02:07.890> picture<00:02:08.580> now<00:02:09.000> LG<00:02:09.660> also<00:02:10.259> has

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
getting the same picture now LG also has

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.290 
getting the same picture now LG also has
what<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.649> called<00:02:10.679> super<00:02:11.220> IPS<00:02:11.459> technology

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
what is called super IPS technology

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.490 
what is called super IPS technology
which

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
which

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.260 
which
she<00:02:13.590> reduces<00:02:14.220> common<00:02:14.580> distortion<00:02:15.090> and

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
she reduces common distortion and

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.650 
she reduces common distortion and
blurring<00:02:15.660> course<00:02:16.500> by<00:02:16.740> fast<00:02:17.550> motion<00:02:18.360> video

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
blurring course by fast motion video

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.530 
blurring course by fast motion video
like<00:02:18.900> fish<00:02:19.440> with<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:20.430> ability<00:02:20.820> to<00:02:20.850> talk<00:02:21.150> for

like fish with the ability to talk for
some<00:02:21.660> reason<00:02:21.690> okay<00:02:22.140> now<00:02:22.590> let's<00:02:22.800> talk<00:02:22.950> about

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
some reason okay now let's talk about

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.920 
some reason okay now let's talk about
LG's<00:02:23.490> X<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.940> engine<00:02:24.390> I<00:02:24.480> mentioned<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:24.840> earlier

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
inches okay now let's check out all the

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.900 
inches okay now let's check out all the
options<00:04:22.020> in<00:04:22.410> terms<00:04:22.590> of<00:04:22.770> connectivity<00:04:23.130> okay

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
options in terms of connectivity okay

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.400 
options in terms of connectivity okay
it's<00:04:24.030> certainly<00:04:24.270> a<00:04:24.390> lot<00:04:24.630> of<00:04:24.750> options<00:04:24.930> in<00:04:25.200> terms

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
it's certainly a lot of options in terms

it's certainly a lot of options in terms
of<00:04:25.500> connectivity<00:04:25.830> let's<00:04:26.190> take<00:04:26.280> a<00:04:26.370> closer<00:04:26.610> look

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
of connectivity let's take a closer look

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:27.290 
of connectivity let's take a closer look
over<00:04:27.060> here

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
over here

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.180 
over here
on<00:04:27.360> the<00:04:27.599> left<00:04:27.780> hand<00:04:28.020> side<00:04:28.169> check<00:04:28.379> that<00:04:28.560> out<00:04:28.860> you

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
on the left hand side check that out you

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.790 
on the left hand side check that out you
got<00:04:29.340> three<00:04:29.699> HDMI<00:04:30.360> inputs<00:04:30.750> okay<00:04:31.169> so<00:04:31.379> that<00:04:31.650> means

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
got three HDMI inputs okay so that means

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.589 
got three HDMI inputs okay so that means
it's<00:04:32.039> a<00:04:32.099> single<00:04:32.430> cable<00:04:32.580> connection<00:04:33.060> for<00:04:33.449> both

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:33.599 
it's a single cable connection for both

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:35.510 
it's a single cable connection for both
your<00:04:33.780> audio<00:04:34.080> and<00:04:34.229> video<00:04:34.470> for<00:04:35.009> your<00:04:35.129> high-def

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
your audio and video for your high-def

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.850 
your audio and video for your high-def
content<00:04:36.000> in<00:04:36.090> this<00:04:36.210> three<00:04:36.930> of<00:04:37.169> them<00:04:37.560> that's

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
content in this three of them that's

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.740 
content in this three of them that's
pretty<00:04:38.099> cool<00:04:38.310> now<00:04:38.520> if<00:04:39.030> you<00:04:39.120> want<00:04:39.270> to<00:04:39.360> go<00:04:39.449> crazy

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
let's pan across to the right at the

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.649 
let's pan across to the right at the

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:57.509 
you look up your cable you can do that

00:04:57.509 --> 00:04:59.719 
you look up your cable you can do that
also<00:04:58.110> because<00:04:58.409> this<00:04:58.710> has<00:04:58.830> an<00:04:58.949> ATSC<00:04:59.400> as<00:04:59.490> well<00:04:59.639> as
