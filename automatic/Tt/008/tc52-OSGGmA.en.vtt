can<00:00:28.920> even<00:00:29.099> do<00:00:29.340> two<00:00:29.580> which<00:00:29.939> adds<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.570> third<00:00:30.599> AI

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
can even do two which adds a third AI

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.690 
can even do two which adds a third AI
player<00:00:31.439> which<00:00:31.619> seems<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.949> little<00:00:32.040> silly<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.550> do

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.660 
there's a few polish areas that are
definitely<00:03:33.510> needed<00:03:33.770> that<00:03:34.770> being<00:03:35.100> said<00:03:35.400> this

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
definitely needed that being said this

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.550 
definitely needed that being said this
time<00:03:35.910> around<00:03:36.150> they<00:03:36.330> have<00:03:36.480> definitely<00:03:36.720> taken<00:03:37.260> a

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
time around they have definitely taken a

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.360 
time around they have definitely taken a
lot<00:03:37.740> of<00:03:37.770> thought<00:03:38.070> into<00:03:38.360> focusing<00:03:39.360> on<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:40.770> UI

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
lot of thought into focusing on the UI

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.940 
lot of thought into focusing on the UI
of<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:42.030> game<00:03:42.210> the<00:03:42.960> UI<00:03:43.080> changes<00:03:43.740> whether

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
of the game the UI changes whether

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.410 
of the game the UI changes whether
you're<00:03:44.220> on<00:03:44.310> an<00:03:44.460> iPhone<00:03:44.580> whether<00:03:45.210> you're

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
you're on an iPhone whether you're

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.690 
you're on an iPhone whether you're
vertical<00:03:45.960> or<00:03:46.200> horizontal<00:03:46.280> and<00:03:47.280> all<00:03:47.520> these

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
vertical or horizontal and all these

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.920 
vertical or horizontal and all these
little<00:03:47.880> shifts<00:03:48.330> though<00:03:48.480> they<00:03:48.540> don't<00:03:48.720> always

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
little shifts though they don't always

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.740 
little shifts though they don't always
work<00:03:49.200> perfectly<00:03:49.680> are<00:03:50.220> very<00:03:50.610> useful<00:03:51.180> and<00:03:51.420> it

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
work perfectly are very useful and it

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.000 
work perfectly are very useful and it
definitely<00:03:52.140> shows<00:03:52.410> that<00:03:52.440> they<00:03:52.620> put<00:03:52.830> some

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
definitely shows that they put some

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.260 
definitely shows that they put some
thought<00:03:53.220> into<00:03:53.430> how<00:03:53.670> they're<00:03:53.790> presenting<00:03:54.180> the

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
thought into how they're presenting the

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.670 
thought into how they're presenting the
information<00:03:54.780> which<00:03:54.930> I<00:03:55.140> really<00:03:55.410> do<00:03:55.500> not<00:03:55.620> feel

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
information which I really do not feel

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.560 
information which I really do not feel
that<00:03:56.070> in<00:03:56.340> Kingdom<00:03:56.730> builder<00:03:56.940> as<00:03:57.210> you<00:03:57.330> can<00:03:57.450> see

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
that in Kingdom builder as you can see

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.450 
that in Kingdom builder as you can see
everything's<00:03:58.080> oriented<00:03:58.740> towards<00:03:59.040> you<00:03:59.190> you're

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
everything's oriented towards you you're

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.550 
everything's oriented towards you you're
not<00:03:59.640> having<00:03:59.940> to<00:04:00.060> play<00:04:00.600> on<00:04:00.750> some<00:04:00.960> weird<00:04:01.170> edge<00:04:01.380> of

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
not having to play on some weird edge of

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.590 
not having to play on some weird edge of
the<00:04:01.680> board<00:04:01.950> definitely<00:04:02.610> it<00:04:03.240> seems<00:04:03.480> like

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
the board definitely it seems like

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:04.870 
the board definitely it seems like
there's<00:04:03.750> been<00:04:03.870> a<00:04:03.930> lot<00:04:04.080> of<00:04:04.230> thought<00:04:04.410> put<00:04:04.770> into

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
there's been a lot of thought put into

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.090 
there's been a lot of thought put into
the<00:04:05.880> design<00:04:06.060> of<00:04:06.240> the<00:04:06.480> game<00:04:06.780> more<00:04:07.470> than<00:04:07.530> we<00:04:07.920> saw

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
the design of the game more than we saw

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.670 
the design of the game more than we saw
in<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.370> previous<00:04:08.550> queen<00:04:08.970> games<00:04:09.180> title

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
in the previous queen games title

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.530 
in the previous queen games title

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.000 
play Umbra against Aiba I just seem to
be<00:04:14.880> fairly<00:04:15.570> strong<00:04:15.930> the<00:04:16.530> past<00:04:16.710> and<00:04:16.890> play

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
no hidden information in this game so it

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:21.729

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
that way my only concern is the online

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.460 
that way my only concern is the online
play<00:04:24.919> needs<00:04:25.190> a<00:04:25.340> lot<00:04:25.789> of<00:04:25.819> help<00:04:25.940> I<00:04:26.470> understand

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470

play needs a lot of help I understand
the<00:04:27.650> SW<00:04:28.039> was<00:04:28.160> a<00:04:28.190> great<00:04:28.400> tool<00:04:28.610> even<00:04:29.060> one<00:04:29.240> that<00:04:29.389> I

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:29.569 
the SW was a great tool even one that I

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.510 
the SW was a great tool even one that I
use<00:04:29.900> quite<00:04:30.139> a<00:04:30.199> bit<00:04:30.410> but<00:04:30.560> I<00:04:30.620> feel<00:04:30.680> like<00:04:30.979> in<00:04:31.280> terms

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
use quite a bit but I feel like in terms

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.300 
use quite a bit but I feel like in terms
of<00:04:31.759> iOS<00:04:32.210> and<00:04:32.720> also<00:04:33.169> Android<00:04:33.530> there's<00:04:34.069> just<00:04:34.220> so

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:35.620 
of iOS and also Android there's just so
many<00:04:34.400> other<00:04:34.520> options<00:04:34.849> out<00:04:35.120> there<00:04:35.330> that<00:04:35.360> offer

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:40.009 
player choices that I think developers

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:42.370 
player choices that I think developers
should<00:04:40.220> be<00:04:40.370> choosing<00:04:40.819> and<00:04:40.970> exploring<00:04:41.449> so

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
should be choosing and exploring so

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.499 
should be choosing and exploring so

like a lot of the little flourishes
they've<00:04:49.669> added<00:04:50.060> but<00:04:50.569> then<00:04:50.690> again<00:04:50.780> it<00:04:51.259> doesn't

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
they've added but then again it doesn't

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.140 
they've added but then again it doesn't
has<00:04:51.770> a<00:04:51.800> lot<00:04:51.979> of<00:04:52.009> work<00:04:52.250> to<00:04:52.430> live<00:04:52.759> up<00:04:52.910> to<00:04:52.940> the

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
has a lot of work to live up to the

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.089 
has a lot of work to live up to the
other<00:04:53.300> classes<00:04:53.780> on<00:04:53.900> the<00:04:54.020> system<00:04:54.380> but<00:04:54.860> it<00:04:54.949> looks

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099 
other classes on the system but it looks

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:56.559 
other classes on the system but it looks
like<00:04:55.250> a<00:04:55.280> step<00:04:55.550> in<00:04:55.669> the<00:04:55.759> right<00:04:55.909> direction<00:04:55.940> from

00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:56.569 
like a step in the right direction from
