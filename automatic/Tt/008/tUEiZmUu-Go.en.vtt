00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:17.330
 Hi there, it's a clash of clans and this is 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:19.910
 us another tutorial went and how you 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.619
 understood by the name of this video and that 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.140
 hit him with is dedicated to how 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.740
 to determine how many people are playing 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.140
 clash of clans i know what ios 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.410
 device, you can go to the game center and 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.059
 see the date of achievement in 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.519
 clash of clans and that is the very first 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.920
 achievement is an approximate time when you 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:41.510
 started playing the game honestly not 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.559
 I know if I can do the same operation 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.840
 on android 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.700
 but I want to tell you not about it, I 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.100
 I want to tell you about how it is 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.570
 check at all without leaving the game all 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.960
 extremely simple 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.840
 unfortunately calculate the exact date 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.989
 registration of a person in the game basically i 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.030
 I think it is impossible in my opinion but 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.289
 approximate date including plus or 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.680
 minus 1 month 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:08.570
 I think of course one month can 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.149
 there are 30 days a rather large number 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.060
 and it won't be very productive but all 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:16.189
 I still think and the approximate numbers you have 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.799
 will and I think you can do 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:21.350
 certain conclusion due to the development of this 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.860
 Player Well, let's get down to the actual 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.400
 by myself 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:29.329
 computing guys and as you already know or 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:32.659
 you donâ€™t know exactly 24 hours a day 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:34.610
 your villages are three obstacles 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.770
 that is, the obstacle for which you 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.340
 get your own crystals for 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.040
 the task is wonderful and clean in 8 hours 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.610
 there is one obstacle this 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.189
 information from clash of clans century there 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.950
 it is written that in 8 hours appears 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:55.490
 one is obstructing and accordingly we have 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.790
 3 days before 24 hours 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.820
 obstacles actually a month i think 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:05.299
 can be calculated turns 90 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.680
 obstacles and in principle I think from 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.170
 this can be calculated 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.230
 if a person plays more in my opinion 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.970
 three and a half 4 months if he 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.610
 actively cleans cheesecakes then I think in 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.410
 Basically it is possible to calculate the offer in 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.620
 principle to move to global chat and 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.630
 there already start looking for people who 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.580
 can calculate 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.800
 so I found some absolutely 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.860
 random person and let's see 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.190
 we have it at 9 town hall pumping 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.560
 for 9 downtown hula weak 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.350
 the queen is the king is the dragons 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.820
 first-level fires are all pumped on 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.800
 maximum level available 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.550
 unholy archers 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:50.210
 5 here they are 5 barbarian archers 6 and 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:53.750
 Giants and six mortars, too, he 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:57.470
 Level 6 there is even 7 that is pumping 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:01.070
 relatively mean so crossbows too 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.440
 there are 4 dark vaults in principle 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.990
 I think you can throw already approximate 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.590
 numbers and let's look at his statistics 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:12.080
 removed actually 540 obstacles 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.650
 we will divide 540 by 90 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.680
 6 that is, the player plays for about six months 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.970
 plus or minus 1 month as I said so 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.620
 what I think in principle for half a year and if 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.260
 subtract or add 1 month 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.930
 This result is quite justified, I 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.320
 I think here is really about six months 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.720
 base and no more and no less than that is 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.520
 principle, I think you understand how this thing 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.740
 calculated let's even take a look at my 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:45.680
 base and see what I have here so 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:49.580
 removed 510 obstacles respectively 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:54.910
 it's about us 5 and a half months 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:58.430
 and this is true I play almost 6 months 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.200
 almost half a year my village that is like 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.490
 see it really started me 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:08.600
 play at the end of March about 29 somewhere 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:11.720
 March I started to play and as you can see in 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.240
 In principle, the result does not lie and for this 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.480
 statistics can be calm i think 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.340
 calculate how much a person plays in 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.440
 In principle, I hope that this is all for you 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.700
 helped 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.980
 perhaps you knew this cop method 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.980
 Perhaps you did not know him method is not particularly 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.440
 reliably but by eye can be as they say 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.020
 calculate in principle I think that's all 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:35.300
 thanks guys for watching the action 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.510
 that this method will help you all thanks 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.960
 all yes 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.960
 new meetings
