00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
lessons that I feel we can learn from

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.320 
lessons that I feel we can learn from
modern<00:00:10.950> warfare<00:00:11.130> 2<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.730> help<00:00:11.880> us<00:00:12.000> create<00:00:12.240> a

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
modern warfare 2 to help us create a

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.839 
modern warfare 2 to help us create a
better<00:00:12.599> call<00:00:12.929> of<00:00:13.049> duty<00:00:13.320> game<00:00:13.559> i<00:00:13.799> am<00:00:14.340> going<00:00:14.790> to

better call of duty game i am going to

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.580 
better call of duty game i am going to
be<00:00:14.969> focusing<00:00:15.120> on<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.660> positive<00:00:16.199> things<00:00:16.440> that

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
be focusing on the positive things that

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.870 
be focusing on the positive things that
we<00:00:16.680> can<00:00:16.859> learn<00:00:16.949> from<00:00:17.010> auto<00:00:17.340> warfare<00:00:17.699> through

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
we can learn from auto warfare through

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.480 
we can learn from auto warfare through
modern<00:00:18.600> warfare<00:00:18.779> 2<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.980> things<00:00:20.160> they<00:00:20.310> did

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
modern warfare 2 so the things they did

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.010 
modern warfare 2 so the things they did
right<00:00:20.760> rather<00:00:21.210> than<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.600> things<00:00:21.810> they<00:00:21.960> did

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
right rather than the things they did

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.230 
right rather than the things they did
wrong<00:00:22.260> because<00:00:22.560> yes<00:00:22.920> i<00:00:23.130> am<00:00:23.189> fully<00:00:23.670> aware<00:00:23.970> there

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
wrong because yes i am fully aware there

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.029 
wrong because yes i am fully aware there
are<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.539> ton<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:24.960> issues<00:00:25.500> with<00:00:25.529> modern<00:00:25.890> warfare

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
are a ton of issues with modern warfare

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.179 
are a ton of issues with modern warfare
2<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:27.060> most<00:00:27.300> notable<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.900> that<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.710> one

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
2 the most notable of that is the one

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.460 
2 the most notable of that is the one
man<00:00:29.369> army<00:00:29.580> Danger<00:00:30.090> Close<00:00:30.119> noob<00:00:30.599> tubes<00:00:30.869> that

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
man army Danger Close noob tubes that

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.959 
man army Danger Close noob tubes that
pretty<00:00:31.920> much<00:00:32.070> completely<00:00:32.430> ruined<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.820> game

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
pretty much completely ruined the game

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.750 
pretty much completely ruined the game
but<00:00:33.210> I'm<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.600> focus<00:00:33.750> on<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.170> positives

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
but I'm going to focus on the positives

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.950 
but I'm going to focus on the positives
so<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.910> game<00:00:36.059> player<00:00:36.210> watching<00:00:36.480> here<00:00:36.840> is

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
so the game player watching here is

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.660 
so the game player watching here is
actually<00:00:37.140> my<00:00:37.410> very<00:00:37.469> first<00:00:38.070> game<00:00:38.309> back<00:00:38.610> to

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
actually my very first game back to

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.290 
actually my very first game back to
modern<00:00:39.660> warfare<00:00:39.690> 2<00:00:40.170> since<00:00:40.980> before<00:00:41.579> black<00:00:42.059> ops

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
modern warfare 2 since before black ops

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.510 
modern warfare 2 since before black ops
1<00:00:42.420> actually<00:00:43.200> when<00:00:43.379> black<00:00:43.620> ops<00:00:43.770> 1<00:00:43.890> released<00:00:44.309> I

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
1 actually when black ops 1 released I

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.700 
1 actually when black ops 1 released I
never<00:00:44.850> touched<00:00:45.210> modern<00:00:45.660> warfare<00:00:45.840> 2<00:00:46.110> again<00:00:46.469> and

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
never touched modern warfare 2 again and

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.350 
never touched modern warfare 2 again and
that's<00:00:47.250> just<00:00:47.340> simply<00:00:47.700> because<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.090> switched

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
that's just simply because I switched

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.630 
that's just simply because I switched
over<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.719> xbox<00:00:49.170> 360<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.739> didn't<00:00:50.460> own

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
over to the xbox 360 and didn't own

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.910 
over to the xbox 360 and didn't own
black<00:00:50.910> ops<00:00:51.090> or<00:00:51.390> modern<00:00:51.899> warfare<00:00:52.050> two<00:00:52.410> for<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
black ops or modern warfare two for the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.520 
black ops or modern warfare two for the
360<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.910> did<00:00:54.449> find<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.719> used<00:00:54.899> copy<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.260> picked

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
360 so I did find a used copy I picked

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.470 
360 so I did find a used copy I picked
it<00:00:55.620> up<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.250> was<00:00:56.430> my<00:00:56.550> very<00:00:56.879> first<00:00:57.239> game

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
it up and this was my very first game

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.020 
it up and this was my very first game
back<00:00:57.750> after<00:00:58.020> however<00:00:58.890> many<00:00:59.129> years<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.760> is

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
back after however many years that is

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.790 
back after however many years that is
and<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.809> think<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:01.050> did<00:01:01.199> pretty<00:01:01.230> decent

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
and I think I did pretty decent

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.470 
and I think I did pretty decent
especially<00:01:02.160> considering<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:03.090> fact<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.390> I

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
especially considering the fact that I

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.820 
especially considering the fact that I
think<00:01:03.750> there<00:01:03.899> was<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.049> hacker<00:01:04.320> on<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.710> other

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
think there was a hacker on the other

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.100 
think there was a hacker on the other
team<00:01:05.129> he<00:01:05.909> didn't<00:01:06.150> have<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.270> prestige<00:01:06.720> emblem

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
team he didn't have a prestige emblem

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.140 
team he didn't have a prestige emblem
and<00:01:07.229> there<00:01:07.590> were<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:08.010> whole<00:01:08.460> lot<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.820> chopper

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
and there were a whole lot of chopper

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.550 
and there were a whole lot of chopper
gunners<00:01:09.390> going<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.750> this<00:01:09.900> game<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.350> was<00:01:10.530> a

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
gunners going on this game so I was a

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.070 
gunners going on this game so I was a
little<00:01:10.650> bit<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.850> little<00:01:11.970> bit<00:01:12.299> worried<00:01:12.869> about

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
little bit a little bit worried about

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.539 
little bit a little bit worried about
that<00:01:13.260> i'm<00:01:13.409> pretty<00:01:13.619> sure<00:01:13.799> somebody<00:01:14.310> on<00:01:14.460> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
that i'm pretty sure somebody on the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.760 
that i'm pretty sure somebody on the
other<00:01:14.580> team<00:01:14.909> was<00:01:15.030> hacking<00:01:15.299> but<00:01:16.170> i<00:01:16.380> still<00:01:16.619> did

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
other team was hacking but i still did

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.740 
other team was hacking but i still did
alright<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.400> there<00:01:18.150> were<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.299> few<00:01:18.570> other

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
alright and there were a few other

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.240 
alright and there were a few other
issues<00:01:19.229> like<00:01:19.320> with<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.619> predator<00:01:19.920> missiles

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
issues like with the predator missiles

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.620 
issues like with the predator missiles
but<00:01:20.460> that's<00:01:20.939> enough<00:01:21.150> about<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.450> gameplay

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
but that's enough about the gameplay

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.420 
but that's enough about the gameplay
this<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.110> my<00:01:22.229> very<00:01:22.290> first<00:01:22.770> game<00:01:23.040> back<00:01:23.220> I'm

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
this is my very first game back I'm

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.480 
this is my very first game back I'm
literally<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.850> level<00:01:24.150> one<00:01:24.360> here<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.189> yeah<00:01:26.189> so

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
literally a level one here and yeah so

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.859 
literally a level one here and yeah so
now<00:01:26.640> let's<00:01:26.820> get<00:01:26.970> into<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.270> topic<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.659> want<00:01:27.810> to

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
now let's get into the topic I want to

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.920 
now let's get into the topic I want to
talk<00:01:28.020> about<00:01:28.670> so<00:01:29.670> one<00:01:30.000> of<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.180> biggest<00:01:30.390> lessons

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
talk about so one of the biggest lessons

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.359 
talk about so one of the biggest lessons
that<00:01:31.020> I<00:01:31.049> think<00:01:31.380> we<00:01:31.500> can<00:01:31.619> learn<00:01:31.799> from<00:01:31.860> modern

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
that I think we can learn from modern

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.359 
that I think we can learn from modern
warfare<00:01:32.520> 2<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.119> fun<00:01:33.930> killstreaks<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
warfare 2 is fun killstreaks the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.100 
warfare 2 is fun killstreaks the
killstreaks<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.119> game<00:01:36.329> were<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:36.930> much

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
killstreaks in this game were so much

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.200 
killstreaks in this game were so much
fun<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.500> use<00:01:37.710> from<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.340> predator<00:01:38.850> missle<00:01:39.090> like

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
fun to use from the predator missle like

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.580 
fun to use from the predator missle like
you<00:01:39.299> see<00:01:39.450> me<00:01:39.540> using<00:01:39.689> right<00:01:39.930> now<00:01:39.960> although<00:01:40.320> it

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
you see me using right now although it

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.679 
you see me using right now although it
kind<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:40.979> got<00:01:41.369> stuck<00:01:41.670> because<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.390> think<00:01:42.630> this

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
kind of got stuck because I think this

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:43.609 
kind of got stuck because I think this
had<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.960> do<00:01:43.049> with<00:01:43.079> something<00:01:43.409> with<00:01:43.530> the

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
had to do with something with the

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.499 
had to do with something with the
hacking<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.610> happened<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> couple<00:01:45.000> times<00:01:45.240> in

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
hacking this happened a couple times in

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.200 
hacking this happened a couple times in
the<00:01:45.630> game<00:01:45.840> but<00:01:46.829> they're<00:01:47.159> extremely<00:01:47.670> fun<00:01:48.060> to

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
the game but they're extremely fun to

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.240 
the game but they're extremely fun to
use<00:01:48.450> they're<00:01:48.780> actually<00:01:49.170> user<00:01:49.439> controllable

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
use they're actually user controllable

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.950 
use they're actually user controllable
for<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.060> most<00:01:51.210> part<00:01:51.360> they're<00:01:51.689> actually

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
for the most part they're actually

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.389 
for the most part they're actually
things<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.350> requires<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.920> little<00:01:53.130> bit<00:01:53.280> of

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
things that requires a little bit of

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.580 
things that requires a little bit of
skill<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.880> use<00:01:53.909> or<00:01:54.270> at<00:01:54.329> least<00:01:54.509> some<00:01:55.170> hand-eye

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
skill to use or at least some hand-eye

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.319 
skill to use or at least some hand-eye
coordination<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.280> some<00:01:56.579> sort<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.000> you

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
coordination of some sort and you

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.880 
coordination of some sort and you
actually<00:01:57.479> have<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.840> fun<00:01:58.049> factor<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.530> being<00:01:58.740> to

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
actually have the fun factor of being to

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.289 
actually have the fun factor of being to
use<00:01:59.009> them<00:01:59.189> instead<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.460> just<00:01:59.670> calling<00:01:59.909> them<00:02:00.060> in

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
use them instead of just calling them in

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.719 
use them instead of just calling them in
and<00:02:00.509> they<00:02:00.780> do<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.079> work<00:02:01.229> for<00:02:01.259> you<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:02.490> get<00:02:02.610> to

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
and they do the work for you you get to

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.219 
and they do the work for you you get to
actually<00:02:02.850> use<00:02:03.240> them<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.540> control<00:02:03.810> them<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.200> I

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
actually use them and control them and I

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.310 
actually use them and control them and I
really<00:02:04.560> like<00:02:04.740> that<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.189> do<00:02:05.969> realize<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.930> lot<00:02:07.170> of

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
really like that I do realize a lot of

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.100 
really like that I do realize a lot of
them<00:02:07.439> were<00:02:07.590> definitely<00:02:08.160> overpowered<00:02:08.910> and

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
them were definitely overpowered and

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.050 
them were definitely overpowered and
especially<00:02:10.110> because<00:02:10.770> they<00:02:10.920> stacked<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:11.940> if

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
especially because they stacked so if

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.580 
especially because they stacked so if
you<00:02:12.150> earn<00:02:12.270> harriers<00:02:12.840> those

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
you earn harriers those

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.869 
you earn harriers those
years<00:02:13.800> could<00:02:13.950> earn<00:02:14.099> you<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.220> chopper<00:02:14.550> gunner<00:02:14.580> or

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
years could earn you a chopper gunner or

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.210 
years could earn you a chopper gunner or
something<00:02:15.150> like<00:02:15.239> that<00:02:15.300> but<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.440> still<00:02:16.980> feel

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
something like that but I still feel

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.710 
something like that but I still feel
that<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.550> positives<00:02:18.090> outweigh<00:02:18.569> the

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
that the positives outweigh the

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.680 
that the positives outweigh the
negatives<00:02:19.140> here<00:02:19.430> they<00:02:20.430> are<00:02:20.640> so<00:02:21.120> much<00:02:21.300> fun<00:02:21.510> to

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
negatives here they are so much fun to

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.119 
negatives here they are so much fun to
use<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.200> gave<00:02:22.379> you<00:02:22.500> something<00:02:22.739> worthwhile

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:23.129 
use and it gave you something worthwhile

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:25.790 
use and it gave you something worthwhile
to<00:02:23.670> work<00:02:23.819> towards<00:02:24.239> every<00:02:24.750> single<00:02:25.170> game<00:02:25.349> even

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
to work towards every single game even

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.290 
to work towards every single game even
if<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:25.980> weren't<00:02:26.160> leveling<00:02:26.610> up<00:02:26.730> anymore<00:02:27.000> and

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
if you weren't leveling up anymore and

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.390 
if you weren't leveling up anymore and
you<00:02:27.420> were<00:02:27.569> max<00:02:27.959> prestige<00:02:28.470> or<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:29.040> just<00:02:29.160> simply

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
you were max prestige or you just simply

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.550 
you were max prestige or you just simply
weren't<00:02:29.700> interested<00:02:30.150> in<00:02:30.239> leveling<00:02:30.540> up<00:02:30.720> every

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
weren't interested in leveling up every

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.710 
weren't interested in leveling up every
game<00:02:31.799> you<00:02:31.830> could<00:02:32.099> try<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.340> earn<00:02:32.610> five<00:02:33.239> harrier

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
game you could try and earn five harrier

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.300 
game you could try and earn five harrier
strikes<00:02:34.080> or<00:02:34.230> whatever<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.590> wanted<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:34.890> do<00:02:35.069> or

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
strikes or whatever you wanted to do or

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.100 
strikes or whatever you wanted to do or

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
a chopper gunner or you could try and

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.660 
a chopper gunner or you could try and
earn<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.379> nuke<00:02:37.680> and<00:02:37.890> end<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.220> game<00:02:38.370> and

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
earn that nuke and end the game and

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.430 
earn that nuke and end the game and
basically<00:02:39.150> yeah<00:02:39.420> single-handedly<00:02:40.080> finish

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
basically yeah single-handedly finish

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.460 
basically yeah single-handedly finish
the<00:02:40.590> game<00:02:40.879> so<00:02:41.879> much<00:02:42.090> fun<00:02:42.360> in<00:02:42.629> this<00:02:42.900> game<00:02:43.140> came

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
the game so much fun in this game came

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.289 
the game so much fun in this game came
from<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.799> killstreaks<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.640> i<00:02:44.910> think<00:02:45.150> they

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
from the killstreaks and i think they

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.360 
from the killstreaks and i think they
actually<00:02:45.330> did<00:02:45.840> something<00:02:46.079> very<00:02:46.260> very<00:02:46.950> right

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
actually did something very very right

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.640 
actually did something very very right
with<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.880> killstreaks<00:02:48.360> now<00:02:49.019> of<00:02:49.170> course<00:02:49.349> I

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
with the killstreaks now of course I

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.610 
with the killstreaks now of course I
feel<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:50.040> could<00:02:50.250> be<00:02:50.430> tweaked<00:02:50.880> in<00:02:51.090> future<00:02:51.450> games

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
feel it could be tweaked in future games

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.569 
feel it could be tweaked in future games
for<00:02:52.620> instance<00:02:52.890> i<00:02:53.010> don't<00:02:53.250> think<00:02:53.459> the

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
for instance i don't think the

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.580 
for instance i don't think the
killstreaks<00:02:54.000> should<00:02:54.569> stack<00:02:54.900> if<00:02:55.170> they<00:02:55.319> are<00:02:55.470> as

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
killstreaks should stack if they are as

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.530 
killstreaks should stack if they are as
powerful<00:02:55.860> as<00:02:56.160> they<00:02:56.370> are<00:02:56.549> in<00:02:56.730> modern<00:02:56.970> warfare<00:02:57.120> 2

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
powerful as they are in modern warfare 2

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.530 
powerful as they are in modern warfare 2
that<00:02:58.500> is<00:02:58.739> pretty<00:02:59.519> obvious<00:02:59.670> to<00:03:00.060> me<00:03:00.180> anyways

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
that is pretty obvious to me anyways

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.880 
that is pretty obvious to me anyways
because<00:03:00.720> if<00:03:00.930> you<00:03:01.019> earn<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.170> Harrier<00:03:01.590> strike

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
because if you earn a Harrier strike

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.589 
because if you earn a Harrier strike
almost<00:03:02.430> every<00:03:02.760> time<00:03:02.970> that's<00:03:03.150> going<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.480> earn

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
almost every time that's going to earn

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.059 
almost every time that's going to earn
you<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.750> chopper<00:03:04.110> gunner<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:04.500> then<00:03:04.950> that

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
you a chopper gunner and then that

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
chopper gunner a lot of times will earn

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.449 
chopper gunner a lot of times will earn
you<00:03:06.959> a<00:03:06.989> new<00:03:07.230> or<00:03:07.500> will<00:03:07.950> at<00:03:08.040> least<00:03:08.129> get<00:03:08.310> you

you a new or will at least get you

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.880 
you a new or will at least get you
really<00:03:08.760> close<00:03:08.970> to<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.180> nuke<00:03:09.450> so<00:03:10.290> I<00:03:10.319> feel<00:03:10.680> like

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
really close to a nuke so I feel like

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.740 
really close to a nuke so I feel like
there<00:03:11.340> are<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:11.549> few<00:03:11.819> tweaks<00:03:12.120> it<00:03:12.329> could<00:03:12.480> be<00:03:12.569> done

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
there are a few tweaks it could be done

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.539 
there are a few tweaks it could be done
but<00:03:12.930> the<00:03:13.049> killstreaks<00:03:13.530> themselves<00:03:14.099> were<00:03:14.250> so

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
but the killstreaks themselves were so

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.449 
but the killstreaks themselves were so
much<00:03:14.700> fun<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:15.090> use<00:03:15.299> and<00:03:15.480> I<00:03:15.959> feel<00:03:16.200> like<00:03:16.459> ghosts

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
much fun to use and I feel like ghosts

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.250 
much fun to use and I feel like ghosts
and<00:03:17.700> even<00:03:18.120> some<00:03:18.329> other<00:03:18.450> games<00:03:18.690> like<00:03:18.780> black<00:03:19.019> ops

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
and even some other games like black ops

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
2 kind of Miss that in a few areas yes

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.780 
2 kind of Miss that in a few areas yes
some<00:03:22.680> of<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.859> streets<00:03:23.130> and<00:03:23.250> black<00:03:23.400> ops<00:03:23.609> who

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
some of the streets and black ops who

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.340 
some of the streets and black ops who
were<00:03:23.910> fun<00:03:24.090> to<00:03:24.180> use<00:03:24.389> and<00:03:24.420> maybe<00:03:24.780> a<00:03:24.870> couple<00:03:25.139> you

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
were fun to use and maybe a couple you

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.809 
were fun to use and maybe a couple you
could<00:03:25.500> argue<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:25.920> ghosts<00:03:26.220> were<00:03:26.310> fun<00:03:26.519> to<00:03:26.639> use

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
could argue and ghosts were fun to use

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.180 
could argue and ghosts were fun to use
but<00:03:27.389> none<00:03:27.690> were<00:03:27.870> quite<00:03:28.260> as<00:03:28.410> fun<00:03:28.620> as<00:03:28.829> the

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
but none were quite as fun as the

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.870 
but none were quite as fun as the
killstreaks<00:03:29.670> in<00:03:29.849> this<00:03:30.060> game<00:03:30.269> in<00:03:30.480> my<00:03:30.720> mind<00:03:31.880> so

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
killstreaks in this game in my mind so

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.220 
killstreaks in this game in my mind so
the<00:03:33.000> next<00:03:33.180> thing<00:03:33.299> I<00:03:33.450> want<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:33.660> talk<00:03:33.780> about<00:03:33.840> is

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
the next thing I want to talk about is

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.500 
the next thing I want to talk about is
the<00:03:34.650> balance<00:03:35.310> of<00:03:35.459> gunfights<00:03:36.000> in<00:03:36.180> modern

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
the balance of gunfights in modern

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.629 
the balance of gunfights in modern
warfare<00:03:36.690> 2<00:03:37.049> now<00:03:37.650> I'm<00:03:37.799> not<00:03:37.980> talking<00:03:38.130> about<00:03:38.370> the

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
warfare 2 now I'm not talking about the

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.849 
warfare 2 now I'm not talking about the
things<00:03:38.849> like<00:03:39.239> one<00:03:39.569> man<00:03:39.750> army<00:03:39.930> noob<00:03:40.349> tubes<00:03:40.650> or

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
things like one man army noob tubes or

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:42.920 
things like one man army noob tubes or
any<00:03:41.040> sort<00:03:41.220> of<00:03:41.310> explosives<00:03:42.000> versus<00:03:42.389> a<00:03:42.419> gun<00:03:42.690> or

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
any sort of explosives versus a gun or

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.199 
any sort of explosives versus a gun or
the<00:03:43.530> commando<00:03:44.280> perk<00:03:44.549> or<00:03:44.700> anything<00:03:45.030> like<00:03:45.060> that

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
the commando perk or anything like that

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.900 
the commando perk or anything like that
i'm<00:03:45.540> just<00:03:45.569> hopping<00:03:45.840> talking<00:03:46.500> simply<00:03:46.910> regular

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
i'm just hopping talking simply regular

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.720 
i'm just hopping talking simply regular
gun<00:03:48.090> versus<00:03:48.599> regular<00:03:48.840> gun<00:03:49.260> gun<00:03:49.560> fights<00:03:49.829> I<00:03:50.099> feel

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
gun versus regular gun gun fights I feel

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.210 
gun versus regular gun gun fights I feel
like<00:03:50.880> they<00:03:51.060> were<00:03:51.120> very<00:03:51.599> balanced<00:03:52.200> and<00:03:52.410> a<00:03:53.040> big

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
like they were very balanced and a big

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.729 
like they were very balanced and a big
reason<00:03:53.400> for<00:03:53.579> this<00:03:53.819> is<00:03:54.030> there's<00:03:54.480> no<00:03:54.750> perks<00:03:55.380> that

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
reason for this is there's no perks that

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.229 
reason for this is there's no perks that
reduce<00:03:56.069> the<00:03:56.280> flinch<00:03:56.609> while<00:03:56.940> you're<00:03:57.120> in<00:03:57.180> a

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
reduce the flinch while you're in a

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.659 
reduce the flinch while you're in a
gunfight<00:03:57.480> and<00:03:57.840> they<00:03:58.440> also<00:03:58.620> nailed<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.370> amount

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
gunfight and they also nailed the amount

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:02.479 
gunfight and they also nailed the amount
of<00:03:59.819> flinch<00:04:00.180> in<00:04:00.450> my<00:04:00.599> mind<00:04:00.950> the<00:04:01.950> flinch<00:04:02.250> in

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
of flinch in my mind the flinch in

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.050 
of flinch in my mind the flinch in
ghosts<00:04:03.269> without<00:04:03.750> what<00:04:04.650> is<00:04:04.739> it<00:04:04.829> focus<00:04:05.069> the

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
ghosts without what is it focus the

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.030 
ghosts without what is it focus the
flinch<00:04:06.299> on<00:04:06.450> that<00:04:06.510> is<00:04:06.810> extremely<00:04:07.440> high<00:04:07.739> and<00:04:07.980> it

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
flinch on that is extremely high and it

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.319 
flinch on that is extremely high and it
actually<00:04:08.190> makes<00:04:08.430> it<00:04:08.579> really<00:04:08.790> difficult<00:04:08.880> to

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
actually makes it really difficult to

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.659 
actually makes it really difficult to
win<00:04:09.510> a<00:04:09.540> gunfight<00:04:09.989> if<00:04:10.230> you<00:04:10.650> have<00:04:10.980> or<00:04:11.340> if<00:04:11.400> you

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:11.669 
win a gunfight if you have or if you

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:13.909 
win a gunfight if you have or if you
don't<00:04:11.970> have<00:04:12.180> focus<00:04:12.599> and<00:04:12.780> your<00:04:13.079> enemy<00:04:13.349> does<00:04:13.620> in

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
don't have focus and your enemy does in

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.310 
don't have focus and your enemy does in
modern<00:04:14.790> warfare<00:04:14.940> 2<00:04:15.389> it<00:04:15.630> was<00:04:15.720> a<00:04:15.780> completely

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
modern warfare 2 it was a completely

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.319 
modern warfare 2 it was a completely
level<00:04:16.739> playing<00:04:16.950> field<00:04:17.280> you<00:04:17.489> both<00:04:17.729> flinch<00:04:18.120> the

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
level playing field you both flinch the

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:20.300 
level playing field you both flinch the
same<00:04:18.539> amount<00:04:18.690> and<00:04:19.019> it<00:04:19.169> wasn't<00:04:19.560> too<00:04:19.709> extreme<00:04:20.130> it

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
same amount and it wasn't too extreme it

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.399 
same amount and it wasn't too extreme it
didn't<00:04:20.549> kick<00:04:20.669> you<00:04:20.700> so<00:04:21.090> far<00:04:21.299> off<00:04:21.479> target<00:04:22.140> that

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 
didn't kick you so far off target that

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:24.560 
didn't kick you so far off target that
it<00:04:22.500> was<00:04:22.590> impossible<00:04:23.130> to<00:04:23.159> get<00:04:23.370> your<00:04:23.490> kill<00:04:23.729> but

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
it was impossible to get your kill but

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.730 
it was impossible to get your kill but
at<00:04:24.659> the<00:04:24.780> same<00:04:24.990> time<00:04:25.169> it<00:04:25.440> kicked<00:04:25.620> you<00:04:25.710> off

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
at the same time it kicked you off

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.110 
at the same time it kicked you off
enough<00:04:26.310> that

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
enough that

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.270 
enough that
if<00:04:27.240> you<00:04:27.750> got<00:04:27.900> shot<00:04:28.199> first<00:04:28.470> you<00:04:28.919> were<00:04:29.040> at<00:04:29.250> a

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
if you got shot first you were at a

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.890 
if you got shot first you were at a
little<00:04:29.550> bit<00:04:29.669> of<00:04:29.729> a<00:04:29.820> disadvantage<00:04:30.120> and<00:04:30.600> that's

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
little bit of a disadvantage and that's

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.420 
little bit of a disadvantage and that's
the<00:04:31.169> way<00:04:31.260> it<00:04:31.350> should<00:04:31.410> be<00:04:31.560> you<00:04:31.800> got<00:04:31.949> taken<00:04:32.220> off

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
the way it should be you got taken off

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.820 
the way it should be you got taken off
guard<00:04:32.490> you<00:04:33.240> have<00:04:33.389> a<00:04:33.419> chance<00:04:33.750> but<00:04:34.229> the<00:04:34.530> enemy

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
guard you have a chance but the enemy

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.460 
guard you have a chance but the enemy
does<00:04:34.860> have<00:04:35.190> the<00:04:35.310> advantage<00:04:35.430> and<00:04:36.199> I<00:04:37.199> feel<00:04:37.410> like

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
does have the advantage and I feel like

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.740 
does have the advantage and I feel like
gunfights<00:04:38.190> themselves<00:04:38.699> were<00:04:38.880> very<00:04:39.210> balanced

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
gunfights themselves were very balanced

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.540 
gunfights themselves were very balanced
in<00:04:39.810> this<00:04:39.960> regard<00:04:40.320> I'm<00:04:40.949> not<00:04:41.130> really<00:04:41.250> talking

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
in this regard I'm not really talking

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.860 
in this regard I'm not really talking
about<00:04:41.610> gun<00:04:41.850> balance<00:04:42.180> here<00:04:42.330> either<00:04:42.510> I<00:04:42.780> know

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
about gun balance here either I know

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.110 
about gun balance here either I know
some<00:04:43.260> guns<00:04:43.500> were<00:04:43.650> definitely<00:04:44.100> a<00:04:44.400> little<00:04:44.820> bit

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
some guns were definitely a little bit

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.120 
some guns were definitely a little bit
over<00:04:45.360> on<00:04:45.510> the<00:04:45.720> overpowered<00:04:46.260> side<00:04:46.500> so<00:04:46.800> like<00:04:47.010> the

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
over on the overpowered side so like the

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.000 
over on the overpowered side so like the
ump45<00:04:47.729> that<00:04:48.240> was<00:04:48.419> something<00:04:49.229> that<00:04:49.380> I<00:04:49.740> would

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
ump45 that was something that I would

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.770 
ump45 that was something that I would
actually<00:04:50.130> classify<00:04:50.790> as<00:04:50.940> overpower<00:04:51.419> just

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
actually classify as overpower just

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.230 
actually classify as overpower just
because<00:04:52.080> of<00:04:52.350> its<00:04:52.590> insane<00:04:53.160> range<00:04:53.550> for<00:04:53.850> an<00:04:53.910> SMG

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
because of its insane range for an SMG

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.600 
because of its insane range for an SMG
and<00:04:54.630> it<00:04:55.139> also<00:04:55.260> has<00:04:55.410> all<00:04:55.740> the<00:04:55.889> positive<00:04:56.400> perks

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
and it also has all the positive perks

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.390 
and it also has all the positive perks
of<00:04:56.760> an<00:04:56.850> SMG<00:04:57.210> so<00:04:57.660> not<00:04:58.500> the<00:04:58.620> gun<00:04:58.770> balance<00:04:59.100> itself

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
of an SMG so not the gun balance itself

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.219 
of an SMG so not the gun balance itself
but<00:04:59.669> the<00:04:59.729> gun<00:05:00.150> fights<00:05:00.449> were<00:05:00.720> balanced<00:05:01.110> because

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
but the gun fights were balanced because

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.500 
but the gun fights were balanced because
of<00:05:01.620> that<00:05:01.770> flinch<00:05:02.130> so<00:05:02.310> I<00:05:02.340> feel<00:05:02.760> that<00:05:03.030> futures

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
of that flinch so I feel that futures

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.060 
of that flinch so I feel that futures
call<00:05:03.720> of<00:05:03.840> duty's<00:05:04.139> should<00:05:04.380> follow<00:05:04.650> suit<00:05:04.800> with

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
call of duty's should follow suit with

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.129 
call of duty's should follow suit with
that<00:05:05.340> and<00:05:05.550> they<00:05:06.030> should<00:05:06.210> have<00:05:06.360> a<00:05:06.660> level

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
that and they should have a level

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.060 
that and they should have a level
playing<00:05:07.440> field<00:05:08.160> as<00:05:08.370> far<00:05:08.760> as<00:05:08.910> flinch<00:05:09.240> goes

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
playing field as far as flinch goes

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.590 
playing field as far as flinch goes
another<00:05:11.070> thing<00:05:11.310> i<00:05:11.400> noticed<00:05:11.729> that<00:05:11.910> also

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
another thing i noticed that also

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.090 
another thing i noticed that also
contribute<00:05:12.990> to<00:05:13.110> this<00:05:13.199> balance<00:05:13.590> gun<00:05:13.740> fight<00:05:13.949> is

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
contribute to this balance gun fight is

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.040 
contribute to this balance gun fight is
the<00:05:14.580> connections<00:05:15.120> in<00:05:15.240> this<00:05:15.389> game<00:05:15.630> I<00:05:15.840> don't

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
the connections in this game I don't

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.020 
the connections in this game I don't
know<00:05:16.139> what's<00:05:16.770> up<00:05:16.949> with<00:05:17.070> that<00:05:17.130> but<00:05:17.610> they<00:05:17.850> are

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
know what's up with that but they are

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.640 
know what's up with that but they are
amazing<00:05:18.570> for<00:05:18.690> the<00:05:18.750> most<00:05:18.930> part<00:05:19.050> as<00:05:19.229> you<00:05:19.350> see<00:05:19.500> me

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
amazing for the most part as you see me

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.500 
amazing for the most part as you see me

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
start to get a leg skip but that's my

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.029 
start to get a leg skip but that's my
connection<00:05:21.960> my<00:05:22.080> connection<00:05:22.500> is<00:05:22.530> terrible<00:05:22.740> i

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 
connection my connection is terrible i

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:24.879 
connection my connection is terrible i
get<00:05:23.190> that<00:05:23.310> in<00:05:23.460> every<00:05:23.639> call<00:05:23.940> of<00:05:24.060> duty<00:05:24.330> game<00:05:24.539> and

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
get that in every call of duty game and

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.469 
get that in every call of duty game and
also<00:05:25.889> this<00:05:26.100> is<00:05:26.310> a<00:05:26.340> really<00:05:26.669> old<00:05:26.850> game<00:05:27.150> so<00:05:27.360> there

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
also this is a really old game so there

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:29.350 
also this is a really old game so there
aren't<00:05:27.630> a<00:05:27.780> ton<00:05:27.810> of<00:05:28.020> people<00:05:28.350> playing<00:05:28.590> it<00:05:28.800> and

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
aren't a ton of people playing it and

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.700 
aren't a ton of people playing it and
still<00:05:30.360> the<00:05:30.570> connections<00:05:30.960> in<00:05:31.110> this<00:05:31.260> game<00:05:31.500> on

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
still the connections in this game on

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.560 
still the connections in this game on
average<00:05:32.340> are<00:05:32.490> better<00:05:32.849> than<00:05:33.060> the<00:05:33.150> connections

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
average are better than the connections

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.560 
average are better than the connections
i<00:05:33.660> get<00:05:33.870> in<00:05:34.110> black<00:05:34.349> ops<00:05:34.560> 2<00:05:34.710> or<00:05:35.099> in<00:05:35.370> ghosts<00:05:35.849> so<00:05:36.539> i

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
i get in black ops 2 or in ghosts so i

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:37.700 
i get in black ops 2 or in ghosts so i
don't<00:05:36.960> know<00:05:37.020> what<00:05:37.200> they<00:05:37.320> did<00:05:37.500> with<00:05:37.590> the

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
don't know what they did with the

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.159 
don't know what they did with the
netcode<00:05:37.919> here<00:05:38.370> but<00:05:38.729> it<00:05:39.150> was<00:05:39.360> balanced<00:05:39.900> quite

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
netcode here but it was balanced quite

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:42.080 
netcode here but it was balanced quite
nicely<00:05:40.440> and<00:05:40.800> a<00:05:40.889> lot<00:05:41.160> of<00:05:41.190> people<00:05:41.310> agree<00:05:41.789> with<00:05:41.820> me

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
nicely and a lot of people agree with me

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:43.580 
nicely and a lot of people agree with me
on<00:05:42.240> this<00:05:42.750> now<00:05:42.960> I<00:05:42.990> know<00:05:43.139> everybody's

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
on this now I know everybody's

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:44.960 
on this now I know everybody's
connections<00:05:43.979> a<00:05:44.070> little<00:05:44.099> bit<00:05:44.430> different<00:05:44.849> and

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
connections a little bit different and

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.870 
connections a little bit different and
for<00:05:45.660> some<00:05:45.810> people<00:05:45.840> it<00:05:46.260> probably<00:05:46.860> wasn't<00:05:47.130> that

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:47.880 
for some people it probably wasn't that

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.820 
for some people it probably wasn't that
great<00:05:48.330> having<00:05:48.900> the<00:05:49.139> connections<00:05:49.590> in<00:05:49.740> this

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
great having the connections in this

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.860 
great having the connections in this
game<00:05:50.039> compared<00:05:50.430> to<00:05:50.550> some<00:05:50.700> other<00:05:50.760> games<00:05:51.060> but

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:51.870 
game compared to some other games but

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.690 
game compared to some other games but
for<00:05:52.139> me<00:05:52.260> and<00:05:52.500> for<00:05:52.650> a<00:05:52.710> lot<00:05:52.889> of<00:05:52.950> people<00:05:53.039> the

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
for me and for a lot of people the

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.190 
for me and for a lot of people the
connections<00:05:54.150> were<00:05:54.270> balanced<00:05:54.720> almost

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.200 
connections were balanced almost

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.969 
connections were balanced almost
perfectly<00:05:55.889> in<00:05:56.070> modern<00:05:56.370> warfare<00:05:56.400> 2<00:05:57.949> now<00:05:58.949> the

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
perfectly in modern warfare 2 now the

perfectly in modern warfare 2 now the
last<00:05:59.250> thing<00:05:59.400> I<00:05:59.580> really<00:05:59.880> want<00:06:00.030> to<00:06:00.120> talk<00:06:00.240> about

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
last thing I really want to talk about

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.909 
last thing I really want to talk about
that<00:06:00.660> I<00:06:00.720> feel<00:06:00.960> that<00:06:01.080> we<00:06:01.169> could<00:06:01.289> learn<00:06:01.470> from<00:06:01.500> in

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
that I feel that we could learn from in

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:05.060 
that I feel that we could learn from in
modern<00:06:02.280> warfare<00:06:02.430> 2<00:06:02.849> is<00:06:03.060> the<00:06:03.120> map<00:06:03.630> design<00:06:04.070> every

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
really feel like we should be able to

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.100 
really feel like we should be able to
learn<00:06:13.800> from<00:06:14.070> this<00:06:14.250> in<00:06:14.490> ghosts<00:06:15.300> yes<00:06:15.720> we<00:06:15.960> do<00:06:16.080> have

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
learn from this in ghosts yes we do have

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.960 
learn from this in ghosts yes we do have
a<00:06:16.289> little<00:06:16.440> bit<00:06:16.560> of<00:06:16.680> variety<00:06:16.889> but<00:06:17.520> for<00:06:17.729> the<00:06:17.789> most

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:17.970 
a little bit of variety but for the most

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.210 
a little bit of variety but for the most
part<00:06:18.090> the<00:06:18.360> colors<00:06:18.690> are<00:06:18.870> all<00:06:19.020> pretty<00:06:19.440> gray<00:06:19.889> and

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
part the colors are all pretty gray and

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.629 
part the colors are all pretty gray and
green<00:06:20.610> and<00:06:21.060> boring<00:06:21.599> and<00:06:21.780> bland<00:06:22.110> and<00:06:22.440> yes<00:06:23.400> they

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 
green and boring and bland and yes they

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.250 
green and boring and bland and yes they
do<00:06:23.699> have<00:06:23.970> somewhat<00:06:24.539> of<00:06:24.570> a<00:06:24.720> different<00:06:25.050> flow

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:25.260 
do have somewhat of a different flow

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.409 
do have somewhat of a different flow
every<00:06:25.620> map<00:06:25.800> but<00:06:26.669> I<00:06:26.699> don't<00:06:27.150> know<00:06:27.240> they're<00:06:27.389> not

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 
every map but I don't know they're not

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:30.140 
every map but I don't know they're not
so<00:06:27.810> vastly<00:06:28.289> different<00:06:28.860> a<00:06:29.340> lot<00:06:29.880> of<00:06:30.060> the

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.150 
so vastly different a lot of the

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.210 
so vastly different a lot of the
buildings<00:06:30.990> in<00:06:31.110> modern<00:06:31.380> warfare<00:06:31.500> two<00:06:31.830> are<00:06:31.979> very

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.220 
buildings in modern warfare two are very

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.279 
buildings in modern warfare two are very
distinct<00:06:32.849> so<00:06:32.970> you<00:06:33.060> have<00:06:33.240> different<00:06:33.570> sections

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:34.289 
distinct so you have different sections

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:36.380 
distinct so you have different sections
of<00:06:34.440> the<00:06:34.530> map<00:06:34.740> that<00:06:35.010> are<00:06:35.159> so<00:06:35.460> so<00:06:35.760> distinct<00:06:36.270> they

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:36.390 
of the map that are so so distinct they

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:38.990 
of the map that are so so distinct they
offer<00:06:36.650> really<00:06:37.650> really<00:06:38.250> unique<00:06:38.640> gameplay

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
offer really really unique gameplay

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.700 
offer really really unique gameplay
really<00:06:39.599> really<00:06:39.900> unique<00:06:40.169> gunfire

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710 
really really unique gunfire

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:42.470 
really really unique gunfire
within<00:06:41.100> each<00:06:41.310> little<00:06:41.640> section<00:06:41.910> of<00:06:42.210> the<00:06:42.300> map

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:42.480 
within each little section of the map

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.180 
within each little section of the map
and<00:06:42.750> I<00:06:43.140> really<00:06:43.380> like<00:06:43.530> that<00:06:43.680> about<00:06:43.740> modern

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190 
and I really like that about modern

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.820 
and I really like that about modern
warfare<00:06:44.370> 2<00:06:44.730> the<00:06:45.270> maps<00:06:45.480> were<00:06:45.720> simple<00:06:46.200> but<00:06:46.620> they

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
warfare 2 the maps were simple but they

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.770 
warfare 2 the maps were simple but they
had<00:06:47.040> a<00:06:47.070> lot<00:06:47.310> of<00:06:47.340> complexities<00:06:48.090> to<00:06:48.120> them<00:06:48.600> and

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.780 
had a lot of complexities to them and

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.560 
had a lot of complexities to them and
also<00:06:49.650> this<00:06:50.040> really<00:06:50.400> allowed<00:06:50.670> the<00:06:50.910> the<00:06:51.420> more

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:51.570 
also this really allowed the the more

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.870 
also this really allowed the the more
experienced<00:06:52.080> players<00:06:52.370> to<00:06:53.370> learn<00:06:53.400> the<00:06:53.730> little

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:53.880 
experienced players to learn the little

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.730 
experienced players to learn the little
subtleties<00:06:54.270> of<00:06:54.420> the<00:06:54.630> map<00:06:54.810> so<00:06:55.110> you<00:06:55.560> might

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:55.740 
subtleties of the map so you might

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.710 
subtleties of the map so you might
notice<00:06:55.920> there<00:06:56.160> are<00:06:56.250> a<00:06:56.280> whole<00:06:56.520> lot<00:06:56.550> less<00:06:57.060> like

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 
notice there are a whole lot less like

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.510 
notice there are a whole lot less like
jumps<00:06:58.140> and<00:06:58.290> spots<00:06:58.470> and<00:06:58.770> lines<00:06:58.920> of<00:06:59.100> sight<00:06:59.280> in

00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520 
jumps and spots and lines of sight in

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.580 
jumps and spots and lines of sight in
the<00:06:59.970> new<00:07:00.120> games<00:07:00.390> compared<00:07:00.870> to<00:07:01.050> modern<00:07:01.440> warfare

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.590 
the new games compared to modern warfare

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.030 
the new games compared to modern warfare
2<00:07:02.040> or<00:07:02.370> some<00:07:02.910> of<00:07:02.940> the<00:07:03.060> older<00:07:03.300> games<00:07:03.540> I<00:07:04.040> really

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:05.040 
2 or some of the older games I really

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.030 
2 or some of the older games I really
feel<00:07:05.250> like<00:07:05.690> modern<00:07:06.690> warfare<00:07:06.840> 2<00:07:07.110> nailed<00:07:07.740> map

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:08.040 
feel like modern warfare 2 nailed map

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.580 
feel like modern warfare 2 nailed map
design<00:07:08.310> they<00:07:08.940> had<00:07:09.120> a<00:07:09.150> lot<00:07:09.480> of<00:07:09.510> variety<00:07:09.990> in<00:07:10.020> in

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:10.590 
design they had a lot of variety in in

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:12.500 
design they had a lot of variety in in
different<00:07:11.130> styles<00:07:11.610> of<00:07:11.880> play<00:07:12.030> so<00:07:12.180> they<00:07:12.390> had

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:12.510 
different styles of play so they had

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.630 
different styles of play so they had
linear<00:07:12.840> maps<00:07:13.080> they<00:07:13.290> had<00:07:13.440> wide<00:07:13.770> open<00:07:14.160> maps<00:07:14.340> with

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:14.640 
linear maps they had wide open maps with

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:17.300 
linear maps they had wide open maps with
a<00:07:14.670> circular<00:07:15.180> flow<00:07:15.450> to<00:07:15.510> him<00:07:15.780> very<00:07:16.650> very<00:07:17.010> wide

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:17.310 
a circular flow to him very very wide

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.470 
a circular flow to him very very wide
variety<00:07:17.850> of<00:07:17.880> all<00:07:18.510> of<00:07:18.810> flow<00:07:19.650> as<00:07:19.920> well<00:07:19.980> as<00:07:20.880> actual

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:21.480 
variety of all of flow as well as actual

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.910 
variety of all of flow as well as actual
color<00:07:21.810> palette<00:07:22.230> and<00:07:22.350> everything<00:07:22.740> like<00:07:22.860> that

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:22.920 
color palette and everything like that

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.860 
color palette and everything like that
and<00:07:23.250> also<00:07:23.700> here's<00:07:24.000> another<00:07:24.180> little<00:07:24.420> strange

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:24.870 
and also here's another little strange

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:26.600 
and also here's another little strange
thing<00:07:25.050> that<00:07:25.170> happened<00:07:25.470> in<00:07:25.590> this<00:07:25.740> game<00:07:25.980> the

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:26.610 
thing that happened in this game the

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:28.460 
thing that happened in this game the
killcam<00:07:27.000> was<00:07:27.240> like<00:07:27.390> 30<00:07:27.690> seconds<00:07:28.080> long<00:07:28.260> i'm

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:28.470 
killcam was like 30 seconds long i'm

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:29.990 
killcam was like 30 seconds long i'm
sure<00:07:28.620> some<00:07:28.920> of<00:07:29.010> you<00:07:29.040> guys<00:07:29.190> have<00:07:29.460> experiences

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 
sure some of you guys have experiences

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.670 
sure some of you guys have experiences
before<00:07:30.180> but<00:07:30.540> i'm<00:07:30.630> pretty<00:07:30.840> sure<00:07:31.080> that<00:07:31.110> one<00:07:31.530> guy

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 
before but i'm pretty sure that one guy

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.920 
before but i'm pretty sure that one guy
on<00:07:31.800> the<00:07:31.890> other<00:07:31.920> team<00:07:32.070> that<00:07:32.250> Janka<00:07:32.850> guy<00:07:33.030> was

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:33.930 
on the other team that Janka guy was

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:35.630 
on the other team that Janka guy was
hacking<00:07:34.170> or<00:07:34.560> doing<00:07:34.830> something<00:07:35.070> to<00:07:35.340> the<00:07:35.430> game

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:35.640 
hacking or doing something to the game

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.580 
hacking or doing something to the game
so<00:07:35.970> that's<00:07:36.690> pretty<00:07:36.930> much<00:07:37.110> going<00:07:37.320> to<00:07:37.380> wrap<00:07:37.560> it

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:37.590 
so that's pretty much going to wrap it

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.320 
so that's pretty much going to wrap it
up<00:07:37.800> for<00:07:38.010> the<00:07:38.130> lessons<00:07:38.490> that<00:07:38.550> I<00:07:38.730> feel<00:07:39.060> could<00:07:39.240> be

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:39.330 
up for the lessons that I feel could be

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.210 
up for the lessons that I feel could be
learned<00:07:39.570> from<00:07:39.690> modern<00:07:39.990> warfare<00:07:40.140> 2<00:07:40.500> and<00:07:40.710> I<00:07:40.920> kind

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:41.220 
learned from modern warfare 2 and I kind

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.860 
learned from modern warfare 2 and I kind
of<00:07:41.340> hoped<00:07:41.580> that<00:07:41.790> sledgehammer<00:07:42.150> is<00:07:42.570> going<00:07:42.780> to

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:42.870 
of hoped that sledgehammer is going to

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.480 
of hoped that sledgehammer is going to
be<00:07:42.960> taking<00:07:43.320> a<00:07:43.410> few<00:07:43.650> of<00:07:43.740> these<00:07:43.830> lessons<00:07:44.310> and

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:44.490 
be taking a few of these lessons and

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:45.890 
be taking a few of these lessons and
