00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:17.730
 for everyone and not exactly very well 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.100
 what he does is good for you not 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.689
 catch you get the hang of this 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.020
 calculation to see partners from the middle 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.020
 at last 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:39.829
 he pushes me with his father is a better better 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.730
 they push me before and now I slip 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.739
 through the back of a subscriber this from 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.090
 a young subscribers subscribed a 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.090
 subscriber subscriber 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.500
 subscriber 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.990
 has name d 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.250
 I chose subscribers against what already 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:07.200
 better choose subscribers 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:11.450
 after this I had to say we were 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.450
 rooms and here 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:22.290
 you know but it's not enough nor 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.640
 keep in mind through neither do you 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.710
 lace at the airport three already 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.710
 you understand what to jump 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.210
 moments of crisis and calm 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.360
 I'm going to have 200,000 people jumping 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.780
 today today today today today or useful what I owe 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.780
 say please 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.990
 I'm sorry that I have people that I 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.970
 they want to throw and if I wait for you to know if 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.300
 you have seen me I already have and behind 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:55.330
 very sad 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.430
 That's the way it is but the most normal thing is that I 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.740
 tiren 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:04.060
 tell me that the miracle of miracle will come 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.060
 coolest and now 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.210
 sorry this point that is here 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.799
 the audio 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.410
 the shell of the parrot simply 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.460
 nothing that did not see the point boy already of 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.590
 background won me uncle I win I won the 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.819
 look is not clear I do not know why 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.200
 what but not but he does not escape us from 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.240
 catch the point because I do not know I do not know 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.959
 you do not have any kind of sense no 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.959
 It makes no sense 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.510
 but what the fuck is wrong with you 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.439
 to stick me a colleja god and I of 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.480
 I really do not understand sometimes what I 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:47.689
 it happens to try to do it backwards 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.689
 come on 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.010
 amazing 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:56.409
 I suppose if you jump to the left 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.659
 it will be much simpler this is the jump 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:00.659
 we are looking for this is easy this is easy 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.860
 and God 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.790
 going down with getting to be like this is that uncle already 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.440
 when I have the bike it turns super difficult 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.799
 be like this I do if you're already on trial 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.730
 for de xivert I drop the first one already 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.730
 he chewed 25 thousand kilometers 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.090
 the bottom explodes but it's like 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.250
 reappearing caught already half I do not know 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.470
 if it will be because he can not or why not 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.110
 wants 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.820
 I'm super quiet let's see if 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:40.870
 we get by some chance of the 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.870
 life to reach the right-handed as it seems 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.820
 because it seems a little complicated 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.590
 this is not going to work out the audio guys 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.090
 That's it, the guy's already finished 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.510
 Uncle, so now, with a little boy 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.190
 that's what you get, it's going to be a bit 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.350
 we will do here I can not go the second 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.610
 position the second position has to 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.630
 be mine guys that's clearer the 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.910
 Water 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.960
 the second position is going to be mine 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.690
 You have to look, you're going to be mine 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.690
 so let's give it a lot of sugarcane because 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.310
 I want that second position 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.550
 with care within what fits 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.550
 why 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.459
 because if we do not appear in the fifth 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.900
 pine you basically have to see this 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.280
 moment that goes second that I want 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.980
 snatch my position but it's not going to 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.360
 get because he does not want 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.160
 because otherwise the bike bounces for 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.230
 I do not understand, I really do not understand 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.090
 absolutely nothing 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.520
 let's go let's go let's go let's go there 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.540
 it's bouncing we're with the wall 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:37.460
 come come come come come come 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:46.039
 come on come on 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:46.039
 I suppose and I hope that the previous 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:53.380
 down up up I really think that 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.610
 you should have climbed up the ramp that 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.570
 ramp that is out there sticking a 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.460
 jump with the bike with the speed that 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.770
 I had surely gotten 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.210
 catch the point but the case is that not 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.669
 fell of hands and surely yes there was 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.320
 go up for it when we go up we go up 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.000
 we go up I want the first one to be 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.580
 a little stuck in this guy because 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.770
 not because it is complicating the goal but because 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.470
 there will be bleachers fit this basically in 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:19.270
 upload the game on time 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.270
 the point and the goal is in front 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.080
 or yes for little reason the little good boy 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.950
 I am afraid that the third one by 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.950
 least we are within the capacity 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.770
 download a comments appeared and I 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.210
 by twitter and police tram that is 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.470
 just under description and we do not see 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.470
 the next video bye bye
