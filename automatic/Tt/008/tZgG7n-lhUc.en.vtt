that is it if you cannot find them it's

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.289 
that is it if you cannot find them it's
probably<00:01:48.450> because<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.110> lens<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.530> closed<00:01:50.299> so

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299

turn<00:02:23.000> this<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.390> a<00:02:23.420> hundred<00:02:24.080> percent<00:02:24.230> because

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
turn this to a hundred percent because

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.490 
turn this to a hundred percent because
if<00:02:25.069> it's<00:02:25.220> not<00:02:25.250> will<00:02:25.670> be<00:02:25.790> half<00:02:26.209> of<00:02:26.560> 1080<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:27.890> the

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
if it's not will be half of 1080 and the

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.630 
if it's not will be half of 1080 and the
quality<00:02:30.500> will<00:02:30.860> reduce<00:02:31.930> humongously<00:02:33.340> so<00:02:34.340> I

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
quality will reduce humongously so I

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.800 
quality will reduce humongously so I
also<00:02:34.940> I<00:02:35.330> even<00:02:35.780> recommend<00:02:36.110> doing<00:02:36.550> 1440p<00:02:37.810> pixels

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
also I even recommend doing 1440p pixels

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.130 
also I even recommend doing 1440p pixels
but<00:02:39.280> if<00:02:40.280> you<00:02:40.459> if<00:02:40.700> your<00:02:40.850> computer<00:02:41.300> can't<00:02:41.600> handle

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.930 
but if you if your computer can't handle
that<00:02:42.260> that's<00:02:42.530> fine<00:02:44.020> so<00:02:45.020> now<00:02:45.350> for<00:02:45.950> for<00:02:46.700> the

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940
