00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.800 
you see QWERTY is already so ubiquitous
by<00:03:40.130> now<00:03:40.310> that<00:03:40.370> it's<00:03:40.610> probably<00:03:41.239> here<00:03:41.480> to<00:03:41.510> stay

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
by now that it's probably here to stay

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.720 
by now that it's probably here to stay
forever<00:03:42.019> even<00:03:42.769> though<00:03:42.890> I<00:03:42.920> believe<00:03:43.250> that

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
forever even though I believe that

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:44.949 
forever even though I believe that
Dvorak<00:03:44.150> is<00:03:44.329> superior

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
Dvorak is superior

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.140 
Dvorak is superior
I<00:03:45.140> still<00:03:45.560> haven't<00:03:45.739> switched<00:03:46.010> to<00:03:46.310> it<00:03:46.459> I<00:03:46.609> tried

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
I still haven't switched to it I tried

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.030 
I still haven't switched to it I tried
once<00:03:47.420> and<00:03:47.690> it<00:03:47.840> was<00:03:47.930> just<00:03:48.140> too<00:03:48.320> difficult<00:03:48.560> for

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
once and it was just too difficult for

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.640 
once and it was just too difficult for
me<00:03:49.160> so<00:03:49.519> I<00:03:49.549> gave<00:03:49.760> up<00:03:49.940> and<00:03:50.120> that's<00:03:50.660> why<00:03:50.959> QWERTY<00:03:51.530> is

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
me so I gave up and that's why QWERTY is

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.130 
me so I gave up and that's why QWERTY is
still<00:03:51.950> king<00:03:52.280> it's<00:03:52.820> not<00:03:53.120> optimal<00:03:53.570> but<00:03:53.989> it's

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
still king it's not optimal but it's

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.110 
still king it's not optimal but it's
good<00:03:54.440> enough<00:03:54.739> and<00:03:55.070> it's<00:03:55.579> what<00:03:55.730> everybody's

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
good enough and it's what everybody's

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.120 
good enough and it's what everybody's
already<00:03:56.390> used<00:03:56.720> to<00:03:56.959> a<00:03:57.200> lot<00:03:57.590> of<00:03:57.680> things<00:03:57.890> are<00:03:58.040> that
