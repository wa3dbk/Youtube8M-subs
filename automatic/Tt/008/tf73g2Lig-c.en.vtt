00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello people welcome all to me 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.460
 small channel today we see how to prepare a 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.960
 great substrate for the table 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.400
 cultivation that we built already some 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.990
 time and from which I leave a link to 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.030
 end of the video if you want to build 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.889
 yours at the end we are also going to 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.570
 do a small germination test 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.570
 with the substrate do not miss it 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.490
 for the preparation of our substrate 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.960
 we have opted for a fiber mixture of 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.530
 coconut and worm mousse in a 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.150
 proportion of 60 40 and although never before 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.700
 we had used it we had heard 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.350
 so much of him that we finally decided 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.110
 to try it and with very good results 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.760
 then you will see the coconut fiber the 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.379
 we buy loose instead of blocks 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.180
 and although transport has been something to us 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.710
 more difficult we have saved ourselves having 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.170
 that be undoing the little block to 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.030
 little with water 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.070
 between the properties of the fiber of 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.809
 coconut is worth noting how light it is as 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.059
 It is observed is a super light material 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.440
 of very little weight that does not compact 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.140
 a lot and that allows us a perfect 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.329
 development in terms of roots and plants 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.979
 also retains very well water and 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.550
 nutrients avoiding excessive loss 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:06.190
 of these 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.570
 against and as a negative part perhaps 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.490
 is not a very cheap substrate for 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.560
 be the unusable waste of the 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.479
 coconut since it is made up of 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.790
 fibers cut from the shell of this 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:19.360
 but it is approximately to the extent 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.070
 of any other substrate and the truth 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.140
 is that in this way we recycle without 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.540
 destroy the environment as they do 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.180
 the peat bogs 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.890
 and to enrich it since the fiber of 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.140
 Coconut is an inert material in which no 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.330
 plants would thrive on their own 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.820
 we have decided to use a worm mold that 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.440
 they say it's their best companion the humus 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.180
 no more than the excrement of digestion 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.370
 of organic matter by the 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.950
 Earthworms is one of the best fertilizers 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.960
 existing ones is very apt to improve 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.670
 Conditions of only substrates contains 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.140
 fungi and beneficial bacteria for 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.840
 same good amounts of calcium 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.870
 potassium phosphorus and the best thing is that 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.670
 We can do it ourselves at home 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.770
 I opted to buy it and in comparison 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.259
 with coconut fiber I got cheaper 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.550
 but I have built a composting worm 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.550
 and I hope I do not have to do it anymore 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.990
 as you see the slave has not filled the 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.000
 grow table to the edge but that 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.800
 has left a space to be able to remove 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.450
 without our substrate falling and 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.260
 then later we will finish 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.659
 fill it 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.459
 we have also added approximately one 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:25.769
 couple of liters of perlite and vermiculite 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.900
 which will improve even further the 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.299
 aeration of roots and the drainage of 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.640
 excess water but retaining moisture 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.290
 and although the truth is that seeing the 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.180
 characteristics of coconut fiber and the 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.400
 humus I do not think they are all 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.290
 necessary in this case but if 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.930
 we would have opted for another substrate as 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.360
 mulch peat so it would be interesting 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.820
 contribute to our cultivation table 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.710
 and good once we have incorporated all 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.200
 the elements of our mix only we 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:56.740
 it will be necessary to stir well to mix well 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.460
 all components and end of 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.170
 add the part that we were missing 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.950
 we will mix another little bit and 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.900
 we will have prepared our substrate 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.330
 and the truth as this could not be left 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.519
 so I wanted to curl the curl I decided to put on 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.019
 to prove if it was true that the 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.910
 Coconut fiber is in excellent 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.670
 germinator for our seedbeds like 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.410
 they say so in this way I searched for 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.150
 the first crop any of the plants 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.860
 that were difficult to germinate and that 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.890
 they required a free space of bad 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.690
 herbs and of course they ended up being 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.569
 carrots and parsley here as you see 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.410
 I mixed the seeds with a little fiber 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:36.390
 of coconut we stir well the mixture and 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.849
 I set out to sow the truth is that 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.280
 I should have left 24 hours 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.709
 seeds in water soaking for 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.049
 facilitate the germination but good of 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.030
 this way then look more extreme yet 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.620
 we made it a brand to divide 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.510
 our table in two parts for 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:55.170
 differentiate crops and good 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.959
 proceed to the distribution that we can 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.849
 at least or if not making 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.940
 holes at a prudent distance 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:05.400
 we can go putting the seeds once 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.250
 we distribute them sprinkled with a little 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.489
 of coconut fiber and no mix for 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.020
 cover them and especially as always a 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.390
 good watering 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.100
 we will add in the form of fine rain to 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.680
 drag as little as possible our 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.570
 seeds and if we can use like in this 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.570
 case the rain water much better 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.120
 and nothing here you have the result just 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.570
 11 days after having sown 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.980
 began to germinate the carrots and or 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.260
 the truth is that I am amazed because 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.900
 generally less than three weeks I do not 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.810
 they usually take 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.240
 and the result has been exceptional 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.160
 I'm super happy and I recommend it 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.860
 really so much to create your 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.509
 seedlings as to provide the substrate 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.700
 to the cultivation table it seems like a 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:54.410
 exceptional material 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.970
 and here we have arrived today so 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.650
 As I always say, I hope you have 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.390
 liked the video that you give me I like if 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.790
 has been that it is quite important for 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:03.290
 us and that you share it in your 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.050
 social networks that sure some 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:09.820
 friend the slave will come quite well 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.820
 and I said goodbye until next time
