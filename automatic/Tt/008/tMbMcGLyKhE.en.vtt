in years to come at the upper border of
nature<00:00:20.449> but<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.480> realized<00:00:22.109> this<00:00:22.470> point<00:00:22.830> that

it's<00:00:23.340> very<00:00:23.970> secret<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.289> was<00:00:25.410> kept<00:00:25.650> secret

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
it's very secret that it was kept secret

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.009 
it's very secret that it was kept secret
because<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.400> asked<00:00:26.939> him<00:00:27.150> what<00:00:27.750> are<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.900> going

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
because I asked him what are you going

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.230

to do with this piece of information and

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.659 
to do with this piece of information and
