00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
George did you hear there is a new study

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.460 
George did you hear there is a new study
out<00:00:02.790> of<00:00:02.909> Harvard<00:00:03.090> which<00:00:03.720> says<00:00:03.990> that<00:00:04.140> listening

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
out of Harvard which says that listening

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.869 
out of Harvard which says that listening
to<00:00:04.650> rock<00:00:04.830> music<00:00:04.859> will<00:00:05.400> decrease<00:00:05.700> your

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
to rock music will decrease your

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.680 
to rock music will decrease your
reasoning<00:00:06.270> ability<00:00:06.690> by<00:00:06.990> 42%<00:00:07.529> I<00:00:08.420> guess<00:00:09.420> we<00:00:09.570> will

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
reasoning ability by 42% I guess we will

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.680 
reasoning ability by 42% I guess we will
no<00:00:09.870> longer<00:00:10.110> be<00:00:10.349> able<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.620> listen<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:11.010> our<00:00:11.219> iPods

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
no longer be able to listen to our iPods

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.780

do<00:00:12.690> you<00:00:12.809> know<00:00:13.019> if<00:00:13.349> it<00:00:14.009> was<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.160> double<00:00:14.549> blood

do you know if it was a double blood

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.080 
do you know if it was a double blood
study<00:00:15.179> and<00:00:15.900> did<00:00:16.800> it<00:00:16.949> have<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.130> lot<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.430> people<00:00:17.970> in

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
study and did it have a lot of people in

study and did it have a lot of people in
it<00:00:18.270> I<00:00:18.420> don't<00:00:18.869> know<00:00:19.050> but<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:19.590> came<00:00:19.800> out<00:00:19.980> of

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
it I don't know but it came out of

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.240 
it I don't know but it came out of
Harvard<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:21.000> must<00:00:21.210> be<00:00:21.240> true

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250
