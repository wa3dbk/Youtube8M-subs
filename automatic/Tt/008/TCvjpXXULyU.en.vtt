people<00:03:32.470> really<00:03:32.530> get<00:03:32.770> into<00:03:32.950> a<00:03:32.980> groove<00:03:33.250> with

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
people really get into a groove with

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:36.090 
people really get into a groove with
that<00:03:34.140> it's<00:03:35.140> pretty<00:03:35.320> simple<00:03:35.620> to<00:03:35.740> play<00:03:35.890> this

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
that it's pretty simple to play this

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.860 
that it's pretty simple to play this
kind<00:03:36.310> of<00:03:36.340> stuff<00:03:36.610> all<00:03:36.910> you<00:03:37.300> need<00:03:37.450> to<00:03:37.570> figure<00:03:37.750> out

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
kind of stuff all you need to figure out

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.560 
kind of stuff all you need to figure out
is<00:03:38.290> a<00:03:38.530> drum<00:03:39.130> pattern<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:39.640> most<00:03:39.820> people<00:03:40.150> most

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
is a drum pattern and most people most

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.330 
is a drum pattern and most people most
musicians<00:03:40.900> just<00:03:41.200> do<00:03:41.380> this<00:03:41.560> on<00:03:41.800> their<00:03:42.010> owners

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
musicians just do this on their owners

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.900 
musicians just do this on their owners
yes<00:03:43.060> clear<00:03:43.480> pattern<00:03:44.080> with<00:03:44.230> your<00:03:44.670> thumb<00:03:45.670> and

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
yes clear pattern with your thumb and

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:58.440 
yes clear pattern with your thumb and
index<00:03:54.480> and<00:03:55.480> for<00:03:56.020> the<00:03:56.110> codes<00:03:56.880> I'm<00:03:57.880> basically

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
index and for the codes I'm basically

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.090 
index and for the codes I'm basically
just<00:03:58.600> whacking<00:03:59.320> it<00:03:59.620> with<00:03:59.740> the<00:03:59.860> thumb<00:04:00.070> and

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
just whacking it with the thumb and

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.420 
just whacking it with the thumb and
transform<00:04:00.790> it<00:04:00.880> at<00:04:00.970> the<00:04:01.060> same<00:04:01.240> time<00:04:01.560> so<00:04:02.560> instead

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
transform it at the same time so instead

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:09.690 
transform it at the same time so instead
of<00:04:03.520> playing<00:04:03.790> I<00:04:04.530> go

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.699 

when<00:04:10.569> you<00:04:10.630> start<00:04:10.870> doing<00:04:11.080> this<00:04:11.319> you<00:04:11.530> realize

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
when you start doing this you realize

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.640 
when you start doing this you realize
that<00:04:12.090> you<00:04:13.090> can<00:04:13.209> either<00:04:13.330> hit<00:04:13.540> the<00:04:13.810> bottom

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
that you can either hit the bottom

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.090 
that you can either hit the bottom
strings<00:04:14.950> harder<00:04:16.260> or<00:04:17.260> you<00:04:17.320> can<00:04:17.680> hit<00:04:17.799> the<00:04:17.919> top

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
strings harder or you can hit the top

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.090 
strings harder or you can hit the top
string

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
string

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.830 
string
and<00:04:20.850> it's<00:04:20.970> kinda<00:04:21.180> nice<00:04:21.360> because<00:04:21.600> you<00:04:21.810> can

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
and it's kinda nice because you can

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.710 
and it's kinda nice because you can
actually<00:04:22.260> play<00:04:22.530> around<00:04:22.770> with<00:04:22.920> that<00:04:23.100> and<00:04:23.720> based

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
actually play around with that and based

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.820 
actually play around with that and based
on<00:04:24.840> the<00:04:24.960> kind<00:04:25.110> of<00:04:25.140> song<00:04:25.350> you're<00:04:25.500> playing<00:04:25.530> you

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
on the kind of song you're playing you

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.370 
on the kind of song you're playing you
can<00:04:25.980> make<00:04:26.820> it<00:04:26.940> you<00:04:27.570> know<00:04:27.690> what<00:04:27.960> am<00:04:28.080> heavier

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
can make it you know what am heavier

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.000 
can make it you know what am heavier
top-heavy<00:04:28.800> and<00:04:29.900> it<00:04:30.900> also<00:04:31.050> helps<00:04:31.380> in<00:04:31.500> dynamics

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
top-heavy and it also helps in dynamics

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.340 
top-heavy and it also helps in dynamics
the<00:04:32.400> way<00:04:32.520> you<00:04:32.580> get<00:04:32.790> the<00:04:33.150> thing<00:04:33.360> so<00:04:34.080> if<00:04:34.260> you

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
the way you get the thing so if you

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:45.700 
the way you get the thing so if you
wanna<00:04:34.500> play<00:04:34.710> a<00:04:34.740> hotter<00:04:35.250> part

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:05:33.540 

anything<00:04:46.710> ginger<00:04:47.039> to<00:04:47.189> be<00:04:47.430> a<00:04:47.460> little<00:04:47.669> lighter

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:37.240 

so<00:05:34.550> that's<00:05:35.150> pretty<00:05:35.360> much<00:05:35.479> and<00:05:35.930> it's<00:05:36.469> already

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
so that's pretty much and it's already

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.740 
so that's pretty much and it's already
up<00:05:37.400> to<00:05:37.550> your<00:05:37.639> right<00:05:37.789> hand<00:05:37.969> to<00:05:38.539> play<00:05:38.719> a

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
up to your right hand to play a

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.409 
up to your right hand to play a
different<00:05:39.169> kind<00:05:39.289> of<00:05:39.319> rhythm<00:05:39.529> if<00:05:39.979> you're<00:05:40.580> you

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
different kind of rhythm if you're you

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.390 
different kind of rhythm if you're you
don't<00:05:41.569> play<00:05:41.779> a<00:05:41.810> faster<00:05:42.259> rhythm<00:05:42.379> or<00:05:42.830> a<00:05:42.860> little

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
don't play a faster rhythm or a little

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.100 
don't play a faster rhythm or a little
syncopated<00:05:43.909> stuff<00:05:44.180> this<00:05:44.689> would<00:05:44.870> be<00:05:44.930> all<00:05:45.080> in

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
syncopated stuff this would be all in

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.600 
syncopated stuff this would be all in
your<00:05:45.349> right<00:05:45.500> hand<00:05:45.529> and<00:05:45.830> this<00:05:46.219> little<00:05:46.490> bit<00:05:46.580> of

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
your right hand and this little bit of

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.909 
your right hand and this little bit of
practice<00:05:47.349> with<00:05:48.349> respect<00:05:48.500> to<00:05:48.979> slapping<00:05:49.879> the

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
practice with respect to slapping the

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:53.649 
practice with respect to slapping the
bottom<00:05:51.919> side<00:05:52.069> of<00:05:52.129> the<00:05:52.250> guitar<00:05:52.370> what<00:05:53.330> I<00:05:53.360> tried

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:53.659 
bottom side of the guitar what I tried

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:57.999 
bottom side of the guitar what I tried
to<00:05:53.689> do<00:05:53.870> was<00:05:54.819> the<00:05:55.819> flamenco<00:05:56.180> style<00:05:56.569> of<00:05:56.779> I<00:05:57.289> guess

00:05:57.999 --> 00:05:58.009 
to do was the flamenco style of I guess

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:02.730 
to do was the flamenco style of I guess
you<00:05:58.610> know<00:06:00.219> the<00:06:01.219> old<00:06:01.460> fingers<00:06:01.819> just<00:06:01.969> play<00:06:02.539> out

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
you know the old fingers just play out

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.420 
you know the old fingers just play out
after<00:06:03.740> the<00:06:03.800> same<00:06:03.979> thing<00:06:04.159> here<00:06:05.620> so<00:06:06.620> it's<00:06:06.830> one

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
after the same thing here so it's one

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:14.260 
after the same thing here so it's one
two<00:06:07.669> three<00:06:07.789> four<00:06:12.069> one<00:06:13.069> or<00:06:13.219> the<00:06:13.430> other<00:06:13.580> and<00:06:14.150> I

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:14.270 
two three four one or the other and I

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.540 
two three four one or the other and I
use<00:06:14.449> continuous<00:06:15.379> time<00:06:15.589> where<00:06:15.800> I<00:06:15.830> hold<00:06:16.099> my<00:06:16.279> fist

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:16.550 
use continuous time where I hold my fist

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:23.680 
use continuous time where I hold my fist
in<00:06:16.729> and<00:06:16.940> let<00:06:18.159> the<00:06:19.159> other<00:06:21.490> and<00:06:22.490> the<00:06:23.120> last<00:06:23.300> part<00:06:23.539> I

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
in and let the other and the last part I

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:33.429 
in and let the other and the last part I
like<00:06:23.870> the<00:06:23.900> thumb<00:06:30.250> so<00:06:31.250> that<00:06:31.509> um<00:06:32.509> so<00:06:33.020> you<00:06:33.110> can<00:06:33.259> add

00:06:33.429 --> 00:06:33.439 
like the thumb so that um so you can add

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:42.950 
like the thumb so that um so you can add
everything<00:06:33.830> together

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.240 

and<00:06:43.960> takes<00:06:44.170> a<00:06:44.260> little<00:06:44.380> while<00:06:44.650> for<00:06:44.710> you<00:06:45.040> to<00:06:45.070> get

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:45.250 
and takes a little while for you to get

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.400 
and takes a little while for you to get
used<00:06:45.430> to<00:06:45.670> playing<00:06:46.360> it<00:06:46.660> with<00:06:46.870> the<00:06:46.990> beat<00:06:47.170> and

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:47.410 
used to playing it with the beat and

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.260 
used to playing it with the beat and
then<00:06:47.890> backing<00:06:48.220> the<00:06:48.370> base<00:06:48.520> of<00:06:48.640> the<00:06:48.700> guitar<00:06:48.970> and

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270 
then backing the base of the guitar and

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.370 
then backing the base of the guitar and
absolutely<00:06:49.600> working<00:06:49.750> on<00:06:49.930> the<00:06:50.020> stuff<00:06:50.200> like

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:50.380 
absolutely working on the stuff like

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.420 
absolutely working on the stuff like
this<00:06:50.970> but<00:06:51.970> it's<00:06:52.120> a<00:06:52.180> fun<00:06:52.390> exercise<00:06:52.420> and

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.430 
this but it's a fun exercise and

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.380 
this but it's a fun exercise and
hopefully<00:06:54.430> you<00:06:54.520> can<00:06:54.640> learn<00:06:54.790> a<00:06:54.820> lot<00:06:55.030> from<00:06:55.090> this

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:55.390 
hopefully you can learn a lot from this

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.600 
hopefully you can learn a lot from this
and<00:06:55.600> you<00:06:56.380> know<00:06:56.440> when<00:06:56.620> you<00:06:56.680> play<00:06:56.800> campfire<00:06:57.310> song

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:57.610 
and you know when you play campfire song

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.520 
and you know when you play campfire song
stuff<00:06:57.970> it<00:06:58.420> adds<00:06:58.720> a<00:06:58.840> whole<00:06:59.110> different

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530 
stuff it adds a whole different
