well<00:02:17.420> since<00:02:17.750> builder<00:02:18.200> okay<00:02:18.560> I'll<00:02:18.739> carefully

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
well since builder okay I'll carefully

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.089 
well since builder okay I'll carefully
cut<00:02:20.120> that<00:02:20.239> out<00:02:20.299> and<00:02:21.110> then<00:02:21.319> we<00:02:21.470> are<00:02:21.590> back<00:02:21.769> down

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
cut that out and then we are back down

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:28.059 
cut that out and then we are back down
this<00:02:22.519> way<00:02:25.900> this<00:02:26.900> isn't<00:02:27.110> particularly

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
this way this isn't particularly

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.750 
this way this isn't particularly
difficult<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:30.590> main<00:02:30.799> thing<00:02:31.280> really<00:02:31.430> isn't

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
difficult the main thing really isn't

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.030 
difficult the main thing really isn't
thinking<00:02:32.299> about<00:02:32.569> them<00:02:32.810> in<00:02:32.930> it<00:02:33.049> early<00:02:33.470> probably

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
thinking about them in it early probably

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.410 
thinking about them in it early probably

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
oven I it's going to be much more

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.330 
oven I it's going to be much more
difficult<00:03:53.020> to<00:03:53.170> cook<00:03:53.380> it<00:03:53.620> or<00:03:53.830> to<00:03:54.070> get<00:03:54.190> all

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
difficult to cook it or to get all

what we're gonna have is several joints

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.330 
what we're gonna have is several joints
I'm<00:04:04.570> just<00:04:04.720> going<00:04:04.870> to<00:04:04.900> snap<00:04:05.620> that<00:04:05.650> you<00:04:06.040> so<00:04:06.190> I've

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.980 
I'm just going to snap that you so I've
done<00:04:06.490> they're<00:04:06.730> just<00:04:06.940> snap<00:04:07.330> that<00:04:07.630> a<00:04:07.660> little<00:04:07.900> bit

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:07.990 
done they're just snap that a little bit

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.090 
done they're just snap that a little bit
of<00:04:08.080> pressure<00:04:08.430> to<00:04:10.590> super<00:04:11.590> quality<00:04:11.890> meat

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
of pressure to super quality meat

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.920 
of pressure to super quality meat
definitely<00:04:12.670> it's<00:04:12.790> worth<00:04:12.910> paying<00:04:13.300> more<00:04:13.630> for

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
definitely it's worth paying more for

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.050 
definitely it's worth paying more for
something<00:04:14.590> a<00:04:14.770> bit<00:04:14.800> better<00:04:15.160> particular
