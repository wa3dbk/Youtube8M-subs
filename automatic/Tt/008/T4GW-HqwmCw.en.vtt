very simple way to do that okay I've got

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:26.630 
very simple way to do that okay I've got
two<00:00:24.300> pieces<00:00:24.989> of<00:00:25.200> branches<00:00:26.160> that's<00:00:26.310> Colin

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
two pieces of branches that's Colin

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.810 
two pieces of branches that's Colin
actually<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.270> bamboo<00:00:28.169> one's<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.369> little<00:00:29.730> bit

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
actually the bamboo one's a little bit

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.310 
actually the bamboo one's a little bit
flexible<00:00:29.939> probably<00:00:30.779> about<00:00:30.899> half<00:00:31.079> a<00:00:31.169> meter

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
flexible probably about half a meter

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.459 
flexible probably about half a meter
long<00:00:31.489> the<00:00:32.489> other<00:00:32.610> one<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.200> be<00:00:34.350> our

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
long the other one is going to be our

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.020 
long the other one is going to be our
spring<00:00:34.770> action<00:00:35.100> okay<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.910> that's

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
spring action okay and that's

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.690 
spring action okay and that's
approximately<00:00:36.300> say<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.320> made<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.650> long<00:00:37.890> very

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
approximately say I made a long very

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.330 
approximately say I made a long very
simple<00:00:39.060> at<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.050> end<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.440> remove<00:00:40.800> some<00:00:41.070> thread

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
simple at the end of remove some thread

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.920 
simple at the end of remove some thread
from<00:00:42.240> my<00:00:43.070> singlet<00:00:44.450> if<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.630> want<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.840> come

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
from my singlet if you want to come

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.270 
from my singlet if you want to come
closer<00:00:46.200> cameraman<00:00:46.740> I'll<00:00:46.920> show<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:49.100> okay<00:00:50.100> I'll

closer cameraman I'll show you okay I'll

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.910 
closer cameraman I'll show you okay I'll
remove<00:00:50.550> some<00:00:50.790> thread<00:00:51.530> actually<00:00:52.530> took<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.770> off

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
remove some thread actually took it off

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.120 
remove some thread actually took it off
from<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.760> bottom<00:00:53.880> of<00:00:54.060> the<00:00:54.120> pants<00:00:54.860> okay<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.070> I

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.130 
from the bottom of the pants okay and I

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.540 
from the bottom of the pants okay and I
created<00:00:56.489> two<00:00:56.730> loops<00:00:56.970> with<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:58.220> loop<00:00:59.220> number

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
created two loops with it loop number

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.479 
created two loops with it loop number
one<00:01:00.800> being<00:01:02.450> this<00:01:03.450> larger<00:01:03.899> loop<00:01:04.079> if<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.189> can<00:01:05.339> get

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
one being this larger loop if I can get

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.810 
one being this larger loop if I can get
my<00:01:05.670> hands<00:01:06.540> around<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:07.049> okay<00:01:10.520> so<00:01:11.520> I've<00:01:11.610> got<00:01:11.640> this

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
my hands around it okay so I've got this

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.800 
my hands around it okay so I've got this
large<00:01:12.180> loop<00:01:12.770> you<00:01:13.770> can<00:01:13.860> see<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.450> okay<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.690> I

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
large loop you can see that okay and I

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.160 
large loop you can see that okay and I
created<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.409> very<00:01:16.740> small<00:01:17.070> loop<00:01:17.870> again<00:01:18.870> with<00:01:19.050> the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
created a very small loop again with the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.140 
created a very small loop again with the
thread<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:20.060> here<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:22.670> okay<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:23.940> goes

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
thread and here it is okay and that goes

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.930 
thread and here it is okay and that goes
on<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.510> end<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.960> your<00:01:25.440> one<00:01:25.620> meter<00:01:25.830> rod<00:01:26.010> so<00:01:26.820> now

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
on the end of your one meter rod so now

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.700 
on the end of your one meter rod so now
I'm<00:01:27.000> going<00:01:27.120> to<00:01:27.180> set<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.420> up<00:01:27.479> for<00:01:27.659> you

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710

you<00:01:31.830> want<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.010> come<00:01:32.100> closer<00:01:32.280> camera<00:01:32.580> needs<00:01:32.700> to

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
you want to come closer camera needs to

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.960 
you want to come closer camera needs to
show<00:01:33.200> for<00:01:34.200> little<00:01:34.350> twigs<00:01:34.710> right<00:01:35.610> they<00:01:35.729> need<00:01:35.880> to

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
show for little twigs right they need to

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.620 
show for little twigs right they need to
have<00:01:36.090> very<00:01:36.450> smooth<00:01:36.720> surfaces<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.710> here<00:01:37.860> we<00:01:37.950> go

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
have very smooth surfaces so here we go

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.920 
have very smooth surfaces so here we go
so<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.750> first<00:01:39.960> thing<00:01:40.110> we<00:01:40.229> do<00:01:40.610> is<00:01:41.610> we<00:01:42.390> insert

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
so the first thing we do is we insert

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.590 
so the first thing we do is we insert
our<00:01:43.110> bow<00:01:43.440> the<00:01:44.130> cage<00:01:44.310> called<00:01:44.580> the<00:01:44.700> bow<00:01:44.880> at<00:01:45.090> times

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
our bow the cage called the bow at times

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.899 
our bow the cage called the bow at times
this<00:01:45.810> can<00:01:46.049> snap<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:46.890> preferably<00:01:47.340> try<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.670> get

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
this can snap so preferably try to get

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.420 
this can snap so preferably try to get
yourself<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.299> green<00:01:48.740> piece<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.770> branch<00:01:50.070> because

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
yourself a green piece of branch because

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.490 
yourself a green piece of branch because
they<00:01:50.580> are<00:01:50.700> far<00:01:51.240> more<00:01:51.270> flexible<00:01:52.460> so<00:01:54.260> we<00:01:55.260> stick

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
they are far more flexible so we stick

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:19.979 
they are far more flexible so we stick
that<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:56.299> then

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.870 

okay<00:02:20.989> you<00:02:21.050> stick<00:02:21.290> that<00:02:21.380> into<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.680> ground<00:02:21.880> and

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
okay you stick that into the ground and

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.809 
okay you stick that into the ground and
we<00:02:23.120> need<00:02:23.300> to<00:02:23.420> have<00:02:23.569> it<00:02:24.310> approximately<00:02:25.310> two

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
we need to have it approximately two

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.059 
we need to have it approximately two
inches<00:02:25.849> high<00:02:26.420> from<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.349> ground<00:02:27.380> if<00:02:27.860> you<00:02:27.950> want

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
inches high from the ground if you want

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.170

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
our L spring okay we stick that into the

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.420 
our L spring okay we stick that into the
ground<00:02:52.090> and<00:02:53.090> we<00:02:53.150> bend<00:02:53.600> it<00:02:53.750> down<00:02:54.160> so<00:02:55.160> that<00:02:55.190> the

small loop okay and we've been the

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.130 
small loop okay and we've been the
spring<00:03:37.730> down<00:03:37.910> just<00:03:38.450> got<00:03:38.570> to<00:03:38.660> be<00:03:38.720> careful<00:03:38.870> that

two and three and this triangle these

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.410 
two and three and this triangle these
sticks<00:04:16.340> must<00:04:16.610> be<00:04:16.730> pointing<00:04:17.180> okay<00:04:18.049> on<00:04:18.290> a<00:04:18.350> slant

sticks must be pointing okay on a slant
okay<00:04:20.450> towards<00:04:21.049> the<00:04:21.230> spring<00:04:22.330> now<00:04:23.330> with<00:04:23.840> ease

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
okay towards the spring now with ease

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.420 
okay towards the spring now with ease
and<00:04:24.470> we<00:04:24.590> need<00:04:24.710> to<00:04:24.770> be<00:04:24.860> careful<00:04:25.190> and<00:04:25.370> always

and we need to be careful and always
stay<00:04:25.760> away<00:04:25.970> from<00:04:26.030> the<00:04:26.210> spring<00:04:26.480> action<00:04:26.630> here

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
stay away from the spring action here

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.090 
stay away from the spring action here
because<00:04:27.230> it<00:04:27.320> can<00:04:27.350> whack<00:04:27.590> you<00:04:27.710> in<00:04:27.830> the<00:04:27.890> face<00:04:30.100> now

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
what we do is we open up the large loop

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.250 
what we do is we open up the large loop
okay<00:04:38.780> we<00:04:39.710> put<00:04:39.950> it<00:04:40.040> inside<00:04:40.280> out<00:04:40.930> to<00:04:41.930> create<00:04:42.140> a

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
okay we put it inside out to create a

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.870 
okay we put it inside out to create a
sliding<00:04:42.830> loop<00:04:44.500> okay<00:04:45.500> and<00:04:45.740> now<00:04:46.250> we<00:04:46.310> spread<00:04:46.670> it

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
sliding loop okay and now we spread it

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.790 
sliding loop okay and now we spread it
around<00:04:47.060> the<00:04:47.450> triangular<00:04:48.050> sticks<00:04:48.550> it's<00:04:49.550> one

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
around the triangular sticks it's one

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.840 
around the triangular sticks it's one
two<00:04:51.800> and<00:04:53.620> three

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
two and three

two and three
now<00:04:55.850> you're<00:04:56.210> just<00:04:56.510> the<00:04:56.630> sticks<00:04:56.900> so<00:04:57.140> you<00:04:57.350> get<00:04:57.500> a

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
now you're just the sticks so you get a

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.470 
now you're just the sticks so you get a
nice<00:04:57.800> tight<00:04:58.870> triangle<00:05:01.330> okay

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
nice tight triangle okay

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.750 
nice tight triangle okay
