00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 one enjoys a real fight in the 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.109
 elevator that two million already we are 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.960
 watching they discover in chile one of the 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.410
 dinosaurs of course that more than 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.410
 comment 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.859
 they are not looting our have achieved 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.580
 because the one from argentina as you can see 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.769
 like the big triple are going on 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:31.460
 that one is carnivore that the 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.460
 herbivores that a small chick like 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.910
 social networks what is the best 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.960
 dinosaur that has ours to be 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.960
 I tell you 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.789
 one always heard the saying no 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.140
 no matter what size it is but how it 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.140
 move then 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.050
 the thing with that 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.520
 for example the Chilean can be a lot 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.190
 more cash can be much more 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.390
 athletic much faster then what 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.739
 matter that we are big and 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.290
 we are seeing more chili elements 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.060
 saurus diego suárez and that the name of the 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.550
 young man of 7 years who discovered him the 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.180
 things that impress 148 million 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.180
 years 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.770
 in fact that he had not said so 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.410
 like crow's feet that looked like 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.789
 puma even notice that I do not know how in 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.410
 that part and that even also prey 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.630
 as you have them with members like 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.380
 diplodocus as audio ready to 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.990
 are these animals that are much more 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.429
 innocents are not predators are a 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.140
 tremendous discovery was made 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:47.789
 many years and now in this low 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.740
 absolutely rebuilt they do it 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.229
 publicly anyway de facto 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.050
 there is an intervention of several people 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.940
 geological experts and they are 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.160
 friends of the house somehow 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.890
 finally eyes as well as the cave of 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.750
 true milodón in our country this east 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.290
 dinosaur finally gives you a little bit the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.330
 mapping how they worked at the level of 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.680
 prehistory these tremendous creatures 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.320
 who were the true masters and lords 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.100
 of the sun or of the entire planet earth 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.420
 it must be said they lived before where 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.350
 many tens of millions of years 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.270
 later he would live receives the name of 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.130
 according to the official story never 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.610
 they coexisted with human beings and those 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:32.340
 they were the kings dinosaurs of bercy 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:40.560
 raptor is a gift is a gift from us 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:45.330
 in a short hand with the ex-politician already 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.860
 it was but let's keep talking 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.340
 regarding this true land of 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.340
 Argentina 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.190
 we are talking about a year and a half ago 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.440
 this dinosaur not 148 million years old 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.180
 to see that is much older than 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.340
 any tyrannosaur that is not going to 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.140
 to fail and that in fact the 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.140
 fourth movie of one 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.870
 unique that never 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.220
 in fact the news was read a boy from 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.810
 seven years but today that was 2004 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:41.410
 clear the one that is appearing in 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:41.410
 blue screen I think it came out 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.360
 when he was seven years old he discovered it 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.610
 believe and speaking has appeared because the 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.850
 People also was riding 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.860
 supporting and particular support is very 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.020
 complex because it brings together the three 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:03.170
 families of the saurians carnivorous book 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:05.530
 but most good things come in bottle 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.530
 boy 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.950
 with the manual 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.889
 notice that it has its degree of evolution 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:20.570
 it's like the intermediate state towards where 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.570
 the different species are going to shoot 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.470
 who work these blood animals 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.120
 hot and who were the ones 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.550
 they survived the ice age without 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.650
 But they, but like these cars 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.840
 hybrids that could eat from one thing or 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.430
 another had more good ability to 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.690
 evolve and finally as the 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.690
 quintero because there in the fourth 

00:04:40.569 --> 00:04:45.289
 yesterday title in a very very way 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.099
 Amused finally said as he wants 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.560
 as a filter 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:58.729
 finally the filter on the dog more 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:05:00.470
 smart finally the argentinian is 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:04.690
 your dinosaur I want to remind you that 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.690
 as in 1800 the leg with was our 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:14.560
 our says that they mock 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:27.000
 among the great saurian through 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.000
 social networks
