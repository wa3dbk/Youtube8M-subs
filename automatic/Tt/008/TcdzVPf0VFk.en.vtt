00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:09.809
 the official opening of the 16th edition of the Sertões rally with the 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.750
 realization of the prologue that defined the starting order for the first step 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.640
 of the competition this year the plumb had a new format besides having been realized 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.390
 Two different interconnected lanes were set up at night, causing a 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.520
 duel between the competitors who will line up from two to 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.980
 two about 15 thousand people filled the bleachers the fight started with a 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.219
 prologue of the pilots waved everything to ensure that the places on the start I 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.270
 I'm going to drink, I'll have fun 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.050
 in a circuit of this way the most difficult stretches of the course paulo 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.290
 Rogerio 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.900
 I think it does not have much secrecy, this time with you, it has to be the most 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.710
 fast 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.740
 what is possible 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.270
 to get a 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.240
 Lula left the dawn the goal of the program is to put the shoes 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.010
 where they should be placed on the side 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.770
 who walks the strongest and comes first who walks the slowest the date of the decision 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.700
 before that this perspective get the most out of the car 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.220
 and tries to drop among the top ten tries to accelerate the government can achieve 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.090
 the best time 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.009
 the teams 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.799
 about 5 thousand kilometers with many challenges. 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.310
 will pass through six states the sertões falls into the couple category 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.399
 it is a test of speed the winners at the end of the three days of 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.200
 proves that those in the sum of the results taking a lesser time effect 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.260
 everything is minutely calculated from the teams and working hard from the 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.260
 preparations every day have to be planned year 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.000
 and we got better time 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.120
 I'd already been with him for some time. 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.620
 four years 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.530
 he has already been two-time champions of last year's hinterland rally we've said 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.850
 so you do not have many changes if you have some 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.930
 very small adaptations I think the changes were more formal 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.370
 mechanics was elongated and was called 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.130
 so now we make adjustments 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.970
 stayed mute this got more stable
