00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.800
 which we can make out or 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.390

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.110
 that it is noticeable is the pretty white 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.710
 Chrome design that became practically that 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.200
 original from 1968 improved or how 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.910

 one still has this beautiful crown optics 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.180
 and sometimes in black and orange so 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.770
 if the other colors have had 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.399
 that's practically orange up here 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.800
 or black 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.479
 something is very nice in any case 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.610
 this handle is foldable then 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.259
 one can take practically high can the 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.880

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:49.410
 Consuming so under the grip of you above 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:52.170
 located on the top of the country 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.240

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.860
 you can adjust the volume of the program 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.750

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.899
 individual settings come earlier than 

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:08.610
 for example, the language around votes 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.860
 on the left side of the television 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.739
 there is a metal badge on 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.080

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.209
 You can receive this over here 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.859
 If you have a video you can 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.690

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:53.930
