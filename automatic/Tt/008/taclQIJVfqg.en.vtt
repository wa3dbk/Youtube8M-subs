I was starting to research for this
video<00:00:17.599> kind<00:00:17.960> of<00:00:18.080> going<00:00:18.349> on<00:00:18.439> Pinterest<00:00:19.160> and

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
video kind of going on Pinterest and

video kind of going on Pinterest and
Tumblr<00:00:19.550> and<00:00:20.090> figuring<00:00:20.750> out<00:00:20.900> DIY<00:00:21.410> gifts<00:00:21.830> and

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:21.950

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:24.919 
then I like stopped and I figured why

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:26.560 
then I like stopped and I figured why
would<00:00:25.189> I<00:00:25.220> do<00:00:25.340> any<00:00:25.669> of<00:00:25.820> this<00:00:25.939> stuff<00:00:26.059> if<00:00:26.390> I

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
would I do any of this stuff if I

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.630 
would I do any of this stuff if I

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:21.980 
something and then go ahead and take

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.730 
something and then go ahead and take
your<00:01:22.040> sharpies<00:01:22.580> and<00:01:22.610> just<00:01:23.180> outline<00:01:23.870> the

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
your sharpies and just outline the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.120 
your sharpies and just outline the
design<00:01:25.610> with<00:01:26.090> little<00:01:26.540> dots<00:01:26.810> around<00:01:27.140> it<00:01:27.500> and<00:01:27.680> I

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
design with little dots around it and I

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.350 
design with little dots around it and I
learned<00:01:28.340> this<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:28.550> hard<00:01:28.670> way<00:01:28.880> that<00:01:29.000> you<00:01:29.210> need

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
learned this the hard way that you need

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.110 
learned this the hard way that you need
a<00:01:29.510> lot<00:01:29.780> of<00:01:29.840> dots<00:01:30.140> to<00:01:30.440> outline<00:01:30.830> the<00:01:31.120> design

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
a lot of dots to outline the design

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.400 
a lot of dots to outline the design
otherwise<00:01:32.480> it<00:01:32.690> really<00:01:32.900> won't<00:01:33.050> look<00:01:33.200> like

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
otherwise it really won't look like

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.110 
otherwise it really won't look like
anything<00:01:33.830> and<00:01:34.040> then<00:01:34.460> you<00:01:34.580> can<00:01:34.730> go<00:01:34.880> ahead<00:01:34.910> and

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
anything and then you can go ahead and

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.200
