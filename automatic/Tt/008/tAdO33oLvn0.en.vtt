spokes direct from Easton this is just a
regular<00:00:20.430> straight<00:00:20.820> pole<00:00:21.150> spoke<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.720> you

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
regular straight pole spoke and you

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.769 
regular straight pole spoke and you
spoke<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.320> correct<00:00:22.890> length<00:00:23.130> will<00:00:23.430> do<00:00:23.779> it's

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
spoke the correct length will do it's

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.929 
spoke the correct length will do it's
also<00:00:24.900> worth<00:00:25.199> noting<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:25.680> these<00:00:26.340> wheels<00:00:26.609> use

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
also worth noting that these wheels use

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.560 
also worth noting that these wheels use
the<00:00:27.210> same<00:00:27.449> spoke<00:00:27.920> front<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.160> rear<00:00:29.570> non-drive

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
the same spoke front and rear non-drive

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.229 
the same spoke front and rear non-drive
side<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:31.140> drive<00:00:31.410> side<00:00:31.679> so<00:00:32.309> one<00:00:32.759> spoke<00:00:33.059> will

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
cover the whole wheel set we've also got

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.479 
cover the whole wheel set we've also got
a<00:00:35.100> five<00:00:35.399> pack<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.910> Easton<00:00:36.270> UST<00:00:36.750> nipples<00:00:37.140> here

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
a five pack of Easton UST nipples here

a five pack of Easton UST nipples here
this<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.730> only<00:00:38.820> proprietary<00:00:39.540> piece

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
this is the only proprietary piece

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.840 
this is the only proprietary piece
because<00:00:40.170> it's<00:00:40.320> threaded<00:00:40.649> on<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.190> inside<00:00:41.579> and

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
because it's threaded on the inside and

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.420 
because it's threaded on the inside and
the<00:00:42.149> outside<00:00:42.410> the<00:00:43.410> reason<00:00:43.770> we<00:00:43.860> do<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.070> is

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
the outside the reason we do this is

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.010 
the outside the reason we do this is
because<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.820> allows<00:00:44.910> us<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.270> make<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.719> really

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
because it allows us to make a really

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.549 
because it allows us to make a really
lightweight<00:00:46.289> UST<00:00:47.190> rim<00:00:47.809> that's<00:00:48.809> fully<00:00:49.200> sealed

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
lightweight UST rim that's fully sealed

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.220 
lightweight UST rim that's fully sealed
on<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.070> outside<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:51.020> throughs<00:00:52.020> like<00:00:52.199> a

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
on the outside and throughs like a

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.410 
on the outside and throughs like a
normal<00:00:52.559> wheel<00:00:52.710> before<00:00:53.670> we<00:00:53.910> get<00:00:54.000> started<00:00:54.180> we're

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
normal wheel before we get started we're

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.150 
normal wheel before we get started we're
going<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.600> need<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.750> couple<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.050> things<00:00:55.160> we're

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
going to need a couple of things we're

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
the outside of the threads so now I'm

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.340 
the outside of the threads so now I'm
going<00:01:42.520> to<00:01:42.610> thread<00:01:43.060> this<00:01:43.180> assembly<00:01:43.780> into<00:01:44.230> the

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.730 
reverse thread and so probably fine

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:54.090 
reverse thread and so probably fine

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
doing this to make sure you don't

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.250 
doing this to make sure you don't
undress<00:01:56.530> bak<00:01:57.070> from<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.400> nipple

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
undress bak from the nipple

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.900 
undress bak from the nipple
