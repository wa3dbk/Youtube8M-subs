to the body using some schools or if you
prefer<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.660> can<00:00:48.899> use<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:49.110> small<00:00:49.469> amount<00:00:49.770> of

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
prefer you can use a small amount of

prefer you can use a small amount of
double-sided<00:00:50.579> tape<00:00:55.399> we<00:00:56.399> also<00:00:56.550> need<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.879> sensor

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
double-sided tape we also need a sensor

recommend<00:01:19.290> using<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.740> mini<00:01:19.890> breadboard

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
recommend using a mini breadboard

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:33.950 
recommend using a mini breadboard
although<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.180> don't<00:01:21.420> have<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:32.600> if<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.750> looks

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
although you don't have to if it looks

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.480 
although you don't have to if it looks
like<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.350> hole<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.829> telling<00:01:35.159> with<00:01:35.310> you

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
like the hole this is telling with you

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.010 
like the hole this is telling with you
then<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.000> know<00:01:36.180> you've<00:01:36.390> done<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.720> light<00:01:39.020> now

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
then you know you've done it light now

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.280 
then you know you've done it light now
gather<00:01:40.350> some<00:01:40.680> wires<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.960> connect<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.049> sensor

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
gather some wires and connect the sensor

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.560 
gather some wires and connect the sensor
to<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.649> Arduino<00:01:44.310> according<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.149> diagram

to the Arduino according to this diagram

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.649 
to the Arduino according to this diagram
I<00:01:45.869> made<00:01:46.670> to<00:01:47.670> look<00:01:47.790> like<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.270> when<00:01:48.509> you're

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
I made to look like this when you're

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.859 
I made to look like this when you're
done<00:01:49.520> unfortunately<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:51.420> know<00:01:51.479> do<00:01:51.659> we<00:01:51.750> know

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
done unfortunately you know do we know

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.929 
done unfortunately you know do we know
can't<00:01:52.140> control<00:01:52.649> this<00:01:52.829> emotion<00:01:53.340> by<00:01:53.549> itself

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
can't control this emotion by itself

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.590 
can't control this emotion by itself
because<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.630> cones<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.110> generating<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.009> -<00:01:56.280> low

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
because the cones is generating a - low

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.929 
because the cones is generating a - low
vol<00:01:57.600> Vil<00:01:57.810> they<00:01:58.140> cannot<00:01:58.380> be<00:01:58.590> built<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.549> can

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
vol Vil they cannot be built so you can

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.319 
vol Vil they cannot be built so you can
change<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.509> direction<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.259> motor

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
change the direction of the motor

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.690 
change the direction of the motor
so<00:02:03.259> that<00:02:03.590> we're<00:02:03.799> going<00:02:03.920> to<00:02:03.979> use<00:02:04.189> a<00:02:04.219> moto<00:02:04.520> she

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700
