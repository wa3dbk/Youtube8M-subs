00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
infielders gloves

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.229 
infielders gloves
they're<00:00:44.420> both<00:00:45.399> middle<00:00:46.399> infield<00:00:46.760> but<00:00:47.059> you<00:00:47.120> can

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
they're both middle infield but you can

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.049 
they're both middle infield but you can
also<00:00:47.360> use<00:00:47.540> for<00:00:47.660> third<00:00:47.870> base<00:00:48.079> as<00:00:48.350> well

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
also use for third base as well

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.260 
also use for third base as well
primarily<00:00:50.059> though<00:00:50.540> like<00:00:51.050> more<00:00:51.380> like<00:00:51.559> a<00:00:52.270> middle

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
primarily though like more like a middle

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.600 
primarily though like more like a middle
infielder<00:00:53.510> but<00:00:54.079> at<00:00:54.590> your<00:00:54.829> lower<00:00:54.980> ages<00:00:55.370> you<00:00:55.489> can

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
infielder but at your lower ages you can

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.880 
infielder but at your lower ages you can
use<00:00:55.730> it<00:00:55.820> for<00:00:55.910> third<00:00:56.090> base<00:00:56.380> with<00:00:57.380> not<00:00:57.530> without<00:00:57.860> a

problem<00:00:58.160> and<00:00:58.370> some<00:00:58.610> guys<00:00:58.790> still<00:00:59.120> use<00:00:59.270> them<00:00:59.480> at

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
problem and some guys still use them at

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.400 
problem and some guys still use them at
the<00:00:59.690> older<00:00:59.899> ages<00:01:00.219> for<00:01:01.219> third<00:01:01.370> base<00:01:01.579> so<00:01:02.410> but

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410

very - very nice gloves this one is
treated<00:01:05.600> and<00:01:05.899> broken<00:01:06.200> in<00:01:06.289> more<00:01:07.090> than<00:01:08.090> this<00:01:08.329> one

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
treated and broken in more than this one

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.779 
treated and broken in more than this one
but<00:01:09.289> they<00:01:09.409> both<00:01:09.439> you<00:01:10.159> know<00:01:10.249> right<00:01:10.459> out<00:01:10.490> of<00:01:10.609> the

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:10.789 
but they both you know right out of the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:15.300 
but they both you know right out of the
store<00:01:11.539> right<00:01:12.499> off<00:01:12.619> the<00:01:12.740> shelf<00:01:13.240> they<00:01:14.240> close

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
store right off the shelf they close

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.739 
store right off the shelf they close
pretty<00:01:16.310> easily<00:01:16.549> this<00:01:16.999> one<00:01:17.149> is<00:01:17.209> pretty<00:01:17.359> easy<00:01:17.479> so

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:17.749 
pretty easily this one is pretty easy so

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:18.789 
pretty easily this one is pretty easy so
this<00:01:18.049> just<00:01:18.259> needs<00:01:18.350> a<00:01:18.469> little<00:01:18.560> bit<00:01:18.679> more

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
this just needs a little bit more

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.120 
this just needs a little bit more
breaking<00:01:19.219> in<00:01:19.310> with<00:01:19.429> just<00:01:19.639> basically<00:01:20.630> throwing

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
breaking in with just basically throwing

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.639 
breaking in with just basically throwing
catching<00:01:23.170> throwing<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.319> ball<00:01:24.469> into<00:01:24.590> the

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
catching throwing the ball into the

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.639 
catching throwing the ball into the
glove<00:01:24.920> and<00:01:25.340> catching<00:01:25.729> and<00:01:25.959> this<00:01:26.959> one<00:01:27.139> here<00:01:27.529> is

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
glove and catching and this one here is

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.300 
glove and catching and this one here is
broken<00:01:28.490> in<00:01:28.579> more<00:01:28.729> so<00:01:28.939> I'll<00:01:29.029> show<00:01:29.209> you<00:01:30.249> this<00:01:31.249> one

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
broken in more so I'll show you this one

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.499 
broken in more so I'll show you this one
squeeze<00:01:31.670> is<00:01:31.849> a<00:01:31.880> lot<00:01:32.090> easier<00:01:32.420> so<00:01:34.299> this<00:01:35.299> one<00:01:35.479> I

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
squeeze is a lot easier so this one I

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.190 
squeeze is a lot easier so this one I
say<00:01:35.779> here<00:01:36.020> is<00:01:36.409> designed<00:01:36.590> more<00:01:36.950> for<00:01:37.869> between<00:01:38.869> 10

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
say here is designed more for between 10

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.679 
say here is designed more for between 10
and<00:01:39.939> 12<00:01:40.939> maybe<00:01:41.270> even<00:01:41.539> 13<00:01:41.929> possibly<00:01:43.539> if<00:01:44.539> you're

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
and 12 maybe even 13 possibly if you're

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.300 
and 12 maybe even 13 possibly if you're
playing<00:01:44.869> on<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.049> smaller<00:01:45.319> bases<00:01:45.740> you<00:01:46.159> can

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
playing on the smaller bases you can

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.999 
playing on the smaller bases you can
still<00:01:46.490> use<00:01:46.700> it<00:01:46.729> at<00:01:46.969> the<00:01:47.749> older<00:01:48.439> levels<00:01:48.799> for

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
still use it at the older levels for

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.309 
still use it at the older levels for
like<00:01:49.340> literally<00:01:49.579> juniors<00:01:50.090> and<00:01:50.560> seniors<00:01:51.560> but

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319 
like literally juniors and seniors but

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:57.129 
like literally juniors and seniors but
it<00:01:54.319> can't<00:01:54.560> take<00:01:54.709> as<00:01:54.859> much<00:01:55.069> of<00:01:55.939> a<00:01:56.509> force<00:01:56.810> of

00:01:57.129 --> 00:01:57.139 
it can't take as much of a force of

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:59.229 
it can't take as much of a force of
balls<00:01:57.469> being<00:01:57.679> hit<00:01:57.859> hard<00:01:57.889> to<00:01:58.249> it<00:01:58.399> as<00:01:58.549> this<00:01:59.029> one

00:01:59.229 --> 00:01:59.239 
balls being hit hard to it as this one

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:01.089 
balls being hit hard to it as this one
can<00:01:59.270> and<00:01:59.749> this<00:02:00.289> one<00:02:00.439> probably<00:02:00.709> you<00:02:00.829> want<00:02:01.009> to

00:02:01.089 --> 00:02:01.099 
can and this one probably you want to

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:03.940 
can and this one probably you want to
probably<00:02:01.310> go<00:02:01.729> up<00:02:01.880> to<00:02:01.999> about<00:02:02.179> H<00:02:02.359> 14<00:02:02.840> maybe<00:02:03.649> even

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
probably go up to about H 14 maybe even

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.050 
probably go up to about H 14 maybe even
