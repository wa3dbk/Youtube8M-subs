00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.000
 By Ex-SOLDIER 

00:00:22.602 --> 00:00:24.915
 Four centuries ago ... 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:27.306
 Secure the load. 

00:00:27.677 --> 00:00:31.193
 ... with the power that could change the evolution of history ... 

00:00:31.586 --> 00:00:33.026
 ... lost. 

00:00:34.157 --> 00:00:36.040
 She searched for her for generations ... 

00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:37.601
 Look at that, Snowy. 

00:00:37.602 --> 00:00:41.106
 It has long been said that the ship was carrying something secret. 

00:00:41.567 --> 00:00:43.928
 ... but nobody found a clue. 

00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:46.380
 Until now. 

00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:48.493
 FROM THE TWO BEST PRESENTS OF THE PRESENT 

00:00:48.661 --> 00:00:50.525
 There was a track in that model ... 

00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:53.854
 ... which leads to one of the greatest secrets of all time. 

00:00:54.034 --> 00:00:55.404
 From director STEVEN SPIELBERG 

00:00:55.654 --> 00:00:58.225
 I warn you. Leave it alone while you can. 

00:00:59.012 --> 00:01:01.017
 You don't want to mess with those people. 

00:01:01.243 --> 00:01:02.961
 and producer PETER JACKSON 

00:01:04.078 --> 00:01:07.764
 I'll find the ship. Whether with or without your help. 

00:01:11.892 --> 00:01:13.908
 Thanks. And by the way, my name is Tintin. 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.165
 Haddock. Archibald Haddock. 

00:01:16.254 --> 00:01:17.710
 Someone locked the door. 

00:01:18.118 --> 00:01:19.518
 The keys, Snowy. 

00:01:20.733 --> 00:01:22.269
 Not the sandwich! 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:23.735
 The keys! 

00:01:28.777 --> 00:01:30.429
 CHRISTMAS SUMMER 

00:01:31.362 --> 00:01:33.563
 How could you let them escape! 

00:01:34.675 --> 00:01:36.363
 AGAINST GOLD 

00:01:36.364 --> 00:01:38.548
 If Sakharine finds the ship ahead, it's over! 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.338
 It's not just about the ship ... 

00:01:41.915 --> 00:01:43.624
 He wants revenge! 

00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:45.552
 A BREAKFAST WORLD 

00:01:45.553 --> 00:01:47.223
 You see it, Tintin? 

00:01:50.473 --> 00:01:51.903
 THE UNBELIEVABLE ADVENTURE 

00:01:51.904 --> 00:01:54.032
 Maybe it sounds crazy, but I have a plan. 

00:01:54.206 --> 00:01:55.392
 Great! 

00:01:58.088 --> 00:01:59.569
 Did you hit anything? 

00:02:00.292 --> 00:02:01.526
 For God's sake ... 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.423
 - Earth! - We're not there yet! 

00:02:03.424 --> 00:02:05.604
 No! There's the land! 

00:02:06.692 --> 00:02:08.517
 TINTIN'S ADVENTURE 

00:02:08.622 --> 00:02:11.924
 You looked cold, so I started a smaller fire. 

00:02:11.925 --> 00:02:13.123
 In the boat? 

00:02:14.343 --> 00:02:15.689
 We're in a pretty mess. 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:22.565
 Hold on, Tintin!
