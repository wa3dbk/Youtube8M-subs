00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.640
 Yes it 's a bit bad Today is a little bit long iphone game app 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.980
 I would like to introduce to you 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:15.240
 Well, it is a game called this Samana's War to introduce this in the introduction year to the last 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.110
 But recently I'm doing a little TV cm I'm doing this This little TV cm 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.130
 But I was even know hit look 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:23.770
 I thought about trying to play and I tried 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:28.720
 So this time 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.140
 I'm not using a cable connection, so I haven't captured it with the mac os feature 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.070
 is 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.920
 I'm doing capture with software that has been used from a long time ago called a reflector 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:39.450
 For a little reason 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:43.710
 It was a good one, but a bit of a recording. 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.740
 Anyway, what kind of game is this game let me introduce Seri easily 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.010
 Hmm 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:53.190
 I already have a field like my own 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.190
 You can place various facilities here first 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:04.190
 This facility is variously purchased and arranged at this shop, and my area is 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:07.730
 What it says will be expanding 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:15.240
 I have the sound element of the wrong game 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:18.900
 In because much is Tteyuu his summons to such is not the king while continue to extend this island 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:24.060
 Monster I am a game I'm playing while summoning 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:26.730
 We'd have this Once the characters who are doing cute here brought up the kids 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:32.360
 While evolving 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:36.410
 It is a game of fighting with that rival who will capture the dungeon 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.240
 It is a great simple way of battle, let's show battle for a while 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.670
 eh 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.670
 There are fields, for example 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.520
 I Do not place cry 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:53.170
 For example, there are men and women in various places like this and I mostly go 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:57.509
 Transfers and characters are like this, they are removed and replaced 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.509
 I can choose a color, but I do have this 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.820
 A monster is arranged in the back in such a feeling and one's character 3 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:08.830
 You are in front of you 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:10.840
 He uses that to get in Yeah three I Oto eaten the like are also freely in the triangular prism 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.940
 The center will start 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:20.960
 At all cats of the dungeon with those of the eddy's I'd margin level characters who 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:24.580
 But the animation is quite gorgeous and interesting, isn't it? 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.380
 There is a little park room when you come to the line 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:32.960
 Let's put income command according to 4 stents 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:36.070
 Technique also 1 I'd have either three Toka two-option and in the character playing while pastor this 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.070
 It feels like going 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:45.050
 It's a little role playing game at the hotel 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:48.890
 I like it because I can play quite lightly 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:54.230
 I do not have a summoner for 2 minutes recently 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:59.780
 At the end of the 8 dungeons, I came back to the warp a little now 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:01.220
 It is written like this achievement, and I get a little reward when I open it here 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.430
 you know 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:08.220
 Collect these things in the past aso red red 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:12.000
 There are many things on the right side, but the top is stamina 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:18.400
 I wonder if there Kana number of times the arena was Kke it under a do 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.700
 Then it was like a crystal, but it 's like money, with a red crystal 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.800
 A place to summon here 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:29.740
 I have a place to summon here 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:31.200
 Such or needed a red crystal to here on whether the summons because Rearea characters 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:37.010
 It is a thing 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:39.710
 I would like to try normal summoning of the way that I like to try 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:44.090
 I feel like you are in the shop 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.990
 It does not come out the so much a big deal because the normal summons does not come out only guy from 1 of 3 stars 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.330
 is 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:50.210
 I think the shoes are better than the elements 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:55.930
 This attribute 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:04:01.540
 Let's be close to the character summoned like this 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:03.740
 Pick a backlit character at the magic square for reinforcement 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.910
 Moving car 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.030
 Ne 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.710
 Tomb 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:14.810
 ANYTHING or, for example, between these guys is life Well 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:16.900
 If you'll reinforced with such feeling 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:20.340
 The level goes up 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.660
 Because it bent Repeat 2 battle the level 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.040
 Oh dear 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.040
 It is such a thing 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.700
 It went 400 pa toilet quite ne physical strength strongly became offensive force 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.130
 Well is this say game by Oh that 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:47.960
 Go to strengthen the monsters Te' to strengthen their field 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.740
 Game is I Utsu's Hey now N Toko friends say eating all of the dungeon the day 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:54.290
 Since there is no 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:58.280
 I'm doing silently alone, but I say friends or maybe I belong to a guild 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:03.230
 I think that the pitch will spread more and more 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:07.130
 If you should make a friend, Figure 3 is like that 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:10.400
 id ã‚¦ max max I do not do it 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:15.460
 If you see Mr. Uz please invite a friend 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:18.789
 If you 're doing that kind of summoner, you might get stuck 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.080
 I would be glad if you could help me a bit 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:20.790
 Yes 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.409
 It has been hanging 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:26.979
 Pretty friend 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:31.360
 I guess I understand somehow in the fact that I'm not you registered 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:35.570
 It's like playing a game like this 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:41.120
 Because the store is great, it is easy to play and a great lesbian 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:42.510
 In which I thought I should try playing Nazoa a while this way to sing also I cute characters 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.860
 I will 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:50.500
 Come mirrored of Once There are those who can and if little friend registration As I said earlier 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.300
 Please invite a character 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:56.030
 As long as there is a vacancy 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:06:01.580
 I think that I can approve that 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:05.690
 Well then another video is a feature of this kind of smartphone game after all though it is a vibe 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:09.030
 It evolved a character I want to strongly and party 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.390
 Because material items and so on are needed 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.460
 Naka Naka I 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:16.569
 It's strange this is a little easier 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:19.289
 Ugh feel that strongly accustomed Baso is 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:19.289
 And the old generation
