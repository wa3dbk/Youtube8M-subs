00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:08.990
 hotels.com fritz 2144 and now there are 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.610
 the sweet apps of original wagner 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.070
 that's exactly what flavors are 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.420
 apple vanilla 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:21.180
 recently chocolate hazelnut was indeed accurate 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.680
 there are other stuff here first 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.529
 the taste actually knows 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:32.579
 Not all cases exist 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:37.760
 made from 92 percent sugar and ingredients 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:52.620
 apple rolls cream fraiche exactly 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:56.539
 dining room and retrieve and now as 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.539
 even the last one inside 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.439
 so it's done then we have me 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:18.119
 but I think a little bit too 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:29.459
 made long though I'm just fine 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:32.909
 so yes preheat without baking one 

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:34.380
 you have to do a lot of small art 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.090
 experience has only there for 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.890
 own big and so on with me 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.219
 meanwhile, I almost only 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:49.229
 still experience from the oven 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:51.950
 push or the time exactly smells nice 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:02:01.619
 for apple in all cases 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:06.709
 I believe that almonds here on it exactly 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.709
 These are prepared for the Mandl Foundation 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:17.090
 of course the fragmentation, so to speak 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.680
 in all cases still a longitudinal section 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.709
 I also say very juicy and very much 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.790
 Creamy longitudinal section I cut now 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.790
 the topping off, so to speak 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:36.019
 that's how it looks like a bit 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.019
 Hot I'll let it cool down like that 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:43.040
 then we do not want to burn 

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:43.040
 It does not have to be necessarily 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:58.010
 first distract a bit that some 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:58.010
 very nice, very funny 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:17.110
 This cream fraiche is related to 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:17.110
 the apple in the beginning 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.080
 soft on the outside crispy inside 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.910
 it is difficult to load that 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:55.790
 yes okay I would be full movie 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.790
 crass 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:16.509
 above all, so to speak, the combination in 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:19.419
 fresh up almonds and respect to you 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:23.530
 say march sukalia believe 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.729
 but I noticed here that this 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.680
 cream fraiche taste especially 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:32.349
 probably a fat he anyway 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:36.699
 transporter of good taste 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:05:10.960
 so to speak, so hopefully no actor the 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:05:15.099
 what they still be relatively rare 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:18.180
 crewchief musician who was first in first 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:18.180
 impression alms 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.080
 so has as a superlative 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:26.629
 the job is still out 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:31.659
 michael ballack even has apple live 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:31.659
 chats 30 fine fest 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.879
 offer these
