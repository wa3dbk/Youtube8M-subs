00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
you can see we got about 70 FPS stable

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.799 
you can see we got about 70 FPS stable
at<00:00:47.989> 70<00:00:48.530> FPS<00:00:48.650> when<00:00:49.190> we<00:00:49.430> are<00:00:49.550> running<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:50.120> when

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
at 70 FPS when we are running and when

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.680 
at 70 FPS when we are running and when
we<00:00:50.989> are<00:00:51.140> at<00:00:51.320> a<00:00:51.410> straight<00:00:52.180> that's<00:00:53.180> almost<00:00:53.540> the

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
we are at a straight that's almost the

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.889 
we are at a straight that's almost the
same<00:00:53.930> as<00:00:54.199> ever<00:00:54.800> we<00:00:55.100> get<00:00:55.340> when<00:00:56.210> we<00:00:56.360> are<00:00:56.480> in<00:00:56.750> the

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
same as ever we get when we are in the

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:57.459 
same as ever we get when we are in the
car

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
car

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.049 
car
but<00:00:58.280> it's<00:00:58.610> a<00:00:58.940> bit<00:00:59.270> lower<00:01:00.190> I'm<00:01:01.190> recording<00:01:01.850> with

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
but it's a bit lower I'm recording with

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.639 
but it's a bit lower I'm recording with
Nvidia<00:01:02.989> shadowplay<00:01:03.260> and<00:01:04.070> I<00:01:05.059> have<00:01:05.810> one<00:01:06.229> two

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
Nvidia shadowplay and I have one two

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:09.790 
Nvidia shadowplay and I have one two
three<00:01:06.680> or<00:01:07.009> a<00:01:07.580> bit<00:01:08.119> more<00:01:08.149> FPS<00:01:08.750> when<00:01:09.320> I'm<00:01:09.530> not

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
three or a bit more FPS when I'm not

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.550 
three or a bit more FPS when I'm not
recording<00:01:10.039> and<00:01:10.610> when<00:01:11.570> I'm<00:01:11.720> driving<00:01:12.110> it's

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
recording and when I'm driving it's

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.940 
recording and when I'm driving it's
about<00:01:12.830> the<00:01:13.100> 70<00:01:13.729> almost<00:01:14.450> the<00:01:14.570> stable<00:01:15.140> when<00:01:15.649> I'm

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
about the 70 almost the stable when I'm

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.859 
about the 70 almost the stable when I'm
driving<00:01:16.310> too<00:01:16.700> but<00:01:17.180> when<00:01:17.600> there<00:01:17.840> are

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
driving too but when there are

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.230 
driving too but when there are
explosives<00:01:18.530> and<00:01:19.009> things<00:01:19.280> that<00:01:19.670> I've<00:01:19.940> got

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
explosives and things that I've got

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.170 
explosives and things that I've got
about<00:01:20.539> 65<00:01:21.170> fps<00:01:22.750> so<00:01:24.310> let's<00:01:25.310> take<00:01:25.580> a<00:01:25.640> look<00:01:25.910> at

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
about 65 fps so let's take a look at

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.000 
about 65 fps so let's take a look at
these<00:01:26.840> settings<00:01:28.180> as<00:01:29.180> you<00:01:30.110> can<00:01:30.200> see<00:01:30.470> I'm<00:01:30.740> not

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
these settings as you can see I'm not

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.060 
these settings as you can see I'm not
using<00:01:31.270> advanced<00:01:32.270> graphics<00:01:32.780> at<00:01:32.990> all<00:01:33.200> it<00:01:33.500> really

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
using advanced graphics at all it really

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.640 
using advanced graphics at all it really
eats<00:01:34.400> FPS<00:01:35.270> I<00:01:35.479> don't<00:01:35.780> know<00:01:35.990> why<00:01:36.229> it's<00:01:36.530> not

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
eats FPS I don't know why it's not

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.179 
eats FPS I don't know why it's not
really<00:01:37.159> optimized<00:01:37.700> for<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:38.590> for<00:01:39.590> digital<00:01:40.009> or

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
really optimized for the for digital or

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.760 
really optimized for the for digital or
graphic<00:01:40.670> art<00:01:40.939> it<00:01:41.570> is<00:01:41.750> really<00:01:41.780> optimized<00:01:42.560> when

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
graphic art it is really optimized when

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.710 
graphic art it is really optimized when
you're<00:01:42.950> using<00:01:43.250> else<00:01:43.640> a<00:01:43.790> lie<00:01:43.939> or<00:01:44.270> something

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
you're using else a lie or something

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.440 
you're using else a lie or something
like<00:01:45.140> that<00:01:45.409> but<00:01:46.100> as<00:01:46.369> you<00:01:46.640> can<00:01:46.729> see<00:01:46.970> in<00:01:47.210> the

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
like that but as you can see in the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.109 
like that but as you can see in the
graphics<00:01:47.990> everything<00:01:48.590> is<00:01:49.040> only<00:01:49.759> very<00:01:50.030> high

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
graphics everything is only very high

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.160 
graphics everything is only very high
and<00:01:50.600> ultra<00:01:51.009> as<00:01:52.009> you<00:01:52.220> can<00:01:52.310> see<00:01:52.520> I'm<00:01:52.729> using<00:01:53.079> FX

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
and ultra as you can see I'm using FX

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.789 
and ultra as you can see I'm using FX
AAA<00:01:54.320> I'm<00:01:54.979> not<00:01:55.369> using<00:01:55.640> MSA<00:01:56.509> at<00:01:56.900> all<00:01:57.140> because<00:01:57.380> it

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
AAA I'm not using MSA at all because it

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:01.270 
AAA I'm not using MSA at all because it
is<00:01:57.950> eating<00:01:58.540> FPS<00:01:59.540> almost<00:01:59.840> like<00:02:00.290> the<00:02:00.650> advanced

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
is eating FPS almost like the advanced

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.940 
is eating FPS almost like the advanced
graphics<00:02:01.790> but<00:02:02.570> when<00:02:03.110> we<00:02:03.790> put<00:02:04.790> it<00:02:05.000> on<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:05.360> x2<00:02:05.950> it

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
graphics but when we put it on the x2 it

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.190 
graphics but when we put it on the x2 it
is<00:02:07.189> completely<00:02:07.640> stable<00:02:08.030> and<00:02:08.360> almost<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:08.989> same

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
is completely stable and almost the same

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.190 
is completely stable and almost the same
fps<00:02:09.739> like<00:02:10.009> before<00:02:10.399> but<00:02:10.940> I<00:02:11.090> don't<00:02:11.450> like<00:02:11.750> it<00:02:11.989> at

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
fps like before but I don't like it at

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.729 
fps like before but I don't like it at
all

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
all

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.220 
all
as<00:02:13.160> you<00:02:13.640> can<00:02:13.730> see<00:02:13.940> Westen's<00:02:14.480> is<00:02:14.690> turned<00:02:14.989> off

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
as you can see Westen's is turned off

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.199 
as you can see Westen's is turned off
that's<00:02:15.590> because<00:02:15.950> I'm<00:02:16.220> recording<00:02:16.910> right<00:02:16.970> now

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
that's because I'm recording right now

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.830 
that's because I'm recording right now
and<00:02:17.930> I<00:02:18.140> want<00:02:18.440> you<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:18.680> see<00:02:19.070> how<00:02:19.640> many<00:02:19.700> FPS<00:02:20.239> did<00:02:20.750> I

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
and I want you to see how many FPS did I

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.590 
and I want you to see how many FPS did I
