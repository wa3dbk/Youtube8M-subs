00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
to have almost no background noise

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.550 
to have almost no background noise
I<00:02:13.160> find<00:02:14.060> that<00:02:14.180> there's<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.570> lot<00:02:14.720> of<00:02:14.780> good<00:02:14.930> voices

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
I find that there's a lot of good voices

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.310 
I find that there's a lot of good voices
out<00:02:16.010> there<00:02:16.040> but<00:02:16.940> due<00:02:17.240> to<00:02:17.270> equipment<00:02:17.660> or

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
out there but due to equipment or

inducing<00:02:23.240> for<00:02:23.570> me<00:02:23.720> I<00:02:23.960> know<00:02:24.800> others<00:02:25.400> feel<00:02:25.760> that

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
inducing for me I know others feel that

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.140 
inducing for me I know others feel that
background<00:02:26.570> noise<00:02:26.810> aids<00:02:27.290> the<00:02:27.920> tingles<00:02:28.400> but

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
background noise aids the tingles but

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.780 
background noise aids the tingles but
for<00:02:29.450> me<00:02:29.570> it<00:02:29.690> does<00:02:29.930> not<00:02:30.520> and<00:02:31.520> also<00:02:31.970> I<00:02:33.670> want<00:02:34.670> to
