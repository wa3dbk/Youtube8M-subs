it's time it's time to get to business
and<00:03:57.580> I<00:03:57.820> think<00:03:58.030> you<00:03:58.150> all<00:03:58.270> know<00:03:58.480> that<00:03:58.510> I<00:03:59.520> honestly

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
and I think you all know that I honestly

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.310 
and I think you all know that I honestly
think<00:04:00.910> the<00:04:01.030> reason<00:04:01.240> that<00:04:01.390> i<00:04:01.540> haven't<00:04:01.750> had<00:04:01.959> most

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
think the reason that i haven't had most

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.050 
think the reason that i haven't had most
of<00:04:02.440> us<00:04:02.620> as<00:04:02.830> far<00:04:03.070> as<00:04:03.190> this<00:04:03.310> being<00:04:03.580> the<00:04:03.670> last<00:04:03.700> game

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
of us as far as this being the last game

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.490 
of us as far as this being the last game
because<00:04:04.300> we're<00:04:04.450> so<00:04:04.570> focused<00:04:04.780> on<00:04:05.110> what<00:04:05.290> we<00:04:05.350> got

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
because we're so focused on what we got

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.280 
because we're so focused on what we got
to<00:04:05.590> do<00:04:05.770> so<00:04:06.670> we're<00:04:07.120> not<00:04:07.270> dwelling<00:04:07.600> on<00:04:07.780> a<00:04:07.840> moment

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
to do so we're not dwelling on a moment

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.740 
to do so we're not dwelling on a moment
if<00:04:08.350> we<00:04:08.440> know<00:04:08.620> it's<00:04:08.770> tough<00:04:08.890> to<00:04:09.040> be<00:04:09.070> done<00:04:09.370> and

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
if we know it's tough to be done and

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.750 
if we know it's tough to be done and
that's<00:04:10.750> why<00:04:10.959> I<00:04:11.020> had<00:04:11.260> that<00:04:11.290> right<00:04:11.709> now<00:04:11.890> so<00:04:12.190> right

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
that's why I had that right now so right

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.130 
that's why I had that right now so right
