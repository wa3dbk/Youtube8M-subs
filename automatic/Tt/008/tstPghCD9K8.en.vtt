00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.590
 now 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.250
 hello very good everyone here we are in 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.010
 a new video and good is 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.279
 a video error because I was not recorded the 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.480
 voice and good then I bring you here my 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.360
 background image doing the asshole 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:27.529
 for a change and good is the robot wing 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.720
 shane is going to be like a road to glory I'm going 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.510
 to start from scratch is has the account of 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.460
 facu fucking and good then now I'm going to 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:38.360
 show the team as you can see I have 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:43.129
 a team burgos or but we have the great 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:45.620
 fire that this year is silver 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:47.090
 it seems fine to me it seems right and I 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.350
 I think with this team we are going to do 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.930
 something 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.899
 and I've decided that each party that wins 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:57.409
 I'll put a player from the republic of 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:00.409
 I congo a Congolese and so we will go 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:02.750
 improving the equipment and good here you see 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:05.479
 the substitutes have endorsement of what is 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.220
 better here we see how we find 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.039
 rival than the truth that cost me 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.810
 very much the truth that in play 4 they go 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:14.360
 very bad the servers do not understand the 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.640
 why we choose here the shirts and 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.560
 well let's see your team to see if it 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.530
 decide to give it is already making changes 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.119
 I miss you but well let's go there to see 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.090
 this team that we are going to face 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:30.130
 eye the most important mauri and in defense 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.439
 because he has bamba anderson the truth 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.409
 a team as well as mine more or 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:37.479
 less loves he fought chemistry 41 and good 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.340
 let's see the goals and see what exactly 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:42.070
 well we 're not going to see a great play to 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.869
 which you do with this step and good 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.780
 as you can see at the first touch almost 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:50.110
 all controlling the ball pretty well 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.689
 good passes to be eye eye bronzes 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.340
 facu point that the eye league go 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:56.140
 thrown is for calculation a pity that not 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.270
 will enter but the rebound becomes 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.259
 goal and the truth that a good goal of 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:05.170
 chino juanes is a good goal the play 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.670
 Facu incredible point and bonus reject 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.890
 for the chinese wang and goal and let's go to 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.810
 for the next goal and good now is the 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.000
 the team's turn to score here 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.190
 he loses a ball in his in his field 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.870
 start all the touch is the action the 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.819
 triangulated euro the truth that is very 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.830
 good that this year they cost a lot and the 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:23.140
 shot of that for my goalie can not 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.630
 doing nothing goes hard and ends up inside 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.270
 a good goal for my rival that the truth 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.390
 It was giving me a lot of problems and 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.550
 well now we're going to something of victory 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.320
 as you can see a recovery here 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.480
 almost in the middle of the field eye for 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.330
 computation does if it is placed to go up 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.670
 a good and spectacular crossing that is 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.560
 a golazo de fort computation the truth 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.690
 still having a very good shot the year 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.850
 last I had an amazing shot and this 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.260
 year as you can see it hits 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.530
 pretty good we're going to see the repetition 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.710
 ojito ojito by calculation how is the 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.150
 place that side and cross it 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.130
 perfectly I think of a great goal that 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.480
 he deserves a lot of likes for this 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:07.269
 goal and good 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.950
 and good after a good game with 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.629
 this team the truth that cost me 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.540
 we're going to see the final result 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:15.069
 which was favorable for me 8 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.849
 with 7 to force with your first match 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:21.040
 Ojito we take 429 coins as 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.200
 you can see here as 21 our 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.180
 first three points and therefore we 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.420
 We deserved to sign a Congolese player 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.329
 which was going to be Mr. cedric that 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.060
 now it is currently in the osasuna the 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.819
 true that he is a great player he has 94 of 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.069
 rhythm and good makes a couple pretty 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:42.190
 good with computation and hence what 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:44.230
 I would like to sign and good first signing 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.959
 we were going to go for the second game 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.430
 we go with him and well there we go to 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.260
 find rival the truth that I was 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.780
 costing a lot in all parties 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.849
 but good we find rival and good 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.190
 this one was going to be a much more rival 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.799
 complicated since as you can see now 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.130
 same as he had four players from 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.220
 silver 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.920
 5 gold and 1 bronze which is sure to be 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.740
 a cheto so we're going to see how 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.300
 was the game and to see the goals and the 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.790
 first of the goal was going to be quite 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.970
 early was going to be the rival and as 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.470
 You can see it was hard to get a lot out of it 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.060
 more to start and good recover it here in 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.790
 defense and started a pretty play 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.160
 good the difference with 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.590
 so many golds and silvers and good as you can 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.990
 see here the l 13 golazo leaves it in 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.700
 Perfect position makes the pass cited 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.950
 see comes from behind 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.180
 what is this man called and the truth 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.490
 that puts me a good goal there is 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.910
 congratulate the rival and we have no other 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.070
 10 and good today we will be in the 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.830
 minute 45 and we will see the goal of the 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.330
 tie on my part here a play on 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.160
 the center of the field that we are touching 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.160
 touching them we're playing here at 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:54.410
 Cali saw or knows it is left kings kings 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.750
 there is a spectacular touch that 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.390
 it is left perfect for the leg 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:02.180
 left that crosses it well below 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:06.110
 of the goalkeeper the truth that a good goal 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:09.780
 celebrates many kings to butt the truth 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.580
 well deserved this goal for kings 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.680
 it's the best thing I have in the 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.780
 team and good you notice the quality here 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.030
 as you can see for me and good a good 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.669
 golazo and let's see the other and good 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.100
 Well, here you will see the 'robbery of the century' 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:24.750
 here the ruling with future truth that very 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.419
 wrong on my part recover it in the 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.150
 defense or fault is that acs help is 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:33.560
 it's the pass here, you lose it, you take it 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:36.389
 bounces another rebound for the eye 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:39.510
 eye grabs you from the shirt and whips 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:42.000
 penalty the referee in shabby the subject 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.680
 the grabs there are many penalties who 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.140
 you do not look for them that do nothing and 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:50.220
 defenders caught just because of 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:52.590
 the shirt to the front and well then you 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:55.470
 pitan penalty and the card is already 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.900
 yellow and out here, well, if it's going to 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.580
 change now from pitcher the opponent will 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.720
 was going to put a better one has to xabi 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.380
 tight 

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:09.300
 and good to score goal easily 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:11.160
 wrong tight and the garlic that is not 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.449
 liquide but good you see that throw it 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.659
 all right 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:17.309
 and well he cheated me completely and 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:19.139
 I thought I was going to throw out there but 

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:22.499
 strip for the other side 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:24.900
 he does well and good a goal a goal 

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:26.849
 quite unfair with the penalty that 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:30.060
 I looked for it but good was going to finish the 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:33.120
 party so let's see a bit the end 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:35.310
 of the game and you can see that it ended 21 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.650
 defeat we can not put anyone in the 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:39.810
 team no more Congolese but good 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:44.800
 we already have cedric we have the focus 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:47.289
 point I think it was hard to be able 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.800
 to be able to win this match with so many golds 

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:52.780
 but there we have it 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.099
 we won the first one we lost the 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.620
 second let's hope that the next two 

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:58.270
 we win them and asia we ascend to the 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.780
 ninth division to see if we have more 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:04.870
 good luck and good guys I hope you give me 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:06.820

 winning and little more than saying the guys
