00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.950
 no 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.280
 our project combines the new ones 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.910
 roots with ancient traditions 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.380
 cultural aspects of wine and the territory 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.120
 we are in a historical heritage area 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.910
 cultural heritage heritage 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.200
 cultural of the unesco cast of the mountains but 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.350
 we are also in a very place 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:51.900
 particular that is that of the zone of 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:54.340
 lamalunga place where in 1874 a 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.680
 agrarian reformer then down to gucci 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.610
 he created the first monumental cellar of 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:03.310
 at the end of 800 our cellar therefore wants 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.100
 be a witness a passage but 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.320
 also a witness between the past and the 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.840
 future of our territory 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.960
 the rural development program allows 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.830
 then to combine art culture with the 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.380
 promotion of excellent wines 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.410
 we believe we have succeeded in giving 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.500
 a strong identity character to ours 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:32.140
 project through production too 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:34.360
 and the use of a label 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.450
 innovative that express the character 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.860
 clearly our identity 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.580
 project 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.959
 the cellar has a battle 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:50.140
 very particular a sailing battle 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:53.640
 in which we allow our wines to 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.170
 mature and prepare for the 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.050
 final production between the elements 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.590
 of rural excellence of the company 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.840
 hawk aggregator i feel like 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.440
 emphasize the aspect concerning the 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.590
 protection of valorisation in modernization 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.800
 I refer to native thorium vines 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.530
 to the black slut of the black bombino 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.620
 I refer to the aria nico of 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.569
 of castel del monte one of the others 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.580
 elements of rural excellence of ours 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.660
 project and its sustainability 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.310
 environmental 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.200
 the project is equipped with an innovative 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.270
 phytodepuration plant for the 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.900
 waste water treatment of 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.430
 processing but also civilian ones 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.830
 next to the phytodepuration plant 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.100
 the company has a plant 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.140
 photovoltaic integrated on the roof 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:47.500
 of winemaking 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:51.760
 this aspect is also important because 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.250
 allowed the company to access the 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.730
 photovoltaic incentives and therefore a 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:01.590
 allow an income receipt that 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.519
 contributes to its sustainability 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.040
 economic and financial 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:09.580
 how could you observe a project 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:13.060
 complex but unitary with significant 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:16.450
 cultural identity in fact it is open 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.660
 to the territory intended as a center of 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.959
 cultural heritage of in our 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.959
 area
