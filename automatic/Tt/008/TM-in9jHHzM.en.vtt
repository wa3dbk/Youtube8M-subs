00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
color and then starting like I think

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.440

either<00:01:48.479> here<00:01:49.020> or<00:01:49.200> here<00:01:50.360> we're<00:01:51.360> getting

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
either here or here we're getting

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.870 
either here or here we're getting
laminate<00:01:52.409> which<00:01:53.130> if<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.460> don't<00:01:53.640> know<00:01:53.729> what

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
laminate which if you don't know what

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.609 
laminate which if you don't know what
that<00:01:54.030> is<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.450> looks<00:01:54.600> exactly<00:01:54.899> like<00:01:55.079> hardwood

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
that is it looks exactly like hardwood

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.700 
that is it looks exactly like hardwood
floor<00:01:55.979> but<00:01:56.280> it's<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:57.119> guess<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.750> different<00:01:57.990> kind

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
floor but it's I guess a different kind

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.770 
floor but it's I guess a different kind
I<00:01:59.009> don't<00:01:59.219> know<00:01:59.310> so<00:02:00.119> we're<00:02:00.240> getting<00:02:00.329> rid<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.630> all
