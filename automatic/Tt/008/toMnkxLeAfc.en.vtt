interested in animatronics robotics some
things<00:00:11.400> like<00:00:11.610> that<00:00:12.410> but<00:00:13.410> wanted<00:00:14.009> to<00:00:14.099> make<00:00:14.309> a

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:14.339 
things like that but wanted to make a

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.540 
things like that but wanted to make a
quick<00:00:14.639> video<00:00:14.790> on<00:00:15.030> something<00:00:15.629> that<00:00:15.870> has<00:00:16.620> caused

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
quick video on something that has caused

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.190 
quick video on something that has caused
a<00:00:17.670> lot<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:17.850> challenges<00:00:18.480> for<00:00:18.720> people<00:00:19.020> in<00:00:19.110> the

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:19.200 
a lot of challenges for people in the

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.710 
a lot of challenges for people in the
past<00:00:19.490> we've<00:00:20.490> dealt<00:00:20.789> with<00:00:20.849> it<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.180> past<00:00:21.240> two

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
past we've dealt with it in the past two

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.080 
past we've dealt with it in the past two
different<00:00:22.260> methods<00:00:22.699> found<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.760> new<00:00:23.910> method

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
different methods found a new method

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.269 
different methods found a new method
that<00:00:24.510> I'd<00:00:24.660> like<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:24.869> just<00:00:25.019> drop<00:00:25.470> line<00:00:25.830> with<00:00:26.099> you

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
that I'd like to just drop line with you

all<00:00:26.730> today<00:00:27.720> real<00:00:28.019> quick<00:00:28.320> this<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.339> scenario

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
all today real quick this is a scenario

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.359 
all today real quick this is a scenario
where<00:00:30.119> we<00:00:30.240> needed<00:00:30.509> a<00:00:30.660> large<00:00:30.960> servo<00:00:31.830> lots<00:00:32.220> of

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
where we needed a large servo lots of

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.340 
where we needed a large servo lots of
torque<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.880> actually<00:00:33.480> we<00:00:33.660> have<00:00:33.780> some<00:00:34.020> linear

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
torque and actually we have some linear

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.000 
torque and actually we have some linear
servos<00:00:34.740> to<00:00:35.840> that<00:00:36.840> just<00:00:37.440> needed<00:00:37.650> to<00:00:37.770> be

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
servos to that just needed to be

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.010 
servos to that just needed to be
controlled<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:39.120> think<00:00:39.390> that'd<00:00:39.510> be<00:00:39.630> a<00:00:39.660> simple

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
controlled you think that'd be a simple

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.440 
controlled you think that'd be a simple
problem<00:00:40.200> turns<00:00:41.010> out<00:00:41.160> when<00:00:41.610> they<00:00:41.730> need<00:00:41.760> 12<00:00:42.180> to

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
problem turns out when they need 12 to

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.580 
problem turns out when they need 12 to
20<00:00:42.750> volts<00:00:43.170> at<00:00:43.550> anywhere<00:00:44.550> from<00:00:44.610> 30<00:00:45.030> amps<00:00:45.590> plus

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
20 volts at anywhere from 30 amps plus

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.830 
20 volts at anywhere from 30 amps plus
those<00:00:47.430> circuits<00:00:47.880> can<00:00:48.060> get<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.420> be<00:00:48.510> very

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
those circuits can get to be very

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.040 
those circuits can get to be very
interesting<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.650> build<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.750> you're<00:00:51.750> lucky

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
interesting to build and you're lucky

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.810 
interesting to build and you're lucky
when<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:52.230> can<00:00:52.380> find<00:00:52.650> one<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.040> buy<00:00:53.190> well<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
when you can find one to buy well the

that's not going to be so great so I

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.840 
that's not going to be so great so I
knew<00:01:57.700> we<00:01:58.300> took<00:01:58.479> that<00:01:59.160> after<00:02:00.160> we<00:02:00.250> found<00:02:00.490> it<00:02:00.670> and

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
knew we took that after we found it and

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.050 
knew we took that after we found it and
you<00:02:01.810> know<00:02:02.320> through<00:02:02.619> all<00:02:02.740> of<00:02:02.890> our<00:02:03.040> other<00:02:03.250> old

research stuff away and said alright
let's<00:02:05.470> just<00:02:05.740> go<00:02:05.920> with<00:02:06.009> the<00:02:06.130> out-of-the-box

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
let's just go with the out-of-the-box

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.169 
let's just go with the out-of-the-box
solution<00:02:07.659> and<00:02:07.920> plugged<00:02:08.920> it<00:02:09.100> in<00:02:09.250> grounded

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
solution and plugged it in grounded

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.699 
solution and plugged it in grounded
everything<00:02:10.540> out<00:02:10.690> a<00:02:10.899> couple<00:02:11.170> quick<00:02:11.350> tips<00:02:11.410> and

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
everything out a couple quick tips and

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.620 
everything out a couple quick tips and
when<00:02:11.860> you<00:02:12.040> plug<00:02:12.310> it<00:02:12.430> into<00:02:12.549> your<00:02:12.700> scope<00:02:13.209> if<00:02:13.480> you

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
when you plug it into your scope if you

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.390 
when you plug it into your scope if you
guys<00:02:13.840> have<00:02:14.079> one<00:02:14.260> not<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:14.709> big<00:02:14.799> deal<00:02:15.160> if<00:02:15.370> you

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
guys have one not a big deal if you

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.250 
guys have one not a big deal if you
don't<00:02:15.489> but<00:02:16.329> when<00:02:16.630> you<00:02:16.720> do<00:02:16.870> make<00:02:17.079> sure<00:02:17.140> you

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
don't but when you do make sure you

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.670 
don't but when you do make sure you
ground<00:02:17.530> your<00:02:17.739> signal<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.459> your<00:02:18.730> radio<00:02:19.680> output

I<00:03:49.530> would<00:03:49.760> say<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:50.820> know<00:03:51.120> in<00:03:51.240> this<00:03:51.330> case<00:03:51.570> we're

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
I would say you know in this case we're

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.510 
I would say you know in this case we're
gonna<00:03:51.870> have<00:03:52.080> to<00:03:52.200> blow<00:03:52.680> air<00:03:52.860> past<00:03:53.160> it

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
gonna have to blow air past it

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.790 
gonna have to blow air past it
not<00:03:53.700> my<00:03:53.820> favorite<00:03:54.030> scenario<00:03:54.570> but<00:03:54.900> we<00:03:55.500> have<00:03:55.680> to

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
not my favorite scenario but we have to

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.050 
not my favorite scenario but we have to
do<00:03:55.920> that<00:03:56.130> we're<00:03:56.280> gonna<00:03:56.370> have<00:03:56.490> about<00:03:56.610> six<00:03:56.970> of

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
do that we're gonna have about six of

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.880 
do that we're gonna have about six of
these<00:03:57.180> in<00:03:57.240> the<00:03:57.390> box<00:03:57.600> so<00:03:58.140> that<00:03:58.170> will<00:03:58.530> get<00:03:58.680> pretty

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
these in the box so that will get pretty

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.670 
these in the box so that will get pretty
hot<00:03:59.040> we<00:03:59.820> do<00:03:59.970> see<00:04:00.180> if<00:04:00.270> they<00:04:00.480> work<00:04:00.690> here<00:04:01.020> as<00:04:01.260> well

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
hot we do see if they work here as well

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.190 
hot we do see if they work here as well
and<00:04:02.010> numerical<00:04:02.640> analysis<00:04:03.120> of<00:04:03.300> the<00:04:03.540> forced

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
and numerical analysis of the forced

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.270 
and numerical analysis of the forced
convection<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:04.740> natural<00:04:05.130> convection

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
convection and natural convection

convection and natural convection
cooling<00:04:05.670> and<00:04:05.970> I<00:04:06.120> don't<00:04:06.330> even<00:04:06.600> need<00:04:06.780> to<00:04:06.840> do<00:04:07.080> that

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
cooling and I don't even need to do that

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.280 
cooling and I don't even need to do that
to<00:04:07.410> say<00:04:07.650> alright<00:04:08.190> time<00:04:08.910> to<00:04:08.940> put<00:04:09.240> on<00:04:09.390> a<00:04:09.420> fan<00:04:10.080> or

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
to say alright time to put on a fan or

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.830 
to say alright time to put on a fan or
two<00:04:10.440> on<00:04:10.620> this<00:04:10.740> thing<00:04:10.950> but<00:04:11.820> you<00:04:12.510> can<00:04:12.660> see<00:04:12.780> the

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
two on this thing but you can see the

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.860 
two on this thing but you can see the
results<00:04:13.200> here<00:04:13.610> works<00:04:14.610> great<00:04:14.940> and<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.660> pot

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
results here works great and the pot

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.009 
results here works great and the pot

wish I got a kickback on every cell they

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.370 
wish I got a kickback on every cell they
made<00:04:29.070> because<00:04:29.340> I<00:04:29.760> am<00:04:30.420> a<00:04:30.450> very<00:04:30.780> happy<00:04:31.170> customer
