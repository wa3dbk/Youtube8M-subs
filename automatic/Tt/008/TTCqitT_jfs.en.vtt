I<00:00:34.250> think<00:00:35.250> Tetris<00:00:35.790> has<00:00:36.649> this<00:00:37.649> idea<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.910> cleaning

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450

things<00:00:39.750> up<00:00:40.020> push<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.450> higher<00:00:42.450> arc<00:00:42.690> this<00:00:43.290> is

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
things up push to a higher arc this is

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.549 
things up push to a higher arc this is
one<00:00:43.680> where<00:00:44.040> tidiness<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:46.050> next<00:00:46.469> to

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
one where tidiness is is is next to

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.740 
one where tidiness is is is next to
godliness<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:47.309> is<00:00:47.489> brilliant<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.180> addictive

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
godliness it is brilliant and addictive

exactly<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.790> what's<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.090> idea<00:01:51.360> of

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
exactly and what's the idea of

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.620 
exactly and what's the idea of
pentominoes<00:01:51.990> sir<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.310> idea<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.670> who's<00:01:54.420> put

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
pentominoes sir so the idea of who's put

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.649 
pentominoes sir so the idea of who's put
it<00:01:54.780> back<00:01:54.990> alright<00:01:56.119> yes<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:58.640> basically

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
it back alright yes and basically

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.780 
it back alright yes and basically
usually<00:02:00.659> takes<00:02:00.990> about<00:02:01.229> hour<00:02:01.740> for<00:02:02.340> an<00:02:02.640> hour

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
usually takes about hour for an hour

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.770 
usually takes about hour for an hour
yeah<00:02:04.070> so<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.130> could<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.820> could<00:02:05.969> put<00:02:06.270> most<00:02:06.540> of

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
yeah so you could you could put most of

yeah so you could you could put most of
them<00:02:06.990> here<00:02:07.350> but<00:02:08.300> but<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.479> rest<00:02:09.720> but<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.649> last

three<00:02:11.280> or<00:02:11.400> four<00:02:11.430> pieces<00:02:11.910> would<00:02:12.239> be

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
three or four pieces would be

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.509 
three or four pieces would be
well<00:02:13.180> there<00:02:13.810> may<00:02:13.900> be<00:02:13.930> a<00:02:14.049> problem<00:02:14.260> for<00:02:14.379> you<00:02:14.620> XC

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519

well there may be a problem for you XC
but<00:02:15.700> i'm<00:02:15.790> sure<00:02:15.819> there<00:02:16.689> won't<00:02:16.840> be<00:02:16.930> a<00:02:16.959> problem

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
but i'm sure there won't be a problem

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.929 
but i'm sure there won't be a problem
here<00:02:17.469> to<00:02:17.739> hang<00:02:17.980> on<00:02:18.069> a<00:02:18.159> second<00:02:18.519> that<00:02:18.609> goes<00:02:18.730> in

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:18.939 
here to hang on a second that goes in

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.660 
here to hang on a second that goes in
there<00:02:19.150> this<00:02:19.629> is<00:02:19.780> a<00:02:20.159> little<00:02:21.159> bit<00:02:21.310> trickier<00:02:21.609> than

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
there this is a little bit trickier than

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.309 
there this is a little bit trickier than
I<00:02:21.849> thought<00:02:21.879> that<00:02:22.150> I<00:02:22.389> think<00:02:22.659> I<00:02:22.719> can<00:02:22.900> do<00:02:23.079> it<00:02:23.109> I

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
I thought that I think I can do it I

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.459 
I thought that I think I can do it I
thought<00:02:23.980> that<00:02:24.340> if<00:02:24.730> you<00:02:24.790> if<00:02:25.480> you<00:02:25.719> finish<00:02:26.230> the

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:26.469 
thought that if you if you finish the

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:28.770 
thought that if you if you finish the
line<00:02:26.680> if<00:02:26.980> you<00:02:27.189> make<00:02:27.609> a<00:02:27.849> complete<00:02:28.359> the<00:02:28.569> line

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
line if you make a complete the line

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.170 
line if you make a complete the line
later<00:02:29.139> on<00:02:29.349> it<00:02:29.650> has<00:02:29.889> no<00:02:30.069> reason<00:02:30.340> to<00:02:30.549> keep<00:02:30.849> it<00:02:31.030> on

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
later on it has no reason to keep it on

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.660 
later on it has no reason to keep it on
the<00:02:31.329> screen<00:02:31.540> anymore<00:02:31.930> so<00:02:32.439> it's<00:02:32.769> try<00:02:33.069> to<00:02:33.129> start

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670

years<00:05:54.669> cinema<00:05:55.510> was<00:05:56.050> thought<00:05:56.320> to<00:05:56.350> be<00:05:56.500> a

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
years cinema was thought to be a

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.010 
years cinema was thought to be a
mindless<00:05:57.250> form<00:05:58.090> which<00:05:58.600> was<00:05:58.810> just

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
mindless form which was just

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.440 
mindless form which was just
sensationalist<00:05:59.740> and<00:05:59.950> pornographic<00:06:00.370> and<00:06:00.880> then

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 
sensationalist and pornographic and then

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:02.730 
sensationalist and pornographic and then
eventually<00:06:01.540> people<00:06:01.990> realize<00:06:02.410> while<00:06:02.590> their

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
eventually people realize while their

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.260 
eventually people realize while their
artistic<00:06:03.100> things<00:06:03.430> you<00:06:03.550> can<00:06:03.669> do<00:06:03.820> this<00:06:03.940> in<00:06:04.120> while

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
artistic things you can do this in while

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.180 
artistic things you can do this in while
you<00:06:04.450> can't<00:06:04.660> do<00:06:04.810> any<00:06:04.960> other<00:06:05.080> forms<00:06:05.470> and<00:06:05.650> I<00:06:06.010> think

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
you can't do any other forms and I think

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.050
