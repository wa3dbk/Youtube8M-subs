00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280
 the process to start very difficult the annual comparison the easier price 

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.150
 declared 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.150
 It would have been much easier to be able to debut in 

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:15.879
 There are those who get used to what is 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:17.880
 lira 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.359
 in formula one 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.689
 what makes you mature will face this year 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.189
 years nobody is a difficult debut but 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.119
 but to get him out 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:29.720
 and do it in the best way 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.610
 how to deal with this circuit have to make delivery more complicated 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.840
 melbourne circuit 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.780
 3rd of that 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.660
 the circuit very difficult to find the limit because the limit is very 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.660
 near the wall the container costs very expensive 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.510
 then it is the most difficult 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.520
 I do not know him too 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.270
 another point 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.220
 bad but 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.310
 but that does not cost me much work 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.310
 know him and that on October 5 télam - 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.910
 hutchison luck of course for the Czech Perez are the classmates Luis 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.049
 ramírez we are accompanying him cd ya adif de astic labor sphere saturday 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:08.899
 when at 12 o'clock on the day before two o'clock in the morning, produce just the 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:09.610
 midnight 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.530
 of Mexico starts this race there in Venezuela have possibilities to 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.820
 unreal and realistic realistic legazpi 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.780
 that this insect 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.330
 in this ccaa to surprise with state everything depends a lot on the cars 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.440
 a surprise if you consume a percentage point the first ten would be very 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.100
 positive for the potosino as such and how it is doing microsoft is going to 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.850
 tear 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.680
 percent and the 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.010
 the situation with time of 3 1 4 that does not know this track although the author of 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.490
 all right 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.830
 you can hardly get a podium and philadelphia in the interview with eating or 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.950
 to sleep that Australia only the artist of valencia would have 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.049
 facilitated because he does not want that he met in the gp2 series is given to him 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.220
 knows almost everything since it was suspended because of political problems 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.920
 eta and therefore to the European tracks the out there this experience triumphs in 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.020
 gp2 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.000
 that would help a lot since they are Europe as much income as possible must be added points 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.210
 in then we are going to follow up of course the Czech in this return of 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.819
 Mexican as a pilot 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:08.739
 those of the maximum competition in motorsport the formula one we will be 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:09.969
 attentive on all our platforms
