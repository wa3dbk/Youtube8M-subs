00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
our guys has been and it's my my commute

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.560 
our guys has been and it's my my commute
it's<00:00:09.450> not<00:00:09.900> good<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:10.799> so<00:00:10.950> anyway<00:00:11.309> today<00:00:11.570> we're

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
it's not good and so anyway today we're

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.210 
it's not good and so anyway today we're
doing<00:00:12.839> about<00:00:12.990> hashmaps<00:00:13.650> in<00:00:13.919> bucket<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.490> stuff

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:16.220 
doing about hashmaps in bucket and stuff

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.929 
doing about hashmaps in bucket and stuff
so<00:00:17.220> yeah<00:00:17.400> this<00:00:18.029> here<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:18.980> comm<00:00:19.980> figure<00:00:20.400> stuff

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
so yeah this here this comm figure stuff

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.070 
so yeah this here this comm figure stuff
you<00:00:21.210> don't<00:00:21.330> need<00:00:21.449> all<00:00:21.539> these<00:00:21.660> different

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
you don't need all these different

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.700 
you don't need all these different
classes<00:00:22.260> so<00:00:23.449> it's<00:00:24.449> wrong<00:00:24.630> with<00:00:24.750> my<00:00:24.869> screen<00:00:25.140> you

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
classes so it's wrong with my screen you

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.410 
classes so it's wrong with my screen you
know<00:00:25.890> it's<00:00:26.039> different<00:00:26.220> classes<00:00:26.699> but<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:27.150> know

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
know it's different classes but you know

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.409 
know it's different classes but you know
you<00:00:27.630> can<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:27.839> want<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.259> up<00:00:28.380> here<00:00:29.330> we're<00:00:30.330> gonna

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
you can you want to up here we're gonna

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.350 
you can you want to up here we're gonna
make<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.839> new<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.589> new<00:00:31.859> thing<00:00:32.370> called<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.180> hash

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
make it a new a new thing called a hash

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.630 
make it a new a new thing called a hash
map<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.870> what<00:00:34.710> hash<00:00:34.860> map<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.160> is<00:00:35.310> is<00:00:35.430> like<00:00:35.610> a

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
map and what hash map is is is like a

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.330 
map and what hash map is is is like a
little<00:00:35.880> group<00:00:36.120> which<00:00:36.510> um<00:00:36.900> it<00:00:37.380> stores<00:00:37.770> people's

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
little group which um it stores people's

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.130 
little group which um it stores people's
data<00:00:38.640> in<00:00:38.880> so<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.270> can<00:00:39.540> do<00:00:39.660> things<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.080> a

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
data in so you can do things to a

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.890 
data in so you can do things to a
specific<00:00:40.620> player<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.280> not<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.600> the

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
specific player and not and in the

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.930 
specific player and not and in the
entire<00:00:43.260> server<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.250> make<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> hash<00:00:44.640> map<00:00:44.820> you

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
entire server so to make a hash map you

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.250 
entire server so to make a hash map you
do<00:00:45.030> public<00:00:45.450> final<00:00:46.260> hash<00:00:46.950> map<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.170> then<00:00:49.170> you

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
do public final hash map and then you

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.320 
do public final hash map and then you
put<00:00:49.470> two<00:00:49.710> like<00:00:50.310> more<00:00:50.610> than<00:00:50.730> less<00:00:50.910> than<00:00:50.940> signs

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.330 
put two like more than less than signs

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.140 
put two like more than less than signs
and<00:00:51.630> inside<00:00:51.930> here<00:00:52.460> this<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.610> this<00:00:53.760> can<00:00:54.060> be

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
and inside here this is this can be

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.000 
and inside here this is this can be
changed<00:00:54.540> to<00:00:54.750> where<00:00:54.870> you<00:00:55.020> want<00:00:55.230> but<00:00:55.470> why<00:00:55.710> do<00:00:55.770> is

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
changed to where you want but why do is

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.780 
changed to where you want but why do is
I<00:00:56.100> do<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.310> do<00:00:56.370> player<00:00:56.820> comma<00:00:57.860> arrays<00:00:58.860> and<00:00:59.250> then

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
I do I do player comma arrays and then

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.170 
I do I do player comma arrays and then
another<00:01:00.060> two<00:01:00.660> of<00:01:00.840> these<00:01:00.990> um<00:01:01.940> more<00:01:02.940> than<00:01:02.970> less

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
another two of these um more than less

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.249 
another two of these um more than less
than<00:01:03.360> signs<00:01:04.189> oh<00:01:05.189> it's<00:01:05.759> not<00:01:05.909> raised<00:01:06.240> its<00:01:06.780> array

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
than signs oh it's not raised its array

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:12.139 
than signs oh it's not raised its array
list<00:01:08.750> block<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:10.049> think<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.609> then<00:01:12.030> I'm<00:01:12.090> just

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:12.149 
list block I think and then I'm just

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.279 
list block I think and then I'm just
gonna<00:01:12.329> call<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:13.109> hash<00:01:13.820> map<00:01:14.869> is<00:01:15.869> equal<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.259> a

00:01:16.279 --> 00:01:16.289 
gonna call this a hash map is equal to a

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:23.020 
gonna call this a hash map is equal to a
new<00:01:16.560> hash<00:01:17.240> map<00:01:18.409> player<00:01:19.640> array<00:01:20.640> list<00:01:21.390> block

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
new hash map player array list block

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.510 
new hash map player array list block
like<00:01:24.030> it's<00:01:24.740> okay<00:01:25.740> I'm<00:01:25.890> gonna<00:01:25.979> try<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.280> explain

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
like it's okay I'm gonna try and explain

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.039 
like it's okay I'm gonna try and explain
this<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.759> people<00:01:27.890> but<00:01:29.179> it's<00:01:30.179> gonna<00:01:30.689> be<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.899> bit

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
this to people but it's gonna be a bit

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.359 
this to people but it's gonna be a bit
confusing<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:31.469> it's<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:31.799> poor<00:01:31.979> everything

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
confusing so it's in poor everything

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.990 
confusing so it's in poor everything
first

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.840 

input<00:01:36.840> hash<00:01:37.020> map<00:01:38.300> imports<00:01:39.300> ArrayList<00:01:40.850> import

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
input hash map imports ArrayList import

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.460 
input hash map imports ArrayList import
look<00:01:43.910> so<00:01:44.910> basically<00:01:45.840> what<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.050> is<00:01:46.110> doing<00:01:46.170> is

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
look so basically what this is doing is

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.200 
look so basically what this is doing is
it's<00:01:46.620> gonna<00:01:46.740> create<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.100> new<00:01:47.250> hash<00:01:47.490> map<00:01:47.790> which

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
it's gonna create a new hash map which

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.880 
it's gonna create a new hash map which
is<00:01:48.950> a<00:01:50.720> it's<00:01:51.720> where<00:01:51.870> you<00:01:51.930> can<00:01:52.080> store<00:01:52.320> things<00:01:52.530> and

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
is a it's where you can store things and

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.130 
is a it's where you can store things and
in<00:01:53.730> attachment<00:01:54.030> we're<00:01:54.360> going<00:01:54.510> to<00:01:54.570> be<00:01:54.690> storing

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
in attachment we're going to be storing

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.290 
in attachment we're going to be storing
player<00:01:55.470> data<00:01:56.090> okay

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
player data okay

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.600 
player data okay
now<00:01:57.840> you<00:01:57.900> could<00:01:58.110> change<00:01:58.290> this<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.740> location

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
now you could change this to location

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.910 
now you could change this to location
data<00:01:59.990> but<00:02:00.990> for<00:02:01.440> the<00:02:01.560> purpose<00:02:01.800> of<00:02:01.830> this

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
data but for the purpose of this

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:02.960 
data but for the purpose of this
tutorial<00:02:02.070> which<00:02:02.400> is<00:02:02.430> going<00:02:02.580> to<00:02:02.640> change<00:02:02.790> to

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
tutorial which is going to change to

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.400 
tutorial which is going to change to
play<00:02:03.120> you<00:02:03.180> can<00:02:03.300> change<00:02:03.480> it<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.600> anything<00:02:03.930> data

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
play you can change it to anything data

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.710 
play you can change it to anything data
and<00:02:04.800> then<00:02:05.160> it's<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.340> realist<00:02:05.640> block<00:02:05.820> thing<00:02:06.090> this

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
and then it's a realist block thing this

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.969 
and then it's a realist block thing this
is<00:02:06.870> just<00:02:07.459> it's<00:02:08.929> it's<00:02:09.929> hard<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.320> explain<00:02:10.590> it

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
is just it's it's hard to explain it

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.320 
is just it's it's hard to explain it
um<00:02:12.740> I'll<00:02:13.740> try<00:02:13.980> to<00:02:14.070> explain<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:14.370> later<00:02:14.459> but<00:02:14.790> for

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
um I'll try to explain it later but for

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.610 
um I'll try to explain it later but for
now<00:02:15.600> you<00:02:15.720> should<00:02:15.870> need<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:16.050> remember<00:02:16.320> to<00:02:16.440> put

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
now you should need to remember to put

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.270 
now you should need to remember to put
that<00:02:17.150> if<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:18.330> want<00:02:18.510> more<00:02:18.660> tutorials<00:02:19.070> like<00:02:20.070> I

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
that if you want more tutorials like I

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.120 
that if you want more tutorials like I
don't<00:02:20.610> know<00:02:20.790> I<00:02:20.820> just<00:02:21.690> never<00:02:22.320> mind<00:02:22.530> just<00:02:22.830> just

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
don't know I just never mind just just

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.590 
don't know I just never mind just just
that's<00:02:23.370> that's<00:02:23.760> why<00:02:23.940> I<00:02:23.970> put<00:02:24.180> and<00:02:24.360> then<00:02:24.450> hash

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
that's that's why I put and then hash

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.150 
that's that's why I put and then hash
trap<00:02:24.840> that's<00:02:25.050> all<00:02:25.140> going<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.320> be<00:02:25.470> nicknaming

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
trap that's all going to be nicknaming

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.430 
trap that's all going to be nicknaming
this<00:02:26.550> hash<00:02:26.730> map<00:02:26.940> now<00:02:27.900> it's<00:02:28.140> going<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.290> be<00:02:28.380> equal

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
this hash map now it's going to be equal

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.050 
this hash map now it's going to be equal
to<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.680> new<00:02:28.860> hash<00:02:29.070> map<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.550> then<00:02:29.670> here<00:02:29.910> we're

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
to a new hash map and then here we're

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.880 
to a new hash map and then here we're
just<00:02:30.090> gonna<00:02:30.270> put<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:31.050> we're<00:02:31.380> gonna<00:02:31.560> check

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
just gonna put the we're gonna check

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.520 
just gonna put the we're gonna check
basically<00:02:32.450> that<00:02:33.560> for<00:02:34.560> this<00:02:34.740> hash<00:02:35.280> map<00:02:36.530> it's

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
basically that for this hash map it's

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.810 
basically that for this hash map it's
really<00:02:37.740> hard<00:02:37.890> to<00:02:37.980> explain<00:02:38.220> baby<00:02:38.459> in<00:02:38.730> the

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
really hard to explain baby in the

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.759 
really hard to explain baby in the
comments<00:02:39.060> we're<00:02:39.150> gonna<00:02:39.300> do<00:02:39.360> if<00:02:39.540> the<00:02:39.959> command

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
comments we're gonna do if the command

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.050 
comments we're gonna do if the command
ylabel

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
ylabel

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.729 
ylabel
no<00:02:42.180> it's<00:02:42.360> open<00:02:42.690> my<00:02:43.040> plug<00:02:44.040> into<00:02:44.190> one<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:45.739> see

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
no it's open my plug into one and see

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.020 
no it's open my plug into one and see
what<00:02:47.489> commands<00:02:47.880> have<00:02:47.970> really<00:02:48.120> go<00:02:48.300> in<00:02:48.420> here

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:03:00.180 

come<00:02:52.569> on<00:02:54.000> load<00:02:55.000> up<00:02:55.180> right<00:02:56.640> stick<00:02:57.640> so<00:02:59.190> cool

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
come on load up right stick so cool

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.830 
come on load up right stick so cool
right<00:03:00.310> so<00:03:00.370> if<00:03:00.580> the<00:03:00.640> command<00:03:00.910> ylabel<00:03:01.120> dots<00:03:03.840> you

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
right so if the command ylabel dots you

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.320 
right so if the command ylabel dots you
call<00:03:05.500> sake<00:03:05.830> no<00:03:06.069> case<00:03:07.230> stick<00:03:08.760> then<00:03:09.760> let's<00:03:10.030> um

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
call sake no case stick then let's um

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:17.610 
call sake no case stick then let's um
let's<00:03:11.400> do<00:03:13.050> hash<00:03:14.670> map<00:03:15.670> dot<00:03:16.420> okay<00:03:17.260> and<00:03:17.410> then<00:03:17.500> we

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
let's do hash map dot okay and then we

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.190 
let's do hash map dot okay and then we
do<00:03:17.739> put<00:03:18.300> so<00:03:19.300> we're<00:03:19.420> going<00:03:19.540> to<00:03:19.630> put<00:03:19.840> the<00:03:19.959> player

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
do put so we're going to put the player

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.229 
do put so we're going to put the player
in<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:20.650> hash<00:03:20.800> map<00:03:21.010> so<00:03:21.160> you<00:03:21.190> player<00:03:21.610> and<00:03:21.970> then

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
in the hash map so you player and then

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.060 
in the hash map so you player and then
the<00:03:22.420> value<00:03:22.840> we<00:03:23.050> just<00:03:23.230> do<00:03:23.319> nope

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
the value we just do nope

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.940 
the value we just do nope
okay<00:03:24.940> so<00:03:25.540> that's<00:03:25.660> how<00:03:25.870> you<00:03:25.930> put<00:03:26.260> a<00:03:26.320> player<00:03:26.709> in

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
okay so that's how you put a player in

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.720 
okay so that's how you put a player in
the<00:03:27.040> hash<00:03:27.220> map<00:03:27.810> now<00:03:29.190> but<00:03:30.190> we<00:03:30.310> want<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.489> make<00:03:30.580> it

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
the hash map now but we want to make it

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.620 
the hash map now but we want to make it
so<00:03:30.790> if<00:03:30.880> they're<00:03:31.000> already<00:03:31.120> in<00:03:31.269> the<00:03:31.360> hash<00:03:31.510> would

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
so if they're already in the hash would

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.850 
so if they're already in the hash would
people<00:03:31.780> remove<00:03:32.110> them<00:03:32.290> out<00:03:32.410> so<00:03:32.800> we<00:03:33.790> could<00:03:33.910> do<00:03:34.090> if

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
people remove them out so we could do if

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.170 
people remove them out so we could do if
hash<00:03:36.569> map<00:03:37.569> dot<00:03:37.959> contains<00:03:38.560> key<00:03:39.040> so<00:03:39.940> if<00:03:40.060> it

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
hash map dot contains key so if it

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.920 
hash map dot contains key so if it
contains<00:03:40.600> the<00:03:40.780> key<00:03:40.900> of<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.319> player<00:03:42.930> you're

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
contains the key of the player you're

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.160 
contains the key of the player you're
gonna<00:03:44.350> want<00:03:44.560> to<00:03:44.650> do<00:03:44.800> is<00:03:45.069> remind<00:03:45.340> you<00:03:45.519> hash<00:03:45.850> map

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:56.009 

dots<00:03:50.400> remove<00:03:51.400> player<00:03:53.280> else<00:03:54.510> we<00:03:55.510> do<00:03:55.660> what<00:03:55.870> we

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
dots remove player else we do what we

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:59.880 
dots remove player else we do what we
are<00:03:56.049> we<00:03:56.530> put<00:03:56.739> there<00:03:56.890> so<00:03:57.370> basically<00:03:57.989> if<00:03:58.989> -<00:03:59.560> map

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
are we put there so basically if - map

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.240 
are we put there so basically if - map
contains<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:01.000> player<00:04:01.650> then<00:04:02.650> is<00:04:02.769> gonna<00:04:02.950> remove

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
contains the player then is gonna remove

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.789 
contains the player then is gonna remove
them<00:04:03.489> from<00:04:03.670> hash<00:04:03.910> map<00:04:04.150> otherwise<00:04:05.079> we're<00:04:05.739> gonna

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
them from hash map otherwise we're gonna

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.860 
them from hash map otherwise we're gonna
put<00:04:06.130> them<00:04:06.310> in<00:04:06.340> hash<00:04:06.640> map<00:04:06.910> with<00:04:07.239> no<00:04:07.450> second

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
put them in hash map with no second

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:15.030 
put them in hash map with no second
document<00:04:08.230> so<00:04:09.570> then<00:04:12.030> else<00:04:13.030> if<00:04:13.480> the<00:04:14.260> command

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
document so then else if the command

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:22.080 
document so then else if the command
ylabel<00:04:16.320> dot<00:04:17.320> equals<00:04:18.100> ignore<00:04:18.489> case<00:04:19.530> check

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
ylabel dot equals ignore case check

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.940 
ylabel dot equals ignore case check
if<00:04:22.860> so<00:04:23.860> if<00:04:24.100> if<00:04:24.970> the<00:04:25.090> command<00:04:25.389> is<00:04:25.480> check<00:04:25.810> and<00:04:26.080> if

if so if if the command is check and if

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.409

the hash map contains the key of the

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.960 
the hash map contains the key of the
player<00:04:32.970> then<00:04:33.970> when<00:04:34.120> you<00:04:34.240> play<00:04:34.480> a<00:04:34.510> dot<00:04:34.840> send

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
player then when you play a dot send

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:47.150 
player then when you play a dot send
message<00:04:38.730> you<00:04:39.730> are<00:04:40.180> in<00:04:40.930> the<00:04:41.830> hash<00:04:43.950> hash<00:04:45.780> map

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
message you are in the hash hash map

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.480 
message you are in the hash hash map
just<00:04:48.160> like<00:04:48.280> that<00:04:48.430> okay<00:04:48.730> so<00:04:49.690> now<00:04:49.980> if<00:04:50.980> they're<00:04:51.280> in

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
just like that okay so now if they're in

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.270 
just like that okay so now if they're in
the<00:04:51.669> hash<00:04:51.850> map<00:04:52.120> is<00:04:52.330> guy<00:04:52.450> said<00:04:52.630> them<00:04:52.720> that

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
the hash map is guy said them that

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.490 
the hash map is guy said them that
otherwise<00:04:54.450> maybe<00:04:55.450> player<00:04:55.810> dot<00:04:56.350> send<00:04:57.040> message

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
otherwise maybe player dot send message

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:09.150 
otherwise maybe player dot send message
you<00:04:59.500> are<00:05:00.190> not<00:05:01.000> in<00:05:01.330> the<00:05:03.450> hash<00:05:04.680> map<00:05:07.860> just<00:05:08.860> like

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
you are not in the hash map just like

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.050 
you are not in the hash map just like
that<00:05:09.690> so<00:05:11.190> let's<00:05:12.190> go<00:05:12.340> into<00:05:12.460> our<00:05:12.520> plugin<00:05:12.820> dot<00:05:12.940> one

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
that so let's go into our plugin dot one

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.810 
that so let's go into our plugin dot one
though

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.810

like okay so let's call this hash map
check<00:05:55.450> torture

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.730 

just<00:06:01.970> going<00:06:02.120> to<00:06:02.180> here<00:06:02.390> stop<00:06:02.990> my<00:06:03.110> server<00:06:04.690> right

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
just going to here stop my server right

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:16.450 
just going to here stop my server right
so<00:06:07.990> we<00:06:08.990> go<00:06:09.170> in<00:06:09.320> here<00:06:12.460> and<00:06:13.460> we<00:06:13.670> do<00:06:15.130> stick<00:06:16.130> I<00:06:16.280> think

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460 
so we go in here and we do stick I think

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:25.390 
so we go in here and we do stick I think
it<00:06:16.580> was<00:06:17.050> and<00:06:18.050> then<00:06:18.860> we<00:06:18.950> do<00:06:19.070> check<00:06:19.460> Oh

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.400 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.850 

so<00:06:26.400> I'm<00:06:26.520> I'm<00:06:27.270> not<00:06:27.420> very<00:06:27.630> clever<00:06:27.810> I<00:06:28.440> put<00:06:28.620> out

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 
so I'm I'm not very clever I put out

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.210 
so I'm I'm not very clever I put out
here<00:06:29.190> just<00:06:30.030> just<00:06:30.240> check

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:31.220 
here just just check

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:37.190 
here just just check
so<00:06:32.810> let's<00:06:34.010> actually<00:06:35.120> react<00:06:36.120> sport<00:06:36.660> it<00:06:36.870> first

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.200 
so let's actually react sport it first

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.790 
so let's actually react sport it first
that<00:06:37.500> would<00:06:37.710> be<00:06:39.050> don't<00:06:40.050> be<00:06:40.080> clever<00:06:40.260> now<00:06:40.590> shut

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 
that would be don't be clever now shut

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:49.280 
that would be don't be clever now shut
up<00:06:40.920> over<00:06:42.530> reload<00:06:45.470> so<00:06:46.470> if<00:06:47.100> we<00:06:47.310> do<00:06:47.430> stick<00:06:48.200> and<00:06:49.200> if

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:49.290 
up over reload so if we do stick and if

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:50.660 
up over reload so if we do stick and if
we<00:06:49.380> do<00:06:49.500> check<00:06:49.830> it's<00:06:50.100> gonna<00:06:50.190> say<00:06:50.340> you're<00:06:50.490> in<00:06:50.580> the

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:50.670 
we do check it's gonna say you're in the

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:53.090 
we do check it's gonna say you're in the
hospital<00:06:51.000> we<00:06:51.090> just<00:06:51.270> stick<00:06:51.510> again<00:06:51.890> and<00:06:52.890> we<00:06:52.980> do

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.100 
hospital we just stick again and we do

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.350 
hospital we just stick again and we do
check<00:06:53.400> it's<00:06:53.700> gonna<00:06:53.820> say<00:06:53.910> you're<00:06:54.030> not<00:06:54.090> in

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 
check it's gonna say you're not in

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.120 
check it's gonna say you're not in
hashmap<00:06:54.840> so<00:06:55.410> that's<00:06:55.560> what<00:06:55.650> I'm<00:06:55.800> saying<00:06:56.040> if

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:56.130 
hashmap so that's what I'm saying if

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.740 
hashmap so that's what I'm saying if
someone<00:06:56.250> else<00:06:56.400> came<00:06:56.640> in<00:06:56.790> and<00:06:56.940> they<00:06:57.270> did<00:06:57.450> it<00:06:57.570> and

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:57.750 
someone else came in and they did it and

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.020 
someone else came in and they did it and
we<00:06:58.500> broadcast<00:06:58.980> the<00:06:59.100> message<00:06:59.220> and<00:06:59.550> stuff<00:06:59.730> it

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.030 
we broadcast the message and stuff it

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:02.720 
we broadcast the message and stuff it
with<00:07:00.120> a<00:07:00.440> it<00:07:01.440> would<00:07:01.590> say<00:07:01.740> there<00:07:01.890> and<00:07:02.010> hashmap<00:07:02.310> so

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:02.730 
with a it would say there and hashmap so

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:04.840 
with a it would say there and hashmap so
that's<00:07:02.940> a<00:07:03.030> way<00:07:03.120> of<00:07:03.270> making<00:07:03.660> keying<00:07:04.050> things

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:04.850 
that's a way of making keying things

00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:07.520 
that's a way of making keying things
private<00:07:05.850> to<00:07:05.970> players<00:07:06.210> making<00:07:06.900> little<00:07:07.200> groups

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:07.530 
private to players making little groups

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:09.230 
private to players making little groups
for<00:07:07.860> players<00:07:08.100> and<00:07:08.370> you<00:07:08.490> could<00:07:08.640> do<00:07:08.760> TPA

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.240 
for players and you could do TPA

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:14.380 
for players and you could do TPA
