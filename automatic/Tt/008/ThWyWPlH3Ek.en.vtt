00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 yes hello people welcome to one 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.990
 more ss street 4 tutorial video and 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.080
 today, see mÃ¼nster mission number 5 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.910
 the sequences seven years and this one 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.650
 is not peace and she is 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.809
 starts with our good friend 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.600
 blackbeard and we start directly 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.430
 the first one becomes pure right away 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.490
 mission goal optional see mission goal 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.449
 after we small these types back there 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.890
 little has happened 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.170
 you always have here in this mission 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.029
 very good coverage options so that 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.480
 you are already at the beginning 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.280
 No problems should this have 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.660
 summer due to follow and yes how 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.070
 said here are so for the six 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.960
 you can see all this here 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.690
 pirates who are celebrating here and you 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.129
 then you can at this position you 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.329
 hiding everywhere in the end 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.430
 also continue to piece 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.780
 You can go to the dancers here or to those 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.329
 they are sitting on the floor and they are 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.420
 also been hidden then yes 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.100
 It is good to see this person too 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.199
 then also to mark it in front 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.359
 you can keep an eye on them 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.800
 Now follow my little niece see 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.719
 here also the good think 0 small 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.519
 and I start as fast as possible 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.810
 here in this book that was me 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.400
 Although seen but it is just me 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.340
 right because so crazy off directly 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.020
 and already one in four weeks as 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.060
 Departure is called because we have four 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.189
 kill guards as an optional mission target 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.900
 I will tell you how and exactly how 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.759
 Now show you followed these weeks 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.619
 a little further on her 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.229
 I read conversational got from grade 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.799
 pay attention to me 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.299
 drawn 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.500
 that was a bit premature of me 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.390
 but that is not a problem either 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.009
 just stay at a radius and keep it 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.740
 continue to benefit as well 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.509
 situation around more often his eagle eye 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.310
 to use to know where the guards are 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.350
 then really stop and where 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.759
 maybe offer a situation 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.100
 could watch with the man 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.570
 Can write out the watch there 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.329
 we have seen and I'll switch 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.250
 also directly from how you see it here 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.960
 we have already done that 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.659
 we doubt already turned off 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.060
 all fans two were for the full 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.619
 synchronization and this shows now 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.509
 the first is on the left 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.110
 just as easy from the bush 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.909
 off 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.710
 the second you see back there will be 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.240
 at least not to be avoided that is 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.099
 You go as fast as you can here 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.069
 behind you in the bush even if you 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.670
 the guy noticed briefly because bush 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.319
 stay and it happens then 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.569
 Now I'm waiting for the two of them 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.760
 go further then also here 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.349
 this fourth had to be eliminated unnoticed 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.000
 and there we did it you would have done 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.470
 before then in the book can start 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.420
 After this week you fast 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.250
 but that way it stays better 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.440
 a little bit in the circle around her 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.540
 eavesdrop and does not risk that 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.550
 ye walk away in the end yes so 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.500
 far as well as this option we have goal 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.030
 so finished now it still works 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.600
 therefore , a little bit further went on 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.970
 consequences 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.680
 until finally the next one 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.860
 passes part of the mission 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.230
 So check it out there and now 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.940
 Anyway, here on the left is relatively good 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.920
 passages unobtrusively by the 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.900
 Resolutions follow and we are already in 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.970
 finally arrived where we too 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:59.860
 you wanted to see it arrive 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.530
 comes the little interim sequence it becomes 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.299
 now in the end, yes, such a small 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.130
 Rocket shot down a signal fire 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.780
 I do not want to mission too much 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.910
 later for those who may still be 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.030
 did not play but it was good 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.799
 by otherwise the story as if look at 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.440
 then you're done here 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.900
 This burning house is still in the 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.269
 finally again relatively clear because you 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.390
 just have to go straight and 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:28.030
 specified by the game paths are 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.620
 because you are relatively clear so you see 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.840
 you too have enough time you have 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.850
 Now still 45 seconds to jacko 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.310
 to come and you see I always have 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.019
 still 40 seconds time and very sharp 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.640
 very loose now we are already that 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:43.200
 second option of a mission pull that 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:47.079
 is the warship with the heavy ones 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.579
 Cannons heavy bullets harmless 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.870
 make the shrimp used on the 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.450
 pc i can only use for the pc version 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.000
 speak like this by her 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.319
 just click the left mouse button 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.690
 seen when you are next to the war 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.390
 should be the right mouse button 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.239
 pressure and then the left then made 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.560
 Although the broadside but not this 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.900
 Heavy cannons heavy cannons 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.549
 These are the things that follow and I have 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.380
 you little tip in the mission is 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.420
 or already the people have to open 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.670
 Again, I call it a lot easier 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.989
 You can do it but you see 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.750
 How fast is it with a full 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.060
 equipped sector so start now 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.910
 we are only on board this ship 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.950
 to change it and the others 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.660
 have claimed to satisfy that's 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.610
 also the simple so completely normal 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.200
 if another ship and has easy 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.720
 fulfill the mission requirements 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.850
 and after that, the mission is actually 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.280
 Already as good as you managed to see 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.680
 the different things until 20 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.740
 killing members is relatively easy 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.200
 you have to turn off the customer and 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.730
 She had to destroy powder reserves 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.770
 as I said the whole I will now 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.390
 skip I think you get it 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.680
 a lot has played knows how that 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.300
 should work if that too 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.250
 you can ask his comics 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.400
 post or so then I answer them 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.440
 Of course, you definitely like it 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.030
 this whole story would have to be then 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.150
 swim again to jackos and out of the 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.430
 circle of boats escaped and that was it 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.260
 then already with this mission 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.820
 you liked this tutorial video 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.440
 if you liked it , please let it on 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.390
 abo downtown therefore my others 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.410
 tutorial videos and also my last one 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.490
 that would be nice 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.070
 I hope see you next time 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:24.180
 video again makes it goodbye 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.180
 see you
