00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:05.810
 hello I am marta villar be com today 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.730
 I would like to give you some small tips 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.129
 that can help you if you have decided 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.200
 change of life but you still do not know 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:14.869
 Where to put your hand have you tried a 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:16.730
 there filling a glass of water and 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:19.039
 when it is full, it is up 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.400
 pouring the water that passes so what 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:24.080
 happens is that they do not fit more water then 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.730
 when we have when we want to change 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.740
 of video we want to do different things 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.839
 many times this happens to us we have in 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.390
 these new things if you are emptying 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:35.210
 the above the first thing that I propose 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.850
 is tendientes if you do not know where by 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.739
 your house if it will seem a little to you is father 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.230
 from your house but in the end the house is the 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.760
 reflection of our mind with which 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.320
 you start no matter where by the 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.010
 kitchen or the bathroom where 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:52.129
 you prefer to date or give away all that 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.360
 that no longer serves you, fix everything 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:58.320
 have spoiled 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:02.010
 and populate your comfortable taste that you 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.840
 feel good once you've done what 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.220
 of the house or as you doing it from 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.620
 home 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.730
 and you can start to see what kind of 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:15.090
 activities of people with whom you 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:18.540
 relationships you really do it for a 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.360
 long time habit or an idea of 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.190
 an obligation imposed then maybe 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.510
 let's play tennis every week 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.820
 We do not love the soul of either 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:27.680
 alzheimer 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.370
 become aware of what is really 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:36.229
 is important to you and begins little to 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:39.500
 little to modify and stop going to 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.520
 meetings with people who do not motivate you 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.380
 it makes you feel bad 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.510
 It is important that little by little too 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.920
 we are aware of that let's take 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.479
 consciousness if we want to change and 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.259
 we want to open up to new 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.040
 Introductions new friendships to bring 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.150
 new things 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.340
 let's throw away the beam that we no longer provide 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.020
 nothing we do not know when you're going to 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.619
 stay here and I think it's important 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.869
 to spend it with people and in 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.899
 situations that really motivate us 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.900
 they give us joy you choose who 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.220
 you want to spend with your life you will see yourself as 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.660
 when you start doing these little ones 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.960
 changes 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:23.030
 the results are going to be huge so 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:25.100
 nothing cheer little by little at your pace and 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.930
 start now 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.930
 to live the life you want
