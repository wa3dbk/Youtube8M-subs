00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 Hello my dear, that he will be back 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.109
 be there 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.360
 I actually thought I could 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.389
 you guys today a test video of the 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.120
 new sony alpha 77 present 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.020
 I can do that but it has 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.090
 proved that this sony alpha 77 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.880
 that's not the right one here 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.189
 is for my needs for what 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.140
 So I really need that 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.060
 highly recommend as a camera and me 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.980
 give it even with a heavy heart now 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.960
 back but I had quite 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.750
 other requirements I wanted with it 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.250
 also turn my new videos and for that 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.350
 unfortunately in my eyes at all 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.690
 not to use or I do one 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.489
 mistake if someone out there is watching 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.170
 that maybe can help me or one 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.850
 can give advice then I would be there 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.020
 very connected write me please 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.690
 in the comments 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.579
 I also do not want a technology review here 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.039
 or something I know 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.309
 Much too little is missing and there is 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.070
 in youtube very many test videos 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:06.680
 on the topic Sony Alpha 77 which has now 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.880
 costed objectively in about 1500 euro 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.830
 and was for me actually for the 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.049
 work intended as wide-angle shots 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.090
 sad much and I think so 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.009
 respect, think highly of 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.270
 16.50 ssm no idea does not ask me 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.090
 I said yes I know myself with the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.299
 details are not accurate and this video 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.830
 function works very well 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.930
 it is even here in the finder one 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.780
 built-in spirit level in it and the 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.729
 menu is totally good but what me 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.310
 absolutely fault it i have the first 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.860
 test video downloaded and also mine 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.350
 Soundtrack was a huge rush to 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.970
 I had to listen to an external one now 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.380
 micro connect what i of course 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.450
 do not want to do it 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.009
 because I do not want another 200 euros 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.200
 or spend more on this up here 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.790
 you could do it now 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.350
 and I had now 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.510
 with us in a specialty shop 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.580
 Asked there it was said that they have 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.010
 the sony alpha never heard of it 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.780
 that that's the soundtrack out there but it 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.220
 is very clear test video 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.320
 recorded about a meter 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.000
 Distance from the camera and that 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.710
 background noise was clearly too 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.869
 I can hear you all this here 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.390
 short play I have that namely 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:17.100
 video still all my love that is the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:19.140
 first test with the sony alpha 77 and me 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.090
 I'm curious how that now on the 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.610
 screen looks like the resolution 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.130
 is and yes I'm just curious if 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.390
 we can shoot the next videos like that 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.060
 now you have heard like that in the 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.890
 original condition sounds and so can 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.040
 I do not work now I have the 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.780
 panasonic hdc sd 40 with which I will be 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.140
 about one and a half years turn and 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.350
 will probably stay with the topic 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:46.500
 video movies and so on and pure as 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.020
 Photo camera SLR is mine 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.610
 quite frankly 1500 euros too much 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.330
 expensive we will be back for that 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.640
 send back 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.790
 we ordered the over Amazon 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.640
 had and as I said the quality of 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.130
 the photos are bombastic to this whole 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.190
 zeugs it works flawlessly 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.290
 of course a hu of camera if 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.360
 now this noise would not have been 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.910
 the camera would have been perfect for me 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.040
 but that's the way I should say that too 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.170
 now not a test report but 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.900
 I'm just a little disappointed 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.840
 been that by this internal 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.959
 micro thing up here well does it fit yet 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.890
 this background noise so much 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.840
 falls into the weight 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.989
 there are also in the menu or in the 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.390
 menu guidance no extra buttons where you 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.280
 I could just adjust that 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.930
 only one sensor button found because of 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.909
 wind speeds 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.620
 reduce and so on so the child 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:43.719
 something but I did not have any wind and 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.939
 I also filmed with ton in here 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:46.510
 without doing and the noise was clear 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:48.640
 to listen 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.010
 I have no further attitude 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.280
 I found somehow still 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.739
 anything on the camera on the topic of sound 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.230
 could change or adjust 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.180
 That's why I really do 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.739
 no other choice than this good 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.689
 to return pieces again 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:06.969
 and then I will probably 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:09.010
 either buy the smaller model so 

00:04:06.969 --> 00:04:10.720
 something about 500 euro I think 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.849
 I'm on the safe side with that 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.159
 really only need photos and 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:16.769
 for video I take the panasonic me 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:18.970
 thought that's one 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.699
 multifunction device with which I film 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.410
 can and can take great pictures at the 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:24.910
 There is nothing wrong with photos 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.009
 Again, I can give you a few 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.599
 Examples show you last night 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:30.729
 Just made it quick 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:32.530
 so that you get an impression the 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.880
 it really very brilliant of the 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.830
 resolution all the technical 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.530
 data you can find everything on the internet 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.360
 youtube and so on and yes I am 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.060
 just a bit in love with me 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.260
 so if we like the photo quality a lot 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.960
 very much like it and also the 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.909
 film quality but if the sound is not too 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.680
 it does not work and me 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:52.930
 get this noise easily 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.090
 not gone too with my magix 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.099
 program and there I have the clipper 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.110
 and so on, so I can 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:01.599
 still something in the program itself 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.940
 but I do not even get it away 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:06.400
 something so that's something I do not 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.560
 can accept and maybe someone is 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.110
 who can give me the advice how to 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.460
 that rushing away, well, I get 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.900
 Anyone can hope for me now 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.750
 help or know each other a bit 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.130
 outside with the sony alpha 77 maybe 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.479
 I also have a thinking error in it 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.100
 my husband and I do not know 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:23.380
 can not get us in 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.150
 I also called in one 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.670
 other dealers and there was me too 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.650
 said that these are internal with roses 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.060
 are not particularly powerful and 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.670
 sprinkle a lot and also the 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.130
 amplify background noise and get that 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:39.280
 just then in this rushing noticeable 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.570
 makes and yes but as I said that works 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.000
 not at all for me because i can 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.950
 you do not offer this sound quality there 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
 We would all be subscribers 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.980
 run away 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.540
 so maybe there is one more 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.100
 possibility please write me 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.180
 which does not have to be the one above 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.730
 go back again 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.080
 with amazon we have as return 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.020
 So it is not a problem now 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.940
 maybe it could be a good one 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:04.390
 mirror reflex digital mix camera 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.320
 I can miss in the future 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:10.420
 I had thought 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:12.250
 the canon eos 660 de or 600d that should 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.740
 I also need good pictures 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:17.050
 As I said for work and it should 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.060
 that has also panorama function that 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.040
 I found it really great and it has 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.660
 just 50 frames in seconds and 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.360
 that was very much a performance 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.860
 very powerful but if the 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.450
 movie feature does not work then 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.340
 that's way too expensive for me then so must 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.800
 really everything is right for this price 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.660
 yes now I would be happy if you 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.100
 subscribed to my channel or maybe 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:40.320
 again looked inside for the next 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.320
 videos bye bye your card
