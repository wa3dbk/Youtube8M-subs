a<00:00:58.350> short<00:00:58.469> amount<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:58.949> time<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.309> really

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
a short amount of time is really

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.430 
a short amount of time is really
challenging<00:00:59.879> we<00:01:00.329> have<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.569> push<00:01:00.780> past<00:01:01.079> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
challenging we have to push past the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.469 
challenging we have to push past the
comfort<00:01:01.979> zone<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.609> get<00:01:03.089> to<00:01:03.209> a<00:01:03.239> place<00:01:03.389> where

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
comfort zone and get to a place where

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:05.119 
comfort zone and get to a place where
that<00:01:03.749> hard<00:01:04.019> work<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.379> gonna<00:01:04.500> pay<00:01:04.590> off<00:01:04.739> at<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
that hard work is gonna pay off at the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.440 
that hard work is gonna pay off at the

up close and personal like this it's

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.470 
up close and personal like this it's
really<00:01:28.500> cool<00:01:28.890> it's<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.550> little<00:01:29.820> nerve-wracking

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.480 
really cool it's a little nerve-wracking

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.390 
really cool it's a little nerve-wracking
because<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.900> know<00:01:30.960> they're<00:01:31.830> at<00:01:31.980> the<00:01:32.130> highest

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
level of marching arts possible it's

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.100 
level of marching arts possible it's
also<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.520> level<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.090> excitement<00:01:36.420> because<00:01:36.960> I

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
also a level of excitement because I

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.560 
also a level of excitement because I
know<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.620> when<00:01:38.310> we<00:01:38.340> do<00:01:38.700> get<00:01:38.940> this<00:01:39.120> cleaned

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570
