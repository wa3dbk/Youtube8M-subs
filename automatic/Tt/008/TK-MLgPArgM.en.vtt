codec<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.090> not<00:00:57.930> all<00:00:58.199> editing<00:00:58.770> software

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
codec and not all editing software

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.399 
codec and not all editing software
supports<00:01:00.629> um<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.739> PC<00:01:02.219> 850<00:01:02.760> colic<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.510> think

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
supports um this a PC 850 colic I think

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.210 
supports um this a PC 850 colic I think
it<00:01:04.530> should<00:01:04.739> seen<00:01:04.949> em<00:01:05.129> -<00:01:05.460> yes<00:01:06.710> so<00:01:07.710> not<00:01:08.040> all

it should seen em - yes so not all

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.170 
it should seen em - yes so not all
editing<00:01:08.790> software<00:01:09.240> supports<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.900> but<00:01:11.180> you're

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
editing software supports it but you're

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.050 
editing software supports it but you're
gonna<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.570> convert<00:01:13.320> if<00:01:13.950> you're<00:01:14.250> using

Windows Movie Maker you don't have to

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.820 
Windows Movie Maker you don't have to
download<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:18.090> converting<00:01:18.840> software<00:01:19.409> to

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
download a converting software to

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.830 
download a converting software to
convert<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.640> then<00:01:23.150> but<00:01:24.150> if<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.360> have<00:01:24.479> windows

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840

like<00:01:25.020> moving<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.710> don't<00:01:25.860> have<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.250> convert<00:01:26.700> or

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
like moving you don't have to convert or

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.179 
like moving you don't have to convert or
anything<00:01:27.140> it's<00:01:28.140> just<00:01:28.290> gonna<00:01:28.650> take<00:01:28.950> some<00:01:28.979> time

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
anything it's just gonna take some time

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.819 
anything it's just gonna take some time
but<00:01:29.780> it's<00:01:30.780> totally<00:01:30.960> fine<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:33.079> now<00:01:34.079> it's<00:01:34.530> good

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
but it's totally fine so now it's good

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.030 
but it's totally fine so now it's good
to<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.280> once<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.939> is<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.420> Newtonian<00:01:37.079> surgery

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
to the once it is the Newtonian surgery

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.609 
to the once it is the Newtonian surgery
you<00:01:38.189> can<00:01:38.430> see<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:39.090> camera<00:01:39.360> can<00:01:39.659> focus<00:01:39.869> it

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
you can see this camera can focus it

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.940 
you can see this camera can focus it
Sony<00:01:40.860> lens<00:01:43.220> and<00:01:44.220> here<00:01:44.720> III<00:01:45.720> believe<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.530> main

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
Sony lens and here III believe this main

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.510 
Sony lens and here III believe this main
feature<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.810> 30x<00:01:48.810> optical<00:01:49.259> zoom<00:01:49.950> not<00:01:50.490> a

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
feature is 30x optical zoom not a

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.800 
feature is 30x optical zoom not a
digital<00:01:50.960> 30x<00:01:51.960> optical<00:01:52.229> which<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.040> really<00:01:53.549> nice

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
digital 30x optical which is really nice

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.840 
digital 30x optical which is really nice
there's<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.899> pretty<00:01:55.140> big<00:01:55.380> lens<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.100> that's

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
there's a pretty big lens and that's

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.959 
there's a pretty big lens and that's
probably<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.360> aperture<00:01:58.310> number<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.939> I

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
probably the aperture number of the I

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.179 
probably the aperture number of the I
know<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.420> don't<00:02:00.630> know<00:02:00.810> what<00:02:01.049> those<00:02:01.380> are<00:02:01.439> one
