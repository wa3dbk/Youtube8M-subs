00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:10.916
 Welcome to the quick course on the Wind Walker Monk. 

00:00:10.916 --> 00:00:15.053
 In this video, we'll show you a brief summary of what to do 

00:00:15.053 --> 00:00:18.059
 to start playing with a level 90 Windwalker. 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.928
 They use two main features: energy and chi. Energy is mainly used 

00:00:24.928 --> 00:00:29.746
 to accumulate chi. Chi is used to perform powerful attacks. 

00:00:29.746 --> 00:00:34.167
 Before starting the fight, activate the Legacy of the White Tiger 

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:37.145
 to increase their attributes and chance of critical hit. 

00:00:37.145 --> 00:00:41.828
 In battles, the main source of chi is Jabe. Always use 

00:00:41.828 --> 00:00:44.048
 that does not have enough chi to give a better blow. 

00:00:44.048 --> 00:00:48.629
 Then use Tiger Palm to earn the Tiger Power bonus. 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.808
 Tiger's palm only spends 1 chi, but the damage is very low 

00:00:52.808 --> 00:00:55.764
 it is best to use it just to keep the bonus active. 

00:00:55.764 --> 00:01:00.931
 Then comes the kick of the rising sun. Use when not recharging 

00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:03.202
 while Tiger Power is active. 

00:01:03.202 --> 00:01:06.865
 Fist Fists too, use whenever you can. 

00:01:06.865 --> 00:01:10.364
 Or spend the chi in the Chute Blackout. 

00:01:10.364 --> 00:01:14.270
 While performing basic rotation, stick to the effects 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.538
 of the "combo-break" type. 

00:01:15.538 --> 00:01:20.053
 When using Jabe, you have a chance to drop a combo break with Tiger Palm 

00:01:20.053 --> 00:01:24.265
 or Blackout Chute, using the skills without spending any chi. 

00:01:24.265 --> 00:01:27.587
 You will know when you get a combo-breaker for the icons 

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:29.220
 on both sides of your character. 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.248
 An icon on the left is worth a Palm of the Tiger. On the right 

00:01:33.248 --> 00:01:37.537
 It's worth a Blackout Kick. The Chute of the Rising Sun is more important 

00:01:37.537 --> 00:01:40.595
 but remember to use the skills when the icons appear. 

00:01:40.595 --> 00:01:43.824
 There is much more to learn to dominate the monk 

00:01:43.824 --> 00:01:46.325
 but we hope that this introduction will give you the necessary knowledge 

00:01:46.325 --> 00:01:48.274
 to go in the right direction. 

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:51.820
 Once you've mastered the basics, spend some time 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.698
 reading about the library, the talents and the glyphs to know 

00:01:55.698 --> 00:01:58.088
 other skills not mentioned here. 

00:01:58.088 --> 00:02:01.626
 Thanks for watching, and see you in Draenor!
