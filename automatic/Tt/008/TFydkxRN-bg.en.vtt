00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:02.579 
what I did to show where I was at in
here<00:01:01.359> since<00:01:01.629> it<00:01:01.780> was<00:01:01.809> kind<00:01:02.050> of<00:01:02.109> sitting<00:01:02.289> at<00:01:02.500> an

here since it was kind of sitting at an
angle<00:01:02.980> and<00:01:03.160> some<00:01:03.370> of<00:01:03.489> the<00:01:03.550> foundations<00:01:04.059> up

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
angle and some of the foundations up

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.660 
angle and some of the foundations up
against<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.750> side<00:01:05.019> if<00:01:05.710> you<00:01:05.770> have<00:01:06.070> a<00:01:06.100> pump<00:01:06.430> you

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
against the side if you have a pump you

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.180 
against the side if you have a pump you
can<00:01:06.880> screw<00:01:07.360> off<00:01:07.540> the<00:01:07.570> top<00:01:07.960> wipe<00:01:08.440> off<00:01:08.710> the<00:01:08.950> top

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
can screw off the top wipe off the top

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.490 
can screw off the top wipe off the top
put<00:01:09.520> it<00:01:09.550> back<00:01:09.790> in<00:01:10.210> and<00:01:10.540> then<00:01:10.840> when<00:01:11.020> you<00:01:11.140> take<00:01:11.380> it

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
put it back in and then when you take it

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.910 
put it back in and then when you take it
out<00:01:11.620> your<00:01:12.250> foundation<00:01:12.940> should<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:14.650> should<00:01:14.800> be

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
out your foundation should you should be

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.780 
out your foundation should you should be
able<00:01:15.010> to<00:01:15.130> see<00:01:15.460> where<00:01:16.030> your<00:01:16.930> mark<00:01:17.640> should<00:01:18.640> be

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
able to see where your mark should be

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.580 
able to see where your mark should be
made<00:01:19.060> where<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:19.750> foundation<00:01:20.380> is<00:01:20.470> actually

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
made where the foundation is actually

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.190 
made where the foundation is actually
actually<00:01:21.220> sitting<00:01:21.820> in<00:01:22.150> the<00:01:22.450> container<00:01:22.960> if

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
actually sitting in the container if

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.970 
actually sitting in the container if
that<00:01:23.410> makes<00:01:23.620> sense

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:23.980 
that makes sense

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.520 
that makes sense
so<00:01:24.370> that's<00:01:24.700> what<00:01:24.820> I<00:01:24.880> did<00:01:25.060> with<00:01:25.180> this<00:01:25.330> one<00:01:25.390> if<00:01:26.260> I

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
so that's what I did with this one if I

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.680 
so that's what I did with this one if I
wear<00:01:26.980> this<00:01:27.130> on<00:01:27.310> its<00:01:27.460> own<00:01:27.610> I<00:01:27.880> usually<00:01:28.450> have<00:01:28.600> to

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
wear this on its own I usually have to

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.930 
wear this on its own I usually have to
use<00:01:28.810> four<00:01:29.290> pumps<00:01:29.980> of<00:01:30.100> this<00:01:30.190> because<00:01:30.520> my

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
use four pumps of this because my

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.550 
use four pumps of this because my
preferred<00:01:31.390> way<00:01:31.600> to<00:01:31.660> use<00:01:31.870> this<00:01:32.050> is<00:01:32.260> with<00:01:32.440> the

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
preferred way to use this is with the

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.470 
preferred way to use this is with the
Beauty<00:01:32.860> Blender<00:01:33.220> and<00:01:33.250> it<00:01:33.580> does<00:01:33.730> absorb<00:01:33.940> up<00:01:34.330> a

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
Beauty Blender and it does absorb up a

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.990 
Beauty Blender and it does absorb up a
little<00:01:34.720> bit<00:01:34.900> of<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.110> foundation<00:01:35.430> but<00:01:36.430> just<00:01:36.880> on

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
little bit of the foundation but just on

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.360 
little bit of the foundation but just on
its<00:01:37.180> own<00:01:37.300> it's<00:01:37.540> incredibly<00:01:38.080> sheer<00:01:38.530> I<00:01:38.890> have<00:01:39.220> to

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
its own it's incredibly sheer I have to

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.660 
its own it's incredibly sheer I have to
use<00:01:39.640> about<00:01:40.330> three<00:01:40.960> pumps<00:01:41.410> if<00:01:41.650> I'm<00:01:41.920> not<00:01:42.100> using<00:01:42.400> a

use about three pumps if I'm not using a

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.790 
use about three pumps if I'm not using a
Beauty<00:01:42.910> Blender<00:01:43.050> just<00:01:44.050> because<00:01:44.350> of<00:01:44.650> the

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
Beauty Blender just because of the

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.860 
Beauty Blender just because of the
consistency<00:01:45.400> of<00:01:45.790> this<00:01:46.030> foundation<00:01:46.540> it's<00:01:46.690> very

down before I put my foundation and it

down before I put my foundation and it
just<00:02:16.629> conceals<00:02:17.319> everything<00:02:17.920> so<00:02:18.250> I<00:02:18.459> don't<00:02:18.760> know

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.250 
I'm thinking maybe three or four more
weeks<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:21.790> this<00:02:21.909> should<00:02:22.120> be<00:02:22.239> finished<00:02:22.569> up<00:02:22.720> so

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
weeks and this should be finished up so

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.630 
weeks and this should be finished up so
there's<00:02:23.739> that<00:02:24.040> one<00:02:25.739> then<00:02:26.739> I<00:02:26.980> have<00:02:27.040> my

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640

there's that one then I have my

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
suggestion for many guys to use it as a

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.560 
suggestion for many guys to use it as a
lip<00:04:47.920> liner<00:04:48.130> a<00:04:48.280> little<00:04:48.580> bit<00:04:48.700> so<00:04:48.970> I'll<00:04:49.180> put<00:04:49.450> it

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
lip liner a little bit so I'll put it

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.560 
lip liner a little bit so I'll put it
along<00:04:50.200> the<00:04:50.230> outer<00:04:51.040> edge<00:04:51.370> of<00:04:51.400> my<00:04:51.910> lips<00:04:52.180> when<00:04:52.480> I'm

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
along the outer edge of my lips when I'm

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.500 
along the outer edge of my lips when I'm
wearing<00:04:52.720> a<00:04:53.080> purpley<00:04:53.650> kind<00:04:54.220> of<00:04:54.280> color<00:04:54.520> and<00:04:54.850> its

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
wearing a purpley kind of color and its

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.120 
wearing a purpley kind of color and its
really<00:04:55.720> been<00:04:55.990> allowing<00:04:56.410> me<00:04:56.650> to<00:04:56.680> use<00:04:56.800> it<00:04:57.100> a

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
really been allowing me to use it a

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.190 
really been allowing me to use it a
couple<00:04:57.430> of<00:04:57.580> different<00:04:57.940> ways<00:04:58.240> so<00:04:58.660> then<00:04:58.840> I<00:04:59.020> had

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
couple of different ways so then I had

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.070 
couple of different ways so then I had
my<00:04:59.530> MAC<00:05:00.070> lipstick<00:05:00.850> this<00:05:01.060> is<00:05:01.120> the<00:05:01.480> Viva<00:05:01.870> Glam

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
my MAC lipstick this is the Viva Glam

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.730 
my MAC lipstick this is the Viva Glam
Gaga

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
Gaga

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.290 
Gaga
and<00:05:02.950> this<00:05:03.130> is<00:05:03.280> a<00:05:03.310> lustre<00:05:03.730> so<00:05:03.910> it's<00:05:04.030> a<00:05:04.090> little

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
and this is a lustre so it's a little

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.900 
and this is a lustre so it's a little
bit<00:05:04.390> easier<00:05:04.780> to<00:05:04.990> wear<00:05:05.530> then<00:05:05.980> a<00:05:06.250> deeper<00:05:06.670> shade

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:06.910 
bit easier to wear then a deeper shade

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:09.090 
bit easier to wear then a deeper shade
and<00:05:07.330> then<00:05:07.480> you<00:05:08.170> know<00:05:08.260> it's<00:05:08.410> easier<00:05:08.680> to<00:05:08.800> wear<00:05:08.920> it

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
and then you know it's easier to wear it

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.430 
and then you know it's easier to wear it
than<00:05:09.250> something<00:05:09.550> that's<00:05:09.700> matte<00:05:10.270> because<00:05:10.900> it

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
than something that's matte because it

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.410 
than something that's matte because it
does<00:05:11.620> wear<00:05:11.860> off<00:05:11.890> a<00:05:12.070> little<00:05:12.310> bit<00:05:12.520> easier<00:05:12.910> so

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.420 
does wear off a little bit easier so

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.770 
does wear off a little bit easier so
when<00:05:13.750> I<00:05:13.780> started<00:05:14.440> I<00:05:14.770> was<00:05:15.280> all<00:05:15.730> the<00:05:16.000> way<00:05:16.090> up<00:05:16.420> at

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
when I started I was all the way up at

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.090 
when I started this one's gonna go
backwards<00:05:54.970> so<00:05:55.360> when<00:05:55.990> I<00:05:56.020> started<00:05:56.470> I<00:05:56.680> was<00:05:56.710> right

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710
