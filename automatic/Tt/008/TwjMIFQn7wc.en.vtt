00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:31.700
 I learn very much a by nature 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:34.580
 Nature is something that is perfect 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:38.330
 just so it did not matter to anything 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:42.310
 I do not need anything more and I think so 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.310
 that reminds me a lot of mother to herself 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.640
 I think mozart was a genius of this 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.630
 different human characters like that 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.850
 well describe and through the music and 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.780
 that was very important to me 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:52.049
 accurately analyze which characters 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:55.619
 just describes and then I had to 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:58.830
 do that with a plus 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:02.720
 that is alive and mozart music 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.720
 and liveliness that does not work 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.519
 sometimes introduce me 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:35.819
 mozart is clicking a picture 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:38.920
 he meant me a big one very much 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:42.280
 expressively thematic is he has 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:45.220
 maybe a smaller name and 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.139
 Kathrin Pattinson so dropped what 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:54.780
 are very dramatic and you have to 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:54.780
 continue to interpret 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:20.050
 i can have enough mozart i can 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.709
 It will still be my practice for so long 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.989
 joy 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.019
 this results in the preparation has it 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:29.370
 I was very happy and me 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:33.790
 I hope that the listeners will find out 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:37.209
 edwin fischer the legendary pianist has 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:42.010
 Mozart was a test of the 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:45.400
 Herzens and his music comes from the heart 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:49.989
 and hearts may it hold again 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:53.079
 that 's what moves us and I want 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:56.250
 with this exception the hearts of 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.250
 move people
