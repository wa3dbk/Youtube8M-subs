00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.969
 the fastest cars in the country 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.940
 landed in a new holy rita in the 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.770
 last weekend before r went to the 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.470
 velopark know the Brazilian start 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.810
 and show how a technology 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.760
 is present in the constant 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.760
 evolution of this modality 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.000
 i 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.390
 it's time to talk in speed 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.820
 a lot of speed 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.789
 why a clue came today to 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.190
 velopark international racetrack 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:01.920
 talk about the rush like this 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.449
 sport arrived in Brazil and how it evolved 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.080
 to what is today 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.080
 check it out 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.340
 the start is a competition where the 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.920
 participant has to go through a 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.500
 distance equivalent to one quarter of 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.530
 mile in the shortest possible time 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.550
 this modality appeared in California in the 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.850
 U.S 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.640
 right after the Second World War in 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:32.380
 brazil the first confection of this type 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.930
 happened in curitiba in 1958 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.850
 nowadays the principle of the start 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.180
 remains the same 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.970
 the garments are made in pairs and 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.430
 all divided by categories that in the 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.619
 majority of cases can group the 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:51.250
 more different types of vehicles 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:53.430
 divided by the power or the level of 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.930
 preparation of each 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:00.310
 in the last 45 years there really 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.140
 there was a 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.310
 a professionalization of the category 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.849
 together with the construction of the 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.209
 and we believe that the 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:16.260
 professionalism the organization everything everything 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.260
 came to improve 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.970
 I would say that Brazil is torn because it is 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.370
 in the past much difficulty 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.960
 of quality track she demanded that the 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.580
 electronics advance a lot 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.430
 and then own their own 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.720
 preparers and a former mechanic from brazil 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.030
 they had to evolve a lot to 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.250
 can make the cars on the track animals 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.860
 and today the acquisition of data is a 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.570
 essential tool in any car 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.220
 competition because in fact there is no 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.560
 past the pilot say yes I think 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.940
 have to adjust such thing second gear 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.490
 I was bad today, not today. 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.880
 else you observe data acquisition from the 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:53.130
 car you have 60 sensors connected 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.200
 and can see exactly at each point 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.989
 like that attraction like Justin was 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.510
 engine was regular and this 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.650
 part will make the car have the 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.769
 best time 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.480
 What does Tallinn mean to you? 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.670
 isolated inside the car 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.980
 another very fast car, too. 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.000
 your side and often caring for the 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.099
 barbados 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.769
 Actually I think I started to 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.329
 walk better on the run or walk well 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.540
 on the bench when I did not 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:25.239
 realize who was on my side 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:28.090
 whether he was the winner or whether 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.230
 was in position my opponent was 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.560
 I think it's still a focus 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.629
 so you do not lose your 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.329
 concentration inside the car you have 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:39.849
 to sit there and disconnect from everything and 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:42.280
 think that's your passing moment 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:45.340
 I was dazzled in the pits by several 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.650
 two models in particular and I 'm here 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.879
 with the preparer of these cars 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.650
 what changes did not occupy like this 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:56.200
 that for me they only have the carcass that joão 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.950
 paulo is in fact only the burden of 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.260
 opal changes since the motorization is coming out 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:06.669
 the traditional six- cylinder v8 engine 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:09.730
 They do not get to 350 and 400 delegates with a 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:10.780
 process that works with 45 10 and 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.209
 depression 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.310
 in close to 2 thousand until then a 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.889
 different car error account for 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.930
 reach 300 per hour with ease 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.510
 Good guys, now I'm going to show the second one. 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.490
 model that caught my attention here and 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.669
 another just on the side of the pilot 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.540
 when gyan does not show this marvel 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.550
 that this camaro ss 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.950
 he only has the little shrimp body and 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.650
 felipe camarão has nothing 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:40.340
 already the chrome molybdenum chassis that 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:43.180
 continues in the United States a shell 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.180
 of carbon fiber layers 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:49.580
 We came back and part built in Brazil 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:53.060
 one million the rookies in the front behind 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.820
 huge tires and soft when the car 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:59.510
 is on the track the tire looks like it is very 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:01.670
 soft because it is a characteristic of 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:05.120
 drag racing lost the money in advance 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:07.610
 and came the great driver has attraction in the 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.040
 front is a little bit of us 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.290
 can happen really 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:16.040
 the guide is the rear of the car at the door with 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:19.790
 The farm car that are slicks tires 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:23.120
 is a huge variety of more 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.800
 harder moles but this composition 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.500
 this set that makes people 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.750
 get out in time and why I 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.600
 I do not think I see it. 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:36.320
 tires with kneading so on one they 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:39.170
 will double 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.830
 imagine when he the rear tire it 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:44.860
 stretch he wants to grab 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:47.040
 the amapá the track when he wants to grab 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:50.170
 the lane is folding so that the bottle 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:53.440
 contour so I can tell you how much 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:56.980
 the more he grabs the more grip he has and 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.290
 better driver control has your car is 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:02.850
 a set of things pension and such and such 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:02.850
 But that's it, you 're right. 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.200
 1 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:23.870
 And you like the picture on the track. 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:26.120
 so watch this scrap won
