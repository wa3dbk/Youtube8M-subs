00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
jamming I think it was a great move by

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.390 
jamming I think it was a great move by

because<00:04:30.090> it's<00:04:30.270> obviously<00:04:30.690> what<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:31.020> Calgary

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
because it's obviously what the Calgary

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.170 
because it's obviously what the Calgary
defense<00:04:31.770> thought<00:04:31.980> but<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.640> quick<00:04:32.850> kick<00:04:33.030> I

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
defense thought but the quick kick I

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.520 
defense thought but the quick kick I
think<00:04:33.330> is<00:04:33.420> going<00:04:33.540> to<00:04:33.630> be<00:04:33.750> a<00:04:33.780> great<00:04:34.050> offensive

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
think is going to be a great offensive

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:35.660
