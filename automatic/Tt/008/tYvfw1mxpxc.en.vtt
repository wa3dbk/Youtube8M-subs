00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.390
 hello friends welcome will come my 

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:06.339
 name is events and rodríguez in the class 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:08.620
 today we are going to see the plant performance 

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:10.509
 if you want to know what it is 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.040
 please stay with us in 

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:14.130
 with the intro 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.130
 ah 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.509
 good friends the flan is good a 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.820
 performance in what it consists 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:28.070
 good he plants we have it in 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.169
 the sheet of rudy lie we too 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.899
 we are going to put it so that you 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:35.449
 download in pdf through seven if 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.449
 rodríguez dotcom and good the following 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:42.620
 is the explanation of what is good 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:46.190
 are four figures worth it would be two 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.149
 right and two left if it is the same 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.970
 to the doubles ie right right 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:56.030
 left left that happens that the 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:01:01.230
 first of every two will bring a flan 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:05.489
 then this would be right 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.990
 left flame let's say we repeat the 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.140
 same hand with which we do 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.050
 the flan if you realize if we 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.070
 we do slowly you will see that just 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.670
 we go down 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.130
 let's pass the custard and there is really the 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.049
 left 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.729
 Well, we do not need it at all 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.649
 So that's where we have 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.360
 that take advantage of that energy to 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:30.760
 just do this 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.480
 What the left really does is a 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.670
 stroud app would make one and you're 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.740
 up and then it is already staying 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:43.600
 making the tape stroud let's say 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.979
 we would do down up up and with the 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.700
 same with the other hand we would do 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:50.920
 exactly the same movement 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.020
 we would say that it would be right right 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.070
 left left right right 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.130
 left left if we practice what 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.350
 that would be the up stroke of the hand with the 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.130
 that we are in the part of 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.830
 below you will see how suddenly that is 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.300
 move let's save a lot 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.610
 a lot of energy because really 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.170
 what we would do would be 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.810
 directly and upload it so that 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.500
 it would be ready then this 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.500
 it would really be 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.299
 if you realize, it would be two with each 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.739
 hand is worth no more 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.739
 let's see it now with the metronome 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.789
 well friends, so far, the video of 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.410
 today I hope you liked to remember 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:43.500
 that's good, all this kind of 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.330
 rudiments that we have done then 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.090
 you have to study it little by little always 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.310
 we say it apart are rudiments that 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.129
 then we'll see how to use them in the 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.830
 kit 

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:56.389
 we have taken it up to 120 what 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.879
 you can carry at the speed that 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:01.429
 you obviously want 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:02.869
 well, we always try 

00:05:01.429 --> 00:05:05.659
 do it at a speed more or less 

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:07.629
 mean for you to see it and 

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:10.610
 can you follow us you know without problems 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:12.709
 so then without more from here from 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.899
 that will come ams we tell you very many 

00:05:12.709 --> 00:05:17.509
 thank you for following us so many thanks

 really help us a lot because 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:25.099
 you ask us things and then then 

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:27.919
 you give us ideas for the following 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:30.349
 videos, do not despair because those 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:33.409
 videos are doing little by little 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:37.070
 as you can check these little ones and 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:39.380
 you can we have to be give 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.390
