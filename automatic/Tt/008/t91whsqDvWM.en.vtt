00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.990 

well<00:05:04.560> I<00:05:04.590> wish<00:05:05.070> I'd<00:05:05.250> have<00:05:05.430> had<00:05:05.550> a<00:05:05.580> little<00:05:05.760> more

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
well I wish I'd have had a little more

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.930 
well I wish I'd have had a little more
time<00:05:06.810> to<00:05:07.190> stay<00:05:08.190> at<00:05:08.310> the<00:05:08.430> range<00:05:08.639> and<00:05:08.789> do<00:05:08.909> a

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
time to stay at the range and do a

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.659 
time to stay at the range and do a
little<00:05:09.090> more<00:05:09.300> shooting<00:05:09.659> earlier<00:05:09.960> today<00:05:10.320> but

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
little more shooting earlier today but

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.070 
little more shooting earlier today but
just<00:05:11.669> one<00:05:11.820> of<00:05:11.909> them<00:05:12.060> days<00:05:12.270> when<00:05:12.659> you<00:05:12.870> could

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
just one of them days when you could

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.260 
just one of them days when you could
hardly<00:05:13.349> fit<00:05:13.650> it<00:05:13.770> in<00:05:13.919> but<00:05:14.250> I<00:05:14.520> did<00:05:14.759> want<00:05:14.970> to<00:05:15.060> get<00:05:15.210> a

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
hardly fit it in but I did want to get a

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.290 
hardly fit it in but I did want to get a
few<00:05:15.720> shots<00:05:16.220> off<00:05:17.220> with<00:05:17.639> this<00:05:17.820> little<00:05:18.090> critter

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
few shots off with this little critter

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.370 
few shots off with this little critter
to<00:05:18.659> see<00:05:19.320> how<00:05:19.530> well<00:05:19.770> it<00:05:19.919> worked<00:05:20.159> and<00:05:21.150> it<00:05:22.080> seemed

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
to see how well it worked and it seemed

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.230 
to see how well it worked and it seemed
to<00:05:22.470> work<00:05:22.590> just<00:05:22.650> fine<00:05:23.159> even<00:05:23.460> though<00:05:23.639> sites<00:05:23.970> were

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
to work just fine even though sites were

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:31.700 
to work just fine even though sites were
reasonably<00:05:25.080> well<00:05:25.470> on<00:05:27.590> and<00:05:28.880> as<00:05:29.880> you<00:05:30.330> can<00:05:30.539> see

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
reasonably well on and as you can see

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.969 
reasonably well on and as you can see
before<00:05:32.669> I<00:05:32.699> had<00:05:33.660> trouble<00:05:34.110> with<00:05:34.199> that<00:05:34.259> sight<00:05:34.680> pin

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
before I had trouble with that sight pin

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:37.999 
before I had trouble with that sight pin
being<00:05:35.340> out<00:05:35.789> a<00:05:35.820> little<00:05:36.120> bit<00:05:36.270> you<00:05:37.169> can<00:05:37.320> see<00:05:37.380> it's

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:38.009 
being out a little bit you can see it's

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:40.700 
being out a little bit you can see it's
come<00:05:38.580> back<00:05:38.850> out<00:05:39.090> just<00:05:39.509> a<00:05:39.840> little<00:05:39.870> bit<00:05:40.229> there

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
come back out just a little bit there

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.730 
come back out just a little bit there
and<00:05:40.949> it<00:05:41.940> is<00:05:42.090> so<00:05:42.120> looshing<00:05:42.810> push<00:05:43.080> it<00:05:43.259> back<00:05:43.470> in

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
and it is so looshing push it back in

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.990 
and it is so looshing push it back in
with<00:05:43.860> your<00:05:44.009> finger<00:05:46.310> I'm<00:05:47.310> probably<00:05:47.580> going<00:05:47.789> to

either put a little lock tight on it or

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.189
