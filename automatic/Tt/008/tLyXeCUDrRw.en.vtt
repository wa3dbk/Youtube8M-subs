00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
oil okay back up as though this is going

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.380 
oil okay back up as though this is going
to<00:03:20.709> attack<00:03:20.980> you<00:03:21.190> it'll<00:03:21.910> be<00:03:21.940> okay

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
to attack you it'll be okay

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.880 
to attack you it'll be okay
you<00:03:22.840> just<00:03:22.989> want<00:03:23.110> to<00:03:23.140> start<00:03:23.320> adding<00:03:23.590> it<00:03:23.680> really

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
you just want to start adding it really

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.430 
you just want to start adding it really
slowly<00:03:24.160> okay<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:25.060> then<00:03:25.360> it<00:03:25.510> you<00:03:26.110> can<00:03:26.260> hear<00:03:26.380> it

slowly okay and then it you can hear it

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.479 
slowly okay and then it you can hear it
start<00:03:26.680> to<00:03:26.769> get<00:03:26.860> a<00:03:26.920> little<00:03:27.040> thicker<00:03:27.280> and

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
start to get a little thicker and

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.710 
start to get a little thicker and
thicker<00:03:27.640> how<00:03:28.540> much<00:03:28.690> it

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
thicker how much it

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.140 
thicker how much it
I<00:03:29.750> don't<00:03:30.320> know<00:03:30.380> it's<00:03:30.530> just<00:03:30.740> until<00:03:30.980> it<00:03:31.070> stops<00:03:31.340> so

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
I don't know it's just until it stops so

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.570 
I don't know it's just until it stops so
it<00:03:32.270> gets<00:03:32.390> really<00:03:32.540> thick<00:03:33.280> so<00:03:34.280> that<00:03:34.430> should<00:03:34.520> be

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
it gets really thick so that should be

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.070 
it gets really thick so that should be
now<00:03:34.670> maybe<00:03:34.880> that<00:03:35.000> was<00:03:35.120> like<00:03:35.240> a<00:03:35.270> cup<00:03:35.570> for<00:03:35.870> two

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
now maybe that was like a cup for two

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.080 
now maybe that was like a cup for two
egg<00:03:36.350> yolks<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:36.860> then<00:03:37.670> we're<00:03:37.760> gonna<00:03:37.880> add<00:03:38.060> in

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
time constraints and like even the

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.430 
time constraints and like even the
improv<00:04:28.250> one<00:04:28.430> that<00:04:28.550> you<00:04:28.610> guys<00:04:28.730> did<00:04:29.030> I<00:04:29.410> guess<00:04:30.410> a

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
improv one that you guys did I guess a

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:37.510 
improv one that you guys did I guess a
93<00:04:31.010> is<00:04:31.190> very<00:04:32.410> embarrassing<00:04:36.190> know<00:04:37.190> itself

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
93 is very embarrassing know itself

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.190
