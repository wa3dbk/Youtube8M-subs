00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.680
 I'll explain in another video because right now 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.170
 they are down because they work more than 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.620
 all in the morning they work for the 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:18.640
 magnificent good and how I come deciding 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:21.310
 they develop some books and some 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.460
 things are going to come to me to this place 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.830
 where there are already caves and everything is not 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:31.000
 caves not in all the caves is not only 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.590
 then there as if species of views in 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.350
 the mountains but the biggest is 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.320
 very high here as you can see here there 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.770
 a cave here is a cave and good 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.960
 let's show you some some things 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.260
 that were not the key to launch the 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.260
 egg 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.900
 and another little 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.509
 no less a box but that's how it comes out I do not 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.549
 like how the coso appears to launch 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:59.659
 the arrows the bow I do not like how 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:02.750
 appears and good but then normal dance 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.899
 but I do not like how the bow and the 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:10.989
 eggs that are thrown many times I do not 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.989
 like how they are thrown and good 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.760
 and the maps are bigger and so for 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:21.630
 some tablets that are a bit 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:25.430
 slow let's say Chinese speaking they do not go 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:28.890
 capital much good and at the same time faster 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.840
 So what are you going to do in case 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.620
 at first to me at the beginning he takes me 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.050
 a little bit a little bit but already the 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.489
 while it's off, and then I do not 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.540
 I have problems what they have to do 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:45.480
 is to give it here tells me views distance what 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.459
 they take it off and but I no longer take the 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.069
 that this is to take away the ctc if 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:53.239
 they want but I always like me 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.890
 well but in this way you can not give me 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.260
 and good 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.690
 and then this has been everything and I hope that 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.180
 like it 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:06.209
 and good 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.129
 so that this book of the egg but I 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.170
 I like it although I think it's because 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.450
 he is creative but when he left rival 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.069
 it also happens the same thing by launching a 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:21.870
 bunch and they launch but as projectiles 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:24.630
 and well this has been everything and 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.860
 hope you like 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.380
 and good 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.730
 and this has been everything and I hope that 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.060
 comment to know that I have to 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.860
 improve and good they have put me new 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:43.110
 items 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:43.110
 and good now to clarify here 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:53.190
 is good telescope does have good 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.190
