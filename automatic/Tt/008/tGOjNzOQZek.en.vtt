00:00:10.455 --> 00:00:11.313
 Hello! 

00:00:11.313 --> 00:00:12.258
 My name is Grace Juan 

00:00:12.258 --> 00:00:15.008
 and I am a lecturer in the educational program here. 

00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:17.832
 For students who are not yet familiar with modern art, 

00:00:17.832 --> 00:00:20.249
 I think this picture can be a challenge. 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:22.409
 I usually try to make it easy for students, 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:23.674
 helping them to see, 

00:00:23.674 --> 00:00:26.266
 that Picasso here takes the human body 

00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:29.331
 and turns it into colors and figures. 

00:00:29.331 --> 00:00:31.639
 Our eyes start to look for familiar things - 

00:00:31.639 --> 00:00:34.106
 "Oh, I see a face, I see my eyes." 

00:00:34.106 --> 00:00:36.930
 Light-fast these figures combine 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.671
 and then we see this mirror. 

00:00:39.671 --> 00:00:43.259
 And I think this moment of discovery is very interesting to them. 

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:46.183
 Something like "This is a girl and she looks in a mirror, 

00:00:46.183 --> 00:00:48.749
 and the mirror says something different from the real world ... " 

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:50.684
 It looks really sad, 

00:00:50.684 --> 00:00:52.037
 or dislike what he sees, 

00:00:52.037 --> 00:00:54.088
 or it reveals her true feelings. 

00:00:54.088 --> 00:00:55.312
 And it's very exciting, 

00:00:55.312 --> 00:00:57.561
 because this is a direct interpretation. 

00:00:57.561 --> 00:00:58.290
 I ask them 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.861
 "How did you get to that?". 

00:00:59.861 --> 00:01:01.756
 And then we start talking about colors, 

00:01:01.756 --> 00:01:02.997
 they are so bleak. 

00:01:02.997 --> 00:01:07.263
 Her eyes have no pupils, somehow sunken. 

00:01:08.063 --> 00:01:11.257
 The discovery I made, looking at the picture, 

00:01:11.257 --> 00:01:12.339
 is the background. 

00:01:12.339 --> 00:01:15.541
 This crazy figure of diamonds and circles, 

00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:17.163
 so colorful in foolish. 

00:01:17.163 --> 00:01:23.029
 And that Picasso thinks of himself as a magician or a clown. 

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:26.455
 The background is actually a metaphor for Picasso. 

00:01:26.455 --> 00:01:28.182
 If students get there, 

00:01:28.182 --> 00:01:29.957
 I will reveal this information 

00:01:29.957 --> 00:01:32.408
 as a discovery I made myself in my research. 

00:01:32.408 --> 00:01:33.549
 And this is very interesting, 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.275
 because some children say "It's too crazy, 

00:01:36.275 --> 00:01:41.578
 I will just remember that it is a girl and how she sees herself, so I see it. " 

00:01:41.578 --> 00:01:48.342
 And some say, "This is how Picasso sees the young woman looking in the mirror." 

00:01:48.342 --> 00:01:51.022
 What I like in art, especially in the modern, 

00:01:51.022 --> 00:01:55.024
 is that he is with you and that when you are ready, he invites you to yourself. 

00:01:55.024 --> 00:01:57.862
 If you want to stay where you are, it tells you 

00:01:57.862 --> 00:01:59.758
 "I'll stay with you." 

00:01:59.758 --> 00:02:10.686
 .
