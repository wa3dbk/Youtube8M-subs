think<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.640> stall<00:01:20.909> I've<00:01:21.090> got<00:01:21.270> something<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.570> play

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
think a stall I've got something to play

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.080 
think a stall I've got something to play
for<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.350> also<00:01:22.590> ask<00:01:23.040> my<00:01:23.189> god<00:01:23.340> I'm<00:01:23.490> really<00:01:23.970> good

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
for and also ask my god I'm really good

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.469 
for and also ask my god I'm really good
momentum<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:25.100> they've<00:01:26.100> got<00:01:26.130> three<00:01:27.000> wins<00:01:27.270> on

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
momentum and they've got three wins on

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.609 
momentum and they've got three wins on
the<00:01:27.509> bounce<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.080> think<00:01:28.320> they're<00:01:28.439> going<00:01:28.560> to

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
the bounce and I think they're going to

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.080 
the bounce and I think they're going to
make<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.890> four<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.640> think<00:01:29.820> they're<00:01:29.909> going

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
make it four and I think they're going

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.359 
make it four and I think they're going
to<00:01:30.180> score<00:01:30.450> plenty<00:01:31.020> against<00:01:31.740> west<00:01:31.890> brom<00:01:32.130> so

birthright<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:55.049> think<00:01:55.590> they've<00:01:55.710> got<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
birthright I think they've got the

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.319 
birthright I think they've got the
experience<00:01:56.250> they've<00:01:56.549> got<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.759> momentum<00:01:56.880> and

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
experience they've got the momentum and

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.670 
experience they've got the momentum and
they've<00:01:57.450> really<00:01:57.719> got<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.869> chance<00:01:58.079> of<00:01:58.290> doing<00:01:58.439> it

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
they've really got a chance of doing it

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.200 
they've really got a chance of doing it
all<00:01:58.979> they<00:01:59.250> need<00:01:59.369> is<00:01:59.399> for<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.729> Tottenham<00:02:00.090> or
