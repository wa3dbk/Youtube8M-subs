00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:27.170 
and now I'm actually thinking about

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:28.870

ordering<00:06:27.470> a<00:06:27.650> couple<00:06:27.920> cases<00:06:28.040> because<00:06:28.400> I<00:06:28.520> don't

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 
ordering a couple cases because I don't

like<00:06:30.590> that<00:06:30.740> in<00:06:30.980> my<00:06:31.010> place<00:06:31.280> for<00:06:31.460> a<00:06:31.520> while<00:06:31.580> I'm

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:32.480 
like that in my place for a while I'm

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.050 
like that in my place for a while I'm
actually<00:06:32.750> thinking<00:06:32.990> maybe<00:06:33.290> it's<00:06:33.500> a<00:06:33.590> good<00:06:33.770> plan

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:34.060

that you guys will check it out now I

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.800 
that you guys will check it out now I
believe<00:07:10.520> there<00:07:10.790> is<00:07:10.850> a<00:07:10.970> discount<00:07:11.420> code<00:07:11.600> that

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:11.810 
believe there is a discount code that

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:13.630 
believe there is a discount code that
you<00:07:11.900> can<00:07:12.080> use<00:07:12.290> on<00:07:12.320> the<00:07:12.680> laser<00:07:12.860> mods<00:07:13.160> website

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:13.640 
you can use on the laser mods website

you can use on the laser mods website
and<00:07:14.240> i<00:07:14.270> believe<00:07:14.510> it's<00:07:14.660> DSP<00:07:15.590> so<00:07:16.580> if<00:07:16.760> you<00:07:16.880> do<00:07:17.090> head

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:17.300 
and i believe it's DSP so if you do head

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.790 
and i believe it's DSP so if you do head
over<00:07:17.480> there<00:07:17.630> and<00:07:17.720> you<00:07:17.810> buy<00:07:17.960> anything<00:07:18.380> I

over there and you buy anything I

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.310 
over there and you buy anything I
believe<00:07:19.070> you<00:07:19.220> use<00:07:19.340> the<00:07:19.520> code<00:07:19.700> DSP<00:07:20.570> you'll

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:21.320 
believe you use the code DSP you'll

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.290 
believe you use the code DSP you'll
actually<00:07:21.530> get<00:07:21.860> a<00:07:21.920> discount<00:07:22.490> which<00:07:23.000> is<00:07:23.150> pretty
