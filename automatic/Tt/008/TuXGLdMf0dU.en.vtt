00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.120 

fit<00:01:22.070> pretty<00:01:23.070> decent<00:01:24.560> could<00:01:25.560> have<00:01:25.710> been<00:01:25.830> better

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
fit pretty decent could have been better

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.190 
fit pretty decent could have been better
and<00:01:26.939> I'll<00:01:27.119> be<00:01:27.299> in<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.509> cons<00:01:28.610> came<00:01:29.610> with<00:01:30.200> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
and I'll be in the cons came with the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.380 
and I'll be in the cons came with the
rubber<00:01:31.740> o-ring<00:01:32.340> down<00:01:32.700> there<00:01:33.229> for<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.320> petcock

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
rubber o-ring down there for the petcock

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.710 
rubber o-ring down there for the petcock
came<00:01:36.390> with<00:01:36.570> new<00:01:36.840> bolts<00:01:37.939> for<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.000> petcock<00:01:39.479> as

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
came with new bolts for the petcock as

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.429 
came with new bolts for the petcock as
well

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:50.389 

and<00:01:45.890> it<00:01:46.890> bolted<00:01:47.729> up<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.240> shrouds<00:01:49.399> fairly

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
and it bolted up to the shrouds fairly

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.660 
and it bolted up to the shrouds fairly
decent<00:01:51.920> it<00:01:52.939> didn't<00:01:53.939> make<00:01:54.090> my<00:01:54.329> seat<00:01:55.429> scrunch<00:01:56.429> up

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
decent it didn't make my seat scrunch up

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.139 
decent it didn't make my seat scrunch up
in<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.000> front<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.569> much<00:01:58.640> but<00:01:59.640> now<00:01:59.789> for<00:02:00.060> the

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
in the front that much but now for the

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.789 
in the front that much but now for the
cons<00:02:00.890> this<00:02:01.890> gas<00:02:02.250> tank<00:02:02.609> is<00:02:02.849> larger<00:02:03.539> so<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.140> is

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
cons this gas tank is larger so it is

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.180 
cons this gas tank is larger so it is
going<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.909> make<00:02:06.439> getting<00:02:07.439> that<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.799> spark

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
going to make getting that the spark

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.339 
going to make getting that the spark
plug<00:02:09.769> impossible<00:02:10.769> so<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.400> will<00:02:11.670> have<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.349> take

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
plug impossible so you will have to take

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.589 
plug impossible so you will have to take
off<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.860> gas<00:02:14.069> tank<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.670> get<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.299> spark

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
off the gas tank to get to the spark

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.410 
off the gas tank to get to the spark
plug<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.440> radiator<00:02:16.950> hoses<00:02:17.340> all<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.940> stuff<00:02:18.209> at

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
plug the radiator hoses all the stuff at

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.789 
plug the radiator hoses all the stuff at
the<00:02:18.450> top<00:02:19.640> when<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:20.670> installed<00:02:21.629> it<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:22.110> will

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
the top when I installed it you will

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:30.890 
the top when I installed it you will
have<00:02:23.239> to<00:02:24.239> make<00:02:25.160> little<00:02:26.160> brackets<00:02:28.099> as<00:02:29.720> you<00:02:30.720> can

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
have to make little brackets as you can

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.190 
have to make little brackets as you can
see<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.440> made<00:02:32.250> aluminum<00:02:32.970> spacer<00:02:33.690> brackets

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
see I made aluminum spacer brackets

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.430 
see I made aluminum spacer brackets
because<00:02:34.470> my<00:02:34.940> shroud<00:02:35.940> did<00:02:36.359> not<00:02:36.510> meet<00:02:36.780> up<00:02:36.989> to

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
because my shroud did not meet up to

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.280 
because my shroud did not meet up to
where<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:37.739> mounts<00:02:37.950> on<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.670> radiator<00:02:39.200> so<00:02:40.200> you

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
where it mounts on the radiator so you

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.490 
where it mounts on the radiator so you
are<00:02:40.590> gonna<00:02:40.799> have<00:02:41.069> to<00:02:41.220> make<00:02:41.840> little<00:02:42.840> spacer

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
are gonna have to make little spacer

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.030 
are gonna have to make little spacer
brackets<00:02:44.069> a<00:02:44.540> mine<00:02:45.540> an<00:02:45.720> aluminum<00:02:46.349> very<00:02:46.709> cheap

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
brackets a mine an aluminum very cheap

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.199 
brackets a mine an aluminum very cheap
simple<00:02:47.430> I<00:02:48.260> did<00:02:49.260> notice<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.280> pet<00:02:50.549> cop<00:02:50.849> I

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
simple I did notice the pet cop I

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.319 
simple I did notice the pet cop I
torqued<00:02:52.019> it<00:02:52.139> down<00:02:52.319> everything<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.760> petcock

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.329 
torqued it down everything the petcock

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.240 
torqued it down everything the petcock
is<00:02:54.569> leaking<00:02:55.500> or<00:02:55.950> I<00:02:56.400> should<00:02:56.880> say<00:02:57.090> seeping

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
is leaking or I should say seeping

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.659 
is leaking or I should say seeping
little<00:02:59.250> gas<00:03:00.319> around<00:03:01.319> the<00:03:01.530> rubber<00:03:01.769> seal<00:03:02.220> right

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:02.669 
little gas around the rubber seal right

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:05.479 
little gas around the rubber seal right
there<00:03:03.079> I'll<00:03:04.079> know<00:03:04.380> if<00:03:04.440> it's<00:03:04.650> quality<00:03:05.130> or<00:03:05.280> what

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
there I'll know if it's quality or what

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:11.379 
there I'll know if it's quality or what
but<00:03:05.849> is<00:03:06.090> leaking<00:03:06.599> or<00:03:07.200> seeping<00:03:09.530> the

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:11.389 
but is leaking or seeping the

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:14.300 
but is leaking or seeping the
installation<00:03:12.389> of<00:03:12.599> the<00:03:13.049> seat<00:03:13.349> is<00:03:13.530> a<00:03:13.590> little

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
installation of the seat is a little

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.009 
installation of the seat is a little
harder<00:03:14.669> since<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.120> gas<00:03:15.299> tank<00:03:15.569> is<00:03:15.720> bigger

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
harder since the gas tank is bigger

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.500 
harder since the gas tank is bigger
