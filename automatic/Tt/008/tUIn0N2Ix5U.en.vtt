00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
lot it's like camouflage but except you

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.840 
lot it's like camouflage but except you
know<00:04:13.150> you<00:04:13.630> only<00:04:14.040> in<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.160> only<00:04:15.459> time<00:04:15.610> you<00:04:15.640> can

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
know you only in the only time you can

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.699

you<00:04:16.060> switch<00:04:16.690> types<00:04:16.930> when<00:04:17.080> you<00:04:17.169> use<00:04:17.290> an<00:04:17.410> attack

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
you switch types when you use an attack

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:20.099 
you switch types when you use an attack
which<00:04:17.950> is<00:04:18.100> awesome<00:04:18.540> but<00:04:19.540> here<00:04:19.720> he<00:04:19.810> goes<00:04:19.930> with

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
which is awesome but here he goes with

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.230 
which is awesome but here he goes with
the<00:04:20.169> grass<00:04:20.350> not<00:04:20.620> and<00:04:20.859> it's<00:04:21.640> gonna<00:04:21.880> change<00:04:22.090> this

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
the grass not and it's gonna change this

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.940 
the grass not and it's gonna change this
type<00:04:22.450> to<00:04:22.630> grass<00:04:23.290> so<00:04:23.560> I<00:04:23.590> thought<00:04:23.890> that

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
type to grass so I thought that

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.230 
type to grass so I thought that
Thunderbolt<00:04:24.400> would<00:04:24.550> for<00:04:24.700> sure<00:04:24.730> kill<00:04:25.030> him<00:04:25.150> off

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
Thunderbolt would for sure kill him off

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.450 
Thunderbolt would for sure kill him off
but<00:04:25.479> he<00:04:25.539> was<00:04:25.720> a<00:04:25.750> grass<00:04:25.990> type<00:04:26.020> so<00:04:26.500> he<00:04:26.710> ain't<00:04:27.250> that

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
but he was a grass type so he ain't that

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.080 
but he was a grass type so he ain't that
up<00:04:27.640> pretty<00:04:27.820> nice

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
up pretty nice

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.550 
up pretty nice
sleep<00:04:28.300> so<00:04:28.630> he's<00:04:28.810> gonna<00:04:28.900> go<00:04:29.050> for<00:04:29.080> another<00:04:29.260> grass

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
sleep so he's gonna go for another grass

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.560 
sleep so he's gonna go for another grass
not<00:04:29.800> as<00:04:29.949> I<00:04:30.040> go<00:04:30.190> for<00:04:30.430> my<00:04:30.460> final<00:04:31.030> thunderbolt<00:04:31.480> and

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570
