on<00:00:09.210> his<00:00:09.360> gear<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:11.000> it's<00:00:12.000> been<00:00:12.150> sitting<00:00:12.389> in<00:00:12.420> my

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
on his gear and it's been sitting in my

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.999 
on his gear and it's been sitting in my
basement<00:00:12.719> cuz<00:00:13.170> it's<00:00:13.320> not<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.590> right<00:00:13.769> size<00:00:13.950> for

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
basement cuz it's not the right size for

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.880 
basement cuz it's not the right size for
my<00:00:14.460> rat<00:00:14.700> cutlery<00:00:16.100> but<00:00:17.100> on<00:00:17.220> my<00:00:17.340> new<00:00:17.490> Escobar

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
my rat cutlery but on my new Escobar

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.439 
my rat cutlery but on my new Escobar
they<00:00:19.890> made<00:00:20.160> these<00:00:20.340> things<00:00:20.640> so<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.090> TDI

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
they made these things so that the TDI

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.470 
they made these things so that the TDI
clip<00:00:21.869> fits<00:00:22.170> these<00:00:22.609> but<00:00:23.609> I've<00:00:24.029> never<00:00:24.240> used<00:00:24.359> a

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
clip fits these but I've never used a

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.359 
clip fits these but I've never used a
TDI<00:00:24.750> clip<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.260> don't<00:00:25.320> have<00:00:25.560> one<00:00:25.830> what<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.250> do

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
TDI clip and I don't have one what I do

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.859 
TDI clip and I don't have one what I do
have<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:27.859> a<00:00:28.859> check<00:00:29.340> lock<00:00:29.570> so<00:00:30.570> what<00:00:30.689> I'm<00:00:30.750> gonna

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
have is a check lock so what I'm gonna

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:38.630 
have is a check lock so what I'm gonna
do<00:00:31.309> is<00:00:34.070> drill<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.100> hole<00:00:36.950> to<00:00:37.950> fit<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.219> check<00:00:38.430> lock

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
do is drill a hole to fit the check lock

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.650 
do is drill a hole to fit the check lock
hardware<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.840> see<00:00:40.050> how<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.410> works<00:00:40.590> out<00:00:41.660> this

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
hardware and see how it works out this

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.920 
hardware and see how it works out this
is<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.840> 3/16<00:00:43.559> bit<00:00:43.800> I<00:00:44.360> got<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.480> first<00:00:45.629> hole

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
is a 3/16 bit I got the first hole

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.229 
is a 3/16 bit I got the first hole
placement<00:00:46.260> I'm<00:00:47.250> setting<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.610> check<00:00:47.789> lock<00:00:48.000> on

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
placement I'm setting the check lock on

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:59.630 
placement I'm setting the check lock on
there

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.690 

mmm<00:01:00.640> smells<00:01:00.820> good<00:01:01.210> and<00:01:01.600> the<00:01:02.440> hole<00:01:02.620> was<00:01:02.860> the<00:01:03.010> the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:03.700 
mmm smells good and the hole was the the

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.730 
mmm smells good and the hole was the the
hardware<00:01:04.090> is<00:01:04.210> a<00:01:04.239> little<00:01:04.480> wider<00:01:04.660> in<00:01:04.809> 3/16<00:01:05.560> but

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
hardware is a little wider in 3/16 but

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.500 
hardware is a little wider in 3/16 but
just<00:01:05.950> short<00:01:06.190> of<00:01:06.400> a<00:01:06.550> quarter<00:01:06.940> or<00:01:07.980> 7/32<00:01:09.010> so<00:01:10.000> uh<00:01:10.030> I

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
just short of a quarter or 7/32 so uh I

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.840 
just short of a quarter or 7/32 so uh I
figured<00:01:11.110> I'd<00:01:11.440> try<00:01:11.560> that<00:01:11.710> 3/16<00:01:12.280> first<00:01:12.520> and<00:01:12.760> see

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
figured I'd try that 3/16 first and see

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.160 
figured I'd try that 3/16 first and see
if<00:01:12.940> I<00:01:13.000> can<00:01:13.150> get<00:01:13.270> this<00:01:13.390> thing<00:01:13.450> to<00:01:13.690> jam<00:01:13.900> through

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
if I can get this thing to jam through

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.410 
if I can get this thing to jam through
the<00:01:14.290> hole<00:01:14.470> tighter<00:01:15.400> the<00:01:15.580> fit<00:01:15.610> the<00:01:15.910> better<00:01:16.120> in

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
the hole tighter the fit the better in

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.950 
the hole tighter the fit the better in
my<00:01:16.630> opinion<00:01:18.690> for<00:01:19.690> a<00:01:19.960> lot<00:01:20.440> of<00:01:20.470> things<00:01:20.650> in<00:01:20.830> life

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
my opinion for a lot of things in life

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.820 
my opinion for a lot of things in life
but<00:01:22.960> uh<00:01:23.580> want<00:01:24.580> to<00:01:24.640> see<00:01:24.790> how<00:01:24.910> it<00:01:25.030> worked<00:01:25.240> out

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
but uh want to see how it worked out

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.480 
but uh want to see how it worked out
it's<00:01:26.830> about<00:01:26.980> there<00:01:27.610> I<00:01:28.110> could<00:01:29.110> probably<00:01:29.490> force

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
it's about there I could probably force

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.310 
it's about there I could probably force
it

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
it

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.790 
it
as<00:01:32.320> with<00:01:32.560> most<00:01:32.710> good<00:01:32.979> tight<00:01:33.190> fits<00:01:33.430> in<00:01:33.580> life<00:01:34.800> but

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
as with most good tight fits in life but

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.280 
as with most good tight fits in life but
uh<00:01:36.540> it's<00:01:37.540> pretty<00:01:39.570> pretty<00:01:40.570> tough<00:01:40.869> I<00:01:41.050> think<00:01:41.080> I

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
uh it's pretty pretty tough I think I

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.330 
uh it's pretty pretty tough I think I
could<00:01:41.610> catch<00:01:42.610> it<00:01:42.729> with<00:01:42.820> some<00:01:42.970> pliers<00:01:44.190> and<00:01:45.190> just

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
could catch it with some pliers and just

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.680 
could catch it with some pliers and just
having<00:01:45.580> Ebony's<00:01:45.820> laying<00:01:46.030> around<00:01:48.690> haven't

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
having Ebony's laying around haven't

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.540 
having Ebony's laying around haven't
been<00:01:49.780> using<00:01:49.930> the<00:01:50.140> tool<00:01:50.290> as<00:01:50.470> much<00:01:50.619> not<00:01:51.220> that<00:01:51.369> -

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
been using the tool as much not that -

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.590 
been using the tool as much not that -
well<00:01:51.910> I<00:01:51.940> guess<00:01:52.150> that<00:01:52.180> either

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
well I guess that either

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.180 
well I guess that either
since<00:01:53.260> my<00:01:53.380> arm<00:01:53.530> got<00:01:53.680> tore<00:01:53.860> up<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:56.979> I've<00:01:57.070> been

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
since my arm got tore up so I've been

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.130 
since my arm got tore up so I've been
taking<00:01:57.490> it<00:01:57.580> easy<00:01:57.729> here<00:02:00.870> don't<00:02:01.870> know<00:02:01.930> what<00:02:02.080> all

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
taking it easy here don't know what all

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.800 
taking it easy here don't know what all
my<00:02:02.260> stuff<00:02:02.530> is<00:02:02.710> anymore

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
my stuff is anymore

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.080 
my stuff is anymore
it's<00:02:04.810> definitely<00:02:05.050> a<00:02:05.380> little<00:02:05.530> tight<00:02:05.920> if<00:02:06.820> I<00:02:06.940> can

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
it's definitely a little tight if I can

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.600 
it's definitely a little tight if I can
knock<00:02:07.240> that<00:02:07.420> out<00:02:07.480> of<00:02:07.810> there<00:02:08.100> I'll<00:02:09.100> probably<00:02:09.280> go

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
knock that out of there I'll probably go

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.310 
knock that out of there I'll probably go
with<00:02:09.700> a<00:02:09.760> different<00:02:10.149> size<00:02:10.360> but<00:02:10.810> if<00:02:10.869> I<00:02:10.959> can<00:02:11.110> jam

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
with a different size but if I can jam

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.690 
with a different size but if I can jam
that<00:02:11.500> one<00:02:11.650> through<00:02:11.950> am<00:02:12.070> i<00:02:12.220> work<00:02:12.430> out<00:02:12.670> I<00:02:14.700> don't

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
that one through am i work out I don't

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.880 
that one through am i work out I don't
think<00:02:15.940> I've<00:02:16.000> have<00:02:16.120> any<00:02:16.239> punches<00:02:16.660> in<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.959> bag

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.910 

something<00:02:20.890> just<00:02:21.100> as<00:02:21.250> good

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.020 

I'm<00:02:27.920> boring<00:02:28.280> videos<00:02:28.849> I<00:02:29.060> apologize<00:02:29.629> for<00:02:29.870> that

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
I'm boring videos I apologize for that

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.489 
I'm boring videos I apologize for that
kind<00:02:32.030> of<00:02:32.120> making<00:02:32.299> it<00:02:32.510> up<00:02:32.599> as<00:02:32.780> I<00:02:32.930> go

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:33.499 
kind of making it up as I go

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:51.009 
kind of making it up as I go
hopefully<00:02:34.340> you<00:02:34.400> can<00:02:34.519> bear<00:02:34.760> with<00:02:34.969> me<00:02:49.689> my<00:02:50.689> screws
