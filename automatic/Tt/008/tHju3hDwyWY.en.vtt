00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello friends welcome to another new 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.379
 good video I think initially 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.330
 make this idea clear but for the 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.429
 current discussions that occur in the 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.099
 social networks on this topic I've 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.719
 forced to make a new video 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:18.570
 reflecting on it so 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.910
 well here we go as the title says today 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.740
 I'm going to try to explain a little bit of this 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.350
 New transformation freezer 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.720
 many fans having already seen the 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.609
 trailer that came out a few hours ago already 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.769
 they released their conclusions 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.200
 about the new movie and those 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.780
 first comments already came out some 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.120
 doubts and the main one we 're going to 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.219
 talk today is this freezer with this 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.920
 new transformation is stronger than 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.600
 bills that is the current doubt that many 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.760
 fans came and good 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.520
 theoretically they do not know how to express well 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.949
 solution except a few but neither 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.969
 you have to do more laps well before 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.860
 reflect 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.140
 we must know well in what area they are 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.239
 located these two characters for 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.520
 start there are several things to have in 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.369
 account and one of them is the following 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.150
 frizer belongs to a very warrior race 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.220
 powerful 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.680
 the universe from which its inhabitants 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.360
 they acquire great fighting powers already 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.040
 since birth 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.870
 that is, freezer is a being that since 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.150
 that is born acquires unparalleled powers 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.000
 bills instead is a being of 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.920
 millions of years as you know he is a 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.650
 god precisely the god of the 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.210
 destruction therefore its power will 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.270
 I could say that from its very existence 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.420
 it is a power totally out of the ordinary 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.310
 a power which is worthy of a god if 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.500
 we are going to the area of ​​speaking of a god 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.420
 we are talking about someone who is 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.360
 to respect quite in all its 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.760
 aspects well so far we explained 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.830
 what kind of warriors are we now going to 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.710
 the comparison which I tell you something 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.930
 from the obvious there is no such thing as 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.630
 He explained earlier bills is a god 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.030
 therefore its power and strength the 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.979
 acquired since it exists and in addition 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.200
 we are talking about a god of the 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.600
 destruction whose power is out 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.060
 of the common think about something 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.220
 civilians was not as strong as 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.010
 supposes that it is because it would be 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.690
 charge of the seventh universe guys I think 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.340
 that up to this point 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.650
 and realize what I want to get 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.750
 freezer can train the times that 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.390
 want to acquire the power you want and 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.700
 even ask for eternal life but 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.620
 You can never cope with the bills 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.600
 ranges of each are more than 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.480
 relevant to determine the strength and 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.940
 power in this case we want to compare to 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.920
 a simple warrior with all respect but 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.860
 technically it is so with a god 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.750
 manager of the seventh universe is true 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.790
 we must recognize the efforts of 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.920
 freezer that despite everything is only 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.470
 to get revenge for what I do not know if it will have 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.420
 in mind fight against bills but even if 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.820
 so they have to take into account 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.220
 something important if frizer came to 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.560
 surpass bills thing I do not think that 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.510
 Do you think that bills are 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.680
 would sit idly admitting 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.870
 the defeat 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.730
 perhaps he would not seek to become stronger and 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.310
 respect your place as god of the 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.890
 destruction then I think there's no 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.380
 that to give more to this topic in order 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.480
 everything is clarified we can not compare 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.610
 to these beings because technically it is 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.350
 impossible because of the big difference 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.540
 one over the other 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.210
 I think that the rank that is given to 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.580
 bills should be respected is more guys 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.590
 think about something I do not know what 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.990
 events could occur in this 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.060
 movie I really do not know either because 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.340
 Goku is fighting against frizer in his 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.100
 been normal and not like a super saiyans 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.230
 but I would dare to say this theory if 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.090
 I may I think goku and 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.970
 he perfected his level of super saiyan 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.980
 God over there why he does not use his 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.650
 three transformations of super saiyans 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.600
 but technically this does not explain why 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.060
 what goku is fighting in his state 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.010
 normal truth there is a theory in which 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.560
 says that goku perfected of certain 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.140
 form the super saiyan god but in his 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.480
 normal state I want to say no 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.580
 there is a need for a transformation only 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.790
 borrow that ki without transforming 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.770
 make me understand this theory can be 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.230
 a bit more accurate than some that 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.850
 see read on social networks but 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.790
 you certainly have to think 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.260
 well if this theory is true then 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.320
 it is demonstrated that truly 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.750
 frizer surpassed goku I did not really 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.010
 I know what to say but I think that in the end 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.350
 Goku will see that in that 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.600
 will not have a chance and will go out to look 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.480
 its most powerful transformation the super 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.880
 saiyan god maybe there show us the 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.160
 training results knowing 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.260
 to toriyama I think it could be this 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.750
 theory that I am saying or the previous 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.180
 it could also be valid in the case of 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.130
 the previous one if it's like that I think that goku 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.170
 he will finish it off again with a flame agent 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.540
 but this time will be the most powerful 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.120
 all although the truth is I'm not very 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.310
 sure of this last theory hahahaha 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.110
 I have many theories in my mind but 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.020
 I prefer that you better see the 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.060
 movie and so everyone happy as everything 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.580
 fan just like you I hope for the best of 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.020
 this great movie I remind you that if 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.760
 the movie did not like them 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.310
 refrain from criticizing toriyama 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.350
 because as I said you asked all 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.320
 these years that dragon ball continue 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.390
 so good with this I say goodbye I hope 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.280
 that this reflection has become clear to you 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.320
 which did not need so many 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.510
 arguments because the real analyst 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.640
 really realize if there is anything that 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.830
 analyze and if there is not there it does more 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.860
 accurate through the obvious good 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.879
 dear spectators 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.879
 until next time
