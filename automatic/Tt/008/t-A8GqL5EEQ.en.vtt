 you want to dry it 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.100

 altered its hold so especially wring out the 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.490

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.979
 bath that is certainly maybe a little 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.229
 more expensive than what we dress 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.180
 the habit of finding for example in 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.920
 big area but it will definitely be 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.479
