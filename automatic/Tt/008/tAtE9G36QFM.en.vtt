the<00:02:02.159> dawn's<00:02:02.760> there<00:02:03.330> were<00:02:03.540> in<00:02:03.900> her<00:02:04.440> hair<00:02:05.540> but

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
the dawn's there were in her hair but

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.420 
the dawn's there were in her hair but
compared<00:02:07.470> to<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:08.490> beauty<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.890> provide<00:02:10.890> in<00:02:11.190> my

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
compared to the beauty you provide in my

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.530 
compared to the beauty you provide in my
life

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.080 

but<00:02:15.540> I<00:02:15.569> think<00:02:15.900> it's<00:02:16.290> only<00:02:16.470> right<00:02:16.760> that<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:17.819> go

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
but I think it's only right that I go

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.809 
but I think it's only right that I go
through<00:02:18.120> these<00:02:19.250> complications<00:02:20.250> on<00:02:20.909> my<00:02:22.700> so<00:02:23.700> the

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
through these complications on my so the

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.640 
through these complications on my so the
least<00:02:24.000> hope<00:02:24.209> that<00:02:24.299> i'm<00:02:24.510> wearing<00:02:24.629> is<00:02:24.870> also<00:02:25.260> from

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
least hope that i'm wearing is also from

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.470 
least hope that i'm wearing is also from
free<00:02:25.950> people<00:02:25.980> and<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:26.790> like<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.000> it's<00:02:27.239> black

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
free people and I like that it's black

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.119 
free people and I like that it's black
because<00:02:27.659> this<00:02:27.989> can<00:02:28.170> be<00:02:28.319> really<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.709> little<00:02:29.040> bit

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
because this can be really a little bit

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.589 
because this can be really a little bit
more<00:02:29.250> dressy<00:02:29.670> just<00:02:29.909> because<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.269> the<00:02:30.360> change

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
more dressy just because of the change

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.539 
more dressy just because of the change
in<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.780> colors<00:02:31.079> and<00:02:31.349> then<00:02:31.739> for<00:02:31.920> accessories<00:02:32.400> I

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
in the colors and then for accessories I

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.280 
in the colors and then for accessories I
have<00:02:32.579> on<00:02:32.879> this<00:02:33.060> gold<00:02:33.360> cuff<00:02:33.629> bracelet<00:02:34.140> from

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
have on this gold cuff bracelet from

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.199 
have on this gold cuff bracelet from
forever<00:02:34.680> 21<00:02:34.769> and<00:02:35.310> went<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.760> keep<00:02:35.879> it<00:02:36.000> simple

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
forever 21 and went to keep it simple

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.390 
forever 21 and went to keep it simple
because<00:02:36.480> kind<00:02:36.930> of<00:02:36.989> a<00:02:37.079> lot<00:02:37.230> going<00:02:37.409> on<00:02:37.620> and<00:02:37.890> it's

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
because kind of a lot going on and it's

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.280 
because kind of a lot going on and it's
a<00:02:38.430> little<00:02:38.610> dramatic<00:02:38.730> with<00:02:39.269> all<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.599> black<00:02:39.810> and

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
a little dramatic with all the black and

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.020 
a little dramatic with all the black and
then<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.620> skirt<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.190> actually<00:02:41.700> from

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
then the skirt is actually from

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.330 
then the skirt is actually from
Billabong<00:02:42.629> and<00:02:42.810> I<00:02:42.870> love<00:02:43.140> it<00:02:43.170> because<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:44.069> first

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
Billabong and I love it because it first

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.099 
Billabong and I love it because it first
has<00:02:44.609> this<00:02:44.790> little<00:02:44.970> skirt<00:02:45.359> right<00:02:45.540> here<00:02:45.930> and

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
has this little skirt right here and

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:48.649 
has this little skirt right here and
then<00:02:46.620> it's<00:02:46.829> open<00:02:47.250> lace<00:02:47.519> all<00:02:47.849> the<00:02:47.879> way<00:02:48.030> down<00:02:48.299> and

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:48.659 
then it's open lace all the way down and

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:49.910 
then it's open lace all the way down and
I<00:02:49.019> think<00:02:49.079> it<00:02:49.349> just<00:02:49.379> makes<00:02:49.709> it<00:02:49.859> more

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
I think it just makes it more

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.379 
I think it just makes it more
appropriate<00:02:50.579> for<00:02:50.609> spring<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.060> summertime

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:51.389 
appropriate for spring and summertime

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.899 
appropriate for spring and summertime
plus<00:02:52.319> for<00:02:52.650> shoes<00:02:52.889> I<00:02:53.190> would<00:02:53.370> recommend<00:02:53.639> wearing

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
plus for shoes I would recommend wearing

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:55.670 
plus for shoes I would recommend wearing

wedges from nine less because if you

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.270 
wedges from nine less because if you

skirt that you have on so overall this

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:12.920 
skirt that you have on so overall this

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.140 

what<00:03:13.680> so<00:03:14.099> this<00:03:14.280> is<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.489> type<00:03:14.670> of<00:03:14.700> outfit<00:03:15.090> i

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
what so this is the type of outfit i

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.520 
what so this is the type of outfit i
would<00:03:15.299> put<00:03:15.390> together<00:03:15.540> if<00:03:15.870> i<00:03:15.959> wanted<00:03:16.230> to<00:03:16.379> wear

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
would put together if i wanted to wear

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.899 
would put together if i wanted to wear
something<00:03:16.560> more<00:03:16.890> formal<00:03:17.310> while

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909 
something more formal while

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:19.490 
something more formal while
incorporating<00:03:18.239> one<00:03:18.719> of<00:03:18.810> these<00:03:18.930> lace<00:03:19.140> skirts

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
incorporating one of these lace skirts

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.110 
incorporating one of these lace skirts
and<00:03:19.739> because<00:03:20.010> it<00:03:20.159> is<00:03:20.219> black<00:03:20.519> it's<00:03:20.819> a<00:03:20.909> little

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
and because it is black it's a little

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.330 
and because it is black it's a little
bit<00:03:21.209> more<00:03:21.390> formal<00:03:21.689> and<00:03:21.930> i<00:03:22.709> also<00:03:22.859> think<00:03:23.099> it's<00:03:23.280> a

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
bit more formal and i also think it's a

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:24.830 
bit more formal and i also think it's a
little<00:03:23.400> bit<00:03:23.579> more<00:03:23.879> of<00:03:23.939> a<00:03:24.000> dramatic<00:03:24.150> look<00:03:24.599> so

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
little bit more of a dramatic look so

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.000 
little bit more of a dramatic look so
just<00:03:25.019> be<00:03:25.140> careful<00:03:25.290> with<00:03:25.500> your<00:03:25.709> hair<00:03:25.890> and

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
just be careful with your hair and

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.589 
just be careful with your hair and
makeup<00:03:26.310> because<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:26.969> don't<00:03:27.120> want<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.299> be<00:03:27.359> over
