00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:29.489 
we're taking a look at some of their

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.869 
we're taking a look at some of their
cool<00:00:29.730> pistols<00:00:30.239> like<00:00:31.079> for<00:00:31.500> example<00:00:31.559> this<00:00:32.309> early

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879 
cool pistols like for example this early

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:37.610 
cool pistols like for example this early
volcanic<00:00:33.690> repeating<00:00:34.140> pistol<00:00:34.909> so<00:00:36.199> you<00:00:37.199> may<00:00:37.379> if

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
volcanic repeating pistol so you may if

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.020 
volcanic repeating pistol so you may if
you're<00:00:37.739> not<00:00:37.890> familiar<00:00:38.040> with<00:00:38.339> these<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.909> may

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
you're not familiar with these you may

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.910 
you're not familiar with these you may
notice<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.629> similarity<00:00:40.409> to<00:00:40.589> some<00:00:40.769> of<00:00:40.829> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
notice the similarity to some of the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.860 
notice the similarity to some of the
very<00:00:41.070> early<00:00:41.399> like<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.850> Henry<00:00:42.300> lever<00:00:42.510> action

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
very early like the Henry lever action

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.750 
very early like the Henry lever action
rifle<00:00:42.899> well<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.710> reason<00:00:44.010> for<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.519> a

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
rifle well the reason for that is a

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.119 
rifle well the reason for that is a
volcanic<00:00:45.510> was<00:00:46.229> in<00:00:46.500> every<00:00:46.739> way<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
volcanic was in every way the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.640 
volcanic was in every way the
predecessor<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.049> Henry<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.530> then

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.650 
predecessor to the the Henry and then

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.740 
predecessor to the the Henry and then
the<00:00:49.739> Winchester<00:00:50.250> lever-action<00:00:50.280> rifles<00:00:51.150> this

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
the Winchester lever-action rifles this

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.109 
the Winchester lever-action rifles this
was<00:00:51.960> kind<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.379> not<00:00:53.189> quite<00:00:53.369> the<00:00:53.640> very<00:00:53.820> first

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:54.119 
was kind of the not quite the very first

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:56.719 
was kind of the not quite the very first
but<00:00:54.420> just<00:00:54.750> about<00:00:55.040> the<00:00:56.040> the<00:00:56.280> first<00:00:56.519> of<00:00:56.640> the

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:56.729 
but just about the the first of the

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:01.520 
but just about the the first of the
breed<00:00:57.259> so<00:00:58.259> in<00:00:59.040> the<00:00:59.280> volcanic<00:00:59.750> the<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:01.110> toggle

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
breed so in the volcanic the the toggle

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.340 
breed so in the volcanic the the toggle
action<00:01:01.909> that<00:01:02.909> would<00:01:03.119> become<00:01:03.479> very<00:01:03.509> common<00:01:04.229> in

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
action that would become very common in

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.840 
action that would become very common in
lever-action<00:01:04.650> rifles<00:01:05.280> was<00:01:07.850> initially

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
lever-action rifles was initially

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.210 
lever-action rifles was initially
developed<00:01:09.290> you<00:01:10.290> can<00:01:10.320> see<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.740> bolt<00:01:10.950> here

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
developed you can see the bolt here

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.190 
developed you can see the bolt here
traveling<00:01:11.579> back<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:11.850> forth<00:01:12.439> and<00:01:14.810> a<00:01:15.810> pair<00:01:16.170> of

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
traveling back and forth and a pair of

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.609 
traveling back and forth and a pair of
lifters<00:01:16.850> so<00:01:17.850> there's<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.090> tube<00:01:18.360> magazine<00:01:18.619> here

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
lifters so there's a tube magazine here

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.249 
lifters so there's a tube magazine here
underneath<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.549> barrel

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
underneath the barrel

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.550 
underneath the barrel
there's<00:01:22.259> our<00:01:22.409> spring-loaded<00:01:24.380> there's<00:01:25.380> our

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
there's our spring-loaded there's our

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.520 
there's our spring-loaded there's our
spring-loaded<00:01:26.039> follower<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:27.109> what<00:01:28.109> happens

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
spring-loaded follower and what happens

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.129 
spring-loaded follower and what happens
is<00:01:30.380> when<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.499> bolt<00:01:31.679> comes<00:01:31.950> back<00:01:32.990> so<00:01:33.990> let's

00:01:34.129 --> 00:01:34.139 
is when the bolt comes back so let's

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:36.620 
is when the bolt comes back so let's
start<00:01:34.439> here<00:01:34.499> a<00:01:34.909> cartridge<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.119> dropped<00:01:36.359> onto

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
start here a cartridge is dropped onto

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.809 
start here a cartridge is dropped onto
those<00:01:36.899> two<00:01:37.139> little<00:01:37.289> lifters<00:01:37.740> when<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.609> bolt

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:38.819 
those two little lifters when the bolt

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:43.609 
those two little lifters when the bolt
comes<00:01:39.090> back<00:01:40.639> cartridge<00:01:41.639> is<00:01:41.850> inside<00:01:42.689> these

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
comes back cartridge is inside these

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.980 
comes back cartridge is inside these
gets<00:01:44.549> pushed<00:01:44.819> into<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.240> barrel<00:01:45.539> by<00:01:45.659> the<00:01:45.719> bolt

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
gets pushed into the barrel by the bolt

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.770 
gets pushed into the barrel by the bolt
locks<00:01:46.889> and<00:01:47.189> then<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.700> lifters<00:01:48.240> drop<00:01:48.539> down

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
locks and then the lifters drop down

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.069 
locks and then the lifters drop down
again<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.579> at<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.729> point<00:01:50.999> a<00:01:51.209> new<00:01:51.630> cartridge

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
again and at that point a new cartridge

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.230 
again and at that point a new cartridge
from<00:01:52.289> the<00:01:52.380> magazine<00:01:52.499> is<00:01:53.069> pushed<00:01:53.340> into<00:01:53.909> that

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
from the magazine is pushed into that

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.239 
from the magazine is pushed into that
lifter<00:01:54.709> from<00:01:55.709> here

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:56.249 
lifter from here

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:58.550 
lifter from here
there's<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.579> firing<00:01:56.999> pin<00:01:57.179> in<00:01:57.389> the<00:01:57.899> back<00:01:58.049> of<00:01:58.319> the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
there's a firing pin in the back of the

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.109 
there's a firing pin in the back of the
bolt<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.789> when<00:01:59.880> I<00:01:59.909> pull<00:02:00.179> the<00:02:00.299> trigger<00:02:02.119> the

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
bolt so when I pull the trigger the

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.349 
bolt so when I pull the trigger the
pistol<00:02:03.509> fires<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:04.369> then<00:02:05.369> in<00:02:05.579> order<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.850> recon

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:06.359

there it is now the other interesting
thing<00:02:37.390> about<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.719> volcanics<00:02:38.230> was<00:02:38.439> their

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
thing about the volcanics was their

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.069 
thing about the volcanics was their
ammunition<00:02:38.890> this<00:02:39.819> is<00:02:39.969> chambered<00:02:40.180> for<00:02:40.329> 41

volcanic<00:02:42.209> which<00:02:43.209> was<00:02:43.390> very<00:02:43.599> interesting

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
volcanic which was very interesting

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.369 
volcanic which was very interesting

self-contained cartridge the it fired a
conical<00:02:48.280> bullet<00:02:48.549> and<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:49.090> base<00:02:49.329> of<00:02:49.569> the

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
conical bullet and the base of the

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:51.660 
conical bullet and the base of the
bullet<00:02:49.750> was<00:02:49.989> hollowed<00:02:50.409> out<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:50.739> actually

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
bullet was hollowed out and actually

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.280 
bullet was hollowed out and actually
contained<00:02:52.120> all<00:02:52.359> of<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.569> propellant<00:02:52.989> powder

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
contained all of the propellant powder

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.699 
contained all of the propellant powder
and<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.859> primer<00:02:54.040> charge<00:02:55.019> so<00:02:56.019> there<00:02:56.140> wasn't<00:02:56.530> a

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
and the primer charge so there wasn't a

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.979 
and the primer charge so there wasn't a
spent<00:02:57.700> casing<00:02:58.120> to<00:02:58.150> eject<00:02:58.629> after<00:02:58.959> firing<00:03:00.989> of

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
spent casing to eject after firing of

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.500 
spent casing to eject after firing of
course<00:03:02.260> that's<00:03:02.439> good<00:03:02.889> in<00:03:03.129> that<00:03:03.250> it<00:03:03.400> makes<00:03:03.579> it's

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
course that's good in that it makes it's

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.770 
course that's good in that it makes it's
an<00:03:04.689> interesting<00:03:05.139> form<00:03:05.349> of<00:03:05.439> ammunition<00:03:05.709> and

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
an interesting form of ammunition and

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.119 
an interesting form of ammunition and
potentially<00:03:07.780> less<00:03:07.989> wastage<00:03:08.439> and<00:03:08.590> cheaper<00:03:09.040> to

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
potentially less wastage and cheaper to

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.000 
potentially less wastage and cheaper to
manufacture<00:03:09.370> on<00:03:09.849> the<00:03:10.450> other<00:03:10.629> hand<00:03:11.010> they

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
manufacture on the other hand they

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.319 
manufacture on the other hand they
weren't<00:03:12.250> able<00:03:12.400> to<00:03:12.549> get<00:03:12.760> all<00:03:12.970> that<00:03:13.120> much

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
weren't able to get all that much

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.149 
weren't able to get all that much
propellant<00:03:13.720> into<00:03:14.139> that<00:03:14.470> cartridge<00:03:14.950> just

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
propellant into that cartridge just

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.089 
propellant into that cartridge just
because<00:03:15.730> of<00:03:15.879> the<00:03:16.090> physical<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:17.319> geometric

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
because of the physical and geometric

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.089 
because of the physical and geometric
limitations<00:03:18.730> so<00:03:19.659> it<00:03:20.500> was<00:03:20.620> actually<00:03:20.919> a<00:03:20.980> pretty

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
limitations so it was actually a pretty

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.670 
limitations so it was actually a pretty
weak<00:03:21.459> pistol<00:03:21.939> despite<00:03:22.629> being<00:03:22.840> a<00:03:23.169> pretty<00:03:23.409> huge

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
weak pistol despite being a pretty huge

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.750 
weak pistol despite being a pretty huge
pistol<00:03:24.159> and<00:03:25.379> that<00:03:26.379> that<00:03:26.950> really<00:03:27.189> didn't<00:03:27.549> help

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
pistol and that that really didn't help

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.710 
pistol and that that really didn't help
its<00:03:28.030> its<00:03:28.810> longevity<00:03:29.379> in<00:03:29.470> popularity<00:03:30.720> now

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
its its longevity in popularity now

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.330 
its its longevity in popularity now
these<00:03:31.989> these<00:03:32.470> eventually<00:03:32.950> went<00:03:33.099> out<00:03:33.220> of

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
these these eventually went out of

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.369 
these these eventually went out of
production<00:03:33.489> and<00:03:33.909> were<00:03:34.120> that<00:03:34.900> the<00:03:35.019> pistol

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
production and were that the pistol

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.530 
production and were that the pistol
version<00:03:35.790> didn't<00:03:36.790> really<00:03:36.939> get<00:03:37.060> replaced<00:03:37.419> by

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
version didn't really get replaced by

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.809 
version didn't really get replaced by
anything<00:03:37.989> the<00:03:38.109> rifle<00:03:38.409> versions<00:03:38.769> went<00:03:39.010> on<00:03:39.190> to

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
anything the rifle versions went on to

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.729 
anything the rifle versions went on to
