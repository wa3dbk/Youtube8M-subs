00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.500
 you influence and this day we will be initiating 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.080
 our special for Christmas and for year 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.450
 again we will be starting with a dessert 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.380
 which are decorated vanilla cupcakes 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.549
 for Christmas 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.990
 first I'm going to show you the 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.210
 ingredients that are to make the 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.949
 cupcakes and then they are teaching them the 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.080
 ingredients to make frosting that you 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.240
 let's put the comics as first 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.939
 step let's heat our oven to 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.470
 350 degrees fahrenheit so that it is already 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.330
 ready when we are going to put our 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.300
 whims these are the ingredients 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:37.020
 to make the cÃ¡rmenes we will need 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.450
 an inter is flour rate all use a 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.739
 cup of sugar a bar of 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.489
 butter has to be at 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.309
 room temperature two eggs two 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.309
 spoonfuls of eiken javier an eighth of 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.969
 spoonful of salt a third cup of 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.800
 Vanilla extract milk and mold 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:00.079
 for cupcakes 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.390
 now let's combine the sugar 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.009
 for the butter until we get 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.009
 a soft consistency 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.810
 since we have the consistency that 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.170
 we need let's add the two 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.170
 eggs 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.340
 and the vanilla extract 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:34.920
 now a separate container let's put 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.969
 the flour station opens and the salt nothing more 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.009
 let's comment 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:40.009
 so very pointed that a spoon 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:48.000
 and we're going to add the mix we had 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.000
 of butter as fire without sugar 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.270
 and again we are going to mix everything very 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.270
 all right 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:02.220
 and now we add the milk first one 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:05.840
 we mix it very well and then 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.840
 let's add the other half of milk 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.759
 good 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.340
 since we see that the milk is well 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.590
 combined we stopped because if we mix it 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.450
 the dough will be very hard and 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.950
 the cupcakes will not be smooth 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.930
 but it will be hard as it is 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.180
 bread 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.180
 now we are going to fill the molds of the 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.610
 cupcakes with the dough we have 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.709
 using a squeeze cooper but if not 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.959
 they have a joke but they can use two 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.000
 spoons but making sure that all 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.130
 molds have the same amount is more or 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 minus three quarters full so you do not 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.000
 they are going to review 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.930
 Y 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.370
 now we are going to put the oven to 350 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.980
 Fahrenheit degrees for 20 minutes 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.600
 while they are in the oven I will teach them 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.100
 what are the ingredients for 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.950
 prepare the casting that we are going to 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.810
 put these are the ingredients that 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.210
 we are going to need to do for the 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.070
 Contrast or also known in Spanish 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.610
 like bitumen and is what it has on 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.140
 our poster we will need one and a 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.940
 third cup of butter to 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.670
 room temperature 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.920
 four cups of fabregas or sugar glass 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.400
 a teaspoon of vanilla extract 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.840
 of two to three tablespoons of milk and 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.849
 coloring for green and red food 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.260
 The first thing to do is add 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.260
 butter to sugar 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.060
 I want to return everything very well 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.910
 since the butter is very good 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.980
 combined with sugar we are going to add the 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.280
 Vanilla extract and mix 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.280
 low 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.150
 now let's add the milk but it's 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.840
 important that we add it 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.250
 teaspoon at a time and combine everything very 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.080
 well so that we will not be so 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.650
 diluted and we know the consistency that 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.650
 we want 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.560
 to 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:27.010
 already when you see that the thing has a 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.600
 soft consistency is now ready as 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.430
 you can see I do not know all the 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.400
 milk so that's why it's important 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.070
 be throwing teaspoon 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.900
 how we want to make some decorations 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.800
 special for christmas let's divide 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.380
 a little bit of rating 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:48.110
 make it red 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:50.150
 and a little bit to make it green 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.410
 Now let's add a little bit of the 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.410
 coloring the red 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.620
 and this is already your own taste when 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.460
 you see he has seized the color 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.520
 what do you want 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.520
 i 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:11.110
 and we will do the same with the green color 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.850
 after having had the cupcakes in 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.800
 the oven for 20 minutes we take them out and it's 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.680
 necessary to let them cool at least 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.330
 20 to 30 minutes so they are not 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:32.320
 hot when we put our 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:34.960
 cake and they will not melt 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.040
 to decorate the first thing we're going to use the 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.040
 white frosting 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.560
 I'm doing it simple and 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.360
 I'm just using a spoon 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.670
 because the decoration is going to 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.520
 add within a moment with the 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:51.770
 green and red casting that we did in a 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.389
 bag to decorate cupcakes with a lot in 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:57.700
 small round 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:57.700
 let's put some green casting 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.830
 and here at this moment they can do the 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:10.660
 decoration that is to your liking I will try 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.660
 to make a fried smash 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:17.169

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.110
