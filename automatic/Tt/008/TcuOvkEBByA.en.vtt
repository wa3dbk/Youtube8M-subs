00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
for me the whole soloing thing was in a

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.690 
for me the whole soloing thing was in a
lot<00:02:11.200> of<00:02:11.230> ways<00:02:11.410> I<00:02:11.440> was<00:02:11.650> like<00:02:11.740> reteaching<00:02:12.220> myself

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
lot of ways I was like reteaching myself

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.900 
lot of ways I was like reteaching myself
how<00:02:12.790> to<00:02:12.820> climb<00:02:13.120> again<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:14.490> it<00:02:15.490> particularly

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
how to climb again and it particularly

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.350 
how to climb again and it particularly
weight<00:02:16.660> my<00:02:16.870> left<00:02:17.140> foot<00:02:17.380> so<00:02:17.710> I<00:02:17.740> would<00:02:18.070> just<00:02:18.360> solo

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
weight my left foot so I would just solo

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.610 
weight my left foot so I would just solo
really<00:02:19.750> easy<00:02:19.960> things<00:02:22.110> moved<00:02:23.110> on<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.410> harder

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
really easy things moved on to harder

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.860 
really easy things moved on to harder
stuff<00:02:23.710> but<00:02:24.160> it<00:02:24.250> started<00:02:24.640> off<00:02:24.820> with<00:02:25.120> really

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
stuff but it started off with really

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.590 
stuff but it started off with really
easy<00:02:26.050> things<00:02:26.380> just<00:02:26.620> relearning<00:02:27.070> how<00:02:27.310> to<00:02:27.600> wait

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
easy things just relearning how to wait

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.090 
easy things just relearning how to wait
the<00:02:28.780> crystals<00:02:29.260> and<00:02:29.530> yeah

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
the crystals and yeah

the crystals and yeah
just<00:02:30.250> sort<00:02:30.430> of<00:02:30.520> a<00:02:30.730> some<00:02:31.630> quiet<00:02:31.900> time<00:02:32.050> yeah<00:02:32.590> I

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
just sort of a some quiet time yeah I

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.710 
just sort of a some quiet time yeah I

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
one that I hadn't back in my head for a

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.790 
one that I hadn't back in my head for a
long<00:03:24.130> time<00:03:24.519> and<00:03:24.880> that<00:03:25.780> one<00:03:25.930> feels<00:03:26.200> really

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
long time and that one feels really

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.870 
long time and that one feels really
exposed<00:03:27.250> is<00:03:27.580> it<00:03:28.450> like<00:03:28.750> 12<00:03:29.050> a<00:03:29.260> yes<00:03:29.739> yes<00:03:30.100> seven

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
peoples I think that can be a really

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.170 
peoples I think that can be a really
dangerous<00:04:24.600> game<00:04:25.170> so<00:04:25.530> at<00:04:25.860> the<00:04:26.700> end<00:04:26.850> of<00:04:26.970> the<00:04:27.030> day

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
dangerous game so at the end of the day

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.820 
dangerous game so at the end of the day
it's<00:04:27.330> like<00:04:27.420> it's<00:04:27.720> a<00:04:27.810> really<00:04:28.290> personal<00:04:28.560> thing

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
it's like it's a really personal thing

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.140 
it's like it's a really personal thing
and<00:04:29.270> you<00:04:30.270> really<00:04:30.570> have<00:04:30.720> to<00:04:31.760> have<00:04:32.760> you<00:04:32.880> know<00:04:32.970> had

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
and you really have to have you know had

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.660 
and you really have to have you know had
that<00:04:33.180> good<00:04:33.630> gut<00:04:34.080> instinct<00:04:34.770> in<00:04:34.920> yourself<00:04:35.460> as

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670 
that good gut instinct in yourself as

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.830 
that good gut instinct in yourself as
opposed<00:04:36.000> to<00:04:36.330> like<00:04:37.760> you<00:04:38.760> know<00:04:38.940> stacking<00:04:39.630> things

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
opposed to like you know stacking things

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.260 
opposed to like you know stacking things
up<00:04:40.140> and<00:04:40.500> that's<00:04:41.220> I<00:04:41.490> think<00:04:41.640> that's<00:04:41.820> a<00:04:42.000> really

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
up and that's I think that's a really

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.970 
up and that's I think that's a really
dangerous<00:04:42.390> game<00:04:42.930> so<00:04:43.170> it's<00:04:43.410> a<00:04:43.470> really<00:04:43.740> personal

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
dangerous game so it's a really personal

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.570 
dangerous game so it's a really personal
thing<00:04:44.220> for<00:04:44.430> me<00:04:45.320> hey<00:04:46.320> so<00:04:46.620> we're<00:04:46.890> going<00:04:47.370> max

without the flame yeah I think that's

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.060 
without the flame yeah I think that's
wildly<00:04:54.180> impressive<00:04:54.600> what<00:04:55.560> hitting<00:04:55.740> make<00:04:55.919> you

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
wildly impressive what hitting make you

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.100 
wildly impressive what hitting make you
fancy<00:04:56.370> going<00:04:56.580> back<00:04:56.760> in<00:04:56.970> how<00:04:57.210> many<00:04:57.360> go<00:04:57.570> yeah

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
it's a good question you know I've been

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.010 
it's a good question you know I've been
terrified<00:05:02.730> of<00:05:02.880> the<00:05:02.940> UK<00:05:03.300> ever<00:05:03.450> since<00:05:03.690> I<00:05:03.810> broke

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
terrified of the UK ever since I broke

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.740 
terrified of the UK ever since I broke
my<00:05:04.230> foot<00:05:04.470> but<00:05:04.740> I'm<00:05:04.980> slowly<00:05:05.280> getting<00:05:05.550> over<00:05:05.970> so

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
my foot but I'm slowly getting over so

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.220 
my foot but I'm slowly getting over so
maybe<00:05:08.690> maybe<00:05:09.690> I<00:05:09.930> will

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
maybe maybe I will

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.420 
maybe maybe I will
I<00:05:10.940> I<00:05:11.940> think<00:05:12.660> I'd<00:05:12.780> go<00:05:12.930> back<00:05:13.110> and<00:05:13.169> and<00:05:13.590> have<00:05:14.340> a

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:14.430 
I I think I'd go back and and have a

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:15.830 
I I think I'd go back and and have a
little<00:05:14.610> bit<00:05:14.790> more<00:05:14.910> of<00:05:15.030> a<00:05:15.090> slow<00:05:15.390> progression

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
little bit more of a slow progression

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.630 
little bit more of a slow progression
through<00:05:16.350> the<00:05:16.380> different<00:05:16.860> grit<00:05:17.190> routes<00:05:17.400> I'm

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
through the different grit routes I'm

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.280 
through the different grit routes I'm
still<00:05:17.910> fascinated<00:05:18.450> by<00:05:18.540> the<00:05:18.600> area<00:05:18.900> it's<00:05:19.140> still
