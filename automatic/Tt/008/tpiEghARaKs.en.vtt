macros<00:01:30.689> what<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:30.990> can<00:01:31.170> do<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.619> basically<00:01:32.329> get

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
macros what you can do is basically get

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.450 
macros what you can do is basically get
a<00:01:33.540> smartphone<00:01:33.930> app<00:01:34.290> or<00:01:34.560> track<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.070> all<00:01:35.159> in<00:01:35.340> your

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
a smartphone app or track it all in your

a smartphone app or track it all in your
computer<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.090> personally<00:01:36.780> like<00:01:36.930> my<00:01:36.960> fitness

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
computer I personally like my fitness

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.840 
computer I personally like my fitness
felt<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:37.770> know<00:01:37.829> there<00:01:38.189> are<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> ton<00:01:38.820> of

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
will have my macros for the day that I

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.510 
will have my macros for the day that I
want<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.630> hit<00:01:51.780> before<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.200> go<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.560> bed<00:01:52.680> I'll<00:01:53.280> have

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520

want to hit before I go to bed I'll have
these<00:01:53.700> set<00:01:53.880> numbers<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.630> found<00:01:54.990> in<00:01:55.320> the

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
these set numbers that I found in the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.200 
these set numbers that I found in the
videos<00:01:55.829> down<00:01:55.979> below<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.670> how<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:56.820> figured

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
videos down below this is how I figured

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.080 
videos down below this is how I figured
out<00:01:57.240> my<00:01:57.299> macros<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:59.130> allowance<00:02:00.000> that

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
out my macros and in that allowance that

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.270 
out my macros and in that allowance that
I<00:02:00.240> have<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.600> can<00:02:00.869> maybe<00:02:01.049> have<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.590> pop-tart

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
I have I can maybe have a pop-tart

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.270 
I have I can maybe have a pop-tart
oh<00:02:02.509> maybe<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.689> bowl<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.259> ice<00:02:04.439> cream<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:05.009> slice<00:02:05.250> of

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
oh maybe a bowl of ice cream a slice of

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.850 
oh maybe a bowl of ice cream a slice of
pizza<00:02:05.670> but<00:02:05.939> it's<00:02:06.060> not<00:02:06.180> like<00:02:06.299> my<00:02:06.390> whole<00:02:06.570> diet

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
pizza but it's not like my whole diet

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.369 
pizza but it's not like my whole diet
filling<00:02:07.860> up<00:02:07.979> those<00:02:08.160> macros<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:09.000> just<00:02:09.869> what<00:02:10.229> you

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
filling up those macros is just what you

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.710 
filling up those macros is just what you
would<00:02:10.500> call<00:02:10.679> dirty<00:02:10.979> food<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.700> have<00:02:12.090> moderation

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
would call dirty food I have moderation

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.140 
would call dirty food I have moderation

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
make sure I hit plenty of fiber in a day

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.130 
make sure I hit plenty of fiber in a day

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:04.920 
eat I really don't have to worry about
it<00:03:03.370> because<00:03:03.639> I<00:03:03.939> can<00:03:04.120> just<00:03:04.209> track<00:03:04.510> it<00:03:04.540> in<00:03:04.810> my

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
it because I can just track it in my

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.569 
it because I can just track it in my
macros<00:03:05.409> so<00:03:05.530> that's<00:03:05.709> the<00:03:05.799> reason<00:03:06.069> I<00:03:06.099> don't<00:03:06.159> like

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
macros so that's the reason I don't like

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.849 
macros so that's the reason I don't like
meal<00:03:07.150> plans<00:03:07.420> it's<00:03:07.629> so<00:03:07.810> restrictive<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:08.709> if

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
meal plans it's so restrictive and if

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:10.949 
meal plans it's so restrictive and if
you<00:03:08.950> eat<00:03:09.159> the<00:03:09.340> same<00:03:09.519> thing<00:03:09.849> every<00:03:09.879> single<00:03:10.329> day

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
you eat the same thing every single day

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.830 
you eat the same thing every single day
day<00:03:11.739> in<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:12.220> day<00:03:12.310> out<00:03:12.579> it<00:03:13.000> is<00:03:13.209> probably<00:03:13.629> going

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
day in and day out it is probably going

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.170 
day in and day out it is probably going
to<00:03:13.959> lead<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.500> a<00:03:14.799> little<00:03:15.280> bit<00:03:15.370> of<00:03:15.459> burnout<00:03:15.879> and

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180
