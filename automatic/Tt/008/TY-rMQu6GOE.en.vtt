00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:09.650
 so the next is twos-threes 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:11.930
 very cool stuff that allows 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.270
 play you but very very fast it 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:17.200
 when you're doing with one hand, none 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:17.200
 strike and immediately 2 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.040
 I mean, there are so many possibilities. 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:41.210
 especially when you start 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:44.149
 combine form really 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.340
 so many different shapes now come on 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:48.380
 it's time to discuss how you can actually 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.660
 learn to play twos that is twain 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:55.520
 in fact it's when you hit with a stick 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:58.940
 she jumped and you shut himself batted 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:02.629
 fingers that is what you did 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:07.990
 kick you wand rebounded bounced off and 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:10.909
 you just fingers closed fist here sting 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.950
 initially we put a blow 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:17.740
 our fingers are about like this 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.740
 level turned out and shut them down 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.970
 again we have fingers here and you them 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.400
 you're closing 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.330
 you hit it bounces and finger again 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.420
 shut up 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:36.020
 the wand hits bounces and fingers 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.460
 connect together not the strongest place 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.530
 somehow call you close your hand squeeze 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.660
 close your hand up hit she bounced 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.970
 locked accordingly you start it 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.970
 work first on the one hand 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:03.290
 you won't be good then 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:16.790
 you try to combine it all exactly the 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:25.519
 right this is left well and then naturally 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:29.269
 gaining momentum and little by little 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:32.260
 accelerate we showed we learned how to 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.260
 you wash
