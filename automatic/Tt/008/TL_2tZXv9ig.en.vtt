00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:07.990
 in the year 1995 a man of nationality 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:10.769
 Chinese called pen shulin was cut by 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.230
 half by a truck 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.719
 everyone believed that he was going to die they did not have 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.669
 no kind of hope that I could 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.250
 get out alive from an accident that 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:22.619
 type however the doctors the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.380
 specialists got through 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.110
 a procedure that took lots of 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.050
 hours of surgical intervention save 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.390
 their life the certain thing is that they had few 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.149
 hopes they believed that he would die 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.399
 even when the man had already been 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.879
 operated they believed that he was not going to recover 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.860
 I was not going to be able to move for life 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:47.550
 after being many years in a 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.040
 stretcher doing nothing this man is 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.160
 he started to train he started doing the 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.660
 pine was put to do push-ups was put to 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.320
 do all kinds of things with the 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.050
 optimism of a fighter person today 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.049
 in day already after many years after 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.450
 of spending many years of rehabilitation and 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.390
 many years without being able to move in the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.149
 stretcher can walk like a person 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.999
 normal the only difference is that it is 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.679
 considered as the robot man is a 

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:20.039
 good man have developed a 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:22.289
 kind of a device that mates 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:25.409
 to his body and he has two legs 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:26.909
 bionics so you can walk the same way 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.880
 that a human 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.909
 the body was cut in half 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.009
 what do you mean, that the whole area 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.299
 of the legs all the area of ​​the 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:42.180
 legs or is the whole area is not 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.920
 you are not alone you have the top and 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.960
 the arms 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.540
 so that this machine serves them as 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.810
 pretty useful who knows in the 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.560
 future what will be the advances 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.350
 of robotics and so on there will be no hybrids 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.970
 all these people who have accidents 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.940
 they will then use metal arms that 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.490
 You can control to your liking the truth is 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.530
 that this person is an example of how 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.270
 someone can leave the situation of 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.300
 the worst situations that the 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.550
 life and is an example of overcoming 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.430
 because he spent many years fighting for 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.870
 his life and struggling to return to power 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.870
