00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.510 
my hair as well just to make sure the
back<00:04:45.889> of<00:04:46.070> my<00:04:46.220> hair<00:04:46.460> stayed<00:04:46.850> flat<00:04:47.630> as<00:04:47.870> possible

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
back of my hair stayed flat as possible

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.100 
back of my hair stayed flat as possible
so<00:04:49.520> it<00:04:49.669> wouldn't<00:04:50.060> get<00:04:50.180> frizzy<00:04:50.539> or<00:04:50.810> anything

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
so it wouldn't get frizzy or anything

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:52.900 
so it wouldn't get frizzy or anything
like<00:04:51.380> that<00:04:51.410> and<00:04:51.770> it<00:04:51.889> will<00:04:52.010> hold<00:04:52.280> it<00:04:52.430> down<00:04:52.580> like

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
like that and it will hold it down like

00:04:52.910 --> 00:05:03.550 
like that and it will hold it down like
a<00:04:52.940> lot<00:04:53.180> better<00:05:01.510> now<00:05:02.510> what<00:05:02.750> I'm<00:05:02.870> going<00:05:03.139> to<00:05:03.199> do<00:05:03.410> is
