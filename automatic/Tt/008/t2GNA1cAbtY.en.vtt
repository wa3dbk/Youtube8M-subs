like<00:01:13.220> it<00:01:13.430> um<00:01:13.580> I<00:01:14.450> made<00:01:14.840> this<00:01:14.960> in<00:01:15.140> time-lapse<00:01:15.470> in

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
like it um I made this in time-lapse in

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.390 
like it um I made this in time-lapse in
just<00:01:16.280> a<00:01:16.400> few<00:01:16.610> hours<00:01:16.990> so<00:01:17.990> it's<00:01:18.380> maybe<00:01:19.070> not<00:01:19.190> as

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
just a few hours so it's maybe not as

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.550 
just a few hours so it's maybe not as
best<00:01:19.640> it's<00:01:19.820> what<00:01:19.940> I<00:01:19.970> could<00:01:20.240> normally<00:01:20.630> do<00:01:20.840> but

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
best it's what I could normally do but

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.330 
best it's what I could normally do but
it's<00:01:21.770> pretty<00:01:21.950> good<00:01:22.220> and<00:01:22.460> one<00:01:23.450> note<00:01:23.690> is<00:01:23.930> all<00:01:24.340> the

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
it's pretty good and one note is all the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.640 
it's pretty good and one note is all the
trees<00:01:25.790> and<00:01:26.150> the<00:01:26.300> building<00:01:26.690> and<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:27.110> tank

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
trees and the building and the tank

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.100 
trees and the building and the tank
I<00:01:27.680> had<00:01:28.430> beforehand<00:01:29.120> so<00:01:29.450> none<00:01:29.750> of<00:01:29.780> those<00:01:29.930> were

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
I had beforehand so none of those were

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.960 
I had beforehand so none of those were
built<00:01:30.380> you<00:01:30.800> know<00:01:30.830> while<00:01:31.130> I<00:01:31.160> was<00:01:31.280> making<00:01:31.670> it<00:01:31.760> so

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
built you know while I was making it so

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.720 
built you know while I was making it so
most<00:01:32.150> of<00:01:32.360> it<00:01:32.420> was<00:01:32.510> just<00:01:32.690> the<00:01:33.020> terrain<00:01:33.380> and

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
most of it was just the terrain and

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.280 
most of it was just the terrain and
placing<00:01:34.730> all<00:01:34.910> the<00:01:34.940> grass<00:01:35.270> which<00:01:35.600> was<00:01:35.810> very

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
placing all the grass which was very

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.780 
placing all the grass which was very
boring<00:01:36.710> and<00:01:37.010> time-consuming<00:01:38.500> um<00:01:39.500> so<00:01:40.310> to<00:01:40.370> start

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
boring and time-consuming um so to start

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.730 
boring and time-consuming um so to start
this<00:01:40.910> off<00:01:41.090> we<00:01:41.390> could<00:01:41.720> take<00:01:42.229> a<00:01:42.260> look<00:01:42.440> at<00:01:42.530> this

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
this off we could take a look at this

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.190 
this off we could take a look at this
house<00:01:42.979> over<00:01:43.430> right<00:01:43.520> here<00:01:43.729> in<00:01:43.790> the<00:01:43.880> corner<00:01:46.030> um

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
house over right here in the corner um

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.110 
house over right here in the corner um
so<00:01:48.200> some<00:01:48.500> of<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:48.680> techniques<00:01:48.860> I<00:01:49.340> use<00:01:49.520> in<00:01:49.760> here

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
so some of the techniques I use in here

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.140 
so some of the techniques I use in here
I<00:01:50.150> had<00:01:50.479> like<00:01:50.690> little<00:01:50.930> piles<00:01:51.860> of<00:01:52.220> just<00:01:52.850> random

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
I had like little piles of just random

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.340 
I had like little piles of just random
parts<00:01:53.479> to<00:01:53.690> make<00:01:53.810> it<00:01:53.840> look<00:01:54.020> like<00:01:54.110> it's

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
parts to make it look like it's

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.140 
parts to make it look like it's
collapsed<00:01:55.190> and<00:01:55.370> him<00:01:55.520> puts<00:01:55.760> a<00:01:55.850> robble

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
collapsed and him puts a robble

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.410 
collapsed and him puts a robble
everywhere<00:01:56.540> on<00:01:57.400> the<00:01:58.400> walls<00:01:58.640> they're<00:01:59.120> kind<00:01:59.360> of

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
everywhere on the walls they're kind of

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.080 
everywhere on the walls they're kind of
like<00:01:59.540> collapsed<00:02:00.380> in<00:02:00.560> it<00:02:01.400> was<00:02:01.520> really<00:02:01.880> bombed

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
like collapsed in it was really bombed

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.130 
like collapsed in it was really bombed

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
these bushes I just added to give the

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.470 
these bushes I just added to give the
grass<00:02:57.650> a<00:02:57.680> little<00:02:58.070> more<00:02:58.190> features<00:03:00.310> you<00:03:01.310> know

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
grass a little more features you know

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.170 
grass a little more features you know
that<00:03:02.480> there<00:03:02.690> it's<00:03:02.810> a<00:03:02.930> little<00:03:03.170> bit<00:03:03.350> taller<00:03:04.180> and

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
that there it's a little bit taller and

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:27.149 
those are also
not<00:03:18.849> new<00:03:19.209> but<00:03:20.310> they're<00:03:21.310> pretty<00:03:21.519> good<00:03:22.560> um<00:03:26.159> one

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:27.159 
not new but they're pretty good um one

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:29.610 
not new but they're pretty good um one
thing<00:03:27.189> I<00:03:27.670> changed<00:03:28.120> since<00:03:28.450> the<00:03:28.840> time<00:03:28.870> lapse<00:03:29.319> I

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
thing I changed since the time lapse I

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.580 
thing I changed since the time lapse I
added<00:03:30.010> all<00:03:30.159> these<00:03:30.430> like<00:03:30.700> little<00:03:30.909> rocks<00:03:31.590> you

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
added all these like little rocks you

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.679 
added all these like little rocks you
know<00:03:32.680> around<00:03:33.069> the<00:03:33.370> path<00:03:34.030> because<00:03:34.450> I<00:03:34.569> thought

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:34.689 
know around the path because I thought

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:38.160 
know around the path because I thought
it<00:03:34.810> looked<00:03:34.900> too<00:03:35.109> plain<00:03:35.439> so<00:03:36.480> that<00:03:37.480> definitely

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
it looked too plain so that definitely

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.770 
it looked too plain so that definitely
adds<00:03:38.409> more<00:03:38.889> texture<00:03:39.400> and<00:03:39.549> everything<00:03:42.780> that's

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
adds more texture and everything that's

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.080 
adds more texture and everything that's
really<00:03:44.049> not<00:03:44.319> focused<00:03:44.560> okay<00:03:46.019> there<00:03:47.019> we<00:03:47.139> go

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
really not focused okay there we go

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.770 
really not focused okay there we go
just<00:03:49.090> a<00:03:49.180> nice<00:03:49.359> overhead<00:03:50.049> view<00:03:50.639> um<00:03:51.780> anyways

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
just a nice overhead view um anyways

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.099 
just a nice overhead view um anyways
besides<00:03:53.169> that<00:03:53.439> uh<00:03:53.739> I<00:03:54.489> think<00:03:54.790> it's<00:03:55.120> pretty<00:03:55.810> much

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
besides that uh I think it's pretty much

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:59.879 
besides that uh I think it's pretty much
