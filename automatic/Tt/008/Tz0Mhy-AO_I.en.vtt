brought in this zombie Santa sculpted in
Shevat<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.099> we<00:00:11.820> decided<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.269> mold<00:00:12.540> this<00:00:12.780> with

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
Shevat and we decided to mold this with

Shevat and we decided to mold this with
some<00:00:13.230> 7110<00:00:14.190> silicone<00:00:15.080> now<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.470> thought<00:00:16.770> this

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
some 7110 silicone now I thought this

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.710 
some 7110 silicone now I thought this
would<00:00:17.010> be<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.160> good<00:00:17.310> chance<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.640> recover<00:00:18.390> some

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
would be a good chance to recover some

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.859 
would be a good chance to recover some
of<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.900> basic<00:00:19.740> mold<00:00:20.189> steps<00:00:20.580> for<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.420> process

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
of the basic mold steps for a process

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.840

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.650 
the bottom cut out and that fit almost
perfectly<00:00:30.330> over<00:00:30.689> our<00:00:30.810> zombie<00:00:31.289> Santa<00:00:32.329> now<00:00:33.329> once

is butted up against the the plastic cup
there<00:00:51.180> now<00:00:51.870> once<00:00:52.079> we've<00:00:52.230> got<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:52.680> place

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
there now once we've got it in place

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.520 
there now once we've got it in place
we're<00:00:53.699> gonna<00:00:53.789> seal<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.480> with<00:00:55.170> some<00:00:55.590> hot<00:00:55.829> glue

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
we're gonna seal it with some hot glue

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.279 
we're gonna seal it with some hot glue
and<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.649> can<00:00:58.800> also<00:00:58.949> use<00:00:59.489> some<00:01:00.480> more<00:01:00.660> clay<00:01:00.930> heat

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
and you can also use some more clay heat

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.380 
and you can also use some more clay heat
it<00:01:01.440> up<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.829> smashed<00:01:02.129> around<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.609> outside<00:01:02.969> but

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
it up and smashed around the outside but

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.690 
it up and smashed around the outside but
hot<00:01:03.629> glue<00:01:03.840> does<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.080> great<00:01:04.409> job<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:05.100> sealing

hot glue does a great job of sealing

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.270 
hot glue does a great job of sealing
things<00:01:06.210> like<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.020> making<00:01:07.799> sure<00:01:08.130> your

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
things like this and making sure your

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.520 
things like this and making sure your
cup<00:01:08.490> doesn't<00:01:08.729> move<00:01:09.000> around<00:01:09.240> also<00:01:10.020> just<00:01:10.350> as<00:01:10.500> a

the<00:03:57.459> clay<00:03:57.640> sculpture<00:03:59.310> now<00:04:00.390> once<00:04:01.390> this<00:04:01.570> is

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
the clay sculpture now once this is

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.620 
the clay sculpture now once this is
pried<00:04:02.080> off<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.470> base<00:04:06.270> you'll<00:04:07.270> see<00:04:07.450> our

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
pried off the base you'll see our

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.520 
pried off the base you'll see our
exposed<00:04:08.080> clay<00:04:08.350> there<00:04:08.590> on<00:04:08.709> the<00:04:08.800> bottom<00:04:10.440> we<00:04:11.440> can

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
exposed clay there on the bottom we can

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.530 
exposed clay there on the bottom we can
just<00:04:11.739> take<00:04:11.920> that<00:04:11.950> very<00:04:12.430> carefully<00:04:12.670> I'm<00:04:13.360> gonna

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
just take that very carefully I'm gonna

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.460 
just take that very carefully I'm gonna
have<00:04:13.720> Michael<00:04:14.140> help<00:04:14.350> me<00:04:14.500> there<00:04:14.680> pull<00:04:15.130> that<00:04:15.459> out

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
have Michael help me there pull that out

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.560 
have Michael help me there pull that out
and<00:04:17.470> as<00:04:17.739> I<00:04:17.770> stated<00:04:18.160> before<00:04:18.370> might<00:04:18.880> design<00:04:19.299> this

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
and as I stated before might design this

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.390 
and as I stated before might design this
so<00:04:19.870> that<00:04:20.140> it<00:04:20.260> could<00:04:20.410> be<00:04:20.500> a<00:04:20.530> one-piece<00:04:21.070> mold

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
so that it could be a one-piece mold

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.420 
so that it could be a one-piece mold
with<00:04:21.609> no<00:04:21.910> cut<00:04:22.300> in<00:04:22.450> it<00:04:22.600> so<00:04:23.229> that<00:04:23.560> that<00:04:24.039> gives<00:04:24.070> us

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
with no cut in it so that that gives us

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.710 
with no cut in it so that that gives us
the<00:04:24.580> advantage<00:04:25.000> of<00:04:25.060> being<00:04:25.180> able<00:04:25.300> to<00:04:25.479> pour

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
the advantage of being able to pour

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.600 
the advantage of being able to pour
seamless<00:04:26.410> copies<00:04:26.890> of<00:04:27.160> ours

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610
