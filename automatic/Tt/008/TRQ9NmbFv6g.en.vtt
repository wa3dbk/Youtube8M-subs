reader and really what we noticed people

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.480 
reader and really what we noticed people
were<00:00:23.990> complaining<00:00:24.320> that<00:00:24.620> I<00:00:24.650> often<00:00:24.890> forget<00:00:25.190> my

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:37.249 
passwords on it that's not very secure

00:00:37.249 --> 00:00:40.029 
passwords on it that's not very secure
so<00:00:37.789> we<00:00:37.820> integrated<00:00:38.510> some<00:00:39.260> software<00:00:39.739> with<00:00:39.890> our

00:00:40.029 --> 00:00:40.039 
so we integrated some software with our

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:41.709 
so we integrated some software with our
fingerprint<00:00:40.550> reader<00:00:40.730> well<00:00:41.300> we've<00:00:41.420> done<00:00:41.539> for

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
here and assign it to a finger what this

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:54.369 
here and assign it to a finger what this
does<00:00:53.120> is<00:00:53.269> it<00:00:53.359> will<00:00:53.449> quickly<00:00:53.809> launch<00:00:54.109> that

website log me in and now for 2011 and
do<00:00:59.600> a<00:00:59.629> one-time<00:01:00.109> password<00:01:00.350> what<00:01:01.159> that<00:01:01.309> does<00:01:01.519> is

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
do a one-time password what that does is

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.240 
do a one-time password what that does is
another<00:01:01.999> level<00:01:02.269> of<00:01:02.479> security<00:01:02.899> so<00:01:03.739> that<00:01:04.010> a

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
another level of security so that a

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.490 
another level of security so that a
password<00:01:04.909> is<00:01:05.059> six<00:01:05.540> digit<00:01:05.870> code<00:01:05.900> it's<00:01:06.350> only

good one time and it's only good for 30
seconds<00:01:08.960> what<00:01:09.560> this<00:01:09.740> means<00:01:09.950> to<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:10.160> consumer

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
seconds what this means to the consumer

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.340 
seconds what this means to the consumer
is<00:01:10.730> really<00:01:10.760> the<00:01:11.150> days<00:01:11.360> of<00:01:11.600> fishing<00:01:11.840> are<00:01:12.140> just

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
is really the days of fishing are just

simply swipe my middle index finger
which<00:01:28.760> will<00:01:28.940> launch<00:01:29.180> eBay<00:01:29.570> and<00:01:29.870> watch<00:01:30.020> it

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
which will launch eBay and watch it

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.930 
which will launch eBay and watch it
closely<00:01:30.470> you'll<00:01:30.830> see<00:01:30.860> a<00:01:31.040> fill<00:01:31.310> in<00:01:31.430> my<00:01:31.550> username

ask you if you're trying to reset your
one-time<00:02:38.720> password<00:02:39.260> you<00:02:39.440> punch<00:02:39.770> in<00:02:39.920> a<00:02:40.010> secure

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
one-time password you punch in a secure

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.880 
one-time password you punch in a secure
code<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:41.600> then<00:02:41.720> it'll<00:02:41.900> read<00:02:42.320> it<00:02:42.440> back<00:02:42.620> to<00:02:42.800> you

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
code and then it'll read it back to you

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.350 
code and then it'll read it back to you
and<00:02:43.010> you<00:02:43.070> can<00:02:43.220> then<00:02:43.400> enter<00:02:43.580> that<00:02:43.880> bitch<00:02:44.180> that

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
and you can then enter that bitch that

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.300 
and you can then enter that bitch that
code<00:02:44.720> that<00:02:44.930> it<00:02:45.020> gives<00:02:45.200> you<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:45.650> typically

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
code that it gives you and typically

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.770 
code that it gives you and typically
that<00:02:46.430> period<00:02:46.850> will<00:02:47.000> be<00:02:47.090> longer<00:02:47.390> than<00:02:47.630> the

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
that period will be longer than the

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.630 
that period will be longer than the
thirty<00:02:48.020> seconds<00:02:48.500> so<00:02:48.650> allows<00:02:49.250> you<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.520> access

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
thirty seconds so allows you to access

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.160 
thirty seconds so allows you to access
your<00:02:49.880> account<00:02:50.150> even<00:02:50.570> if<00:02:50.630> you<00:02:50.690> don't<00:02:50.900> have<00:02:51.020> your

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
your account even if you don't have your

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.780 
your account even if you don't have your

notebook with the fingerprint sensor on

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.030 
notebook with the fingerprint sensor on
it<00:02:52.820> but<00:02:53.630> by<00:02:53.810> tying<00:02:54.110> it<00:02:54.260> to<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.530> notebook<00:02:54.770> it

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
it but by tying it to the notebook it

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.530 
it but by tying it to the notebook it
makes<00:02:55.190> it<00:02:55.340> a<00:02:55.400> little<00:02:55.580> bit<00:02:55.730> more<00:02:55.850> secure<00:02:56.300> wakes

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
makes it a little bit more secure wakes

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.900 
makes it a little bit more secure wakes
in<00:02:56.690> a<00:02:56.780> lot<00:02:56.960> more<00:02:57.230> secure<00:02:57.680> so<00:02:57.890> basically<00:02:58.340> even

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
in a lot more secure so basically even

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.370 
in a lot more secure so basically even
with<00:02:59.060> again<00:02:59.360> with<00:02:59.390> my<00:02:59.720> notebook<00:03:00.200> and<00:03:00.290> my
