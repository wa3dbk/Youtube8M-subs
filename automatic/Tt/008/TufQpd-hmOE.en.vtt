00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:55.389

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.520
 Thank you for this appeal 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:01.539
 must also clearly say who here 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.069
 The chain may be in the case with itself 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:03.819
 I meet the monkey meeting 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:05.830
 me the monkey 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:07.990
 I like the monkeys anyway 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:14.490
 not okay with him anymore what do we have 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:14.490
 otherwise blue is package boxing gloves 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:23.740
 What should I do with a woman from earlier 

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:27.999
 will you perhaps like he 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:30.490
 not said why does he come out so much 

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:32.050
 her after i believe this pose 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.800
 I will be as good as possible 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.729
 censor somehow 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.289
 otherwise, some people find that 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.059
 maybe a bit offensive 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:41.949
 may I say, even after the 

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:44.559
 Treatment in the beginning that's better because 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:45.809
 we do the uncensored see the 

00:05:44.559 --> 00:05:51.129
 I do not think I already have a present 

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:55.770
 only briefly in the test here will be synonymous 

00:05:51.129 --> 00:06:00.870
 please do not miss what you get 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:04.940
 why do you look so he believes the helmet 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:09.770
 flies away from the katar principle 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:10.880
 like a campfire wonderful and that 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:17.540
 here maybe that last one 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:21.050
 or are we doing something okay okay 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:24.910
 also my god or whatever that 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:28.550
 What I'm not so nice right now, but me 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:30.320
 think you do not know better that 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:37.520
 laptop has not got me laptop yet 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:39.500
 net cold that's that came unexpectedly 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.020
 was also a bit brutal I think 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:44.500
 not so good of you, but you 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:47.000
 knows not what did to her 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.440
 Nobody can hurt you with a laptop and 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.710
 certainly no women that is not 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:53.780
 kind 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:58.220
 I would say for that I have none 

00:06:53.780 --> 00:07:01.570
 suspect audi again so the revenge and 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.570
 god no that was disgusting or
