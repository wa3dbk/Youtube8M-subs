00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
recommend an 8000 k or you get a little

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.550 
recommend an 8000 k or you get a little

you<00:05:39.960> one<00:05:40.740> of<00:05:40.770> the<00:05:40.950> major<00:05:41.280> downsides<00:05:42.150> of<00:05:42.450> an<00:05:42.600> HID

you one of the major downsides of an HID
