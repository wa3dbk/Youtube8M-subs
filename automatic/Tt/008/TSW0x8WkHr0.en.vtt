00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.379
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.969
 I just hope now disturbs the equal 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:17.950
 not once did she next weather 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.199
 since quite blatantly thunderstruck and now 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.670
 I hope the weather does not let one 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.340
 a little bit of peace to do the video here 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:27.279
 and yes, today it's about 2,000 euros 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.869
 gaming pc and yes I'm curious what 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.789
 you keep it and I would say we 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.450
 start directly with the processor and 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:36.400
 Although this is a 75 1820 k 6 core 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.800
 processor a real hex core processor 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.930
 I have installed myself at the time and 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.950
 price-performance technically he's just 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.230
 pretty good 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.620
 yes, it still is the best 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.470
 get into the highend glass with the has 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.550
 really processor and that was why 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.910
 my choice here 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:01:00.580
 then fit the mainboard gbg x90 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:02.530
 ud 46 99 chipset is the quad channel 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.809
 Of course, ram is also involved in that 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.640
 f4 frame school and because it is the four 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.250
 already a bit cheaper 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.619
 and it will indeed soon be mainstream 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.439
 from august if the skylab processors 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.820
 outside are at least the first then 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:17.770
 Will you think again? 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.960
 bit cheaper but currently 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.780
 is it reasonably cheap and 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.079
 affordable yes eight memory 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.969
 slots so you can here up to 64 gb 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:30.130
 RAM builds up enough space 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:33.939
 for graphics cards also 4 x pci e 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.069
 2.0 x16 and yes a lot of stars 6 6 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:39.270
 gigabit connectors ten pieces 7.1 sound 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:42.909
 a gigabit network adapter and usb 3.0 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.549
 There are also six pieces and four pieces 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.979
 usb 2.0 the monument that there is everything 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.749
 with what you need as a gamer 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.789
 and then we move on 

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:55.509
 RAM since I have 16 GB now 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:58.450
 crucible is taken export ddr4 2400 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.999
 megahertz as you can see it is not anymore 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.549
 so incredibly expensive 137 19 I think 

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:04.780
 you can do that 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.100
 but as I said in the future 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.649
 certainly also the 100 euro mark 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.910
 fall below and there I am 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.430
 ever eagerly but on everyone 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.440
 very good and it is not very special 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.910
 high room so anyway spray that is 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.040
 important for the processor 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.010
 We also come namely now we know 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.220
 that tablet hr 02 macho in the 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:27.190
 revision b yes that should be enough 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.290
 its for the six core processor is 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.030
 a relatively cheap processor but me 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:35.170
 find the surcharge for a 70 euro 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.540
 Processor barely worth mentioning 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.890
 performance 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.470
 he also manages to do that easily 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.430
 I would stay here now Berlin and 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.590
 That's why we continue to 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.110
 most important part of the 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:51.450
 graphics card I have now here 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:54.070
 For a gtx 980 t decided for the first time 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.060
 namely the jetstream the super jet 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.220
 stream variant 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.930
 I have one alternative the 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.520
 show up also very briefly 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.590
 this choice and not available because of it 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:05.290
 I can not select that and that 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:10.540
 that's exactly this one in 3 dg 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:12.280
 lyrics 89 de x3 ultra weird name me 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.450
 think the design but really cool and 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.850
 the graphics card is as I said unfortunately 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.250
 for time is not available for award 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.800
 but both of them I'm almost right now 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.820
 sometimes quite big here show the clock-timed 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:27.670
 lies at 1152 megahertz in Rome 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:31.180
 the basic tact naturally and at the 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.260
 first jet stream also at 1152 so there 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.690
 does not do much 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.010
 The Dead The Jetstream is a dual 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.410
 slot variant therefore exists now 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.790
 first taken and who anyway only 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.520
 we have a graphics card there too 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.480
 to take those triples top variant 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.910
 and I think you can see that too 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.080
 maybe there are three slots here 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.030
 there is no more one side view 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.500
 okay so one of the two 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.300
 I would definitely buy graphics cards 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:57.209
 put heart and we remain first in 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:04:00.220
 the super jet stream variant as 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:04.900
 drive I have here the 500gb samsung 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:07.420
 850 evo ssd five gigabytes I guess 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.980
 that there is definitely enough I 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.860
 me now against a 250 gigabyte 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:15.010
 hard disk decided or ssd 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.359
 of course because you need it now 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.560
 I think a little bit more and 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.140
 tell the hardcore gamer the 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.270
 real 2000 euro pc together 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.530
 building the need already 500 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.180
 gigabyte because you get pretty much 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.740
 many games already on it and 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.980
 That's why I think they are already 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.730
 meaningful 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.980
 then as data grad or simply as 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.600
 memory which is a bit slower one 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.650
 western digital green still 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.910
 Of course, fast enough 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.460
 energy efficient and above all very 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:43.880
 quiet and pretty cheap two days 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.920
 work for 76 56 a very good one 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.360
 Hard disk always have a good choice 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.160
 a very low default rate 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.130
 that's why my choice fell on the 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.090
 western digital green as an alternative 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.130
 you can still see the western digital here 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:59.480
 red take it a little faster 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:01.280
 a server drive 24/7 capable and if 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.990
 you need a bit more speed then 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.620
 you can also to the red variant 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.510
 to grab 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.800
 the power supply is really one 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:12.440
 trinket here a sonic platinum 6 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.780
 160 watts and yes as the name suggests 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.960
 it's just 80 plus platinum 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.450
 certification 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.540
 it's a hybrid power supply, so to speak 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.920
 means it is semi passive there is here 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.470
 a little switch went times 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.500
 not at all because you can see exactly 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:31.130
 on a control hybrid and normal and 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:33.620
 that means that on the stage hybrid the 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.230
 Fans up to 50% do not run at all 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.760
 because the power supply is so efficient 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.340
 is not necessary to be cooled 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.140
 up to a certain limit and yes 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.720
 I also have exactly the same power supply 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.940
 only with 1000 watts and I can easily 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:49.160
 only to be advised to them again and again 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:52.010
 This power supply series is really the one 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.690
 hammer really horny inaudible really yes 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.980
 the power adapter does not make a mess 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.570
 no noise there is no peace 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.860
 available 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.630
 so far the best power supply I had 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.200
 so here in any case continue to 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.330
 recommend 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.740
 and then we go on to the housing 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.200
 and I am here for one 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:09.920
 relatively expensive housing decided 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.360
 the corsair obsidian series 450d with 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.120
 view window but as you said you can 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.620
 a housing take what you like 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.510
 I thought that was pretty chic here now 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.830
 did it just like that taken because it 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.050
 a first time I am here now 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.460
 As I said you can see 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.500
 like to take your own that is now 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.520
 of course a matter of taste 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:27.500
 just make sure that the graphics card 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.110
 fits in and the processor cools in 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.150
 this is no problem 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:35.240
 processor cooler up to 165 mm and 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:38.260
 graphics cards up to a maximum of 40 33 430 mm 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.310
 they should pay attention to that and yes 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.560
 I already have a processor cooler 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.169
 drive I have now not 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.700
 accepted at the 2000 euro pc i know it 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:48.430
 not me as I said no use 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:50.220
 drive more builds you then 1 million 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.810
 that is not really difficult anymore 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.950
 just to pack with me but me 

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.110
 personally, really use it now 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.160
 for almost two years no more drive 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:57.820
 that's why I have here now too 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.590
 hilarious 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.419
 I hope you have the calculator here 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:03.010
 I would be very happy if 

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:05.020
 your opinion in the comments nada 

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:08.110
 load and I would me mad my 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:11.010
 Look forward to the thumb and then to the 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.010
 see you next
