00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
got you so excited that you ran all the

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.510 
got you so excited that you ran all the
way<00:02:34.870> across<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.470> field<00:02:35.709> the<00:02:35.890> meadow<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:36.370> get

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
way across the field the meadow to get

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.330

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
when I changed that perspective then I

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.740 
when I changed that perspective then I
really<00:02:55.630> found<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:55.930> photograph<00:02:57.090> now<00:02:58.090> I<00:02:58.120> used

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
these techniques go together and this is

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.880 
these techniques go together and this is
not<00:03:28.940> a<00:03:28.970> assignment<00:03:29.930> for<00:03:30.080> the<00:03:30.140> geographic<00:03:30.710> but
