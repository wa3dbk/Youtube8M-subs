00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.910
 the constant clashes between 

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.129
 Karen I leave and Michelle Soifer continues the 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.440
 triumph of one and the defeat of another in 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:11.570
 different physical dexterity tests have 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.350
 fact that both want to be more and more 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.350
 invincible 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:26.739
 after the lioness I am ruled by 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:29.140
 discontent after the victory of the cobra 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:31.869
 I leave in the box a hand was proposed to 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.840
 dance hand principle rejected that by 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:39.600
 happy ending opting for a yes I think that 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.600
 I also seem to accept the challenge 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.399
 I took on the challenge and I'm going to do it because 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.629
 what made you change your mind because 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.030
 at first I was very decided not to 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.039
 make this confrontation with the 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.449
 people who support me on twitter in 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.510
 Facebook 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.680
 then they give me this breath and for that reason 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.780
 is very fine this dance told him 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.489
 so I feel very good that I 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.500
 I used to bind and buried all of these 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.780
 challenges for both but I would ask the 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.580
 production team please if you what 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.360
 they could change I would because I have 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.070
 bring 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.640
 the laugh that swims the opportunity 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.760
 partner I have to record I'm going to 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.200
 meet tomorrow more with me also not 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.610
 there is a lot of time you know one that 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.830
 refers to it was put together well so that this 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.510
 nice not the wardrobe everything however 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.250
 we're going to have to be putting days 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.950
 which is quite difficult now the 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.390
 watch him play against care and this is 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.610
 could lend to the bad 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.010
 interpretations will be that perhaps the 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.870
 morocha has retracted I do not know if I could 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.000
 go against the clock against time but 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.860
 my predisposition is always going to 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.140
 being there is always going to make me want to 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.119
 do it better but I do not know at what time 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.790
 the more you do not fall asleep you might think 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.320
 that I would have recanted and ask 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.610
 a report for tomorrow at 5 o'clock 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.290
 tomorrow and today you have to work 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.660
 how do you make your report if not 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.550
 you have time only one subject of 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.200
 time is a clock only theme 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.200
 only of time I want 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.700
 develop and for you to have a 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.320
 good show both of mechel and 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.119
 mine we have to respect the 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.009
 public and we have to rehearse and it 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.080
 will hold this rematch on the track 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.090
 of dance we do not know yet 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.660
 in itself the lioness soifer promises 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.770
 surprise by his hip movement 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.520
 that is, it is not that it filtered and today 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.520
 I want to do the same
