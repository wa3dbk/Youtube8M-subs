but if you do use the e6000 you'll need

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:48.659 
but if you do use the e6000 you'll need
to<00:04:36.480> let<00:04:36.600> it<00:04:36.660> dry<00:04:38.840> so<00:04:39.840> firmly<00:04:40.080> overnight

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
back and I'm going to add our other

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.100 
back and I'm going to add our other
one-inch<00:05:15.860> felt<00:05:16.550> circle<00:05:17.120> and<00:05:17.719> you<00:05:17.840> can<00:05:17.990> add

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
one-inch felt circle and you can add

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.769 
one-inch felt circle and you can add
this<00:05:18.259> with<00:05:18.439> hot<00:05:18.620> glue<00:05:19.210> just<00:05:20.210> goes<00:05:20.389> right<00:05:20.629> there

00:05:20.769 --> 00:05:20.779 
this with hot glue just goes right there

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:23.080 
this with hot glue just goes right there
on<00:05:20.870> the<00:05:20.960> back<00:05:21.139> and<00:05:21.500> then<00:05:21.919> this<00:05:22.639> is<00:05:22.879> what's

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
on the back and then this is what's

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.999 
on the back and then this is what's
going<00:05:23.300> to<00:05:23.389> stick<00:05:23.689> to<00:05:23.870> your<00:05:23.900> hair<00:05:24.139> bow<00:05:24.349> and<00:05:27.009> this

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:28.009 
going to stick to your hair bow and this

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:30.010 
going to stick to your hair bow and this
is<00:05:28.189> what<00:05:28.370> the<00:05:28.490> back<00:05:28.669> looks<00:05:28.699> like<00:05:29.270> after<00:05:29.900> I've

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
is what the back looks like after I've

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.429 
is what the back looks like after I've
attached<00:05:30.529> that<00:05:30.830> one-inch<00:05:31.340> felt<00:05:31.729> circle<00:05:32.439> now

00:05:33.429 --> 00:05:33.439 
attached that one-inch felt circle now

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:35.890 
attached that one-inch felt circle now
you<00:05:33.500> can<00:05:34.099> attach<00:05:34.520> it<00:05:34.550> to<00:05:34.909> the<00:05:35.240> hair<00:05:35.419> boat<00:05:35.629> and

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
you can attach it to the hair boat and

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:41.559 
you can attach it to the hair boat and
this<00:05:36.860> is<00:05:37.039> what<00:05:37.250> the<00:05:37.370> front<00:05:37.729> looks<00:05:38.000> like<00:05:38.509> I<00:05:40.569> know

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:41.569 
this is what the front looks like I know

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:43.300 
this is what the front looks like I know
the<00:05:41.810> image<00:05:42.110> is<00:05:42.259> probably<00:05:42.560> backwards<00:05:43.099> in<00:05:43.189> the

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
the image is probably backwards in the

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.290 
the image is probably backwards in the
video<00:05:44.169> but<00:05:45.169> honestly<00:05:45.729> I've<00:05:46.729> been<00:05:46.939> trying<00:05:47.210> to

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:47.300 
video but honestly I've been trying to

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.080 
video but honestly I've been trying to
several<00:05:47.719> different<00:05:48.699> techniques<00:05:49.699> for<00:05:50.000> the

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
several different techniques for the

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.969 
several different techniques for the
bottle<00:05:50.360> caps<00:05:50.569> and<00:05:50.870> this<00:05:51.110> has<00:05:51.409> been<00:05:51.529> working

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:51.979 
bottle caps and this has been working

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:54.219 
bottle caps and this has been working
and<00:05:52.190> it's<00:05:52.580> really<00:05:52.849> easy<00:05:52.909> to<00:05:53.210> do<00:05:53.479> and<00:05:53.719> I<00:05:53.779> like<00:05:53.960> it

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:54.229 
and it's really easy to do and I like it

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:59.619 
and it's really easy to do and I like it
because<00:05:54.440> the<00:05:54.979> top<00:05:56.080> it<00:05:57.080> raises<00:05:57.800> the<00:05:58.159> image<00:05:58.940> once

00:05:59.619 --> 00:05:59.629 
because the top it raises the image once

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:02.260 
because the top it raises the image once
the<00:05:59.960> felt<00:06:00.409> circle<00:06:00.710> is<00:06:01.099> on<00:06:01.430> the<00:06:01.639> inside<00:06:02.000> of<00:06:02.029> the

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
the felt circle is on the inside of the

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.300 
the felt circle is on the inside of the
tray<00:06:02.569> no<00:06:03.259> no<00:06:03.440> it<00:06:03.500> just<00:06:03.529> gives<00:06:03.800> it<00:06:03.919> a<00:06:04.009> raised

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
tray no no it just gives it a raised

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.300 
tray no no it just gives it a raised
look<00:06:04.940> and<00:06:05.690> so<00:06:06.139> far<00:06:06.349> so<00:06:06.379> good<00:06:06.710> I<00:06:06.770> haven't<00:06:07.159> had

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
look and so far so good I haven't had

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.300 
look and so far so good I haven't had
any<00:06:07.550> trouble<00:06:08.419> with<00:06:08.449> them<00:06:08.750> popping<00:06:09.589> off<00:06:09.800> the

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
any trouble with them popping off the

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.510 
any trouble with them popping off the
image<00:06:10.550> images<00:06:11.000> or<00:06:11.270> the<00:06:11.300> actual<00:06:11.719> cap<00:06:12.050> so<00:06:12.949> maybe

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
image images or the actual cap so maybe

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.670 
image images or the actual cap so maybe
this<00:06:13.699> will<00:06:13.849> help<00:06:13.909> somebody<00:06:14.240> out<00:06:14.569> there<00:06:14.779> all

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
this will help somebody out there all

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.980 
this will help somebody out there all
