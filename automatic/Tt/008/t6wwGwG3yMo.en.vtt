 welcome to your active agro program a 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.010
 extension management program 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.530
 agriculture of the Ministry of 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.170
 agriculture and livestock you are looking for 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.839
 present and share experiences of 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.890
 Costa Rican agriculture in addition to providing 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.490
 knowledge with an agro approach 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.880
 conservationist how about friends 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.560
 welcome to your active agro program 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.420
 program that presents the address 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.910
 superior of regional operations and 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.120
 agricultural extension of the Ministry of 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.450
 agriculture and livestock today we will visit 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.610
 the western central region 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:42.329
 specifically the canton of Athens here 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.930
 we will see how to make a good 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:49.200
 mobile and cheap sprue for livestock 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.829
 then we will go to the farm of don el jean 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:57.539
 when he steps on he will tell us how to reproduce 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:00.270
 in natural form the orchids in the 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.420
 trees of your farm how interesting 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.200
 true so stay with us in 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.210
 its agro-active program 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.240
 welcome to the staff of the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:15.539
 agricultural services agency of 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.329
 Ministry of Agriculture in Athens is 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:21.060
 It's a pleasure to show you part of the 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:23.970
 activities that are attended in the canton 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:29.009
 known as the best weather 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:31.649
 world to start we will show you how 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.640
 a trough for cattle is made 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:39.569
 quick easy and cheap way let's 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:43.740
 explain the proposed trough 

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:46.330
 homemade manufacture used 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.930
 intensive livestock farms 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:52.600
 bovine either from meat production or 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.720
 milk production we start that the 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.420
 water is a fundamental element in the 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.000
 milk production and in the gain of 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.400
 weight of meat animals 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.960
 it practically means 50 percent 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:10.209
 in both farms it's about seeing 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.000
 how you get the most availability 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.130
 of water and of the highest quality so that 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.590
 governments have easy access in the 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.620
 when they need it, we believe that 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.140
 this proposal is important for its low 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.090
 cost and its versatility of movements 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.850
 within the exploitation we are going to 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.800
 explain the materials and 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.590
 necessary tools for 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.420
 construction of that water trough 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.150
 homemade manufacturing 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.090
 we have to have this plastic jon 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.890
 100 liters or less that comes from 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.920
 of raw material of the industry 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.050
 This is of great importance 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.930
 to make sure we're not going to have 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.440
 residues of toxic material or of 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.870
 pesticides a pot of very good 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.330
 quality to make sure that we do not 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:04.709
 fail in a short time and does not mean 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:04.709
 a waste of water a threaded union 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:13.850
 an adapter for medium hose 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:16.940
 [Music] 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.400
 and a hose to supply 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.120
 half inches depending on the 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.219
 need so will be the tree 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.219
 [Music] 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.360
 necessary tools we have to 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.330
 have a tape measure to take the 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.120
 measurements of the window where you speak 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:40.270
 goes from the cattle a marker or a is a 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.020
 stick to delimit the size of the 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.380
 window 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:49.010
 and a cutter disk that allows us 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:52.390
 remove the piece that we are going to do 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.870
 with ease and a French key 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.250
 to touch the buoy 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.970
 [Music] 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:04.600
 the measurements or the size of the window 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:06.430
 depend on the size of Spanish in a 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.160
 Spanish like the one we are proposing 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:13.630
 of 100 liters we can have a window 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:16.000
 40 x 40 and in a larger Spanish the 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:19.690
 conventional tin that is 200 liters 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.630
 we can have a window of 60 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.340
 longitudinal centimeters and 40 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.070
 transverse centimeters 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.210
 to locate the location of the 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.570
 window 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:35.570
 we have to mark the center of the room 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:38.810
 which we do looking for sewing 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:42.169
 that all this year has and I've already done 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:45.560
 for the marking of the window for the 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:49.100
 window cut a disc is used 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:52.699
 cutter respecting the bottom edge 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:56.300
 of espanyol so as not to detract from its strength 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:57.480
 to that stranger and so that lasts many 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.660
 years 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.400
 the placement of the pot is made of the 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.790
 next form 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:09.120
 attached to the natural discharge cap of the 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:12.000
 Spanish through a union threatens with 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.040
 help from a French key so that 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.160
 be well touched 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:20.370
 the foot on which the 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:22.800
 Spanish water trough preferably 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:25.500
 it has to be metallic this does not want 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.780
 say that you can not make wood the 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.300
 difference is strength and 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.000
 durability 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.150
 the cost of this now balero is 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.629
 relatively down maximum 20 thousand 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:42.710
 colons depending on the price that is 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:47.360
 get the tin and the materials for 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:51.110
 the foot the durability of that order or is 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:54.259
 minimum of 15 years logically going to 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.960
 depend on the maintenance of the buoy and 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:06:01.190
 of the foot the advantages that the 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:03.409
 Using this watering hole is easy 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.599
 to move from the place or in a 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:08.719
 intensive exploitation we can 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:12.139
 move day by day or every two days of 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:15.229
 I leave the apartment according to what suits us and 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:18.469
 Where animals are guaranteed 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:21.440
 quality and water and its economy and the 

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:25.219
 drinking trough capacity that is for 15 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:27.919
 cattle for this year we hope that the 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:30.680
 previous proposal is going to be a teacher 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:34.580
 utility in the intensive production of 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:37.340
 cattle , either milk or meat 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.810
 for any questions you can contact us 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.650
 to the service agency of the 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:46.279
 sea ​​livestock 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:49.009
 senasa in atenas to the telephone 24 46 51 30
