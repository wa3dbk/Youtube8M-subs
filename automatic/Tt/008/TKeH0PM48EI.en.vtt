00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
drowning in his influences a little bit

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.399 
drowning in his influences a little bit
too<00:01:26.040> much<00:01:26.220> to<00:01:26.729> make<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.510> tape<00:01:27.780> really<00:01:28.020> hit

too much to make this tape really hit

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.020 
too much to make this tape really hit
hard<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.950> just<00:01:29.070> be<00:01:29.369> memorable

hard and just be memorable

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.030 
hard and just be memorable
even<00:01:30.270> though<00:01:30.360> Joey<00:01:30.600> was<00:01:30.840> mimicking<00:01:31.350> his<00:01:31.590> idols

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
even though Joey was mimicking his idols

even though Joey was mimicking his idols
a<00:01:32.159> little<00:01:32.340> bit<00:01:32.460> too<00:01:32.610> much<00:01:32.850> he<00:01:33.659> spit<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.290> real

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
a little bit too much he spit a real

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.820 
a little bit too much he spit a real
nice<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.060> tracks<00:01:36.420> but<00:01:37.140> still<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.409> felt<00:01:37.740> like

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
nice on the tracks but still I felt like

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.590 
nice on the tracks but still I felt like
there<00:01:37.979> needed<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.250> be<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.490> little<00:01:39.270> bit<00:01:39.450> more

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
there needed to be a little bit more

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.230 
there needed to be a little bit more
growth<00:01:40.170> or<00:01:40.470> evolution<00:01:41.070> there<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.490> certainly

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
growth or evolution there and certainly

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.690 
growth or evolution there and certainly

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
my opinion that are as an emic and

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.680 
my opinion that are as an emic and
really<00:04:38.199> just<00:04:38.410> career-defining<00:04:39.250> as<00:04:39.850> hard

knock<00:04:40.930> and<00:04:41.320> I<00:04:41.620> don't<00:04:41.710> really<00:04:41.949> think<00:04:42.070> it<00:04:42.340> has

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
knock and I don't really think it has

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.550 
knock and I don't really think it has
anything<00:04:42.729> to<00:04:42.910> do<00:04:43.120> with<00:04:43.150> a<00:04:43.300> lack<00:04:43.840> of<00:04:44.050> effort<00:04:44.260> or

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
anything to do with a lack of effort or

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.290 
anything to do with a lack of effort or
just<00:04:44.800> Joey<00:04:45.040> not<00:04:45.340> really<00:04:45.610> being<00:04:45.850> all<00:04:46.120> that

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
just Joey not really being all that

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.719 
just Joey not really being all that
Hungary<00:04:46.780> or<00:04:47.350> anything<00:04:47.530> like<00:04:47.830> that<00:04:47.889> Joey<00:04:48.370> still

although<00:05:00.340> I<00:05:00.370> guess<00:05:00.520> Joey<00:05:00.970> did<00:05:01.270> evolve<00:05:01.780> into<00:05:02.410> a

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
although I guess Joey did evolve into a

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
these tracks he sounds gruff he still

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.320

sounds hungry just like you did on the

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.290 
sounds hungry just like you did on the
Peet<00:05:10.570> mixtape<00:05:11.139> desi<00:05:11.919> Hines<00:05:12.220> who<00:05:12.729> was<00:05:13.090> one<00:05:13.270> of

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
Peet mixtape desi Hines who was one of

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.090 
Peet mixtape desi Hines who was one of
the<00:05:13.419> more<00:05:13.570> standout<00:05:14.050> emcees<00:05:14.440> I<00:05:14.680> fell<00:05:14.919> on<00:05:14.950> the

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
the more standout emcees I fell on the

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.830 
the more standout emcees I fell on the
Peet<00:05:15.430> mixtape<00:05:15.910> is<00:05:16.090> still<00:05:16.270> rapping<00:05:16.660> pretty

Peet mixtape is still rapping pretty
fast<00:05:17.169> and<00:05:17.500> I<00:05:17.650> think<00:05:17.950> his<00:05:18.130> voice<00:05:18.400> deepened<00:05:19.060> a

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
fast and I think his voice deepened a

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.629 
fast and I think his voice deepened a
little<00:05:19.389> bit<00:05:19.539> since<00:05:19.900> peep<00:05:20.680> came<00:05:21.070> out<00:05:21.340> because

little bit since peep came out because

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:24.450 
little bit since peep came out because

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
with his voice lowering a little bit he

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.000 
with his voice lowering a little bit he
kind<00:05:24.760> of<00:05:24.820> sounds<00:05:25.000> like<00:05:25.150> jay-z<00:05:25.510> circa<00:05:26.020> 1996

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.010 
kind of sounds like jay-z circa 1996

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.760 
really well across these tracks and the
songs<00:05:37.510> that<00:05:37.660> do<00:05:37.870> feel<00:05:38.080> more<00:05:38.229> personal<00:05:38.680> and

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
songs that do feel more personal and

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.100 
songs that do feel more personal and
focused<00:05:39.220> are<00:05:39.520> fantastic<00:05:40.419> it's<00:05:40.630> just<00:05:40.960> that

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
focused are fantastic it's just that

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.589 
focused are fantastic it's just that
again<00:05:41.470> summer<00:05:42.340> nights<00:05:42.610> feels<00:05:42.880> a<00:05:43.210> little<00:05:43.389> bit

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:43.599 
again summer nights feels a little bit

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:46.650 
again summer nights feels a little bit
like<00:05:43.660> a<00:05:44.260> sequel<00:05:44.889> to<00:05:45.130> keep<00:05:45.550> the<00:05:45.729> approps<00:05:46.300> even

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
like a sequel to keep the approps even

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.690 
like a sequel to keep the approps even
with<00:05:46.780> a<00:05:46.810> series<00:05:47.200> of<00:05:47.229> beats<00:05:47.590> that<00:05:48.280> feel<00:05:48.520> like

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:48.700 
with a series of beats that feel like

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.540 
with a series of beats that feel like
instrumentals<00:05:49.479> from<00:05:49.900> that<00:05:50.380> mixtape<00:05:50.950> I<00:05:51.190> mean<00:05:51.370> I

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
instrumentals from that mixtape I mean I

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:52.890 
instrumentals from that mixtape I mean I
guess<00:05:51.760> I<00:05:51.880> can't<00:05:52.060> really<00:05:52.210> be<00:05:52.389> surprised

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
guess I can't really be surprised

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.960 
guess I can't really be surprised
considering<00:05:53.500> how<00:05:53.919> little<00:05:54.130> time<00:05:54.490> has<00:05:54.669> passed

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
considering how little time has passed

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.820 
considering how little time has passed
between<00:05:55.270> the<00:05:55.599> release<00:05:55.870> of<00:05:56.139> summer<00:05:56.349> nights<00:05:56.620> and
