00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.870
 this is the center of industry and 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.870
 aerospace technology 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.910
 city in what is in science and 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.230
 aircraft construction technology 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.330
 we arrive until santa cruz the process is 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.960
 start here with the cut of the material that 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.330
 will be used this is the first phase 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.130
 where the construction of 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.600
 parts in the first aircraft factory 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.980
 of the Bolivian air force all 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.980
 start here with the molds 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.440
 the fuselage of the aircraft this is bad 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.750
 we use to manufacture from what 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.449
 we manufacture what we manufacture web indicated of 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.870
 composite material of resin and fiber 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:50.120
 of glass that will show us the 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.909
 material is toxic so they should be taken 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.979
 the care that you are following as 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:57.739
 Initially we had indicated the equipment 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:59.329
 of industrial safety I wanted to 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.640
 that kind of work here we have the sub o 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.829
 lucia we already have the basic pieces for 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.380
 our pretty now we have to start 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.840
 join the pieces the wings are made with 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.759
 the same materials that have 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.429
 here by hand is the wing tip in 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.380
 process the work until here takes almost 

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:18.380
 one month the pieces are being joined with 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.200
 special bolts assembled the part 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.350
 of the fuselage after this part we have 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.920
 a second that it is essential to place 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.920
 the wings 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:37.640
 because say that the wings more so 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.799
 horizontal has a high angle towards 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.380
 up the fuel tank too 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.590
 the fuel tank is ready 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.429
 what you have indicated is throughout 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.429
 from the 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.880
 now it's time to implement the 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.110
 heart of the plane the engine this time 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.660
 they imported it from the usa 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.460
 the secular brand is an engine 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.800
 conventionally we are currently 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.990
 modifying the oil system for the 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:17.510
 inverted flight that will last thirty 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:19.400
 seconds maximum placed the engine the 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.520
 The plane's propeller is now ready to 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.680
 fly let's move to the cabin the 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.180
 indication of the temperature of two the 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.640
 Nine analog and non-digital board 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.510
 all the electrical wiring of the 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.150
 aircraft 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.950
 so work is needed already goes by the 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.459
 third plane and the project is still 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.379
 higher 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.079
 olivia already account with a factory 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:42.060
 planes and the takeoff was a success 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:45.920
 although these used pilot managed 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.920
 dodge the maneuver in time 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.910
 for being it is no longer just air force 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.340
 we are talking about a project at a level 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.959
 national therefore this center of 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.849
 industry will always open the door to 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.349
 all the professional technicians that 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.330
 want to participate who want to contribute 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.400
 these are the later plans for the 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.590
 aircraft factory in santacruz planes 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.879
 ambulances for each governorate for 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.090
 a little bigger than those of 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.470
 training they need to transport a 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.140
 wounded here we are seeing the way 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.720
 of making an ambulance plane at a cost 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.280
 very modest that can save lives from 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.709
 the visit of the president of the state to the 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.310
 appointment basis last October there are 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.310
 optimism 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.910
 but they are the most important policies 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.550
 and the current command of the air force that 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.440
 is in charge of the general 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:35.170
 division brigade 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.970
 vÃ­ctor hugo menezes also have the 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.460
 same expectations as your 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.230
 new staff no doubt say the 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.230
 authorities that it's about generating a 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.900
 aeronautical trade and it really is 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.180
 according to the needs that it has 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.510
 for a good coach where the costs 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.010
 be beneficial for buyers 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.440
 we are talking about a cost I'm going to 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.110
 give approximate approximate of about 400 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.880
 thousand dollars this aircraft the biggest 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.450
 it's going to cost 50 percent 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.450
 approximately
