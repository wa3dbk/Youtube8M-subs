00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
yeah the reason at why I'm using the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.440 
yeah the reason at why I'm using the
star<00:01:24.869> sure<00:01:25.110> because<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:26.070> really<00:01:26.820> feel<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.119> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
star sure because I really feel that the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.100 
star sure because I really feel that the
twenty<00:01:27.810> five<00:01:27.990> percent<00:01:29.600> decrease<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:31.049> the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
twenty five percent decrease and the

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.240 
twenty five percent decrease and the
damage<00:01:31.939> my<00:01:32.939> did<00:01:33.119> natasha<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:34.020> really<00:01:34.409> big

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
damage my did natasha is a really big

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.630 
damage my did natasha is a really big
pain<00:01:35.610> in<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.939> ass<00:01:36.090> because<00:01:36.420> um<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.950> could

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
pain in the ass because um I could

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.940 
pain in the ass because um I could
really<00:01:38.939> use<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.240> map<00:01:39.570> damage<00:01:40.140> ahead<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.770> I

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
really use the map damage ahead and I

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.020 
really use the map damage ahead and I
honestly<00:01:41.340> really<00:01:41.670> don't<00:01:42.240> think<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.710> the

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
honestly really don't think that the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.690 
honestly really don't think that the
Natasha's<00:01:45.140> slowed<00:01:46.140> our<00:01:46.380> ability<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.220> pretty

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
Natasha's slowed our ability is pretty

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.380 
Natasha's slowed our ability is pretty
useful<00:01:48.590> honestly<00:01:49.590> because<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:51.030> know<00:01:51.180> a

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
useful honestly because you know a

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.210 
useful honestly because you know a
normal<00:01:51.630> heavy<00:01:52.110> can<00:01:52.320> easily<00:01:52.829> take<00:01:53.040> now

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
normal heavy can easily take now

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.359 
normal heavy can easily take now
essentially<00:01:53.759> nice<00:01:53.939> all<00:01:54.149> by<00:01:54.299> himself<00:01:55.070> at<00:01:56.070> close

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369
