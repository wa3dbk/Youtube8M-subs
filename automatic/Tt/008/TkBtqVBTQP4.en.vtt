everything certainly I'm not a sprinter
but<00:01:46.990> in<00:01:47.140> the<00:01:47.259> early<00:01:47.290> days<00:01:47.650> I<00:01:47.860> used<00:01:47.890> to<00:01:48.250> sprint

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
but in the early days I used to sprint

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.010 
but in the early days I used to sprint
to<00:01:48.640> when<00:01:48.970> we're<00:01:49.119> doing<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:49.479> Criterion's<00:01:49.960> you

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
to when we're doing the Criterion's you

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.540 
to when we're doing the Criterion's you
had<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.320> sprint<00:01:50.650> when<00:01:50.860> you<00:01:50.950> grew<00:01:51.130> up<00:01:51.159> racing

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
had the sprint when you grew up racing

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.280 
had the sprint when you grew up racing
in<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:51.909> States<00:01:52.300> you<00:01:52.570> you<00:01:52.930> make<00:01:53.110> your<00:01:53.259> money

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
in the States you you make your money

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.930 
in the States you you make your money
from<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.770> criterium<00:01:54.250> so<00:01:54.400> you<00:01:54.490> had<00:01:54.670> to<00:01:54.820> be<00:01:54.909> a

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
from the criterium so you had to be a

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.940 
from the criterium so you had to be a
sprinter<00:01:55.390> maybe<00:01:55.990> you<00:01:56.140> didn't<00:01:56.350> want<00:01:56.380> to<00:01:56.650> be<00:01:56.770> but

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
sprinter maybe you didn't want to be but

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.170 
sprinter maybe you didn't want to be but
you<00:01:57.009> still<00:01:57.310> had<00:01:57.490> to<00:01:57.640> be<00:01:57.729> if<00:01:57.820> you're<00:01:57.970> going<00:01:58.119> to

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
you still had to be if you're going to

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.880 
you still had to be if you're going to
make<00:01:58.300> a<00:01:58.360> paycheck<00:01:58.690> and<00:01:59.020> pay<00:01:59.170> for<00:01:59.380> gas<00:01:59.530> on<00:01:59.800> the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
obvious it's number one on the list it's

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.009 
obvious it's number one on the list it's
it's<00:02:09.160> always<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:09.970> hardest<00:02:10.300> there's<00:02:10.539> always<00:02:10.989> a

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
it's always the hardest there's always a

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.380 
it's always the hardest there's always a
day<00:02:11.380> or<00:02:11.530> two<00:02:11.739> where<00:02:12.550> you're<00:02:12.940> having<00:02:13.150> an

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
extremely bad moment you need to get

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.170 
extremely bad moment you need to get

scary<00:03:19.150> for<00:03:19.269> me<00:03:19.510> of<00:03:20.170> course<00:03:20.440> I<00:03:20.560> don't<00:03:20.739> want<00:03:20.860> to

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
scary for me of course I don't want to

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.729 
scary for me of course I don't want to
relive<00:03:21.190> what<00:03:21.430> happened<00:03:21.459> afterwards<00:03:22.299> but<00:03:22.739> it

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
relive what happened afterwards but it

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.259 
relive what happened afterwards but it
was<00:03:23.950> it<00:03:24.190> seemed<00:03:24.430> like<00:03:24.579> one<00:03:24.760> of<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:24.910> easier

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269
