00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.060 

so<00:03:22.510> just<00:03:22.540> like<00:03:22.990> go<00:03:23.290> to<00:03:23.350> Google

going<00:03:36.730> to<00:03:36.790> run<00:03:36.940> through<00:03:37.210> it<00:03:37.240> much<00:03:37.510> more

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
going to run through it much more

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.770 
going to run through it much more
because<00:03:39.370> it's<00:03:39.520> not<00:03:39.610> really<00:03:39.820> much<00:03:40.180> more<00:03:40.570> for<00:03:40.720> me
