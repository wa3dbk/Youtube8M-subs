flying squirrels and Superman push-ups
now<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.830> way<00:00:10.950> I'm<00:00:11.099> going<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.280> show<00:00:11.429> up<00:00:11.490> today

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
now the way I'm going to show up today

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.520 
now the way I'm going to show up today
is<00:00:11.910> how<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.120> figured<00:00:12.840> out<00:00:12.870> no<00:00:13.259> one<00:00:13.380> actually

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
is how I figured out no one actually

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.039 
is how I figured out no one actually
shouldn't<00:00:14.040> kind<00:00:14.219> of<00:00:14.309> do<00:00:14.400> these<00:00:14.580> moves

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
shouldn't kind of do these moves

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.930 
shouldn't kind of do these moves
basically<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.800> saw<00:00:17.010> some<00:00:17.220> people<00:00:17.340> do<00:00:17.609> it<00:00:17.850> on

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
basically I saw some people do it on

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.910 
basically I saw some people do it on
YouTube<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.779> just<00:00:18.990> figured<00:00:19.350> out<00:00:19.470> what

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
YouTube and I just figured out what

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.000 
YouTube and I just figured out what
works<00:00:20.189> best<00:00:20.310> for<00:00:20.580> me<00:00:20.699> so<00:00:21.300> here<00:00:22.109> we<00:00:22.199> go<00:00:22.350> we're

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
works best for me so here we go we're

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:33.190 
works best for me so here we go we're
going<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.160> start<00:00:23.369> off<00:00:23.550> with<00:00:24.350> tornadoes

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.970 

alright<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.380> when<00:00:34.500> you're<00:00:34.620> first<00:00:34.770> learning

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
alright so when you're first learning

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.799 
alright so when you're first learning
how<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.370> do<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.700> tomato<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.300> first<00:00:36.510> time<00:00:36.780> I

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
how to do the tomato the first time I

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.940 
how to do the tomato the first time I
suggest<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.620> learn<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.980> at<00:00:38.190> an<00:00:39.180> incline

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
suggest is to learn it at an incline

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.280 
suggest is to learn it at an incline
reason<00:00:40.950> being<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.430> much<00:00:41.820> easier<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.660> do<00:00:43.170> with

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
reason being is much easier to do with

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.049 
reason being is much easier to do with
them<00:00:43.410> because<00:00:43.860> you're<00:00:44.129> basically<00:00:44.610> standing

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
them because you're basically standing

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.160 
them because you're basically standing
up<00:00:45.210> when<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.390> do<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.660> you're<00:00:45.750> able<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:46.050> go

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
up when you do and you're able to go

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.990 
up when you do and you're able to go
through<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> motions<00:00:46.800> slower<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:47.850> when<00:00:47.940> you

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
through the motions slower so when you

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.060 
through the motions slower so when you
get<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.270> ground<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:49.260> basically<00:00:49.620> want<00:00:49.890> all

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
get to the ground you basically want all

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.729 
get to the ground you basically want all
the<00:00:50.190> motions<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.610> be<00:00:50.820> second<00:00:51.420> nature<00:00:51.590> so<00:00:52.590> when

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
the motions to be second nature so when

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.229 
the motions to be second nature so when
you're<00:00:52.860> up<00:00:52.890> here<00:00:53.129> your<00:00:53.399> body<00:00:53.579> can<00:00:53.820> learn<00:00:54.000> to

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
you're up here your body can learn to

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.930 
you're up here your body can learn to
adapt<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.320> movement<00:00:55.800> through<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:56.670> move

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
adapt to the movement through this move

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.299 
adapt to the movement through this move
like<00:00:57.300> when<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.480> first<00:00:57.780> learned<00:00:57.960> my<00:00:58.050> good<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.530> did

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
like when I first learned my good I did

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.889 
like when I first learned my good I did
it<00:00:59.430> on<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.760> second<00:01:00.059> event<00:01:00.180> that's<00:01:00.629> where<00:01:00.840> I

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
it on the second event that's where I

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.110 
it on the second event that's where I
learned<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.320> then<00:01:01.500> afterwards<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.250> was<00:01:02.789> doing

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
learned and then afterwards I was doing

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.030 
learned and then afterwards I was doing
it<00:01:03.210> on<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.420> side<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.780> bench<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.350> then<00:01:05.010> I

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
it on the side of the bench and then I

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.190 
it on the side of the bench and then I
moved<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.670> ground<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.210> one<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
moved it to the ground and one of the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.810 
moved it to the ground and one of the
important<00:01:07.650> things<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:08.010> know<00:01:08.189> about<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.580> move

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
important things to know about this move

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.230 
important things to know about this move
about<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.420> tornado<00:01:09.600> is<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.400> the<00:01:11.400> explosive

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
about the tornado is that the explosive

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.510 
about the tornado is that the explosive
you<00:01:12.960> explode<00:01:13.380> with<00:01:13.530> your<00:01:13.650> upper<00:01:13.830> body<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.340> you

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
you explode with your upper body and you

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.820 
you explode with your upper body and you
kinda<00:01:14.909> get<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.330> momentum<00:01:16.080> of<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.380> direction

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
kinda get the momentum of the direction

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.870 
kinda get the momentum of the direction
you<00:01:16.890> want<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.100> go<00:01:17.189> whether<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.610> be<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
you want to go whether it be to the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.330 
you want to go whether it be to the
right<00:01:17.970> or<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.450> left<00:01:18.710> but<00:01:19.710> it's<00:01:19.860> your<00:01:20.040> feet

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
right or to the left but it's your feet

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.260 
right or to the left but it's your feet
that<00:01:20.580> guide<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.150> through<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:22.970> here's<00:01:23.970> how

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
that guide you through it so here's how

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.499 
that guide you through it so here's how
it<00:01:25.170> goes<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:26.340> if<00:01:26.490> we're<00:01:26.670> going<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.270> right

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
it goes so if we're going to the right

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.660 
it goes so if we're going to the right
we<00:01:28.500> want<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.799> explode<00:01:30.079> that<00:01:31.079> way<00:01:31.490> first<00:01:32.490> thing

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
we want to explode that way first thing

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.249 
we want to explode that way first thing
I<00:01:32.729> want<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.939> do<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.240> get<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.420> good<00:01:33.570> explosive

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
I want to do is get a good explosive

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.670 
I want to do is get a good explosive
push<00:01:35.189> with<00:01:35.820> your<00:01:35.850> upper<00:01:36.090> body<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:37.409> finally

going to go in my left shoulder is going

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.289 
going to go in my left shoulder is going
to<00:01:41.220> go<00:01:41.310> out<00:01:41.490> sending<00:01:42.000> me<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.930> direction<00:01:44.299> my

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
to go out sending me that direction my

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.899 
to go out sending me that direction my
feet<00:01:45.570> are<00:01:45.689> going<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.869> want<00:01:46.049> to<00:01:46.110> do<00:01:46.759> with<00:01:47.759> my

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
send me that direction and then my left

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.010 
send me that direction and then my left
foot<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.130> going<00:01:56.190> to<00:01:56.340> be<00:01:56.430> my<00:01:56.550> guide<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.630> rest<00:01:57.870> of

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
foot is going to be my guide the rest of

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.020 
foot is going to be my guide the rest of
the<00:01:58.080> way<00:01:58.200> down<00:01:58.460> so<00:01:59.460> here's<00:01:59.729> what<00:01:59.940> it<00:01:59.970> looks

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
the way down so here's what it looks

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.920 
the way down so here's what it looks
like<00:02:00.300> slow<00:02:00.950> so<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.040> explode<00:02:02.550> foot<00:02:03.540> goes<00:02:03.720> in

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
like slow so you explode foot goes in

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:13.870 
like slow so you explode foot goes in
that<00:02:04.890> catches<00:02:05.369> land<00:02:06.110> it<00:02:07.110> will<00:02:07.320> go<00:02:07.410> faster<00:02:11.270> okay

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
that catches land it will go faster okay

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.420 
that catches land it will go faster okay
and<00:02:15.050> after<00:02:16.050> when<00:02:16.350> I<00:02:16.380> go<00:02:16.500> to<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.709> left<00:02:16.920> the

alright<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:44.580> after<00:02:44.880> you've<00:02:45.000> gotten

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
alright so after you've gotten

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.300 
alright so after you've gotten
comfortable<00:02:45.450> with<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.959> motions<00:02:46.410> and<00:02:46.680> you're

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
comfortable with the motions and you're

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.610 
comfortable with the motions and you're
ready<00:02:47.519> to<00:02:47.640> bring<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:48.060> flat<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:48.840> main<00:02:49.440> thing

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
ready to bring it to flat the main thing

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.920 
ready to bring it to flat the main thing
I<00:02:49.680> would<00:02:49.739> suggest<00:02:49.950> is<00:02:50.459> still<00:02:51.090> to<00:02:51.300> exaggerate

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
I would suggest is still to exaggerate

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.840 
I would suggest is still to exaggerate
as<00:02:52.050> much<00:02:52.230> as<00:02:52.350> possible<00:02:52.530> especially<00:02:53.070> at<00:02:53.580> first

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
as much as possible especially at first

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.090 
as much as possible especially at first
and<00:02:54.120> after<00:02:54.900> time<00:02:55.140> after<00:02:55.410> we<00:02:55.620> do<00:02:55.769> it<00:02:55.799> for<00:02:56.010> a

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
and after time after we do it for a

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.160 
and after time after we do it for a
while<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:57.180> motions<00:02:57.540> will<00:02:57.630> become<00:02:57.930> less<00:02:58.110> and

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
while the motions will become less and

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:17.670 
while the motions will become less and
less<00:02:58.410> so<00:02:59.310> here<00:02:59.640> it<00:03:00.390> is<00:03:00.510> exaggerated

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:34.830 

and<00:03:18.680> in<00:03:19.250> time<00:03:19.459> the<00:03:19.640> moves<00:03:19.819> becomes<00:03:20.150> smaller

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.210 

alright<00:03:35.840> so<00:03:36.019> flying<00:03:36.349> squirrels<00:03:36.739> is<00:03:36.920> another

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
alright so flying squirrels is another

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.210 
alright so flying squirrels is another
one<00:03:37.370> of<00:03:37.400> those<00:03:38.170> exercises<00:03:39.170> where<00:03:39.590> the<00:03:39.890> initial

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
one of those exercises where the initial

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.619 
one of those exercises where the initial
explosion<00:03:40.519> and<00:03:40.879> dictating<00:03:41.180> which<00:03:41.329> direction

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:41.629 
explosion and dictating which direction

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:43.569 
explosion and dictating which direction
you<00:03:41.810> want<00:03:41.930> to<00:03:41.989> go<00:03:42.049> it's<00:03:42.920> no<00:03:43.099> one<00:03:43.220> pick<00:03:43.340> up<00:03:43.459> your

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:44.420 
another thing I would suggest a trailer
is<00:04:42.030> the<00:04:42.110> kicker<00:04:43.110> needs<00:04:43.319> in<00:04:43.469> and<00:04:43.680> popping

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
is the kicker needs in and popping

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.140 
is the kicker needs in and popping
lambda1<00:04:45.090> 80<00:04:45.240> or<00:04:45.509> 90<00:04:46.469> laying<00:04:47.460> on<00:04:47.580> your<00:04:47.610> feet

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
lambda1 80 or 90 laying on your feet

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.989 
lambda1 80 or 90 laying on your feet
so<00:04:49.020> kick<00:04:49.229> it<00:04:50.960> 99<00:04:52.279> then<00:04:53.279> time<00:04:53.580> get<00:04:53.819> that

00:04:53.989 --> 00:04:53.999 
so kick it 99 then time get that

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:56.209 
so kick it 99 then time get that
rotation<00:04:54.629> a<00:04:54.659> little<00:04:54.900> more<00:04:55.050> and<00:04:55.319> see<00:04:56.009> you<00:04:56.069> can

00:04:56.209 --> 00:04:56.219 
rotation a little more and see you can

00:04:56.219 --> 00:05:03.580 
rotation a little more and see you can
get<00:04:56.400> a<00:04:56.639> whole<00:04:57.599> money<00:04:57.919> and<00:04:58.919> land<00:04:59.069> on<00:04:59.189> your<00:04:59.310> feet

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.679 

then<00:05:04.590> from<00:05:04.800> there<00:05:05.300> pretty<00:05:06.300> much<00:05:06.419> when<00:05:06.539> you<00:05:06.599> get

00:05:06.679 --> 00:05:06.689 
then from there pretty much when you get

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:09.140 
then from there pretty much when you get
that<00:05:06.870> 180<00:05:07.219> you<00:05:08.219> basically<00:05:08.490> want<00:05:08.699> to<00:05:08.759> extend

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
that 180 you basically want to extend

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.100 
that 180 you basically want to extend
your<00:05:09.629> legs<00:05:09.810> back<00:05:10.050> out<00:05:10.289> and<00:05:10.560> you'll<00:05:11.159> land<00:05:11.340> it<00:05:12.110> so

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
your legs back out and you'll land it so

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:24.080 
your legs back out and you'll land it so
it<00:05:13.259> looks<00:05:13.439> like<00:05:13.500> this<00:05:22.430> and<00:05:23.430> that's<00:05:23.759> the<00:05:23.849> flying

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
it looks like this and that's the flying

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:35.059 
it looks like this and that's the flying
school<00:05:32.870> all<00:05:33.870> right<00:05:33.930> so<00:05:34.199> last<00:05:34.349> exercise<00:05:34.830> we

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:35.069 
school all right so last exercise we

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:38.989 
school all right so last exercise we
have<00:05:35.099> here<00:05:35.490> is<00:05:35.960> the<00:05:36.960> Superman's<00:05:37.529> and<00:05:37.999> also

00:05:38.989 --> 00:05:38.999 
have here is the Superman's and also

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:40.489 
have here is the Superman's and also
this<00:05:39.150> right<00:05:39.300> here<00:05:39.479> is<00:05:39.629> the<00:05:39.810> easiest<00:05:40.199> out<00:05:40.409> of

00:05:40.489 --> 00:05:40.499 
this right here is the easiest out of

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:43.249 
this right here is the easiest out of
all<00:05:40.650> three<00:05:41.460> of<00:05:41.520> them<00:05:41.759> I<00:05:42.029> would<00:05:42.719> also<00:05:42.839> say<00:05:43.080> is

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.259 
all three of them I would also say is

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:44.570 
all three of them I would also say is
the<00:05:43.379> most<00:05:43.560> attractive<00:05:43.830> when<00:05:44.159> it<00:05:44.279> comes<00:05:44.430> to

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
the most attractive when it comes to

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.079 
the most attractive when it comes to
building<00:05:44.990> that<00:05:45.990> plyometric<00:05:46.680> strength<00:05:47.029> and<00:05:48.029> I

00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:48.089 
building that plyometric strength and I

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:49.790 
building that plyometric strength and I
think<00:05:48.330> the<00:05:48.449> reason<00:05:48.779> being<00:05:48.960> is<00:05:49.139> because<00:05:49.169> of<00:05:49.650> its

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
think the reason being is because of its

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.249 
think the reason being is because of its
simplicity<00:05:50.069> with<00:05:50.520> like<00:05:50.699> tornadoes<00:05:51.259> you

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:52.259 
simplicity with like tornadoes you

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:53.719 
simplicity with like tornadoes you
explode<00:05:52.680> with<00:05:52.860> the<00:05:52.889> upper<00:05:53.159> body<00:05:53.339> and<00:05:53.669> your

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
explode with the upper body and your

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:56.089 
explode with the upper body and your
legs<00:05:54.089> you<00:05:54.689> know<00:05:54.719> do<00:05:55.379> other<00:05:55.529> stuff<00:05:55.860> from<00:05:55.979> the

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:56.099 
legs you know do other stuff from the

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:58.309 
legs you know do other stuff from the
help<00:05:56.310> with<00:05:56.460> rotation<00:05:57.060> flying<00:05:57.779> squirrels<00:05:58.139> is

00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:58.319 
help with rotation flying squirrels is

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:00.740 
help with rotation flying squirrels is
once<00:05:58.500> again<00:05:58.860> the<00:05:59.189> upper<00:05:59.669> body<00:06:00.029> and<00:06:00.270> knees<00:06:00.539> are

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
once again the upper body and knees are

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.990 
once again the upper body and knees are
kicking<00:06:01.050> in<00:06:01.199> with<00:06:02.069> this<00:06:02.250> one<00:06:02.430> right<00:06:02.460> here

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
kicking in with this one right here

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.329 
kicking in with this one right here
you're<00:06:03.960> basically<00:06:04.319> exploding<00:06:04.949> your<00:06:05.039> entire

00:06:05.329 --> 00:06:05.339 
you're basically exploding your entire

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:08.389 
you're basically exploding your entire
body<00:06:05.699> off<00:06:05.969> the<00:06:06.000> ground<00:06:06.740> so<00:06:07.740> I<00:06:07.800> think<00:06:08.189> that

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:08.399 
body off the ground so I think that

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:10.550 
body off the ground so I think that
being<00:06:08.729> will<00:06:09.599> make<00:06:09.779> this<00:06:09.930> the<00:06:10.080> most<00:06:10.259> effective

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
being will make this the most effective

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.200 
being will make this the most effective
exercise<00:06:11.430> when<00:06:11.639> it<00:06:11.729> comes<00:06:11.879> to<00:06:12.029> building

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
exercise when it comes to building

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.269 
exercise when it comes to building
Plateau<00:06:12.990> metric<00:06:13.379> strength<00:06:13.649> and<00:06:13.830> I<00:06:13.889> also<00:06:14.039> say

00:06:14.269 --> 00:06:14.279 
Plateau metric strength and I also say

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:17.839 
Plateau metric strength and I also say
is<00:06:14.460> the<00:06:14.610> key<00:06:14.819> to<00:06:15.419> learn<00:06:15.599> any<00:06:15.779> other<00:06:15.870> -<00:06:16.729> so<00:06:17.729> the

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:17.849 
is the key to learn any other - so the

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:19.429 
is the key to learn any other - so the
first<00:06:18.029> exercise<00:06:18.210> is<00:06:18.659> to<00:06:18.750> learn<00:06:18.899> you<00:06:19.110> build<00:06:19.289> and

00:06:19.429 --> 00:06:19.439 
first exercise is to learn you build and

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:21.610 
first exercise is to learn you build and
do<00:06:19.529> a<00:06:19.560> Superman<00:06:20.009> is<00:06:20.370> going<00:06:20.969> to<00:06:21.089> be<00:06:21.240> able<00:06:21.300> to

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
do a Superman is going to be able to

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.709 
do a Superman is going to be able to
explode<00:06:22.620> your<00:06:22.919> upper<00:06:23.129> body<00:06:23.370> off<00:06:23.759> the<00:06:23.819> ground

00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:24.719 
explode your upper body off the ground

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:29.200 
explode your upper body off the ground
so<00:06:25.020> I<00:06:25.289> will<00:06:25.500> suggest<00:06:25.649> first<00:06:27.740> just<00:06:28.740> regular

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210 
so I will suggest first just regular

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:38.190 
so I will suggest first just regular
high<00:06:30.210> up

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:38.200 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.570 

the<00:06:39.200> second<00:06:39.530> thing<00:06:39.680> to<00:06:39.770> learn<00:06:39.860> how<00:06:40.040> to<00:06:40.070> do<00:06:40.310> is

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:40.580 
the second thing to learn how to do is

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.950 
the second thing to learn how to do is
going<00:06:40.820> to<00:06:40.910> be<00:06:41.000> launching<00:06:41.390> your<00:06:41.570> feet<00:06:41.780> off<00:06:41.930> the

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 
going to be launching your feet off the

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.440 
going to be launching your feet off the
ground<00:06:42.230> I<00:06:42.500> would<00:06:42.860> suggest<00:06:43.100> using<00:06:43.550> a<00:06:43.790> bench<00:06:44.000> or

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:44.450 
ground I would suggest using a bench or

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:57.510 
ground I would suggest using a bench or
something<00:06:44.480> that<00:06:45.020> you<00:06:45.170> could<00:06:45.380> explode<00:06:46.370> up<00:06:46.490> on<00:06:46.640> -

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.340 

so<00:06:58.520> now<00:06:58.640> putting<00:06:58.880> it<00:06:59.090> all<00:06:59.270> together<00:06:59.390> the<00:07:00.200> way<00:07:00.320> I

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:00.350 
so now putting it all together the way I

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:01.980 
so now putting it all together the way I
would<00:07:00.500> suggest<00:07:00.680> to<00:07:00.920> learn<00:07:01.040> how<00:07:01.220> to<00:07:01.250> do<00:07:01.370> this<00:07:01.520> is

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:01.990 
would suggest to learn how to do this is

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.200 
would suggest to learn how to do this is
to<00:07:02.990> first<00:07:03.230> learn<00:07:04.040> how<00:07:04.100> to<00:07:04.220> explode<00:07:04.790> with<00:07:05.150> the

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:05.210 
to first learn how to explode with the

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:07.270 
to first learn how to explode with the
upper<00:07:05.510> body<00:07:05.660> and<00:07:05.930> then<00:07:06.470> build<00:07:06.650> it<00:07:06.800> kick<00:07:07.040> your

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280 
upper body and then build it kick your

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.790 
upper body and then build it kick your
launch<00:07:07.610> up<00:07:07.850> with<00:07:08.030> your<00:07:08.180> legs<00:07:08.390> and<00:07:08.840> I'm<00:07:09.620> even

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:09.800 
launch up with your legs and I'm even

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.080 
launch up with your legs and I'm even
suggest<00:07:10.190> bending<00:07:10.460> your<00:07:10.550> knees<00:07:10.730> because<00:07:10.820> it'll

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:11.090 
suggest bending your knees because it'll

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:12.850 
suggest bending your knees because it'll
make<00:07:11.180> it<00:07:11.270> a<00:07:11.300> little<00:07:11.360> easier<00:07:11.630> at<00:07:11.870> first<00:07:12.140> so<00:07:12.800> it

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:12.860 
make it a little easier at first so it

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:25.240 
make it a little easier at first so it
should<00:07:13.010> look<00:07:13.040> like<00:07:13.160> this<00:07:22.600> then<00:07:23.600> over<00:07:23.810> time<00:07:24.250> get

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:25.250 
should look like this then over time get
