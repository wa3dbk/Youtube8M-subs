graphite nut so it stays in tune quite

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:25.010 
graphite nut so it stays in tune quite
well<00:02:18.340> I<00:02:18.580> think<00:02:19.450> it's<00:02:19.569> mainly<00:02:19.750> more<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.799> a

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.440 

for<00:02:26.020> more<00:02:26.170> subtle<00:02:26.610> vibrato<00:02:27.610> effects<00:02:28.030> than<00:02:28.240> for

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
for more subtle vibrato effects than for

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.870 
for more subtle vibrato effects than for
dive-bombing

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
dive-bombing

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:37.580 
dive-bombing
but<00:02:30.880> it<00:02:30.970> does<00:02:31.120> that<00:02:31.300> very<00:02:31.510> nicely

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:45.510 

Roza<00:02:38.610> you<00:02:39.610> can<00:02:39.760> go<00:02:39.880> up<00:02:40.000> with<00:02:40.210> it<00:02:40.360> too

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.230 

stays<00:02:46.210> in<00:02:46.360> tune<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:47.770> controls<00:02:48.220> got<00:02:48.850> a<00:02:48.880> just<00:02:49.090> a

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
real simple volume tone for each pickup
