00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.360
 so to make an xbox love controller 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.740
 you personalized so it's a trial this 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.030
 which is quite complex and which is done in 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.590
 several stages the first step is 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.140
 we will receive from microsoft 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.340
 the new official joysticks that goes 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.340
 we have to dismount one by one 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:29.820
 after that we will send the hulls 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:32.160
 so at the paint lab the 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.210
 first step is sanding 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.720
 pieces for them to have a better 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.820
 adherence 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.040
 then a primer and then a 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.570
 layer of paint that makes a base 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.460
 white that is really necessary for 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.910
 the layers of colored paint that 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.350
 will follow 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.540
 there in this case for the magnetic at 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.900
 So we have a white controller and 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.059
 green 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.710
 we have visuals on the pediment on 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.910
 the front of the hull and on the back on 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.160
 the front we will use a technique of 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.339
 stencils that will allow to achieve the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.780
 visual requested compared to microsoft 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:00.150
 for the back and the printing of 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.739
 xbox logo love you and psycho 17 in 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.449
 use our printing techniques 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.470
 via a process that we prefer to keep 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.470
 confidential for the moment 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.080
 the last step this will be the stage of 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.580
 varnish that is really the most 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.940
 important for the realization of the 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.160
 controller 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.650
 once the analysis and varnish so a 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.660
 drying time to be respected once 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.400
 that the room is it ready to be handled 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.600
 we recover it on the on the workshop for 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.020
 the penultimate step that will be the stage 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.020
 editing 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.300
 so the ultimate phase it will be the phase of 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.040
 test this controller 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.300
 d-box the custom audio for the 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.560
 partner to validate that the 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.610
 joystick be really operational and 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.610
 functional before sending 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.010
