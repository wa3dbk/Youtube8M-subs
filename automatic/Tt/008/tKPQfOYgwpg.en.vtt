00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
then you're gonna go to a C which C is

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.280 
then you're gonna go to a C which C is
on<00:01:05.480> the<00:01:05.900> you're<00:01:06.650> gonna<00:01:06.770> go<00:01:06.920> up<00:01:07.190> one<00:01:07.610> string<00:01:08.290> and

on the you're gonna go up one string and

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.380 
on the you're gonna go up one string and
we're<00:01:09.470> going<00:01:09.590> to<00:01:09.620> slide<00:01:09.800> it<00:01:09.830> down<00:01:10.100> the<00:01:11.060> 8th<00:01:11.180> and

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
10th and that's a C so it's gonna go

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:14.010 
10th and that's a C so it's gonna go
from<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:12.890> e

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
from the e

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.620 
from the e
to<00:01:15.020> a<00:01:15.050> see<00:01:15.380> that's<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:16.400> 8th<00:01:16.610> and<00:01:16.850> 10th<00:01:17.090> fret<00:01:17.300> of

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
meet with that pointer here

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.940 
meet with that pointer here
then<00:03:34.239> you<00:03:34.390> slide<00:03:34.810> down<00:03:34.840> to<00:03:35.380> a<00:03:35.410> deep<00:03:35.620> which<00:03:35.830> is

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
then you slide down to a deep which is

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.580 
then you slide down to a deep which is
the<00:03:36.040> same<00:03:36.250> shape<00:03:37.030> except<00:03:37.450> it's<00:03:37.600> on<00:03:37.720> the<00:03:37.900> fifth

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
the same shape except it's on the fifth

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:47.460 
the same shape except it's on the fifth
and<00:03:38.739> seventh

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.160 

so<00:03:48.470> basically<00:03:48.860> here's<00:03:49.730> the<00:03:50.030> rhythm<00:03:50.630> down<00:03:50.750> here

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
so basically here's the rhythm down here

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.990 
so basically here's the rhythm down here
I<00:03:51.350> don't<00:03:51.680> really<00:03:51.890> I<00:03:52.130> can't<00:03:52.460> really<00:03:52.490> say<00:03:52.940> two

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
I don't really I can't really say two

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.570 
I don't really I can't really say two
words<00:03:53.270> but<00:03:54.080> this<00:03:54.230> is<00:03:54.380> how<00:03:54.560> I<00:03:54.590> think<00:03:55.160> it<00:03:55.430> goes

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
words but this is how I think it goes

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.880 
words but this is how I think it goes
and<00:03:55.970> for<00:03:56.750> these<00:03:56.870> are<00:03:57.020> who<00:03:57.290> are<00:03:57.440> visual

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
and for these are who are visual

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:58.210 
and for these are who are visual
learners

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
learners

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.950 
learners
instead<00:03:58.550> of<00:03:58.610> auditory<00:03:59.000> learners<00:03:59.240> you<00:03:59.810> can

00:03:59.950 --> 00:03:59.960 
instead of auditory learners you can

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.320 
instead of auditory learners you can
just<00:04:00.140> watch<00:04:01.070> you<00:04:01.220> watch<00:04:01.550> my<00:04:01.700> hand<00:04:01.910> you<00:04:02.210> can

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:02.330 
just watch you watch my hand you can

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.950 
just watch you watch my hand you can
figure<00:04:02.480> it<00:04:02.630> out

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
figure it out

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:15.340 
figure it out
I<00:04:12.970> keep<00:04:13.970> that<00:04:14.180> slap<00:04:14.480> going<00:04:14.780> with<00:04:14.900> my<00:04:15.020> pointer

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
I keep that slap going with my pointer

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.289 
I keep that slap going with my pointer
finger<00:04:15.410> I<00:04:15.830> use<00:04:16.519> the<00:04:16.670> rhythm<00:04:18.220> with<00:04:19.220> my<00:04:19.340> thumb<00:04:19.609> my

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
finger I use the rhythm with my thumb my

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:36.940 
finger I use the rhythm with my thumb my
pointer<00:04:20.600> finger<00:04:20.630> I<00:04:20.900> keep<00:04:21.049> the<00:04:21.140> slap<00:04:35.919> and<00:04:36.919> you

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
pointer finger I keep the slap and you

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.190 
pointer finger I keep the slap and you
kind<00:04:37.310> of<00:04:37.460> turn<00:04:37.940> that<00:04:37.970> rhythm<00:04:38.600> you<00:04:38.690> kind<00:04:38.990> of<00:04:39.050> add

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
kind of turn that rhythm you kind of add

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.840 
kind of turn that rhythm you kind of add
pressure<00:04:39.560> to<00:04:39.850> your<00:04:40.850> G<00:04:41.180> power<00:04:41.419> chord<00:04:41.540> here<00:04:42.850> and

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
pressure to your G power chord here and

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.430 
pressure to your G power chord here and
release<00:04:44.180> it<00:04:44.419> you<00:04:44.630> can<00:04:44.750> see<00:04:44.840> my<00:04:44.960> fingers<00:04:45.230> moving

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
release it you can see my fingers moving

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.990 
release it you can see my fingers moving
up<00:04:45.620> here<00:04:45.770> that's<00:04:45.919> me<00:04:46.100> adding<00:04:46.340> pressure<00:04:46.550> and

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
up here that's me adding pressure and

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.760 
up here that's me adding pressure and
releasing<00:04:47.390> pressure<00:04:47.570> that<00:04:48.320> kind<00:04:48.500> of<00:04:48.560> helps

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
releasing pressure that kind of helps

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.590 
releasing pressure that kind of helps
the<00:04:48.860> rhythm<00:04:49.100> out<00:04:49.160> a<00:04:49.220> little<00:04:49.340> bit<00:04:49.550> and<00:04:49.760> during

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
the rhythm out a little bit and during

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.540 
the rhythm out a little bit and during
