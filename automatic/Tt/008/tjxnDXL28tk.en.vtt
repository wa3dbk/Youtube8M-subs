 all sorts of topics 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.289
 the thicker the curlers , the larger your 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.750
 curls I prefer as much as possible 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.849
 large curls so taking advantage of curlers 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.189
 jumbo brand giants colleges 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.949
 lungs are fast and they are not used 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.329
 spoil the hair like a curling iron or a hair iron are 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.260
 Suitable for both thin and damaged 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.300
 hair 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.250
 so for thick and difficult to 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.680
 perm but to get the most 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.540
 spectacular result is important correctly by them 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.350
 to use 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.450
 it is necessary to wind them only slightly 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.059
 wet or almost dry hair 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.399
 here I will only wet the tips and the middle 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.559
 hair so that the hair at the roots remains 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.539
 almost equal to 1 main secret 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.129
 is to cheat 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.620
 strands starting from the tips 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.079
 begin at the far end of our roller 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:06.240
 and wind the 5th helix directing to 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:09.920
 the opposite end of the curlers will fix 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.920
 the roller just bent its ends down 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.740
 to get clear curls not 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.869
 wind too strands over 1 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.439
 the thinner the strand the clearer it will be 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.439
 curl 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.380
 thick strands in turn will create 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.850
 soft waves twirl curlers in 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.400
 several horizontal rows 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.160
 starting from the top layers of hair to the figure 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.260
 you will need 12 to 24 such 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.610
 rollers depending on thickness and length 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.979
 your hair 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:48.170
 make sure you strand well 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.170
 to the roller but do not tighten them too 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.170
 to keep the curlers well and the hair 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.170
 didn't fluff 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.009
 always good to use the mesh 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.869
 for hair there are such 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.320
 special shawls for styling on 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.320
 curlers 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.489
 these curlers are so soft 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.619
 that they are very comfortable to sleep so you 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.619
 can calmly dry your hair overnight 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.860
 or use a hair dryer 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.260
 when kept completely dry neatly 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.260
 take off our curlers 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.640
 Now you can do our texture 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.730
 curls to give them a natural 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.770
 view and at the same time save curl advise 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.380
 do this job without a comb 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.480
 just separate the thin strands of hair and 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.280
 scroll around each finger 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.790

 curls on curling iron or iron curly 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.910
