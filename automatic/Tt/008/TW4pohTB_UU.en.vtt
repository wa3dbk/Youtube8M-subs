00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.980 
where it's very easy to see what a combo
is<00:04:47.750> it's<00:04:48.050> kind<00:04:48.230> of<00:04:48.290> like<00:04:48.440> a<00:04:48.620> molera<00:04:49.190> but<00:04:49.990> the

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
is it's kind of like a molera but the

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.409 
is it's kind of like a molera but the
same<00:04:51.230> you<00:04:51.889> just<00:04:52.160> sacrifice<00:04:52.669> it<00:04:52.880> so<00:04:53.090> instead<00:04:53.360> of

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
same you just sacrifice it so instead of

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.420 
same you just sacrifice it so instead of
like<00:04:53.600> using<00:04:53.840> pod<00:04:54.200> to<00:04:54.410> find<00:04:54.650> these<00:04:54.800> pieces<00:04:55.040> you

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
like using pod to find these pieces you

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.030 
like using pod to find these pieces you
can<00:04:55.460> just<00:04:55.850> have<00:04:56.450> more<00:04:56.780> pieces<00:04:57.229> and<00:04:57.500> this

00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.040 
can just have more pieces and this

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.070 
can just have more pieces and this
replaced<00:04:58.430> is<00:04:58.610> malaria<00:04:58.970> as<00:04:59.210> a<00:04:59.240> piece<00:04:59.570> so

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
replaced is malaria as a piece so

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.680 
replaced is malaria as a piece so
overall<00:05:00.350> pretty<00:05:00.770> good<00:05:00.889> packs<00:05:01.340> rhino<00:05:02.150> would<00:05:02.540> be

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
overall pretty good packs rhino would be

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:06.310 
overall pretty good packs rhino would be
number<00:05:03.139> one<00:05:03.350> and<00:05:03.380> then<00:05:03.860> my<00:05:05.050> princess<00:05:06.050> and<00:05:06.080> a

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
number one and then my princess and a

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.800 
number one and then my princess and a
fire<00:05:06.500> crews<00:05:06.860> I<00:05:07.070> guess<00:05:07.340> died<00:05:07.669> I<00:05:08.000> would<00:05:08.660> read

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
fire crews I guess died I would read

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.020 
fire crews I guess died I would read
them<00:05:08.840> too<00:05:09.229> so<00:05:09.830> let's<00:05:10.190> go<00:05:10.340> ahead<00:05:10.370> and<00:05:10.580> open<00:05:10.760> two

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
them too so let's go ahead and open two

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.419 
them too so let's go ahead and open two
more<00:05:11.150> packs
