it can get so knowing this we can wire
up<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.960> guitar<00:00:58.579> let's<00:00:59.579> start<00:00:59.879> again<00:01:00.030> with<00:01:00.539> two

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
up a guitar let's start again with two

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.020 
up a guitar let's start again with two
pickups<00:01:01.760> note<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:03.239> on<00:01:03.420> less<00:01:03.899> balls<00:01:04.290> or<00:01:04.790> SGS

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
pickups note that on less balls or SGS

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.899 
pickups note that on less balls or SGS
the<00:01:06.390> pickups<00:01:06.810> will<00:01:07.320> usually<00:01:07.680> be<00:01:08.159> humbuckers

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
the pickups will usually be humbuckers

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.609 
the pickups will usually be humbuckers
or<00:01:09.409> p90s

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
or p90s

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.130 
or p90s
so<00:01:11.070> don't<00:01:11.280> let<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.880> shape<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.540> diagram

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
so don't let the shape in the diagram

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.499 
so don't let the shape in the diagram
mislead<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.780> first<00:01:15.780> thing<00:01:16.049> we<00:01:16.350> do<00:01:16.500> again<00:01:17.040> is

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
mislead you first thing we do again is

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.289 
mislead you first thing we do again is
connect<00:01:18.509> both<00:01:18.900> pickups<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.369> ground<00:01:20.909> side

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
connect both pickups to the ground side

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.280 
connect both pickups to the ground side
of<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.720> circuit<00:01:23.119> next<00:01:24.119> we<00:01:24.540> have<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:25.080> main

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
of the circuit next we have the main

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.420 
of the circuit next we have the main
difference<00:01:26.009> with<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.689> Telecaster<00:01:27.950> in<00:01:28.950> that

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
difference with a Telecaster in that

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.410 
difference with a Telecaster in that
here<00:01:30.090> each<00:01:30.540> pickup<00:01:31.140> has<00:01:31.409> its<00:01:31.829> own<00:01:32.040> console<00:01:32.700> for

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
here each pickup has its own console for

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.010 
here each pickup has its own console for
volume<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.320> tone<00:01:35.450> so<00:01:36.450> let's<00:01:36.689> bring<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.500> and

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
volume and tone so let's bring it in and

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.389 
volume and tone so let's bring it in and
connect<00:01:40.020> them<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:41.210> pickups<00:01:43.189> now<00:01:44.189> it's

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
connect them to the pickups now it's

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.450 
connect them to the pickups now it's

in<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.329> future<00:02:06.960> video<00:02:07.140> I'll<00:02:07.680> explain<00:02:07.710> how<00:02:08.520> you

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
in a future video I'll explain how you

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.690 
in a future video I'll explain how you
can<00:02:08.970> wire<00:02:09.270> your<00:02:10.099> volume<00:02:11.099> control

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
can wire your volume control

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.280 
can wire your volume control
so<00:02:13.700> they<00:02:13.910> work<00:02:14.650> independently<00:02:15.700> in<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.900> next

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
so they work independently in the next

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.550 
so they work independently in the next
video<00:02:18.770> I'll<00:02:19.040> discuss<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:20.150> standard<00:02:20.870> wiring

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
video I'll discuss the standard wiring

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.720 
video I'll discuss the standard wiring
of<00:02:21.830> a<00:02:21.980> Stratocaster<00:02:22.610> I<00:02:24.190> hope<00:02:25.190> this<00:02:25.459> was

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
of a Stratocaster I hope this was

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.569 
of a Stratocaster I hope this was
helpful<00:02:26.950> take<00:02:27.950> care<00:02:28.420> thank<00:02:29.420> you
