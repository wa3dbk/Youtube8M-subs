simple and most natural way for a little
child<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:12.090> ball<00:00:13.160> so<00:00:14.160> if<00:00:14.219> you<00:00:14.340> can<00:00:14.490> develop<00:00:14.790> that

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
child to ball so if you can develop that

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.269 
child to ball so if you can develop that
child<00:00:15.780> style<00:00:16.410> into<00:00:16.770> something<00:00:17.010> that<00:00:17.130> he's

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
done naturally from such an early age I

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.050 
done naturally from such an early age I
think<00:00:19.830> that's<00:00:19.980> where<00:00:20.160> my<00:00:20.310> greatest<00:00:20.670> advantage

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
unfortunate the last two frames and I

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.080 
unfortunate the last two frames and I
needed<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.380> capitalize<00:02:27.860> on<00:02:27.890> that<00:02:28.130> so<00:02:28.880> right

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
needed to capitalize on that so right

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.030 
needed to capitalize on that so right
now<00:02:29.270> probably<00:02:29.600> running<00:02:30.170> through<00:02:30.410> his<00:02:30.590> head<00:02:30.620> is

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
now probably running through his head is

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.460 
now probably running through his head is
I've<00:02:31.220> got<00:02:31.430> a<00:02:31.459> strike<00:02:31.820> now<00:02:32.209> and<00:02:32.930> that's

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
I've got a strike now and that's

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.500 
I've got a strike now and that's
something<00:02:33.830> that<00:02:34.040> I<00:02:34.459> feel<00:02:34.760> that<00:02:34.820> I<00:02:34.970> needed<00:02:35.270> to

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
something that I feel that I needed to

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:44.580 
something that I feel that I needed to
make<00:02:35.720> him<00:02:35.990> think

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.260 

and<00:02:44.770> that's<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.130> difference<00:02:45.340> but<00:02:45.580> he<00:02:45.760> really

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
and that's the difference but he really

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.500 
and that's the difference but he really
wants<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.900> strike<00:02:47.230> he<00:02:48.220> will<00:02:48.490> he<00:02:48.790> just<00:02:48.970> has<00:02:49.300> been

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
wants to strike he will he just has been

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:57.900 
wants to strike he will he just has been
friendly<00:02:49.870> with<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.170> Australia<00:02:50.650> tourists

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.220 

that<00:02:58.910> would<00:02:59.030> be<00:02:59.150> so<00:02:59.360> much<00:02:59.510> more<00:02:59.570> fun<00:02:59.780> to<00:02:59.990> watch

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
that would be so much more fun to watch

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.400 
that would be so much more fun to watch
if<00:03:00.440> I<00:03:00.530> wasn't<00:03:00.710> bullying<00:03:00.980> against<00:03:01.280> you
