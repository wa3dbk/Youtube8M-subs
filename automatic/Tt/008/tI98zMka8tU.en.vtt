00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.300 

yes<00:01:23.240> I<00:01:23.479> i<00:01:23.510> think<00:01:24.229> that<00:01:24.409> the<00:01:24.620> combination<00:01:24.920> of

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
yes I i think that the combination of

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.430 
yes I i think that the combination of
quick<00:01:25.520> and<00:01:25.700> so<00:01:25.729> forth<00:01:26.120> the<00:01:26.270> thing<00:01:26.570> is<00:01:26.750> you<00:01:27.320> know

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
quick and so forth the thing is you know

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.340 
quick and so forth the thing is you know
it's<00:01:27.680> really<00:01:28.750> cheated<00:01:29.750> out<00:01:29.840> of<00:01:29.900> the<00:01:30.020> pocket

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
it's really cheated out of the pocket

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.170 
it's really cheated out of the pocket
really<00:01:30.470> quick<00:01:30.800> though<00:01:30.979> because<00:01:31.190> if<00:01:31.760> you<00:01:32.000> stay

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
really quick though because if you stay

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.580 
really quick though because if you stay
in<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.390> pocket<00:01:32.570> for<00:01:32.900> more<00:01:33.050> than<00:01:33.170> two<00:01:33.290> shots

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
in the pocket for more than two shots

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:34.780 
in the pocket for more than two shots
with<00:01:33.740> mayweather<00:01:34.040> he's<00:01:34.280> going<00:01:34.460> to<00:01:34.550> hit<00:01:34.670> you

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
with mayweather he's going to hit you

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.120 
with mayweather he's going to hit you
back<00:01:34.970> I<00:01:35.270> think<00:01:35.750> he's<00:01:36.080> very<00:01:36.170> quick<00:01:36.530> so<00:01:36.770> you<00:01:36.800> take

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
back I think he's very quick so you take

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.590 
back I think he's very quick so you take
two<00:01:37.280> shots<00:01:37.520> get<00:01:37.790> out<00:01:37.910> of<00:01:38.060> pocket<00:01:38.330> make<00:01:38.450> him

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
two shots get out of pocket make him

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.200 
two shots get out of pocket make him
miss<00:01:38.780> and<00:01:38.990> counter<00:01:39.590> that<00:01:39.830> back<00:01:40.430> in<00:01:40.700> you're

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
miss and counter that back in you're

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.780 
miss and counter that back in you're
gonna<00:01:41.330> be<00:01:41.540> yet<00:01:42.170> have<00:01:42.470> more<00:01:42.650> success<00:01:42.920> but<00:01:43.640> the

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
gonna be yet have more success but the

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.100 
gonna be yet have more success but the
thing<00:01:43.820> is<00:01:43.970> if<00:01:44.180> they<00:01:44.300> say<00:01:44.450> in<00:01:44.509> the<00:01:44.659> pockets<00:01:44.990> of
