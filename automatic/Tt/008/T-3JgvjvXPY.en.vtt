00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.850
 ah 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.990
 hello that such friends as they were good 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.580
 this time I bring you a new 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.140
 video with a collection of games for 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.360
 the neo geo 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.340
 tiger arcade or tigger arcade like 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.540
 you know him not if you remember that 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.000
 I had previously made a video with 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.070
 a collection of good capcom games in 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.500
 this time it's up to the neo geo snk 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.000
 playmore and as you know that then 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.190
 there is a lot of fabric to cut with 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.370
 neo neo games this may possibly be 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.230
 the first part of other videos I have 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.690
 scheduled to do the second part as 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.090
 you can see here we are playing the gar 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.050
 omar of the walk and as I was saying 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.539
 possibly it is a second part and if 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.489
 we see that these videos work that to 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.980
 you like we could get to 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.270
 still do a third part and I know that 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.579
 many of you will wonder why 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.949
 does not include this the games of peking of 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.970
 metal fighters load a hero fighting 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:10.460
 the fatal figure and the super sic and good 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.869
 it's very simple friends the truth not the 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.930
 includes because their games will have their 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.720
 own collection in videos whether 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.640
 thinking in the future to upload collections of 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.870
 metal slug and for example in the case of 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.490
 Rey de peleas 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.800
 if you already know that I have a second 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.030
 channel I do not know if they place it good here 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.100
 down I'll leave the link in the 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.320
 description there and upload the dt collection

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.119
 that you download the game that you 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.979
 more you like so you do not have to 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.439
 download a package in which they have 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.390
 games that you really do not like anymore 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.570
 that you can download here 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.430
 individually 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.610
 now as we can see is the neo geo 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.460
 coop 98 on air and as you know it 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.979

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.400
 games are the ones that are going to come in this 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.500

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.350
 I know that if at least if you 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.670
 you have over 16 17 years some of 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.130
 these games you will know them since they are 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.880
 very classic and the truth with these 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.880
 games we all grew up 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.849
 here they are seeing the prehistoric island 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.000
 also belongs to snk games 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:28.250
 playmore and the neo geo plate now 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.040
 let's see with real bone 2 that 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.930
 belongs to the saga of fatal fury and 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.980
 you know in which starring 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.530
 demolition they win they divulge and joe and almost 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.140
 they are like the tournament or the start of the 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.540

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.770

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.760
 as you know I also leave you small 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.400
 games so that the video does not last long 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.520
 because as you can see, the game is 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.250
 accelerate a little so they do not take long 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.080
 too much do not get bored and can see a 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.030
 have a preview of what they are going to 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.370
 download since if you do not know 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.800
 the games through the visual are 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.220
 they will realize what game they are from 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.590
 socks tropper 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.910
 game of shooting adventures although the 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.530
 platform games are the most 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.360
 entertained 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.950

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.720

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.150
 give like and comment 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.640
 since all that you do is very 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.470
 important helps me a lot and I know 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.470
 he is very grateful 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.560
 the game this is from spin master 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.109
 maybe this game has already seen it 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.069
 several of you is the character that is 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:03.359
 it looks like the animated chabelo 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:06.340
 but with a yoyo is something similar since 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:09.099
 it looked like the logo that came out 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.409
 family with the eternal I say with 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:14.019
 Chabelo in the programming of the 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:16.739
 Sundays but this is the spin master 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:20.079
 also plates of neo geo snk playmore 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.699
 strip hops this great game of 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.610
 basketball only that the workshop 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:27.460
 arcade runs it with a little problem 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.289
 that the room or the strip ops game does not 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.139
 has sound would be the only flaw that 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:34.270
 have this game the one of strip hobbes not 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.560
 has the sound compared to all 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.630
 others others that I'm going up 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.310
 If you do not have any errors, run them 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:42.270
 every detail perfectly shooting 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.270
 crazy as you know him 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.070
 we are seeing a small game of 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.070
 strip bots 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.820
 also show that I also know 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.820
 play basketball there 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:00.090
 let's get out now top counter 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.730
 this game also already a classic top 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.730
 counter 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:08.500
 It has similarities to the game of spin 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:12.100
 master that we just saw a while ago 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.230
 but if you change some things because in 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.139
 the story is different and the 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.800
 characters too 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:21.289
 in this we can use 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.479
 a man and a woman and the missions 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:25.580
 you are also eligible you can choose what 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:29.350
 mission you want to start has a 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.900
 type modality mega man 2 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:35.400
 in which we can select 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.400
 in what initial world 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:41.810
 and well I bring you this game of 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.690
 the world and rose perfect the third 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:48.260
 delivery of works and rose you already know that 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:50.910
 game that came out in the snes console 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.740
 or super nintendo 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:56.070
 with our main characters as 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:58.830
 hanson and smokes this game very good 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.480
 although many also criticize it since 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:04.320
 the story says that something is done to them 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:06.330
 soda sake that the mad scientist 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:08.520
 invent a time machine to go 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.930
 recruiting old people 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.509
 epic fighters 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.460
 and making them fight in a good tournament 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:18.390
 maybe many do not like it but for 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:22.410
 example to me if I like that game 

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:24.630
 now be place this airplane game of 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.790
 shots plataformero also seemed 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.310
 to the game of detecting with the wind giga 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:30.710
 except that this one is something different 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.800
 why 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.540
 in this we are flying from the side 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.580
 left to the right side and in 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.020
 I change the wing guide and it always goes 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.550
 towards the front 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.440
 the modality is very different but still 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.080
 so also this game is very good and 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.390
 finally we will have the game of his dad 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.920
 this platform game if I had to 

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:52.050
 compare it with some I could buy it 

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:54.690
 with snow bros or pop tumblr 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.250
 it's like this game his daddy good is 

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:58.289
 It would be the last snore I leave you and how do you 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.810
 I say this would be the first part of 

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:02.909
 collection of geo meo games would be missing 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:05.639
 the second and possibly if you guys 

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:07.190
 they ask for it there will be a third one because not like that 

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:09.240
 that you already know can subscribe to 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:12.479

 dance
