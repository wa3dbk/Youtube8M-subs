involved in this campaign because I

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.240 
involved in this campaign because I
think<00:00:21.029> what<00:00:21.270> eclipse<00:00:21.509> is<00:00:21.630> doing<00:00:21.899> is<00:00:22.050> fantastic

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
think what eclipse is doing is fantastic

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.179 
think what eclipse is doing is fantastic
sometimes<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.480> one<00:00:24.750> person<00:00:25.140> alone<00:00:25.349> you<00:00:26.009> don't

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
sometimes a one person alone you don't

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.040 
sometimes a one person alone you don't
make<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.399> much<00:00:26.759> of<00:00:27.149> a<00:00:27.239> difference<00:00:27.329> or<00:00:27.720> an

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
make that much of a difference or an

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.040 
make that much of a difference or an
impact<00:00:28.590> but<00:00:29.579> together<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.630> think<00:00:30.689> we<00:00:31.020> can

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
impact but together I think we can

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.179 
impact but together I think we can
create<00:00:31.380> something<00:00:31.739> very<00:00:32.040> wonderful

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
create something very wonderful

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.420 
create something very wonderful
especially<00:00:32.969> for<00:00:33.600> our<00:00:33.899> world<00:00:34.200> vision<00:00:34.649> world

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
especially for our world vision world

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.090 
especially for our world vision world
vision<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.750> huge<00:00:37.170> community<00:00:37.650> all<00:00:37.890> over

vision it is a huge community all over

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.490 
vision it is a huge community all over
the<00:00:38.190> world<00:00:38.400> but<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.000> Malaysia<00:00:39.540> we<00:00:40.170> are<00:00:40.320> making

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
the world but in Malaysia we are making

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.600 
the world but in Malaysia we are making
a<00:00:40.680> difference<00:00:40.770> right<00:00:41.130> here<00:00:41.400> and<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.580> think

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
a difference right here and I think

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.970 
a difference right here and I think
that's<00:00:41.910> fantastic<00:00:42.540> I<00:00:42.750> think<00:00:43.320> health<00:00:43.710> care<00:00:43.800> is

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
that's fantastic I think health care is

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.010 
that's fantastic I think health care is
extremely<00:00:44.490> important<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.240> a<00:00:45.540> lot<00:00:45.690> of<00:00:45.720> people

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
extremely important and a lot of people

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.500 
extremely important and a lot of people
