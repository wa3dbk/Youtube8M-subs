00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
you what this device does it it might

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.150 
you what this device does it it might
look<00:00:42.180> like<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.480> modem<00:00:43.110> or<00:00:43.230> router<00:00:43.290> but<00:00:43.950> that's

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
look like a modem or router but that's

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.819 
look like a modem or router but that's
not<00:00:44.730> what<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.870> gateway<00:00:46.410> that

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
not what this is this is a gateway that

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.709 
not what this is this is a gateway that
allows<00:00:47.070> your<00:00:47.430> laptop<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.120> connect<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.510> this

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
allows your laptop to connect to this

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.990 
allows your laptop to connect to this
and<00:00:48.989> then<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.829> connects<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.460> projector

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
and then this connects to the projector

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.850 
and then this connects to the projector
so<00:00:51.510> it'll<00:00:51.840> be<00:00:51.930> able<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.140> pick<00:00:52.289> up<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.530> signal

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
so it'll be able to pick up the signal

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.670 
so it'll be able to pick up the signal
from<00:00:52.890> your<00:00:53.129> wireless<00:00:53.550> B<00:00:53.789> or<00:00:54.000> g<00:00:54.270> device<00:00:55.079> laptop

on it you'll be able to it'll be able to
pick<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.180> up<00:01:00.270> it'll<00:01:01.260> pick<00:01:01.440> up<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.620> signal<00:01:01.980> and

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
pick it up it'll pick up the signal and

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.460 
pick it up it'll pick up the signal and
then<00:01:02.399> it'll<00:01:02.550> transmit<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.570> data<00:01:03.780> from<00:01:04.229> your
