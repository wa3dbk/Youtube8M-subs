infamous mains hum this annoyed me a bit
at<00:01:14.610> first<00:01:14.640> but<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.360> helped<00:01:15.630> me<00:01:15.720> realize<00:01:16.170> that

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
at first but it helped me realize that

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.649 
at first but it helped me realize that
there<00:01:16.590> was<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.770> flaw<00:01:17.009> in<00:01:17.040> my<00:01:17.280> design<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.360> poked

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
there was a flaw in my design so I poked

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.240 
there was a flaw in my design so I poked
around<00:01:18.780> with<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.170> oscilloscope<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.979> worked

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
around with the oscilloscope and worked

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.890 
around with the oscilloscope and worked
out<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.700> needed<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.210> fully<00:01:21.479> regulated

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
out that I needed a fully regulated

$20.00 I bought a 24 volt 1 amp fixed
voltage<00:01:37.780> regulator<00:01:38.470> for<00:01:38.740> a<00:01:38.770> dollar<00:01:38.980> 50<00:01:39.400> and

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
voltage regulator for a dollar 50 and

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.730 
voltage regulator for a dollar 50 and
use<00:01:40.150> the<00:01:40.300> output<00:01:40.450> of<00:01:40.720> that<00:01:40.810> to<00:01:41.170> drive<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.560> base

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
use the output of that to drive the base

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.010 
use the output of that to drive the base
of<00:01:41.950> an<00:01:42.040> NPN<00:01:42.520> transistor<00:01:43.150> this<00:01:43.510> formed<00:01:43.930> a

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
of an NPN transistor this formed a

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.780 
of an NPN transistor this formed a
voltage<00:01:44.380> regulator<00:01:44.710> that<00:01:45.160> can<00:01:45.310> handle<00:01:45.490> about

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
voltage regulator that can handle about

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.730 
voltage regulator that can handle about
5<00:01:46.120> to<00:01:46.300> 10<00:01:46.510> amps<00:01:46.750> depending<00:01:47.350> on<00:01:47.470> the<00:01:47.560> heat

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
5 to 10 amps depending on the heat

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.680 
5 to 10 amps depending on the heat
sinking<00:01:48.130> and<00:01:48.310> temperature<00:01:48.760> and<00:01:48.940> after<00:01:49.540> that

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
sinking and temperature and after that

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.760 
sinking and temperature and after that
then<00:01:50.290> you<00:01:50.380> sanded<00:01:50.620> when<00:01:50.950> I<00:01:52.260> needed<00:01:53.260> to<00:01:53.410> drill<00:01:53.740> a

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
then you sanded when I needed to drill a

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.890 
then you sanded when I needed to drill a
hole<00:01:53.860> in<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.370> back<00:01:54.550> panel<00:01:54.910> to<00:01:54.940> allow<00:01:55.330> an<00:01:55.450> RCA

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900

hole in the back panel to allow an RCA
cable<00:01:56.410> to<00:01:56.530> be<00:01:56.560> connected<00:01:57.100> to<00:01:57.190> the<00:01:57.310> amplifier

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
cable to be connected to the amplifier

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.910 
cable to be connected to the amplifier
and<00:01:58.150> after<00:01:58.720> that<00:01:58.869> I<00:01:58.930> drilled<00:01:59.380> some<00:01:59.560> holes<00:01:59.590> in

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
and after that I drilled some holes in

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.080 
and after that I drilled some holes in
the<00:02:00.010> bottom<00:02:00.310> panel<00:02:00.460> to<00:02:00.760> mount<00:02:00.970> the

upright<00:02:03.670> in<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:03.940> back<00:02:04.090> panel<00:02:04.479> and<00:02:04.660> use

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
upright in the back panel and use

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.660 
upright in the back panel and use
double-sided<00:02:05.290> tape<00:02:05.740> to<00:02:05.950> stick<00:02:06.010> the<00:02:06.310> circuit

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
double-sided tape to stick the circuit

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.030 
double-sided tape to stick the circuit
board<00:02:06.910> down<00:02:07.119> this<00:02:07.930> is<00:02:08.140> what<00:02:08.320> the<00:02:08.470> internals

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 
board down this is what the internals

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.740 
board down this is what the internals
look<00:02:09.220> like<00:02:09.429> before<00:02:09.760> I<00:02:09.820> close<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.270> back<00:02:10.420> panel

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
look like before I close the back panel

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.050 
look like before I close the back panel
up<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.620> finished<00:02:12.010> product<00:02:12.400> indeed<00:02:12.790> looks

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
up the finished product indeed looks

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.210 
up the finished product indeed looks
very<00:02:13.330> clean<00:02:13.630> and<00:02:13.870> professionally<00:02:14.470> done<00:02:14.620> you

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
very clean and professionally done you

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.680 
very clean and professionally done you
can't<00:02:15.459> tell<00:02:15.670> that<00:02:15.700> there<00:02:16.000> is<00:02:16.120> a<00:02:16.150> huge<00:02:16.480> mess<00:02:16.660> of

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
can't tell that there is a huge mess of

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.600 
can't tell that there is a huge mess of
wires<00:02:16.990> inside<00:02:17.590> when<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:17.980> only<00:02:18.130> thing<00:02:18.400> you<00:02:18.490> can

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
wires inside when the only thing you can

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.880 
wires inside when the only thing you can
see<00:02:18.760> from<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.090> outside<00:02:19.240> is<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:19.930> power<00:02:20.260> cable<00:02:20.560> in

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
see from the outside is a power cable in

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.430 
see from the outside is a power cable in
an<00:02:21.010> RCA<00:02:21.340> plug<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:22.240> the<00:02:22.360> results<00:02:22.840> speak<00:02:23.020> for

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
an RCA plug and the results speak for

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.620 
an RCA plug and the results speak for
themselves
