pedal<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:27.449> great<00:00:27.630> thing<00:00:27.810> about<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:28.289> pedal

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
pedal the great thing about this pedal

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.830 
pedal the great thing about this pedal
is<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.279> ships<00:00:29.580> with<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.880> dual<00:00:30.269> chain<00:00:30.570> drive

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
is that it ships with a dual chain drive

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.810 
is that it ships with a dual chain drive
but<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.349> also<00:00:31.500> comes<00:00:32.009> with<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.369> direct<00:00:32.669> drive
