00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.130 
with the fuzz face and I keep the volume
up<00:05:48.280> more<00:05:48.580> and<00:05:48.760> i<00:05:48.850> take<00:05:49.030> the<00:05:49.180> fuzz<00:05:49.420> down<00:05:49.690> because

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.140 
up more and i take the fuzz down because

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.230 
up more and i take the fuzz down because
the<00:05:50.290> volume<00:05:50.470> you<00:05:51.280> can<00:05:51.310> get<00:05:51.550> more<00:05:51.730> overdrive

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
the volume you can get more overdrive

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.090 
the volume you can get more overdrive
with<00:05:52.420> the<00:05:52.510> photos<00:05:52.840> just<00:05:52.990> kind<00:05:53.230> of<00:05:53.290> destroys<00:05:53.830> it

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 
with the photos just kind of destroys it

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.550 
with the photos just kind of destroys it
so<00:05:54.730> you<00:05:54.850> want<00:05:55.000> to<00:05:55.060> keep<00:05:55.210> the<00:05:55.270> fuzz<00:05:55.810> fuzz<00:05:56.350> now

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
so you want to keep the fuzz fuzz now

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.880 
so you want to keep the fuzz fuzz now
