00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.160
 and then people on the channel we saw brazil galera 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.950
 I'm making video fast, just for 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:49.190
 show a last update there 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.190
 left for ne big galaxy two 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:58.350
 is an update that has not changed at all 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:01:01.830
 in a neo-professional system of his not 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.830
 it is a transaction of improvements and none 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:08.250
 update the hot right 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.570
 but an update you can see 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:16.350
 here o 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:21.840
 before here was with the end is the other 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:27.619
 mistake is mb6 right now it's in this version 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:34.799
 which is in itself one I am seeing here Ã³ in c1 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:38.930
 galera available on May 27th but that 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.390
 Actually, it just came out yesterday, right? 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:45.680
 Tuesday 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:49.320
 If I remember correctly, it was Wednesday and 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.320
 this update it is simply not 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.009
 that I know I thought you're the one 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.210
 who wants 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.859
 for him everything but not the improvement is not 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.530
 because there are a lot of people complaining about 

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:03.600
 mainly to carry out and 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.770
 receiving calls is too slow 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.649
 locking and such 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.950
 so I thought it was one of those two 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.980
 things are not this update but 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:18.270
 True, this update is only 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:24.030
 to install three programs that is me 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:25.850
 I believe until you left for the s3 mini nÃ© 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.460
 the models that I'm not inside 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:35.280
 but it's not too much trouble the transaction was 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:38.340
 Just for showing it to you. 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:43.470
 was installed is three play programs 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:46.220
 Bench is over y slide and soccer camera 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.920
 these are the three plans that have been 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.420
 updated is that it was installed in this 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:03:00.120
 update 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:03:03.870
 Although I click on a soccer camera 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:08.900
 right it's a photo you take is with 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:12.209
 characters from the cup and players 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.730
 It's for you it comes out in a way and such but only 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.130
 that actually always appears here 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.580
 can currently download try 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:23.670
 again later and I can not 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:27.480
 make this update is this installation 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:30.209
 it's an application 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.870
 Well now it 's just to show you 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:38.250
 this update is what was done in this 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:42.120
 week for the big two of gas right but 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:47.670
 and it's nothing improvement in the system is of 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:49.769
 receive and make calls because 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:54.150
 There are a lot of people complaining about it 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:57.870
 lock is too slow and not even what it wants 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:01.110
 It's waiting for the guys to see if they'll leave. 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.420

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.340
