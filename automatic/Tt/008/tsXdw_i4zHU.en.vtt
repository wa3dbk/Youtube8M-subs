look ok it's not again you can see this

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.280 
look ok it's not again you can see this
is<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.899> noun<00:01:46.070> throughout<00:01:47.070> ok<00:01:47.939> but<00:01:48.689> maybe<00:01:49.020> this

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
is a noun throughout ok but maybe this

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.770 
is a noun throughout ok but maybe this
route<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.590> not<00:01:50.040> optimized<00:01:50.579> now<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.360> have<00:01:51.600> look

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
route is not optimized now you have look

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.039 
route is not optimized now you have look
at<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.399> you<00:01:53.399> can<00:01:53.430> take<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.240> out<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:55.020> can

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
at it you can take it out and you can

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.459 
at it you can take it out and you can
optimize<00:01:55.560> then<00:01:56.040> you'll<00:01:56.189> find<00:01:57.110> allowed<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.320> go

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
optimize then you'll find allowed to go

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.050
