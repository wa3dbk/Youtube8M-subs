 well, and we'll make you a hudson 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.920
 and I do not have that 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.540
 I was not there until Copenhagen 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.310
 invited at known 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.199
 this is one of the type trabert 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.990
 close patient monitoring and personal 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.449
 there is this drink usual and me 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.750
 thought it was so amazing that I did that 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.360

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.590
 and I have to say if it's you 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:40.140
 interested remains easy 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:43.469
 and as usual our ingredients for 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:48.289
 this awesome drink this hudson amon 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:52.110
 syrup pro7 third without cinnamon stick and 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:54.840
 a vanilla pod and a bottle where 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.820
 this amount of fluid fits in a bit 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.390
 About Lithuania Litern is actually going 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.250
 he makes a dark bottle or yes 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.489
 Do not take a bottle but you have to 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.240
 then put it in the dark first 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.840
 we do 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.409
 the vanilla pod her easy 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.409
 cut out 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.450
 so the first step is carmen syrup 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.439
 is not quite live they can 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.560
 to do my whole thing 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:33.590
 then it would be sweeter because there is yes 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:37.280
 he too hears a song yes I live 280 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:41.929
 visitors 200 milliliters good two 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:44.539
 Third, that's the rest when I'm there 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.000
 we can not do that in there 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.020
 arrived more 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.299
 but then I can still clean 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:57.289
 protect 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:02:02.030
 next through the centers and rhine 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:04.729
 I wake up the vanilla bean 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:10.429
 I also read that completely 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:16.280
 you also cut it small so I do it 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:20.560
 so far the rustic way and now 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.560
 through the ground to 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:37.670
 I make the bottle to taste it 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.460
 a bit you should at the beginning of the 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.530
 do first six weeks over and over again 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.520
 do not do a bit every day 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.620
 shake properly 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:50.660
 he should not do it but one like that 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:57.130
 Pivot that whole thing 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:03:01.010
 mixed nicely and after six weeks 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.740
 is this drink ready there it can 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.880
 already enjoy 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:08.420
 I've heard that before people 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.660
 meanwhile that was also the years 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:14.959
 can or always can stand 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.450
 Better and better, better and better 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.600
 In any case, I think it is too 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:24.800
 Christmas a nice gift or 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:27.440
 even a present and something for christmas 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.530
 is there better like a gift where 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:35.500
 you made yourself and also a 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:38.959
 I have to say that, too 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.500
 Have fun imitating and well 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.500
