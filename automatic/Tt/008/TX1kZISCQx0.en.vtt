00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.850 
off the salt so I'm gonna leave this
here<00:02:05.000> and<00:02:05.360> I'll<00:02:05.660> come<00:02:05.900> back<00:02:05.930> to<00:02:06.440> it<00:02:06.620> whenever

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
here and I'll come back to it whenever

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.749 
here and I'll come back to it whenever
it's<00:02:07.130> dry<00:02:08.350> now<00:02:09.350> that<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.590> paint<00:02:09.830> has<00:02:10.040> dried<00:02:10.070> I

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
it's dry now that the paint has dried I

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.630 
it's dry now that the paint has dried I
can<00:02:11.120> go<00:02:11.240> ahead<00:02:11.330> and<00:02:11.630> just<00:02:11.810> brush<00:02:12.140> it<00:02:12.170> off<00:02:15.640> just

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
can go ahead and just brush it off just

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.520 
can go ahead and just brush it off just
to<00:02:16.760> make<00:02:16.880> sure<00:02:16.910> that<00:02:17.150> I<00:02:17.240> get<00:02:17.480> all<00:02:17.870> that<00:02:18.110> salt

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
to make sure that I get all that salt

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.430 
to make sure that I get all that salt
off<00:02:19.000> so<00:02:20.000> basically<00:02:20.390> on<00:02:20.570> this<00:02:20.810> side<00:02:21.020> is<00:02:21.170> where

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
off so basically on this side is where

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.280 
off so basically on this side is where
the<00:02:21.650> salt<00:02:21.890> picked<00:02:22.459> up<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:23.360> water<00:02:23.600> that<00:02:24.080> also

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
the salt picked up the water that also

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.870 
the salt picked up the water that also
had<00:02:24.560> some<00:02:24.739> of<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:24.890> paint<00:02:25.190> in<00:02:25.400> and<00:02:25.640> it<00:02:25.700> leaves

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
had some of the paint in and it leaves

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.810 
had some of the paint in and it leaves
these<00:02:26.150> sort<00:02:27.110> of<00:02:27.170> rough<00:02:27.530> little<00:02:27.830> I've<00:02:28.640> heard

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
these sort of rough little I've heard

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.110 
these sort of rough little I've heard
them<00:02:28.940> described<00:02:29.780> as<00:02:29.930> starburst<00:02:30.850> patterns<00:02:31.850> or

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
them described as starburst patterns or

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.500 
them described as starburst patterns or
shapes<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:32.780> then<00:02:33.440> these<00:02:34.060> marks<00:02:35.060> over<00:02:35.300> here

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
shapes and then these marks over here

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.380 
shapes and then these marks over here
we're<00:02:35.900> from<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.590> rubbing<00:02:37.459> alcohol<00:02:37.580> some<00:02:38.180> big

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
we're from the rubbing alcohol some big

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.800 
we're from the rubbing alcohol some big
drips<00:02:38.780> and<00:02:38.989> drops<00:02:39.230> of<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:40.070> rubbing<00:02:40.340> alcohol

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
drips and drops of the rubbing alcohol

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.420 
drips and drops of the rubbing alcohol
so<00:02:41.810> some<00:02:42.230> really<00:02:42.350> interesting<00:02:42.739> things<00:02:43.040> that

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
so some really interesting things that

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.370 
so some really interesting things that
happened<00:02:43.910> some<00:02:44.120> very<00:02:44.390> random<00:02:44.780> things<00:02:45.020> but

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
happened some very random things but

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.620 
happened some very random things but
it's<00:02:45.500> an<00:02:45.650> another<00:02:46.340> nice<00:02:46.970> way<00:02:47.239> to<00:02:47.270> start<00:02:48.170> a<00:02:48.410> page
