00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
is a squirrel tree frog or a pilot

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.630 
is a squirrel tree frog or a pilot
squirrel<00:00:35.010> era<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:36.090> believe<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.370> very<00:00:38.370> close

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
squirrel era I believe and a very close

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.869 
squirrel era I believe and a very close
relative<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.809> green<00:00:40.350> tree<00:00:40.559> frog<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:41.550> only

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
relative to the green tree frog the only

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.380 
relative to the green tree frog the only
difference<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:43.530> on<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.460> side<00:00:44.700> right

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
difference is that on the side right

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.350 
difference is that on the side right
here<00:00:45.719> there's<00:00:46.530> not<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.710> white<00:00:46.920> stripe<00:00:47.360> unlike

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
here there's not a white stripe unlike

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.729 
here there's not a white stripe unlike
the<00:00:48.539> green<00:00:48.960> tree<00:00:49.140> frog<00:00:49.170> which<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.620> can

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
the green tree frog which you can

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.180 
the green tree frog which you can
clearly<00:00:50.010> see<00:00:50.280> here<00:00:51.260> but<00:00:52.260> these<00:00:52.680> guys<00:00:52.860> are

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
clearly see here but these guys are

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.209 
clearly see here but these guys are
quite<00:00:53.640> variable<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.210> color<00:00:54.420> come<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:56.129> I'm

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
quite variable in color come on and I'm

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.110 
quite variable in color come on and I'm
not<00:00:56.340> sure<00:00:56.489> how<00:00:56.550> well<00:00:56.730> does<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.910> turn<00:00:57.059> out

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
not sure how well does it turn out

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.670 
not sure how well does it turn out
because<00:00:57.570> it's<00:00:57.780> getting<00:00:57.930> kind<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.260> dark<00:00:58.410> here

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
because it's getting kind of dark here

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.399 
because it's getting kind of dark here
but<00:00:59.449> uh<00:01:00.530> you<00:01:01.530> see<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:01.829> one<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.570> sort<00:01:04.379> of

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
but uh you see this one is a sort of

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.310 
but uh you see this one is a sort of
gray<00:01:04.619> color<00:01:05.630> looks<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.689> little<00:01:06.780> brown<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.290> the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
gray color looks a little brown in the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.920 
gray color looks a little brown in the
camera<00:01:07.740> but<00:01:07.950> these<00:01:08.850> are<00:01:09.000> greenish<00:01:09.240> brown

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
camera but these are greenish brown

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.410 
camera but these are greenish brown
color<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.320> guess<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.619> could<00:01:10.740> say<00:01:10.920> but<00:01:11.420> they're

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
color I guess you could say but they're

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.039 
color I guess you could say but they're
a<00:01:12.450> very<00:01:12.780> beautiful<00:01:12.990> little<00:01:13.470> frog<00:01:14.810> as<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.930> can

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.480 

it's<00:01:20.520> very<00:01:20.670> active<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.330> their<00:01:22.260> call<00:01:22.530> sounds

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
it's very active and their call sounds

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.280 
it's very active and their call sounds
like<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.880> scolding<00:01:24.450> swirl<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:27.140> that's<00:01:28.140> how

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
like a scolding swirl and that's how

like a scolding swirl and that's how
they<00:01:28.350> get<00:01:29.240> the<00:01:30.240> squirrel<00:01:30.930> tree<00:01:31.170> frog<00:01:31.350> name<00:01:31.560> but

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
they get the squirrel tree frog name but

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.760 
they get the squirrel tree frog name but
they<00:01:32.280> what's<00:01:32.640> interesting<00:01:33.080> is<00:01:34.080> they<00:01:34.320> actually

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
have a rain call which sounds more like

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:53.180 
have a rain call which sounds more like
a<00:01:41.550> quacking<00:01:42.150> duck<00:01:50.270> and<00:01:51.270> they<00:01:52.170> have<00:01:52.380> sort<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.070> a

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
a quacking duck and they have sort of a

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.680 
a quacking duck and they have sort of a
breeding<00:01:53.430> call<00:01:53.700> us<00:01:53.820> on<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.180> squirrel<00:01:54.420> I

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
breeding call us on to the squirrel I

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.110 
breeding call us on to the squirrel I
might<00:01:55.080> be<00:01:55.200> like<00:01:55.530> just<00:01:56.070> might<00:01:56.400> be<00:01:56.520> mixed<00:01:56.790> up<00:01:56.880> so

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
might be like just might be mixed up so

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.450 
might be like just might be mixed up so
much<00:01:57.990> work<00:01:58.229> but<00:01:58.260> you<00:01:58.890> see<00:01:59.070> how<00:01:59.220> he's<00:01:59.340> all

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
much work but you see how he's all

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.150 
much work but you see how he's all
puffed<00:01:59.760> up<00:01:59.910> as<00:02:00.900> I'm<00:02:01.260> grabbing<00:02:01.680> around<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.979> waste

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
puffed up as I'm grabbing around a waste

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.480 
puffed up as I'm grabbing around a waste
that's<00:02:02.400> actually<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.760> male<00:02:02.970> defense<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:04.490> and

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
that's actually a male defense so and

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.430 
that's actually a male defense so and
it's<00:02:05.700> also<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:06.000> defense<00:02:06.510> so<00:02:06.780> if<00:02:07.229> something

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
it's also a defense so if something

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.260 
it's also a defense so if something
bigger<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.920> trying<00:02:08.130> to<00:02:08.220> swallow<00:02:08.429> them<00:02:08.610> they'll

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
bigger is trying to swallow them they'll

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.600 
bigger is trying to swallow them they'll
swell<00:02:09.570> right<00:02:09.780> up<00:02:09.929> here's<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.560> second<00:02:11.280> specimen

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
swell right up here's a second specimen

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.630 
swell right up here's a second specimen
and<00:02:11.990> he's<00:02:12.990> more<00:02:13.200> of<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.350> grey<00:02:13.650> green<00:02:14.010> color<00:02:15.140> and

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
I'm not quite sure how well you can see

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.570 
I'm not quite sure how well you can see
that<00:02:19.760> they<00:02:20.760> also<00:02:20.910> have<00:02:21.410> faint<00:02:22.410> spots<00:02:23.010> on<00:02:23.340> the

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
that they also have faint spots on the
