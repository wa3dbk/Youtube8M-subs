and<00:00:50.600> i<00:00:51.600> thought<00:00:51.809> about<00:00:51.929> buying<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.160> 10<00:00:53.370> foot

but I'll have to say I think it's a

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.220 
but I'll have to say I think it's a
proved<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.760> be<00:00:56.789> pretty<00:00:57.000> versatile<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.780> at

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230

scampering<00:02:14.280> and<00:02:14.959> at<00:02:15.959> first<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.379> thought<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:16.590> was

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
scampering and at first I thought it was

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.380 
scampering and at first I thought it was
my<00:02:16.860> imagination<00:02:16.890> because<00:02:17.879> I<00:02:17.940> was<00:02:18.060> really

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
my imagination because I was really

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.540 
my imagination because I was really
tired<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.230> then<00:02:19.530> all<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:20.129> sudden<00:02:20.160> one

tired and then all of a sudden one

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.050 
tired and then all of a sudden one
jumped<00:02:20.910> in<00:02:21.030> my<00:02:21.060> hair<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:21.840> I<00:02:22.770> broke<00:02:23.490> down<00:02:23.520> and

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
jumped in my hair so I broke down and

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.590

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
it in two sizes kinda like Z packs it's

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.580 
it in two sizes kinda like Z packs it's
a<00:03:25.260> little<00:03:25.530> bit<00:03:25.650> thinner<00:03:25.890> than<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.520> Z<00:03:26.700> line<00:03:27.590> and

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
a little bit thinner than the Z line and

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.770 
a little bit thinner than the Z line and
it's<00:03:29.070> got<00:03:29.340> this<00:03:29.610> reflective<00:03:30.450> I<00:03:30.540> know<00:03:30.600> you

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
it's got this reflective I know you

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.180 
it's got this reflective I know you
can't<00:03:30.990> see<00:03:31.200> it<00:03:31.230> because<00:03:31.350> there's<00:03:31.590> no<00:03:31.710> latch<00:03:31.920> on

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
can't see it because there's no latch on

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.250 
can't see it because there's no latch on
and<00:03:32.310> on<00:03:32.460> it's<00:03:32.670> got<00:03:32.790> like<00:03:32.910> a<00:03:32.970> reflective<00:03:33.930> stitch

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
and on it's got like a reflective stitch

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.230 
and on it's got like a reflective stitch
in<00:03:34.440> it<00:03:34.590> so<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.250> line<00:03:35.430> will<00:03:35.460> reflect<00:03:35.940> that

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
in it so the line will reflect that

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.780 
in it so the line will reflect that

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
quite as bright I know it probably it

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.440 
quite as bright I know it probably it

it's not quite as bright as the Z line
in<00:03:44.640> my<00:03:44.670> opinion<00:03:45.120> but<00:03:45.600> it's<00:03:45.780> still<00:03:45.990> as<00:03:46.200> you<00:03:46.290> can

like that it just when I'm trying to do

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.970 
like that it just when I'm trying to do
ha<00:04:52.540> miles<00:04:52.780> it<00:04:53.110> just<00:04:53.290> makes<00:04:53.470> it<00:04:53.590> easier<00:04:53.889> because

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980

ha miles it just makes it easier because
there's<00:04:54.190> an<00:04:54.280> easier<00:04:54.580> setup<00:04:54.940> and<00:04:55.090> teardown<00:04:55.210> I

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
there's an easier setup and teardown I

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.290 
there's an easier setup and teardown I
just<00:04:56.800> put<00:04:56.980> them<00:04:57.040> back<00:04:57.100> on<00:04:57.280> because<00:04:57.880> before<00:04:58.240> I

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
just put them back on because before I

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.770 
just put them back on because before I
was<00:04:58.630> tying<00:04:58.900> knots<00:04:59.230> but<00:05:00.100> I<00:05:00.639> don't<00:05:01.360> know<00:05:01.450> just

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
was tying knots but I don't know just

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.420 
was tying knots but I don't know just
for<00:05:01.900> ease<00:05:02.050> of<00:05:02.230> use<00:05:02.410> I<00:05:02.590> stuck<00:05:02.800> them<00:05:02.889> back<00:05:03.070> on<00:05:03.280> her

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
for ease of use I stuck them back on her

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.680 
for ease of use I stuck them back on her
and<00:05:03.610> that<00:05:03.700> is<00:05:03.850> that's<00:05:04.030> included<00:05:04.570> in<00:05:04.660> the

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
and that is that's included in the

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.360 
and that is that's included in the
weight<00:05:04.900> so<00:05:06.750> nineteen<00:05:07.750> point<00:05:08.020> four<00:05:08.370> ounces

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
weight so nineteen point four ounces

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.270 
weight so nineteen point four ounces
nineteen<00:05:09.820> point<00:05:10.000> four<00:05:10.180> four<00:05:10.419> and<00:05:10.950> I<00:05:11.950> think

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
nineteen point four four and I think

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.450 
nineteen point four four and I think
totals<00:05:12.610> like<00:05:12.760> 1.2<00:05:13.360> one<00:05:13.540> pounds<00:05:14.220> again<00:05:15.220> that

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
totals like 1.2 one pounds again that

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.790 
totals like 1.2 one pounds again that

some of the stuff I just got in and
that's<00:06:33.710> pretty<00:06:33.860> much<00:06:33.980> it

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 
that's pretty much it

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.860 
that's pretty much it
oh<00:06:34.430> by<00:06:34.760> the<00:06:34.790> way<00:06:34.940> those<00:06:35.210> weights<00:06:35.450> include

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:35.870 
oh by the way those weights include

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.240 
oh by the way those weights include
steaks<00:06:36.350> and<00:06:36.940> all<00:06:37.940> that<00:06:38.180> stuff<00:06:38.450> so<00:06:38.750> I<00:06:39.250> do

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:40.250 
steaks and all that stuff so I do

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.230 
steaks and all that stuff so I do
probably<00:06:40.490> carry<00:06:40.820> too<00:06:41.060> many<00:06:41.180> steaks<00:06:41.540> cuz<00:06:41.810> I<00:06:43.240> do

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240

as<00:06:44.990> you<00:06:45.320> can<00:06:45.470> tell<00:06:45.650> this<00:06:45.830> is<00:06:45.980> a<00:06:46.010> custom<00:06:46.460> tarp<00:06:46.730> it

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.030 
as you can tell this is a custom tarp it

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:49.120 
as you can tell this is a custom tarp it
actually<00:06:47.390> has<00:06:47.510> four<00:06:47.750> tiles<00:06:48.020> on<00:06:48.440> each<00:06:48.620> side<00:06:48.860> and

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:49.130 
actually has four tiles on each side and

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:51.030 
actually has four tiles on each side and
I<00:06:49.220> the<00:06:49.670> only<00:06:49.760> reason<00:06:50.060> I<00:06:50.120> did<00:06:50.330> that<00:06:50.360> was<00:06:50.570> just<00:06:50.780> uh

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:51.040 
I the only reason I did that was just uh

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.310 
I the only reason I did that was just uh
some<00:06:52.040> durability<00:06:52.310> in<00:06:52.730> the<00:06:52.850> wind<00:06:53.060> for<00:06:53.990> the<00:06:54.080> for

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:54.320 
some durability in the wind for the for

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.380 
some durability in the wind for the for
the<00:06:54.380> shelter<00:06:54.770> really<00:06:55.400> probably<00:06:55.760> three<00:06:56.150> on

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:56.390 
the shelter really probably three on

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.660 
the shelter really probably three on
each<00:06:56.540> side<00:06:56.780> is<00:06:57.020> really<00:06:57.680> adequate<00:06:58.280> I'm<00:06:58.430> sure

00:06:58.660 --> 00:06:58.670 
each side is really adequate I'm sure

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:02.190 
each side is really adequate I'm sure
but<00:06:59.560> yeah<00:07:00.560> I<00:07:00.620> just<00:07:00.680> went<00:07:01.010> with<00:07:01.100> the<00:07:01.160> four<00:07:01.430> just
