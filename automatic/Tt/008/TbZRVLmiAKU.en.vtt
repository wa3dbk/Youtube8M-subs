this<00:00:35.399> one<00:00:35.640> it's<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.969> simplified<00:00:36.510> version<00:00:37.010> from

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
this one it's a simplified version from

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.600 
this one it's a simplified version from
the<00:00:38.640> other<00:00:38.790> base<00:00:39.059> or<00:00:39.450> their<00:00:39.600> other<00:00:39.780> guitars<00:00:40.610> so

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
the other base or their other guitars so

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.600 
the other base or their other guitars so
it's<00:00:41.790> got<00:00:42.140> one<00:00:43.140> control<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.860> there<00:00:44.070> which<00:00:44.430> is

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
it's got one control in there which is

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.200 
it's got one control in there which is
basically<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.149> mid-range<00:00:45.600> boost<00:00:46.219> you<00:00:47.219> have<00:00:47.489> on

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
basically a mid-range boost you have on

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.970 
basically a mid-range boost you have on
the<00:00:48.390> front<00:00:48.600> these<00:00:48.989> three<00:00:49.289> controls<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.950> have

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
the front these three controls you have

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.500 
the front these three controls you have
your<00:00:50.160> volume<00:00:50.809> irregular<00:00:51.809> tone<00:00:52.670> and<00:00:53.670> then<00:00:54.329> this

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
your volume irregular tone and then this

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.479 
your volume irregular tone and then this
is<00:00:54.719> your<00:00:54.840> Ridge<00:00:55.020> range<00:00:55.610> control<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.960> a

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
is your Ridge range control and a

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:01.849 
is your Ridge range control and a
push-pull<00:00:59.489> pot<00:01:00.199> which<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.469> your<00:01:01.649> mid-range

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
push-pull pot which is your mid-range

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:09.230 
push-pull pot which is your mid-range
boost<00:01:04.309> it's<00:01:05.309> good<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.519> truss<00:01:06.030> rod<00:01:08.060> you<00:01:09.060> just

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
boost it's good a truss rod you just

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
it'll sound on this video but hopefully

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.120 
it'll sound on this video but hopefully
it'll<00:02:10.709> give<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:10.979> an<00:02:11.069> idea<00:02:11.129> of<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.610> different

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
it'll give you an idea of the different

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.880 
it'll give you an idea of the different
as<00:02:12.820> it<00:02:13.000> can<00:02:13.180> do<00:02:13.360> at<00:02:13.570> least<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:15.870> yeah<00:02:16.870> so<00:02:17.470> here<00:02:17.740> is

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
as it can do at least so yeah so here is

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.080 
as it can do at least so yeah so here is
without<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:18.810> pushpot<00:02:19.810> pull<00:02:20.350> and<00:02:20.950> just<00:02:21.090> kind

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
without the pushpot pull and just kind

00:02:22.090 --> 00:05:07.689 
without the pushpot pull and just kind
of<00:02:22.150> a<00:02:22.740> middle

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:07.699 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:13.010 

so<00:05:08.699> that's<00:05:08.910> always<00:05:09.270> thin<00:05:09.570> they<00:05:10.350> upset<00:05:10.889> at<00:05:12.020> the

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
so that's always thin they upset at the

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:21.650 
so that's always thin they upset at the
EQ<00:05:13.470> is<00:05:13.590> all<00:05:13.770> centered<00:05:14.700> out<00:05:16.639> yeah<00:05:19.400> so<00:05:20.479> so<00:05:21.479> it's<00:05:21.630> a

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
EQ is all centered out yeah so so it's a

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.840 
EQ is all centered out yeah so so it's a
very<00:05:21.840> versatile<00:05:22.800> bass<00:05:23.070> because<00:05:23.520> of<00:05:23.700> that

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
very versatile bass because of that

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.050 
very versatile bass because of that
