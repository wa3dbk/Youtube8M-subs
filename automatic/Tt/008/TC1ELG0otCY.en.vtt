00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:03.609
 what 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.460
 hello that welcome to easy cooking my 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.930
 name is andy and today I am going to 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.880
 teach how to make some delicious donuts 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.760
 integrals that are perfect for 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.500
 diet are delicious and very nutritious the 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.210
 Preparation and cooking time 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.550
 combined is less than 30 minutes 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.170
 remember the ingredients list is in 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.699
 the description of this video and also 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.699
 in my blog where you can print the 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:30.189
 full recipe let's preheat the 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.920
 oven at 350 degrees fahrenheit that are 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.180
 180 degrees centigrade in a bowl 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.070
 big let's mix all the 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.050
 dry ingredients but first the 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.180
 we are going to sift so that the mixture does not 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.400
 we are going to be very lumps to so 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.589
 let's start with the flours remember 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.540
 I'm using wholemeal flour and 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.790
 Oatmeal is half a cup of each 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.729
 one and the oatmeal only is 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.080
 it makes grinding whole oats 

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:55.120
 approximately three or four 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.250
 minutes in the blender until we 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.720
 is a mixture made completely 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.449
 powder 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.489
 that's the oatmeal to the mixture of 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:07.520
 the flours are also going to sift 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.340
 the nutmeg the baking powder and 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.229
 the sugar 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.429
 then we are going to mix all these 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.950
 ingredients so that they are well 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:17.079
 combined 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.460
 and since everything is well mixed now 

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:20.560
 we are going to add coconut oil 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.840
 for this recipe you can use 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.759
 butter or vegetable shortening instead 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.170
 of coconut oil but remember the 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.240
 coconut oil is healthier and 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.729
 we want these areas to be a little bit 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.860
 more nutritious to not feel so 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.960
 guilty of eating them so they 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.880
 I recommend the coconut oil is the best 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.409
 option then to the mixture of the 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.539
 flours we are going to add oil 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.799
 coconut and we are going to crumble it in the 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.829
 flour so that we are left with a 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.179
 texture similar to bread crumbs 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.220
 also if they are trying to bring a 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:50.170
 healthier diet the coconut oil goes 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.450
 to be your great ally you have an envelope 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.159
 incredible and it's also great for 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.890
 bake and also to cook any 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.959
 type of saucer plus the oil 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.909
 of coconut is great to accelerate the 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:03.399
 metabolism so it helps us burn 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.380
 fat more quickly they also say that 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.110
 It is good to fight infections and 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.729
 reduce appetite and cholesterol that 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.530
 yes it's a little expensive but really 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.450
 it 's worth investing a little more in 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.880
 our health , I recommend them 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.680
 very much after this also you 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.000
 let's add the yogurt and let's 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.980
 mix again so you follow us 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.810
 leaving that texture similar to the 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.390
 glances 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.920
 since the coconut and the yogurt are well 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.800
 combined with the mixture of flours 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.530
 now let's reserve the pro moment and 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.960
 let's beat the milk with the egg and the 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.780
 vanilla extract 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.900
 I'm using a quarter cup + 1 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.120
 spoonful of milk a large egg and 2 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.560
 teaspoons of vanilla extract and 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.720
 we are going to stir them very well so that 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.250
 everything is well beaten and after 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.440
 that the liquid ingredients are well 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.040
 shakes we are going to add them on the 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.480
 mix of dry ingredients 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.890
 and we are going to stir all the 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.950
 ingredients so that they fit well 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.989
 combined in a soft dough do not mix 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.730
 more than just want to incorporate the 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.040
 dry ingredients to the ingredients 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.620
 liquids but without mixing the others 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.620
 As you can see they will have a mix 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.599
 pretty thick so this is perfect 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.909
 is the consistency you are looking for 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.890
 but if you feel that you are too 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:20.519
 thick can add a spoonful 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.519
 more milk 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.849
 since the mix is ​​ready now what 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.049
 let's empty in our mold first 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.269
 I'll put it in a bag of 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:32.489
 plastic or in a pastry bag for 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.959
 make it easier to fill the mold and 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.439
 mold is sprayed with a little bit of 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.439
 spray oil 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.819
 and I'm going to fill the mold almost to the 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.579
 butt I'm leaving approximately one 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.870
 little more than half a centimeter before 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.849
 fill it 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.620
 since the mold is full they are going to 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:53.110
 hit it a little on the surface 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.220
 so that the mixture is well seated 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.220
 in the bottom of the mold 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.980
 and now we are going to bake them in a 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.349
 350 degree preheated oven 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.720
 fahrenheit that are 180 degrees 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:08.360
 centigrade and we're going to bake them for 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.880
 approximately 8 or 10 minutes or 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.950
 until they are well cooked 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.690
 They will know that they are ready when they insert 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.060
 on a toothpick and it comes out 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.100
 with a little bit of bread crumbs since 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.260
 the donuts come out of the oven handle that 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.500
 cool completely before glacier 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.500
 the 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.849
 for the icing I'm just 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:30.770
 using melted chocolate and I'm 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:33.199
 using dark chocolate because it is 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.659
 more nutritious and healthy than 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:37.039
 milk chocolate but can use 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:38.960
 any kind of chocolate that you 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:41.449
 want a little chocolate never has 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.889
 killed anyone so they can use 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:45.199
 any kind of chocolate that you 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:48.110
 want to melt the chocolate in the 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:50.270
 microwave and I'm just wetting the 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.250
 surface of the donut with chocolate 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.050
 melted for a couple of seconds and 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.479
 then the new little bit to take it 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.009
 the excess of chocolate and the return to 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:01.090
 grate so that it is finished cooling 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:01.090
 the chocolate a little 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.500
 Then they can decorate the areas with a 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.449
 little bit of sparks of colors or with a 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.189
 little grated coconut and that's all 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:13.009
 indeed, these areas remain 

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:15.969
 very rich I hope you like this
