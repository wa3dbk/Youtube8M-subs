00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.009 
approach to get my glove game ready my
approach<00:00:28.920> probably<00:00:29.369> would<00:00:29.490> be<00:00:29.750> it<00:00:30.750> really

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
approach probably would be it really

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.150 
approach probably would be it really
just<00:00:31.289> catching<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.650> ball<00:00:31.800> just<00:00:31.980> playing

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
just catching the ball just playing

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.639 
just catching the ball just playing
catch<00:00:32.340> with<00:00:32.369> as<00:00:32.550> much<00:00:32.700> as<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:32.940> could<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.649> you

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
catch with as much as I could and you

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.459 
catch with as much as I could and you
know<00:00:35.190> using<00:00:35.910> it<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.210> keep<00:00:36.870> tightening<00:00:37.200> it

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
know using it and keep tightening it

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.930 
know using it and keep tightening it
because<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:37.980> gets<00:00:38.100> loose<00:00:38.340> when<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.700> comes<00:00:38.850> from

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
because it gets loose when it comes from

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.819
