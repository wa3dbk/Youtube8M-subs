 I think let's challenge here berry hard by say trying to learn the knowledge of the Grim Reaper 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:07.530
 By the way, all but normal hard jelly hard all I've been cleared to

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.760
 But this time 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.380
 For example , I think I will try a very hard challenge 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.729
 Was 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:28.190
 By the way, the best clear time is 1 minute 20 seconds when using reverse 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:32.600
 Well first look at this one minute is it this time 20 seconds two bodies eyes of so with two a 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:37.970
 I'm looking forward to playing time 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:42.260
 Well it is a place of whether the difference between how much a close combat influence Rie is 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:46.010
 This time I will try to put the attack and conversion 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.180
 Anybody is fine about the partner 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.080

 Don't get married 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.550
 There is a friend point 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:02.810
 Though it is decided to max by 1500 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.990
 I will go ok 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.860
 The purpose is not yet to come 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.860
 Let's save 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.750

 We will inhale Innovation without the Edo character change 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.010
 It's more straight than something to clean up 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.350
 Not to be 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.410
 I want to go while helping 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:32.060
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:34.900
 If you understand that you can make it go down products, it's a major strike down major 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.900
 I think you 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.629
 There is a pressure 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.220
 Is it part 5? 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.650
 The console was a bit surprised 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.160
 Hmm 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.160
 If you break this angle species 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.490
 I'm out with a fan 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.700
 wh 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.510
 place 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.510
 It is the boss 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:24.940
 immediately 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.940
 I'm going to use spring breeze 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.810
 Thank you 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.810
 rar 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.480
 Not 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.500
 I was told I thought it would be good for the seller to sell completely 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.900
 Mystery of 0 Time Warner and Vision 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.989
 dele 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.270
 Pig 22 Seconds Mustang Colonel Ramon Art 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:46.640
 Ne 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.470
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.770
 Also items about this gar 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:57.790
 Return to the home in the fact that the is get 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:04:00.950
 By Well that midnight sun is 100 off now currently a Saturn fan level 65 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:05.150
 Would you like to take care of the status 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:09.090
 It is where the fact that how much such whether a nail cane Kuereberu 100 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.670
 Crew in physical strength 615 ho Ikkiri's 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.640
 It's important is here 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.069
 Is I think a place different from the cans say 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:20.019
 It will be 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:23.080
 I was wondering if the difference would be the difference here, though 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:28.020
 There are also places where only mermaids are used 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:30.590
 It would be better to use the melee constant 3 if it was a little 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.590
 Well 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.980
 There is a considerable risk but it will be close 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:42.310
 However 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:44.790
 It is not a ward or a ward nor a control that has high attack power at a cheap price. 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:50.870
 You should go in the direction of using it 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:54.680
 Hey, do you thing that I think we can be a little short gray tax Maybe 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:05:01.910
 At present 200 schools 11 this is the present condition 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:08.220
 Well I'm the higher of reasons, not been of your post-mortem guy and a base that came out new administration of Uryu Ishida 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:10.030
 It is said that the attack is probably the best among the stars in the average value top level or restoration 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.840
 The heart is the ne 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:19.330
 Let's look at the sofa 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:23.770
 It is that already attack power 264 there is when it comes to 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:25.750
 It's another state at level 65, so the conscience is still a customer 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:30.770
 than df the guy is away 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:34.300
 I think that I will not do it first when I'm at the top when I'm putting items 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.300
 I think it's kind of hard to do 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:46.200
 There is such a feeling and it is not the case that all the attacks are buried for strengthening 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.740
 It's just Tteyuu mountain two-way This is it and is still in the four rise 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.009
 Hmm 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:54.310
 I will do my best, this will be max 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:59.500
 If it becomes nut nut max max 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:02.449
 It was supposed to be loose and high with 600 or more 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.610
 Well when I put this back, it will be a little more 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:13.650
 And how much the difference is coming out of 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:21.330
 I think that this video I'm going to experiment is such a close match in the Meiji period 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:23.350
 Your viewing was there a video of feeling say so say that the main the capture pom poms 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.460
 Thank you very much 

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.460
 Is more than 's it
