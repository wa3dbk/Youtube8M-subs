00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.899
 and so today we all greetings 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.330
 reflash device by 5300 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.940
 and here we are in front of you links to the firmware 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.560
 and the driver, so I discovered you showed 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.180
 they need to be unpacked on the desktop 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.160
 so here I have already downloaded 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.789
 desktop here is the firmware folder and 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.850
 driver 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:28.019
 So we go to my computer control 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.240
 gram device manager and so here you are 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.080
 see my phone now on the screen in 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.680
 right side 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.860
 I hold down the power key and volume 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.440
 down so 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:45.310
 Here we seemed prestige and logo 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:49.230
 he should hang you this how are you 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:53.010
 convinced sean we are stuck we connect 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.090
 our yusbi cord when we swing beauty by 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.890
 computer cable 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.090
 new device he should you have 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.820
 be called android 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.550
 we click on it and click update 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.589
 driver and choose the driver what we have 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.740
 on the desktop 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.719
 so here I have it already selected I click 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.259
 Further, we see the installation with us 

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:17.490
 ended successfully so is the message 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:20.219
 looking for close as we see here is the installation 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.179
 android to the end goes all driver 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:26.320
 installed and now we will run 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:29.320
 our firmware 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.909
 but let's move on how we will run us 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:36.510
 need to disconnect and usb cable 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.790
 so I turned it off 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:42.390
 and run the file as you called 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:47.000
 became windows systems so we have it 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:50.420
 launched wait and connect 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.400
 Installation we will have a long but the video I 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.080
 sped up 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:02.420
 video we send system files to 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:05.210
 samp our device is sent here you see 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.130
 our screen turned white got dots 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.950
 okay it should be so 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:20.330
 so we see the system is already flashing 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:24.910
 so far the first stage is successful but 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.910
 should take at least 15 minutes 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.810
 You know why repaint phones 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.430
 and the soul does not start to hang 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.490
 or you like when you turn on the phone 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.440
 you have it or does not disconnect 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.810
 the problem of this model is because 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.330
 install then delete or you have 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.100
 flash drives turn it on here you have it exactly 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.620
 should and will start or freeze on 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:54.070
 screensaver for example there is a screensaver on the vital 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.680
 navigators who give 90 days he 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.110
 freezes do resetting this is not 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:03.090
 helps or helps but you can't 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:06.100
 him go through the first stage 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:10.470
 select language accept license install 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:13.720
 tattoo time and here on this all crashes 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:20.200
 So here we already have a flashing 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:22.270
 the end of everything and the phone moved 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.970
 disconnected and he himself should now 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.840
 turn on 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:31.200
 All I closed the folder with the firmware you see 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.800
 we run successfully and see what 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.800
 will be next 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.420
 I should have a splash screen 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:50.560
 and so appears us screensavers prestige 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:59.710

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.930

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:15.199
 version we have on the computer appeared 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:17.639

 the phone itself without the help of a computer 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.990
 So here we have almost all applications 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.650

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.650
