hey guys it's a big dude here and
welcome<00:00:02.520> to<00:00:02.730> my<00:00:03.950> automatic<00:00:04.950> sheep<00:00:05.160> farm<00:00:05.460> this

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
welcome to my automatic sheep farm this

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.900 
welcome to my automatic sheep farm this
is<00:00:06.060> very<00:00:06.569> similar<00:00:06.960> to<00:00:07.350> my<00:00:07.470> cow<00:00:07.680> farm<00:00:07.980> and<00:00:08.610> I<00:00:08.700> did

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
is very similar to my cow farm and I did

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.430 
is very similar to my cow farm and I did
my<00:00:09.179> testing<00:00:09.540> world<00:00:09.719> here<00:00:11.210> there's<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.719> drop

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
my testing world here there's the drop

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.289 
my testing world here there's the drop
system<00:00:13.980> it<00:00:14.219> goes<00:00:14.340> underneath<00:00:14.700> that<00:00:15.000> goes<00:00:15.120> back

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
system it goes underneath that goes back

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.810 
system it goes underneath that goes back
up<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.719> returns<00:00:16.139> you<00:00:16.379> but<00:00:17.250> with<00:00:17.490> this

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
up and it returns you but with this

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.990 
up and it returns you but with this
sheep<00:00:18.119> farm<00:00:18.539> it's<00:00:19.380> much<00:00:20.160> more<00:00:20.369> compact<00:00:20.789> than

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
sheep farm it's much more compact than

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.120 
sheep farm it's much more compact than
that<00:00:21.150> you<00:00:21.449> see<00:00:21.630> has<00:00:21.750> four<00:00:22.289> ways<00:00:22.500> down<00:00:22.830> this

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
that you see has four ways down this

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.720 
that you see has four ways down this
only<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.580> two<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:25.340> well<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.430> don't<00:00:26.609> to

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
only is the two and well I don't to

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.089 
only is the two and well I don't to
butcher<00:00:27.000> them<00:00:27.150> most<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.349> mechanism<00:00:28.920> is

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
butcher them most of the mechanism is

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.669 
butcher them most of the mechanism is
right<00:00:29.429> here<00:00:29.939> when<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.630> drop<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:30.960> down<00:00:31.349> they'll

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
right here when I drop it down they'll

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.530 
right here when I drop it down they'll
go<00:00:31.830> into<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.160> shearing<00:00:32.610> area<00:00:32.910> where<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.390> can

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
go into the shearing area where you can

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.729 
go into the shearing area where you can
just<00:00:33.570> share<00:00:33.870> them<00:00:34.020> in<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.170> water<00:00:34.350> will<00:00:34.530> push

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
just share them in the water will push

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.660 
just share them in the water will push
you<00:00:34.860> this<00:00:35.040> way<00:00:35.219> but<00:00:35.670> when<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.820> flip<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.270> lever

you this way but when I flip this lever

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.369 
you this way but when I flip this lever
the<00:00:38.670> water<00:00:38.940> will<00:00:39.210> stop<00:00:39.570> here<00:00:39.840> I'll<00:00:39.989> open<00:00:40.290> up

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
the water will stop here I'll open up

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.139 
the water will stop here I'll open up
that<00:00:40.590> block<00:00:40.860> there<00:00:41.160> allowing<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.730> Sheep<00:00:41.940> to

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
that block there allowing the Sheep to

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.240 
that block there allowing the Sheep to
go<00:00:42.239> all<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.600> way<00:00:42.629> back<00:00:42.870> around<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.890> did<00:00:44.040> this

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
go all the way back around you did this

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.229 
go all the way back around you did this
after<00:00:44.640> you<00:00:44.730> have<00:00:44.820> sheared<00:00:45.030> them<00:00:46.579> because<00:00:47.579> when

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
after you have sheared them because when

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.790 
after you have sheared them because when
you're<00:00:48.390> sharing<00:00:48.539> them<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.170> water<00:00:49.379> let's<00:00:49.590> push

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
you're sharing them the water let's push

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.830 
you're sharing them the water let's push
the<00:00:49.980> wall<00:00:50.129> right<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.760> it's<00:00:51.239> stand<00:00:51.570> here

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
the wall right to you it's stand here

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.270 
the wall right to you it's stand here
share<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.289> Sheep<00:00:53.090> also<00:00:54.090> when<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:55.129> when<00:00:56.129> this

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
share the Sheep also when this when this

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.880 
share the Sheep also when this when this
block<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:56.730> open<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.960> can't<00:00:59.180> drop<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.359> Sheep

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
block is open you can't drop the Sheep

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.349 
block is open you can't drop the Sheep
that's<00:01:01.890> because<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.820> don't<00:01:02.879> want<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.149> see<00:01:03.239> it

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
that's because you don't want to see it

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.759 
that's because you don't want to see it
just<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.629> get<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:03.960> on<00:01:04.140> even<00:01:04.379> though<00:01:04.589> there

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
just to get to you on even though there

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.210 
just to get to you on even though there
weren't<00:01:05.250> sheared<00:01:05.990> this<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.229> caused<00:01:07.500> by<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.950> NAND

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
weren't sheared this is caused by a NAND

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.270 
weren't sheared this is caused by a NAND
gate<00:01:09.409> if<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.560> don't<00:01:10.740> know<00:01:10.830> what<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.979> NAND<00:01:11.189> gate

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
gate if you don't know what a NAND gate

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.120 
gate if you don't know what a NAND gate
is<00:01:11.640> there<00:01:12.479> needs<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.780> be<00:01:12.900> two<00:01:13.170> currents<00:01:13.650> going

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
is there needs to be two currents going

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.030 
is there needs to be two currents going
in<00:01:14.430> from<00:01:14.729> redstone<00:01:15.210> which<00:01:16.170> turns<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.770> book

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
in from redstone which turns this book

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.760 
in from redstone which turns this book
which<00:01:17.549> turns<00:01:17.939> both<00:01:18.180> these<00:01:18.360> torches<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:18.960> or<00:01:19.590> off

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
which turns both these torches on or off

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.670 
which turns both these torches on or off
which<00:01:20.729> turns<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.360> torch<00:01:21.689> on<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.350> it's<00:01:22.470> kind

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
which turns this torch on so it's kind

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.580 
which turns this torch on so it's kind
of<00:01:22.740> like<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.610> need<00:01:23.790> two<00:01:24.330> inputs<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.290> make<00:01:25.320> an

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
of like you need two inputs to make an

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.190 
of like you need two inputs to make an
output<00:01:26.180> and<00:01:27.180> then<00:01:28.049> after<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.369> just

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
output and then after that it just

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.719 
output and then after that it just
releases<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.500> Pistons<00:01:32.210> dropping<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.360> Sheep

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
releases the Pistons dropping the Sheep

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.200 
releases the Pistons dropping the Sheep
so<00:01:35.729> we<00:01:36.420> will<00:01:36.920> try<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.040> with<00:01:38.430> them<00:01:38.579> as<00:01:38.820> you

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
so we will try this with them as you

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.340 
so we will try this with them as you
just<00:01:39.420> saw<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:40.229> won't<00:01:40.409> work<00:01:41.659> so<00:01:42.659> what's<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
just saw that won't work so what's the

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.920 
just saw that won't work so what's the
once<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.770> block<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.189> closed<00:01:44.520> they<00:01:45.450> drop<00:01:45.720> our

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
once that block is closed they drop our

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.060 
once that block is closed they drop our
sheet<00:01:46.250> and<00:01:47.250> they'll<00:01:47.490> just<00:01:47.549> flow<00:01:47.939> down<00:01:49.070> right

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
sheet and they'll just flow down right

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.700 
sheet and they'll just flow down right
into<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.780> that<00:01:51.780> area<00:01:53.149> view<00:01:54.149> them

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
into the that area view them

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.280 
into the that area view them
there<00:01:56.310> we<00:01:56.430> go<00:01:56.580> for<00:01:56.790> their<00:01:56.910> all<00:01:57.060> shared<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.690> wait

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
there we go for their all shared a wait

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.480 
there we go for their all shared a wait
tour<00:01:58.500> until<00:01:59.370> Google<00:01:59.820> gets<00:02:00.120> to<00:02:00.330> us<00:02:01.220> don't<00:02:02.220> see

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
tour until Google gets to us don't see

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.720 
tour until Google gets to us don't see
anything<00:02:02.670> that's<00:02:03.630> in<00:02:03.870> your<00:02:03.900> wall

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
anything that's in your wall

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.150 
anything that's in your wall
only<00:02:05.730> five<00:02:05.910> wall<00:02:06.180> it's<00:02:06.480> not<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.780> much<00:02:06.990> but<00:02:07.350> we

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
only five wall it's not that much but we

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.080 
only five wall it's not that much but we
share<00:02:08.369> them<00:02:08.550> as<00:02:08.640> shares<00:02:08.899> and<00:02:09.899> then<00:02:10.590> we<00:02:10.770> will

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
share them as shares and then we will

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.890 
share them as shares and then we will
close<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.770> close<00:02:13.770> and<00:02:14.190> these<00:02:15.150> Pistons<00:02:15.570> block

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
close that close and these Pistons block

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.170 
close that close and these Pistons block
it<00:02:16.080> so<00:02:16.110> their<00:02:16.500> water<00:02:16.770> current<00:02:17.160> can<00:02:17.550> only<00:02:17.790> head

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
it so their water current can only head

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.290 
it so their water current can only head
this<00:02:18.330> way<00:02:18.830> this<00:02:19.830> is<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:20.100> very<00:02:20.700> good<00:02:21.000> thing

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
this way this is a very good thing

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.250 
this way this is a very good thing
because<00:02:21.780> without<00:02:22.410> these<00:02:22.740> pistons<00:02:23.250> here<00:02:24.260> the

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
because without these pistons here the

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.170 
because without these pistons here the
sheep<00:02:25.800> would<00:02:25.950> get<00:02:26.130> stuck<00:02:26.430> up<00:02:26.670> against<00:02:26.970> these

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
sheep would get stuck up against these

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.530 
sheep would get stuck up against these
slabs<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.780> will<00:02:27.900> not<00:02:28.230> move<00:02:28.440> that<00:02:28.709> way<00:02:29.540> the

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
slabs and will not move that way the

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.980 
slabs and will not move that way the
Pistons<00:02:30.959> are<00:02:31.200> just<00:02:31.440> powered<00:02:31.800> by<00:02:32.540> this<00:02:33.540> little

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
Pistons are just powered by this little

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.860 
Pistons are just powered by this little
piece<00:02:34.110> of<00:02:34.230> redstone<00:02:34.350> here<00:02:34.580> going<00:02:35.580> into<00:02:35.870> this

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
piece of redstone here going into this

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.300 
piece of redstone here going into this
inverter<00:02:37.440> like<00:02:37.830> vertical<00:02:38.700> inverter<00:02:40.310> which

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
inverter like vertical inverter which

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.640 
inverter like vertical inverter which
head<00:02:41.640> out<00:02:41.820> for<00:02:42.150> this<00:02:42.209> button<00:02:42.510> which<00:02:43.260> goes<00:02:43.500> to

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
head out for this button which goes to

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.040 
head out for this button which goes to
here<00:02:43.890> but<00:02:44.430> they<00:02:44.640> pissed<00:02:44.910> in<00:02:45.120> this<00:02:45.630> main

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
here but they pissed in this main

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.530 
here but they pissed in this main
inverter<00:02:46.410> goes<00:02:46.920> to<00:02:47.040> here<00:02:47.250> when<00:02:47.970> this<00:02:48.150> is<00:02:48.300> off

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
inverter goes to here when this is off

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.740 
inverter goes to here when this is off
the<00:02:49.470> redstone<00:02:49.920> goes<00:02:50.070> underground<00:02:50.750> and

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
the redstone goes underground and

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.690 
the redstone goes underground and
there's<00:02:52.500> an<00:02:52.590> inverter<00:02:52.890> also<00:02:53.310> underground

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
there's an inverter also underground

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.440 
there's an inverter also underground
which<00:02:54.000> causes<00:02:54.360> these<00:02:54.450> business<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:54.930> go<00:02:55.050> up<00:02:56.450> so

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
which causes these business to go up so

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.770 
which causes these business to go up so
since<00:02:58.140> all<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.709> sheep<00:02:58.890> are<00:02:59.040> by<00:02:59.269> we<00:03:00.269> can<00:03:00.480> just

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
since all the sheep are by we can just

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.650 
since all the sheep are by we can just
go<00:03:01.290> like<00:03:01.320> that<00:03:01.970> start<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.060> water<00:03:03.209> up<00:03:03.390> again

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
go like that start the water up again

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.120 
go like that start the water up again
this<00:03:04.080> sheep<00:03:04.320> will<00:03:04.560> need<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.800> wait<00:03:04.950> until

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
this sheep will need to wait until

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.210 
this sheep will need to wait until
another<00:03:05.670> sheep<00:03:05.880> comes<00:03:06.120> by<00:03:06.330> but<00:03:07.170> sometimes<00:03:08.070> it

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
another sheep comes by but sometimes it

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.000 
another sheep comes by but sometimes it
just<00:03:08.310> needs<00:03:08.519> an<00:03:08.610> extra<00:03:08.820> little<00:03:08.940> push<00:03:10.010> you

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
just needs an extra little push you

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.979 
just needs an extra little push you
could<00:03:11.190> add<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:11.400> pushing<00:03:11.790> mechanism<00:03:12.360> but<00:03:12.690> I

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
could add a pushing mechanism but I

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.770 
could add a pushing mechanism but I
don't<00:03:13.769> and<00:03:13.950> want<00:03:14.220> to<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:15.120> these<00:03:15.330> sheep<00:03:15.570> will

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
don't and want to and these sheep will

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.310 
don't and want to and these sheep will
slowly<00:03:16.110> flow<00:03:16.500> back<00:03:16.739> up<00:03:17.300> and<00:03:18.300> go<00:03:18.720> back<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:19.080> here

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
slowly flow back up and go back to here

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.670 
slowly flow back up and go back to here
where<00:03:19.950> they<00:03:20.100> will<00:03:20.250> eat<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.640> grass<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:21.680> turn

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
where they will eat the grass and turn

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.360 
where they will eat the grass and turn
into<00:03:23.040> new<00:03:23.580> fully<00:03:23.940> blue<00:03:24.269> sheep<00:03:24.980> so<00:03:25.980> this<00:03:26.130> is<00:03:26.250> my

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
into new fully blue sheep so this is my

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.080 
into new fully blue sheep so this is my
sheep<00:03:26.610> automatic<00:03:27.420> farm<00:03:28.610> this<00:03:29.610> is<00:03:29.730> only<00:03:29.880> really

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
sheep automatic farm this is only really

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.670
