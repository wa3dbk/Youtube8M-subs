The King and the Fortune Teller

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.130
Your Majesty.

00:00:21.235 --> 00:00:25.500
This man is the famed fortune teller from the rumors.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.715
Oh, is that right?

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.100
So you're the fortune teller that everyone is talking about?

00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:35.075
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.695
The name is Hong Kye-Gwan.

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:41.780
The reason I called you here is because

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.845
I have heard amazing stories about your fortune telling.

00:00:45.975 --> 00:00:47.685
I am a man great curiousty,

00:00:47.955 --> 00:00:51.275
and thus wanted to see your abilities with my own eyes.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.200
Now, can you show this mystical talent of yours to me, too?

00:00:56.665 --> 00:00:58.390
Absolutely, Your Majesty.

00:00:58.485 --> 00:01:01.920
I shall not disappoint you.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.110
Very well. Shall we begin then?

00:01:25.755 --> 00:01:28.615
Your Majesty. What is this?

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.405
It is a chest.

00:01:31.075 --> 00:01:34.110
I have put something in this chest.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.950
With your extraordinary abilities,

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.950
tell me what is in this chest.

00:01:46.975 --> 00:01:48.230
What is wrong?

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.005
I am waiting for the answer.

00:01:53.645 --> 00:01:56.270
There are three rats inside.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.260
Are you certain?

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.915
Absolutely, Your Majesty.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.195
How dare you!

00:02:05.975 --> 00:02:07.155
Just who do you think

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.715
you are trying to fool?

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:12.025
Oh, no, Your Majesty!

00:02:12.195 --> 00:02:14.565
I'm certain of this.
-Silence!

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.700
How long did you think your trickery would last?

00:02:19.335 --> 00:02:20.775
Open the chest.

00:02:30.665 --> 00:02:32.070
Your Majesty...

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.790
I don't understand...

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.445
Guards! Take this guy away and execute him!

00:02:38.445 --> 00:02:39.665
Your Majesty!

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.350
Please listen to me!

00:02:41.535 --> 00:02:44.075
This is not a trickery.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.915
Please show me mercy!

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:47.785
Your Majesty!

00:02:48.235 --> 00:02:49.900
Show mercy, please!

00:02:50.095 --> 00:02:53.060
Your Majesty, please!

00:03:20.885 --> 00:03:23.600
Um, sir?

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.460
Can we delay the execution a bit?

00:03:42.315 --> 00:03:45.085
There are three rats inside.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.160
This is not a trickery, Your Majesty!

00:03:49.335 --> 00:03:52.485
It's amazing that he knew it was a rat,

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.075
but why did he say three?

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.415
Of course!

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.865
What if the rat was bearing pups?

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.940
Bring out the chest again!

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.805
Stop! Stop the execution!
