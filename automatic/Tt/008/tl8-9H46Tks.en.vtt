00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
see if that helps that worked for a

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.209 
see if that helps that worked for a
while<00:01:57.960> as<00:01:58.170> well<00:01:58.380> then<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.770> didn't<00:01:59.070> work

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
day you did the body so it wasn't that

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:11.990 
day you did the body so it wasn't that
many<00:04:10.680> sets<00:04:11.010> so<00:04:11.160> three<00:04:11.340> times<00:04:11.520> a<00:04:11.610> week<00:04:11.640> worked

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
many sets so three times a week worked

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.660 
many sets so three times a week worked
for<00:04:12.300> that<00:04:12.420> time<00:04:12.950> you<00:04:13.950> got<00:04:14.100> to<00:04:14.220> find<00:04:14.400> your<00:04:14.520> niche

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
for that time you got to find your niche

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:15.979 
for that time you got to find your niche
you<00:04:14.850> got<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.060> find<00:04:15.180> what<00:04:15.330> works<00:04:15.480> for<00:04:15.660> you<00:04:15.750> but

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989
