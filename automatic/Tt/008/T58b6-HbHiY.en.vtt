00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:10.519
 Old gta5 I can not believe I'm going to play 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:10.519
 gta5 a will not leave this andré 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.960
 so what's up those plans 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.230
 I caught you guys, it's not like that with the 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:29.050
 gta sandra anyone the goal is 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.820
 show you a new gta motto 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.850
 san andreas 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:37.540
 ie they get some stuff from gd 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:41.590
 subject and put to sandra 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:44.320
 for those who do not have a very good computer 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.630
 just like mine 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.680
 The idea is more or less how it is that 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.640
 and it is if the transmission goes well everything is 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.230
 also too 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.990
 but the first thing he can already 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.420
 to notice in the visual there the map 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:02.050
 you can see that the blood bar 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.780
 tallin down and this vest also 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.299
 it was on top and showed the weapons in 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.840
 nick of time does not show other 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:13.180
 Curiosity you squeeze and out of the car 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.960
 now where do you press the 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.200
 tab 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.700
 the show now gta shows him 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.010
 choose another character they do not have 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.800
 another character I came and shows 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.409
 respect to lung capacity 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:31.780
 that's one of those issues where I had 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:32.530
 in that it is still less than 10 andré with 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.320
 a lot of stuff 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:41.080
 It's a old thing, there it looks. 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.580
 gta5 the things I noticed have 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.229
 much more so that it goes 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.220
 discovering through the game 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:50.140
 another thing is the radio stations you move 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.970
 with the mouse look she will show 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.350
 salary 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.540
 look here time then you can goal gta 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.479
 same way to 5 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.750
 Dude, I'll leave the best for the end, or 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.939
 You're going to hear the pirate version and look. 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.340
 another also looks if you press that 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:12.640
 profit looks that the time was not that 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.709
 Way more has to keep changing 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.590
 in the dark to choose the weapon or 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.000
 to press a key you press just know 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:26.319
 On one hand you want, for example, me 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.780
 I want to catch fire and good you there, picking it up. 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.630
 fire went 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:43.590
 The game of the bug attack 3d going wrong 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:51.600
 It's going to catch fire on the speech, she died. 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:54.090
 died in the opa was stronger than me 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.940
 I wanted to show you the camera in 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.459
 first person the police do not bother 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:03.239
 in the police bag on alert 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:07.110
 Look what the fuck looks the camera sits on 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:10.739
 first person in the gta san andreas who 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.420
 I had no gta5 from xbox 360 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.100
 we have to accept saints with 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.910
 now power detected 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.019
 molds and there one thing but look is this 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.480
 that business itself sounds like a 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.670
 My baby, if I put this on 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.920
 right in first person works 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.190
 normal to that closes with the button 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.950
 right to pull normal 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.780
 at the time you get a normal latin 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.400
 day is kraken monster do this with the 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.829
 car in a river 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.799
 I'm making you this guy look this looks 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:43.500
 Look, this was bullshit with Canada. 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:51.959
 it is already out of the car it looks 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:55.160
 mt son face 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:04:00.959
 The day will see with the Dutch. 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:10.880
 look at putting a guy like I was doing 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:10.880
 this was just subject to the law of the galley 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.010
 but the stronger the first person does not 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.949
 have that works inside the car too 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:23.410
 is the first person looks at this of course 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:24.520
 which is not perfect, right? 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.889
 people are awesome 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.880
 but the law is the steering wheel gomes the adu and 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:32.050
 everything else is good college 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.389
 after a mouthful I'm up to 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.130
 considering that in general back years 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:46.210
 first person with face 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:50.770
 Is it possible to support or call santa 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:53.110
 If the game is to also take longer 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:59.650

00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:04.139

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:17.289

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.139
 character can put the trevor can 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:22.930
 put the gta5 characters also not 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:26.289
 I've changed because I'd rather decide if 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:29.229
 I think I know it's going to be strange there. 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:31.030
 I do not know, everyone has a taste, I prefer 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:34.120
 leave but if you want you can 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:37.599

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.880
 what a lot to show more 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.419
 I could not see all things 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.280
 still 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:05.680
 As I went to see things I go 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.440

 It works, too. 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.060
 the bike of the order looks 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:30.070
