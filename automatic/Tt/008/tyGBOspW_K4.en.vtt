00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.759
 hello friends stay Jorge de Ferrovial 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.829
 point they want to show this deposit 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:10.230
 of fully flexible water system 

00:00:07.829 --> 00:00:12.570
 hydration with your tube and system to 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.420
 drink the manufacturer's south e 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.970
 imposing green color as main 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.440
 good feature commented that it has 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.320
 a capacity of about three liters and 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.840
 about 36 centimeters 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.820
 long by 25 and weighing 250 grams 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.529
 the biggest problem problem that does not 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.140
 we found in these deposits at the time 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.200
 of running or filling it is the stopper is a 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.970
 the time of cleaning 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.270
 we have here sun has solved this 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.950
 system 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.110
 making this system that is totally 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.000
 We are not going to have a problem and 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.550
 good as you can see here 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.930
 we can not fill while 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.520
 perfectly good hand to fill the 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.520
 ice cubes here I here in the 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.720
 center another let's say a board so that 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.280
 do not open up to us in the middle so that 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.900
 fill us the whole bag and do not occupy 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.890
 too much volume but everything else more 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.890
 keep going 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.869
 manufacturers 11 tells us that this system 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.070
 it's totally safe since it does not stop 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:15.250
 No taste of water or system 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.600
 micro the bid is no longer understood that 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.119
 example see tube goes totally here 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.490
 lined with that we get that for 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.700
 example vpo rays do not intercede 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.350
 here we do not believe neither bacteria nor anything here 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.000
 we have a system for what is the 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.890
 mouthpiece that totally bring by itself 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.740
 they want to connect a system of 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.570
 filtration then the nozzle that 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.580
 fully selected 360 degrees 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.990
 Carry cartridges for dust and good 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.310
 the manufacturer also tells us that with 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.720
 this new system I know what we would do 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.630
 necessary to bite 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.190
 we should 25 percent would enter a 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.610
 25 percent more water in this respect 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.929
 any other deposit system 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.550
 hydration is good has a capacity 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:53.320
 of 3 liters and I stay the 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.960
 Very easy access feature for 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.340
 the time of filling and cleaning and 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.200
 how good you are not going to have any problem 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.090
 microbial or bacterial 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.770
 as the manufacturer and system 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.430
 treatment so they do not create any 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.990
 type of bacteria 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.580
 I hope the information we have 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.910
 helped a good hello 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.910
 running
