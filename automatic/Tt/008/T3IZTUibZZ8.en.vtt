00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:07.270
 and 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.920
 hello to all boy come simple subo 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.900
 let's go with another fight onaindía this 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.910
 week I bring you a fight which already 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.160
 you know that the teams the leaders of 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.960
 the teams there are times that not only 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.030
 act as the leader but they make a 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.730
 excellent role so much that of leader 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.980
 how crucial are we going to get a 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.560
 a good battle a good good fight 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.390
 and this fights the title from there a 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.949
 reaction of those laws because they talk and 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.660
 apart sometimes being a good leader of 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.820
 team can be a pokémon which you 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.740
 You see them very difficult when it comes to 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.750
 get it knocked down or get done 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.100
 a lot of damage and I want you to see with your 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.620
 own eyes what you can do 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.420
 a saber well trained and knowing 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.030
 handle it so we go with the combat 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.800
 I face an entrant or no longer do not 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.020
 call without ninjas here carving is of his 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.490
 team leader and that house player 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.170
 here the protagonist of this video 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.450
 Wisp began with so vain 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.980
 carvin I know it's not very effective but 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.020
 I prefer to start burning him because he's going 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.970
 to attack or with attacks type fairy or going 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.290
 start doing light screen reflection or 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.420
 mental peace I prefer to make a fire photo 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.009
 at least to make sure that something 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.420
 each turn of wiki tando and not usually 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:09.190
 have a fence to cure the state 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.520
 altered so I think it's okay 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.500
 employee that game 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.630
 and now I use disarm to remove the 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.520
 object either reflecting or with the object 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.659
 that could hurt me and taken away 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.759
 the soft rock will say that the 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.710
 storm here I just put him 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.829
 I was going to do it and will try to annoy 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.240
 based on lunar strength and only 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:27.920
 sand that is regularly removing a 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.079
 little bit of my peset if I do not have any 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.149
 pokemon of earth type steel or rock or 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.170
 with the protective glasses that you know 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.240
 which is a new object is not this 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.429
 generation which prevents the damage by 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.009
 climates of that hail keep cetera 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:41.630
 good return I make recovery and I cured 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.489
 that life that this force has tried 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.159
 carvin area reuse the 

00:01:43.489 --> 00:01:48.140
 same strength and fix disarmed liquidated 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.640
 the object I have already put a fire facto and 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.789
 note that based on force dollars like 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.979
 do not go up more force will not get 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.509
 avoid me saber and attack me down 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.250
 special and it gives me absolutely the same in 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.829
 the nap tomenta doing its function and my 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.880
 burn also advanced a little bit more 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.709
 I burn and I use again 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.140
 recovery in saber and then I want 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:08.329
 cure and I want you to free me the tumbe to 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.560
 your leader who is carving and little by little what 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:11.090
 little by little I'm getting it here 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.980
 take advantage of that yes it has done very 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.660
 well in putting the rocks traps because 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.040
 I explain is because it is a skill 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.000
 that can annoy so much I like it 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.920
 like the focus band 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.660
 and he has only seen a bit of mine 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.100
 already speak our other two so 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.200
 they are very well made those rock traps 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:27.140
 and the web burn to move forward and I do it 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.820
 mockery because I was smelling I was 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.460
 smelling that you can have rest this 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.140
 this coal and I had it and I take that 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.640
 can not sleep and now it is 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.720
 condemned what is also condemned 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.760
 because he has to attack me and attack me 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.590
 all the time can not be cured with 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.080
 rest in the burn and with all the 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.030
 life can not even be in there dorninger 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.959
 he decides to remove it and take out his next 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.459
 because we will return which ones come and look 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.930
 what I had prepared for who to win 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.720
 because this one hit and went for coal 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:55.940
 planet of vitale and just one blow a 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.850
 just a very strong blow of that law 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.260
 and has knocked advenga game that is my po 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.090
 as a favorite the command until that one 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.160
 apparatus also to come and the tomenta 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.959
 amaina has stopped is no longer going to hit the 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.810
 kite in the safe that I get back out 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.980
 coal and leaves pulls half that has 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.720
 also behind sandblasted 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.250
 steam in the storm swims for five 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.709
 turns something that has soft rock and what 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.480
 keep up until 8 thiago motta 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.800
 I want him to hit me all the time despite 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.150
 that are to travel, I want you to hit me 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.130
 anda think thunder or anything like that no 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.440
 no no that hit me avoided the sharp crazy 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.900
 the storm in a month 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.450
 and nothing happens, nothing happens, he will use 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.760
 phosphate and elusive it to also one and 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.690
 one the sharp one this time yes 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.000
 that gives me that it's going to do a lot of damage 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.900
 fixes the exit and how it stays with 18 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.080
 dps but 7 dps for another metal in ay he 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.510
 retires I had just one punch and 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:47.630
 retires to finalize because it is 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.190
 returning to the will-o'-the-wisp and going out to charcoal 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.170
 that again and I took advantage of that shift 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.420
 to do recovery and chrome all 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.190
 my ps good as much as I can the 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.050
 tomenta again shake mommy and 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.520
 you will know already know that when I commented 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.380
 sand the little more rock type increase 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.240
 the special defense 50% in the case of 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.830
 coal is doing it fire does it 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.480
 a little more the same got wet because 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:07.490
 I do not want him to rest, I want him to 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.170
 make mockery I want you to attack me better 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.760
 said so that it does not heal and I do not care 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.980
 that make me work does not happen 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.220
 nothing I want that was not cured with rest 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.519
 and I'm left with 3 dps and the storm in 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.739
 just stop with me if you speak already has 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.200
 harmed this team has 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.550
 shattered stable guys is already a 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.920
 ration completely goes out has been left 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.600
 just a carving blow revenge is 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.220
 out of combat and edit strip has 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.960
 I was very afraid because 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.480
 sharp has not been able to with that and it is 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.340
 returning a fire a willful fire according to 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.040
 my magic that my band has annoyed me 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.500
 focus I use machination because 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.120
 is that of a moon forte I will not fall and 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.800
 the burn will end quietly 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.870
 as a rival so I take advantage of 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.670
 make me a machination and you arm yourself a 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.650
 little more the special attack that is going to 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.200
 come very well the tomenta amaina 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.940
 perfect for me and the burn just 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.100
 with carving his team leader too 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.050
 it's outside I have my two and he's left 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.430
 is dynamite for now I have the 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.380
 to win so I'm calm with my 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.080
 same cues on the battlefield with 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:07.850
 selective thrown machination to edit 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.500
 careful take care of your image because it has 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:11.990
 such it does a lot of damage 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.090
 so much sandstorm again 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.230
 easily with magic shine remember 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.330
 that you enter the sinister and go 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:20.450
 Look removed some life lets you my 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.920
 song is very good and skip the insurance 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:23.630
 weakness is going to up the attack a 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.340
 very much and also special attack 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.500
 careful you have is that already this 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.730
 post and strong makes me a headline and this 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.550
 time I can not stand it because my 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.620
 hands does not have great physical defense and 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.529
 posted even more has this attack not 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:39.109
 I have nothing to do and my own cues fall 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:41.299
 here the combat is turned again is a 

00:05:39.109 --> 00:05:42.799
 precious combat be tongue dance that 

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:45.649
 wise year ago with the traps rocks of 

00:05:42.799 --> 00:05:47.539
 carving and here I play everything to one or 

00:05:45.649 --> 00:05:49.339
 the skill hole presses something that 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:51.199
 pepes go down a little bit more use 

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:53.959
 demolition attack type fight that is by 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:57.649
 four to tyrannize can not stand that blow 

00:05:53.959 --> 00:06:00.409
 and white war air just got me 

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:02.149
 the victory against is tempting ninja and 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:03.319
 this guy has been fighting this 

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:05.029
 This week we liked it a lot 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:08.589
 because I love having combats 

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:10.939
 well and not even saber and you already know 

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:12.409
 but for you to see is not the case of 

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:14.269
 saber so you can see that a leader of 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:16.819
 team in team leader function 

00:06:14.269 --> 00:06:18.469
 It is very important to always be clear and 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:20.479
 when it's done it's a team they're looking for 

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:22.849
 give a pattern to each to each 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:24.169
 a very important function of the 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:26.299
 team leaders whether to put 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:27.499
 barriers for physical attackers 

00:06:26.299 --> 00:06:30.319
 as in the case of saber with willful fire 

00:06:27.499 --> 00:06:32.539
 team leaders are very but that 

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:37.689
 very important so guys or command 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:37.689
 a very strong hugs I want a lot and chau
