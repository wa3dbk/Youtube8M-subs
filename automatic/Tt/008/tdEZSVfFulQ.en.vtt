00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
help to have like some crossing boards I

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.830 
help to have like some crossing boards I
just<00:00:40.110> use<00:00:40.320> some<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:41.329> jointed<00:00:42.329> rail<00:00:42.920> stuff

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
crossing gate here these are safe strong

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.899 
crossing gate here these are safe strong
crossings<00:01:08.240> Sarge<00:01:09.240> X<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:10.400> think<00:01:11.400> up<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.790> don't

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
crossings Sarge X I think up I don't

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.690 
crossings Sarge X I think up I don't
think<00:01:12.180> I'm<00:01:12.270> pronouncing<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.810> right<00:01:13.110> but

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
think I'm pronouncing that right but

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.649 
think I'm pronouncing that right but
SART<00:01:14.700> X<00:01:15.320> critics<00:01:16.320> uh-huh<00:01:17.240> anyway<00:01:18.240> they're

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
SART X critics uh-huh anyway they're

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:30.350 
SART X critics uh-huh anyway they're
nice<00:01:18.810> crossings<00:01:24.049> go<00:01:25.049> here<00:01:28.040> and<00:01:29.150> one<00:01:30.150> thing

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
nice crossings go here and one thing

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.050 
nice crossings go here and one thing
I've<00:01:30.540> noticed<00:01:30.840> with<00:01:31.320> these<00:01:31.439> crossings<00:01:32.070> is

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
I've noticed with these crossings is

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.219 
I've noticed with these crossings is
that<00:01:33.329> when<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.960> put<00:01:34.259> up

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.760 

anyway<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:38.220> uh<00:01:38.600> track<00:01:39.600> it's<00:01:39.869> visible<00:01:40.650> sphere

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
anyway this uh track it's visible sphere

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.160 
anyway this uh track it's visible sphere
but<00:01:41.340> not<00:01:41.520> anywhere<00:01:41.850> else

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
but not anywhere else

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.930 
but not anywhere else
one<00:01:43.619> thing<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:43.830> noticed<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.310> order<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.640> get<00:01:44.790> to

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
one thing I noticed in order to get to

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.370 
one thing I noticed in order to get to
go<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.180> right<00:01:45.330> way<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.570> have<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.990> put<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.290> in

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
go the right way you have to put it in

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.859 
go the right way you have to put it in
the<00:01:46.530> back<00:01:48.350> otherwise<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.619> won't<00:01:49.799> work<00:01:50.750> like<00:01:51.750> if

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
the back otherwise it won't work like if

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.290 
the back otherwise it won't work like if
I<00:01:51.930> get<00:01:52.080> rid<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.350> now<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.560> can<00:01:53.240> kind<00:01:54.240> of

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
I get rid of this now you can kind of

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.550 
I get rid of this now you can kind of
see<00:01:54.450> how<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.630> arrows<00:01:54.840> pointing<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.440> right

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
see how the arrows pointing the right

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.430 
see how the arrows pointing the right
way<00:01:55.740> now<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.420> will<00:01:57.420> try<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.750> arrow<00:01:57.899> points<00:01:58.320> and

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
way now I will try the arrow points and

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.590 
way now I will try the arrow points and
then<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.619> connect<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.790> grab<00:02:00.180> from<00:02:00.420> over

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
then you connect it and grab from over

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.499 
then you connect it and grab from over
here<00:02:01.130> put<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.220> over<00:02:02.340> here<00:02:02.640> now<00:02:03.180> it's<00:02:03.360> facing

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
here put it over here now it's facing

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.880 
here put it over here now it's facing
the<00:02:03.720> right<00:02:03.899> way<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.560> it'll<00:02:04.740> go<00:02:05.340> down<00:02:05.549> right

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
the right way so it'll go down right

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.219 
the right way so it'll go down right
when<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:08.039> go<00:02:08.130> into<00:02:08.280> here<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.970> need<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.450> a<00:02:09.660> TLS

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
when you go into here you need the a TLS

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.150 
when you go into here you need the a TLS
trigger<00:02:12.019> what<00:02:13.019> I<00:02:13.050> like<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.410> do<00:02:13.560> is<00:02:13.739> see<00:02:14.010> you

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
trigger what I like to do is see you

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.460 
trigger what I like to do is see you
just<00:02:14.880> put<00:02:15.980> two<00:02:16.980> here<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:17.580> think<00:02:18.420> so<00:02:19.080> then<00:02:19.260> the

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
a little bit of a distance out put

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.650 
a little bit of a distance out put
another<00:02:28.590> one<00:02:28.800> just<00:02:29.580> like<00:02:29.819> just<00:02:30.269> so<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.480> can<00:02:31.370> bear

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
another one just like just so I can bear

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.080 
another one just like just so I can bear
on<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:33.690> just<00:02:34.319> so<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.500> can<00:02:34.650> barely<00:02:35.459> see<00:02:35.910> the

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
on that just so I can barely see the

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:53.020 
on that just so I can barely see the
road

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.440 

like<00:02:54.030> up<00:02:54.150> here<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:55.500> then<00:02:55.710> I<00:02:56.250> usually<00:02:57.090> just
