 is the good piece had packed 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.269
 You can take it everywhere 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.740
 because he just spent two hours with 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.900
 This battery can be operated 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.370
 and that would be us on the way now 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.839
 want to receive presentation or 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.449
 want to show photos or friends 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.560
 is similar or wants to look in the movie 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:20.760
 that you do not have extra notebook 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.560
 must take with or another 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.060
 responsible device needs is media 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.580
 integrated player he plays different 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.109
 video formats from shows pictures rankel 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.150
 play music and also shows 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.460
 office documents different and powerpoint 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.780
 excel word what ultimately in the picture 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.840
 See everything you have to take with you 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.460
 for the beamer a usb stick where 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.200
 the files are on it and the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.469
 Letting rate pen use too 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.469
 can 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.129
 then I want to show you this one 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.539
 media player works before it with 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.460
 I want to start the media player 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.230
 Show you another feature and that 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.550
 the automatic keystone correction 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.320
 If the beamer is not called 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.149
 the picture becomes quite straight 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.500
 automatically adjusted I do here 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:04.619
 higher and zack that just fit 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.659
 automatically to that is quite convenient 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.570
 and the same if you put it to the 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.689
 Covers would then be the picture too 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.229
 automatically rotated because inside the 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.150
 device is so much a position sensor 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.100
 set up very quickly in practice 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.890
 No major corrections will be needed 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.689
 set penalty it goes manual and 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.119
 then it can start already so me 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.119
 Put now the usb stick usb port 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:43.640
 use automatically charged correctly 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.230
 and as you can see in the upper part 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.310
 I'll look like this on the 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.200
 Stick are all the files in one 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.080
 I can now make a list of them 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.730
 I only have movies photos music or just 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.950
 I want to view files now 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.260
 times all media continue even in folder 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.570
 For example , they had sorted here 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:06.320
 all pictures in it you can now a picture 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:07.869
 start and then just manually the 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.190
 Switching pictures back and forth 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.500
 but you can also down here is you 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.290
 already start an animal show 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.080
 then the pictures are just automatically 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:22.959
 there are also a few changed 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:25.070
 options million are set here 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.080
 kilometer photo can as you can the 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.480
 you can set the speed 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.459
 background music also play 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.530
 the content in the case of usb 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.880
 stick can provide the repeat 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.790
 should or not and whether the pictures too 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.989
 can i be given again 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.640
 a video settings here you can 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:44.330
 adjust the picture mode brightness 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.860
 adjust sharpness and so on and at 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.260
 the audio settings you can hear sound 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.290
 Mode would be the music, for example 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.739
 play stronger or better too 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.480
 can 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.330
 because he also has an integrated 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.630
 speaker output via the audio 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.630
 can be 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:12.340
 then we go back out again 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:12.340
 that were pictures just like that 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:18.299
 data had a folder up then 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.689
 i said yes video also plays from here 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:23.939
 I now have a mv file review that 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:26.340
 theme to a pocket photo easy 

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:31.139
 now you have to listen to the 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.790
 antiquated speakers just as well 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.950
 here media player settings again 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.549
 for video playback can here 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.430
 to adjust 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.120
 the image size will be repeated on 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.400
 should or not 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.719
 Who there is very different audio options 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.750
 could the changes also subtitles 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:47.400
 you can set here then too 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.930
 in the settings whoops the should 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:54.389
 wrong button on the remote control yes 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:58.530
 now the counter-position will continue 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:59.969
 I have your video settings too 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.219
 Here you can select the picture mode 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:04.019
 may for example and may the 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:06.599
 noise reduction color brightness is 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:09.030
 continue to adjust and also audio 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.489
 Settings also every ton bonus music 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.480
 cinema and so on 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.909
 very practical is also that clear 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.049
 Voice feature will then be speech 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:17.729
 highlighted that is quite practical 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.859
 if you will talk to someone somewhere 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.850
 background what noise 12 at 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.750
 football can 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.430
 commentator slightly better 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.930
 you can also very normal here super 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.320
 will jump imagine I want the 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.120
 wants to watch all video has here 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.600
 various settings can also here 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:39.120
 Incidentally set 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.790
 this stands for eco or energy saving 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:46.980
 The holding theme should be 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:54.000
 so much energy is needed 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:56.700
 was the videoplayer offload and too good 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.810
 Lastly, I want the player for 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.400
 show office files 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.690
 I have an example here 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:11.700
 powerpoint word and excel file iris 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:13.350
 powerpoint that's pretty handy 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.720
 now several options 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.370
 Although you can get nice document too 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.250
 zoom in man zoom in or out 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.100
 I would like that to be practical 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.480
 However, the height has to be adjusted 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.820
 then the presentation becomes more accurate 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.260
 completely displayed indicator different 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.090
 if you wanted to get to the 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.110
 appropriate place to jump like that 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:35.160
 now it is completely visible the picture 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.390
 and here I can go to one now 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.950
 certain time to jump if here to 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:42.600
 Example on page 22 would like to bring 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.190
 of course, now I can go inside 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.790
 the powerpoint presentations with the 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:50.570
 remote control jumping back and forth 

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:54.360
 just as they are just also to external 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:56.810
 would carry on pretty much 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.810
 practically 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:04.440
 So we said another one 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:07.160
 word file here I can now too 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:10.160
 jump back to one side and so on 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.160
 chaplain 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.700
 so and now side up with it now 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.500
 you can see these scrolling back and forth 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.170
 laterally above and the position on the 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:25.860
 martin word document is located 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:28.020
 the partial scroll or even here 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:29.370
 also with the remote control with side 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.870
 up and down page by page 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:39.300
 jump and last but not least 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:41.220
 quite incorrect excel file so here too 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:45.990
 again search options and to the side 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:49.140
 jump and of course if 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:51.300
 you moved in the document okay it was 

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.490
 a long time in the holiday have 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.740
 moving in the document one also sees again 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:59.880
 top right where you are in 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:02.190
 document as I said all this only with 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.830
 a usb stick of course before 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:08.550
 other sources following hdmi and 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:09.720
 further but in the case the usb stick 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.280
 and as little as possible 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.930
 to have to lug or 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.430
 presentations at school to keep 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.260

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.860
 to watch movies 

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.150
 Thank you for watching if you 

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.260
 ask the device was simply a 

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:27.190
 youtube comments we answer 

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.190
