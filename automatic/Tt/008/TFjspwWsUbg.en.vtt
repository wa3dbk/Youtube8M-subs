00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.699 
impose on them that would almost be like
call<00:04:00.030> the<00:04:00.150> police<00:04:00.449> right<00:04:00.480> away<00:04:00.690> red<00:04:01.139> flag<00:04:01.410> I

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
call the police right away red flag I

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:06.319 
call the police right away red flag I
think<00:04:02.519> so<00:04:03.030> yeah<00:04:03.989> most<00:04:04.230> likely
