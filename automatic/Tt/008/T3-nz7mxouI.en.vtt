through<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.850> speakers<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.660> garage<00:00:51.899> so

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
through the speakers in the garage so

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.220 
through the speakers in the garage so
we're<00:00:53.520> powering<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.090> thing<00:00:54.449> with<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.050> bench

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
we're powering this thing with a bench

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.619 
we're powering this thing with a bench
power<00:00:55.500> supply<00:00:55.620> it's<00:00:56.460> regulated<00:00:57.030> out<00:00:57.210> thirteen

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
power supply it's regulated out thirteen

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.569 
power supply it's regulated out thirteen
five<00:00:57.930> volts<00:00:58.469> which<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.859> about<00:00:59.070> what<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> running

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
five volts which is about what a running

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.330 
five volts which is about what a running
car<00:00:59.820> would<00:01:00.000> have<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.660> then<00:01:01.620> for<00:01:02.070> an<00:01:02.129> audio

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
car would have and then for an audio

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.910 
car would have and then for an audio
source<00:01:02.670> here<00:01:03.000> I'm<00:01:03.239> just<00:01:03.449> using<00:01:03.619> winamp<00:01:04.710> and

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
source here I'm just using winamp and

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.050 
source here I'm just using winamp and
some<00:01:05.189> streaming<00:01:05.760> internet<00:01:06.030> music<00:01:07.280> so<00:01:08.280> let's

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
some streaming internet music so let's

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.649 
some streaming internet music so let's
do<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.420> first<00:01:09.570> test<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.560> we<00:01:10.890> will<00:01:11.450> turn<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
do the first test so we will turn on the

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.410 
do the first test so we will turn on the
remote<00:01:12.930> line<00:01:13.320> here<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:13.920> then<00:01:14.700> we<00:01:14.939> will<00:01:15.060> run

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
remote line here and then we will run

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.270 
remote line here and then we will run
the<00:01:16.369> sound<00:01:17.369> manager<00:01:17.939> software<00:01:18.920> which<00:01:19.920> should

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
the sound manager software which should

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.750 
the sound manager software which should
turn<00:01:21.150> unit<00:01:21.479> on<00:01:21.600> which<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.020> did<00:01:23.420> now<00:01:24.420> god<00:01:24.659> I

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
turn unit on which it did now god I

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:35.149 
turn unit on which it did now god I
Oh

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.170 

I've<00:01:36.159> down<00:01:36.400> a<00:01:36.430> bit<00:01:36.700> now<00:01:38.399> on<00:01:39.399> the<00:01:39.610> software

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
I've down a bit now on the software

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.460 
I've down a bit now on the software
hopefully<00:01:41.020> that<00:01:41.229> can<00:01:41.380> focus<00:01:41.680> for<00:01:42.430> me<00:01:43.470> you

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
hopefully that can focus for me you

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.499 
hopefully that can focus for me you
notice<00:01:44.799> right<00:01:44.890> in<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.490> center<00:01:45.880> there<00:01:45.909> there's

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
notice right in the center there there's

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.010 
notice right in the center there there's
a<00:01:46.600> temperature<00:01:47.080> in<00:01:47.440> yellow<00:01:48.330> area<00:01:49.330> it's

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
a temperature in yellow area it's

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.550 
a temperature in yellow area it's
focusing<00:01:50.500> there<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.880> I<00:01:52.210> just<00:01:52.840> started<00:01:53.200> it<00:01:53.350> it's

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
focusing there so I just started it it's

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.340 
focusing there so I just started it it's
pretty<00:01:53.830> cool<00:01:53.890> right<00:01:54.430> now<00:01:55.289> temperature<00:01:56.289> is

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
pretty cool right now temperature is

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.320 
pretty cool right now temperature is
about<00:01:56.649> 95<00:01:57.340> Fahrenheit<00:01:57.939> 35<00:01:58.539> centigrade<00:02:00.330> but

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
about 95 Fahrenheit 35 centigrade but

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.809 
about 95 Fahrenheit 35 centigrade but
you<00:02:02.200> can<00:02:02.289> see<00:02:02.439> it's<00:02:02.560> climbing<00:02:02.800> right<00:02:03.399> it's

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
you can see it's climbing right it's

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:07.050 
you can see it's climbing right it's
climbing<00:02:04.240> a<00:02:04.659> couple<00:02:05.080> degrees<00:02:06.060> Fahrenheit

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
climbing a couple degrees Fahrenheit

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.970 
climbing a couple degrees Fahrenheit
every<00:02:07.960> 30<00:02:08.319> seconds<00:02:08.769> or<00:02:08.890> so<00:02:10.709> that's<00:02:11.709> because

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
every 30 seconds or so that's because

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.460 
every 30 seconds or so that's because
the<00:02:12.130> unit<00:02:12.400> is<00:02:12.489> drawing<00:02:13.440> about<00:02:14.440> 860<00:02:15.160> milliamps

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
the unit is drawing about 860 milliamps

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.199 
the unit is drawing about 860 milliamps
current<00:02:17.470> of<00:02:18.459> course<00:02:18.700> that's<00:02:18.940> going<00:02:19.120> to

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
current of course that's going to

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.809 
current of course that's going to
generate<00:02:19.330> heat<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:23.340> we'll<00:02:24.340> just<00:02:24.519> let<00:02:24.700> it

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
generate heat and so we'll just let it

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.229 
generate heat and so we'll just let it
run<00:02:25.030> for<00:02:25.299> a<00:02:25.360> while<00:02:25.569> and<00:02:26.940> let<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.060> temperature

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
run for a while and let the temperature

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.350 
run for a while and let the temperature
get<00:02:28.690> up<00:02:28.840> there<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.880> I'll<00:02:30.880> start<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.269> video

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
get up there and I'll start the video

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.039 
get up there and I'll start the video
again<00:02:31.540> once<00:02:31.989> it's<00:02:32.170> once<00:02:32.590> it's<00:02:32.769> warmed<00:02:33.040> up<00:02:34.049> all

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
again once it's once it's warmed up all

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:37.680 
again once it's once it's warmed up all
right<00:02:35.200> we're<00:02:35.320> back<00:02:35.579> took<00:02:36.579> about<00:02:36.820> four<00:02:37.209> or<00:02:37.480> five

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
right we're back took about four or five

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.360 
right we're back took about four or five
minutes<00:02:38.140> to<00:02:38.709> reach<00:02:38.920> about<00:02:39.730> 107<00:02:40.660> Fahrenheit

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
minutes to reach about 107 Fahrenheit

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.470

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859 
pretty good in heart now so it's been

jump back in your car and you turn your

jump back in your car and you turn your
stereo<00:03:00.850> on<00:03:01.030> and<00:03:03.180> so<00:03:04.320> we'll<00:03:05.320> just<00:03:05.470> flip<00:03:05.650> the

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
stereo on and so we'll just flip the

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:11.120 
stereo on and so we'll just flip the
remote<00:03:06.100> line<00:03:06.310> here<00:03:06.670> so<00:03:07.950> DSP<00:03:08.950> units<00:03:09.280> gone<00:03:09.519> off

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
remote line here so DSP units gone off

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.440 
remote line here so DSP units gone off
software<00:03:12.130> doesn't<00:03:12.280> like<00:03:12.519> that<00:03:12.730> it<00:03:13.090> shuts<00:03:13.269> down

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
software doesn't like that it shuts down

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.479 
software doesn't like that it shuts down
says<00:03:14.350> I<00:03:14.440> can't<00:03:14.650> talk<00:03:14.799> to<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.069> Box<00:03:15.250> anymore

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
says I can't talk to the Box anymore

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.039 
says I can't talk to the Box anymore
that's<00:03:15.910> fine<00:03:17.310> now<00:03:18.310> what<00:03:18.519> we'll<00:03:18.640> do<00:03:18.790> is<00:03:19.120> we<00:03:19.900> will

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:20.049 
that's fine now what we'll do is we will

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.550 
that's fine now what we'll do is we will
immediately<00:03:21.390> flip<00:03:22.390> the<00:03:22.540> remote<00:03:22.780> line<00:03:22.989> back<00:03:23.290> on

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
immediately flip the remote line back on

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.050 
immediately flip the remote line back on
so<00:03:23.920> you've<00:03:24.100> just<00:03:24.130> turned<00:03:24.519> your<00:03:24.609> head<00:03:24.760> unit

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
so you've just turned your head unit

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.410 
so you've just turned your head unit
back<00:03:25.239> on<00:03:25.480> basically<00:03:27.630> start<00:03:28.630> up<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:28.900> software

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
back on basically start up the software

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.750 
back on basically start up the software
units<00:03:31.420> come<00:03:31.810> back<00:03:31.989> on<00:03:32.260> no<00:03:32.769> problem<00:03:33.310> right

I<00:04:05.030> checked<00:04:05.900> it<00:04:06.049> with<00:04:06.200> this<00:04:06.349> scope<00:04:07.870> obviously

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
I checked it with this scope obviously

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.330 
I checked it with this scope obviously
it's<00:04:08.989> look<00:04:09.109> at<00:04:09.260> the<00:04:09.349> stereo<00:04:09.769> you<00:04:09.950> hear<00:04:10.250> it

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
it's look at the stereo you hear it

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.440 
it's look at the stereo you hear it
nothing<00:04:10.879> comes<00:04:11.239> out<00:04:11.389> but<00:04:12.260> if<00:04:12.769> you<00:04:13.340> shut<00:04:14.329> the

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
nothing comes out but if you shut the

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.729 
nothing comes out but if you shut the
unit<00:04:14.689> off<00:04:14.810> here<00:04:15.370> and<00:04:16.630> then<00:04:17.630> wait<00:04:18.410> a<00:04:18.440> few

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
unit off here and then wait a few

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.830 
unit off here and then wait a few
minutes<00:04:18.859> for<00:04:19.370> it<00:04:19.459> to<00:04:19.489> cool<00:04:19.699> down<00:04:19.759> if<00:04:20.479> you<00:04:20.660> let

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
minutes for it to cool down if you let

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.350 
minutes for it to cool down if you let
it<00:04:20.930> cool<00:04:21.049> down<00:04:21.109> seems<00:04:21.949> to<00:04:22.160> be<00:04:22.280> about<00:04:22.520> you<00:04:23.240> know

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
it cool down seems to be about you know

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.589 
it cool down seems to be about you know
102<00:04:23.780> or<00:04:23.990> so<00:04:24.729> it'll<00:04:25.729> come<00:04:25.910> back<00:04:25.940> on<00:04:26.300> and<00:04:26.479> I'll

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:26.599 
102 or so it'll come back on and I'll

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.270 
102 or so it'll come back on and I'll
resume<00:04:26.930> when<00:04:27.139> it<00:04:27.229> when<00:04:27.590> I've<00:04:27.710> let<00:04:27.889> it<00:04:27.919> cool<00:04:28.220> off

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
resume when it when I've let it cool off

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.760 
resume when it when I've let it cool off
a<00:04:28.460> bit

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
a bit

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.680 
a bit
alright<00:04:30.770> we're<00:04:31.009> zoomed<00:04:31.340> should<00:04:32.210> be<00:04:32.330> cool<00:04:32.539> by

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
alright we're zoomed should be cool by

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.620 
alright we're zoomed should be cool by
now<00:04:32.870> let's<00:04:33.650> flip<00:04:33.860> the<00:04:34.099> remote<00:04:34.910> line<00:04:35.120> back<00:04:35.389> on

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
now let's flip the remote line back on

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:40.050 
now let's flip the remote line back on
and<00:04:36.250> then<00:04:37.250> we<00:04:37.520> will<00:04:37.960> run<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.139> software

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
and then we will run the software

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:46.089 
and then we will run the software
software's<00:04:41.060> open<00:04:41.770> boxes<00:04:42.770> on<00:04:44.470> hey<00:04:45.470> presto<00:04:45.949> the

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:46.099 
software's open boxes on hey presto the

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:49.750 
software's open boxes on hey presto the
music's<00:04:46.400> back<00:04:46.580> on<00:04:47.050> so<00:04:48.400> let's<00:04:49.400> check<00:04:49.610> the

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
music's back on so let's check the

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:57.460 
music's back on so let's check the
temperature<00:04:50.150> here<00:04:50.300> when<00:04:50.539> it<00:04:50.659> loads

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.390 

deft<00:04:58.130> focus

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.650 

anyway<00:05:02.090> it's<00:05:02.300> about<00:05:02.860> 92.3<00:05:04.120> is<00:05:05.120> what<00:05:05.479> it's

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
anyway it's about 92.3 is what it's

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:12.040 
anyway it's about 92.3 is what it's
saying<00:05:05.930> here<00:05:07.960> so<00:05:09.699> this<00:05:10.699> is<00:05:10.850> very<00:05:11.120> repeatable<00:05:11.660> I

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229

Fahrenheit<00:05:27.889> if<00:05:28.100> you<00:05:28.389> if<00:05:29.389> you<00:05:29.570> toggle<00:05:29.810> the<00:05:30.050> unit

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
Fahrenheit if you if you toggle the unit

Fahrenheit if you if you toggle the unit
on<00:05:30.410> and<00:05:30.560> off<00:05:30.710> it<00:05:31.270> it<00:05:32.270> doesn't<00:05:32.419> come<00:05:32.540> back<00:05:32.750> on<00:05:32.949> so

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:33.949 
on and off it it doesn't come back on so

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:36.070 
on and off it it doesn't come back on so
until<00:05:34.400> it<00:05:34.520> cools<00:05:34.669> down<00:05:34.789> so<00:05:35.150> clearly<00:05:35.750> there's

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
until it cools down so clearly there's

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.600 
until it cools down so clearly there's
some<00:05:36.260> kind<00:05:36.440> of<00:05:36.500> heat<00:05:36.680> issue<00:05:36.860> here<00:05:37.570> and<00:05:38.590> I<00:05:39.610> will

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
some kind of heat issue here and I will

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.430 
some kind of heat issue here and I will
probably<00:05:40.850> be<00:05:41.300> sending<00:05:41.660> this<00:05:41.750> one<00:05:41.960> back<00:05:42.020> to<00:05:42.410> the

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:42.440 
probably be sending this one back to the

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.980 
probably be sending this one back to the
to<00:05:43.280> the<00:05:43.370> retailer<00:05:43.699> but<00:05:44.030> I'll<00:05:44.180> try<00:05:44.720> and<00:05:44.750> get<00:05:44.960> a

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
to the retailer but I'll try and get a

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.900 
to the retailer but I'll try and get a
hold<00:05:45.169> Alpine<00:05:45.560> first<00:05:45.860> and<00:05:46.160> see<00:05:46.250> what<00:05:46.280> they<00:05:46.490> say

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
hold Alpine first and see what they say

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.990 
hold Alpine first and see what they say
alright<00:05:47.270> thanks<00:05:47.600> for<00:05:47.720> watching
