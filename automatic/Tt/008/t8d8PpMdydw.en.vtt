00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:02.199 
finish that off that was like that's a

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:03.570 
finish that off that was like that's a
good<00:06:02.409> map<00:06:02.590> but<00:06:02.889> I<00:06:02.919> didn't<00:06:03.130> have<00:06:03.190> enough<00:06:03.430> time

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580
