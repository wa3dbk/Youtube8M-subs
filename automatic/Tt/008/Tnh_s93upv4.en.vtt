but<00:02:59.099> we're<00:02:59.219> real<00:02:59.430> clever<00:02:59.700> with<00:02:59.849> it's<00:03:00.000> on<00:03:00.150> the

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
but we're real clever with it's on the

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.030 
but we're real clever with it's on the
floor<00:03:00.540> what<00:03:00.959> are<00:03:01.049> they<00:03:01.139> to<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.319> floor<00:03:01.560> floor

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
blacks and stainless steel in there just

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.170 
blacks and stainless steel in there just
makes<00:03:06.930> it<00:03:07.019> pop<00:03:07.290> out<00:03:07.500> stand<00:03:08.040> out<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:08.909> it<00:03:09.030> kind

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
makes it pop out stand out and it kind

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.580 
makes it pop out stand out and it kind
of<00:03:09.209> plays<00:03:09.359> up<00:03:09.689> with<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:09.959> shape<00:03:10.200> of<00:03:10.319> the<00:03:10.379> room<00:03:10.560> a

clever solution exact just kind of just

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.469 
clever solution exact just kind of just
