00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:12.000

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.330
 I babadinho I painted her nail stand 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.220
 with top beauty enamel or pistachio 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.320
 I made a Spanish with a white on 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.689
 this French girl aside and 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:27.449
 they're babbling with the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:30.119
 condor 402 0 it is a brush that he the 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.769
 long hair and it is thin then 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.769
 To make this detail is pretty good. 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:49.070
 the little one has to always be watching 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:49.070
 the brush putting on the nail and pulling 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:01:02.660
 hillside ink I'm using is the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.519
 natura turbo paint and white glue 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:08.659
 As I told you, I use a trick. 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.659
 they in the milk carton 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.830
 in this farm they yield a lot and they are 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.479
 well good they are well the guardinha 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:26.100
 only always trying to put a 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:29.100
 only droplet in the milk carton made the 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.920
 Now I'm going to make a little snack 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:37.009
 I'll make the pines of the 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.009
 Baba Dinho keeps looking, too. 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.750
 He's making the little penguins around him. 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.750
 softly 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.980
 keep filling until everything's gone bad 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:08.289
 I'll do it on all my nails. 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:09.940
 looking at the brush the toothpick 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:23.200
 dripping on the nail 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:36.600
 only around the little one did 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:36.600
 the other makes a bad Pinguinho around 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.390
 very easy to do with a 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.159
 fine detail brush that is the brush 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.930
 of those I see that they are a 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:03.629
 a little bit thicker I'll make the 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.489
 polka dots on that nail 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.959
 ink is the ink of nature 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.959
 colors is the pink ink 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:15.480
 As you can see here I put a 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.329
 I only get it from her that left a lot then it is 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.459
 a farm that is already going to be wasted 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.319
 10 if you could put a minimum 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.489
 possible in the milk carton to 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.489
 work with her is better 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.190
 I made the balls I'm going to make 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:35.900
 again this model line that will 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.980
 Teach you again the rosinha 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.220
 now the detail is what I'm going to do in 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.900
 I'm going to use the bevelled brush 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.569
 or it the bevelled brush is what has the 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.379
 I'm going to look lonely. 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:52.260
 his tip and I'll do it, I 'll win 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:57.629
 on one side and I'll try on another and I'll 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:04:03.629
 make little hearts just drips only one 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:06.569
 side of the brush a little tip just 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:09.449
 point in the other and 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:13.290
 little heart I just looked at the tip of the brush 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:16.620
 I'm going to lean against one side of the 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.500
 nail on the other side formed the little heart 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.160
 if you want to make the biggest ones 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.110
 you can put more paint in the brush 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.210
 op is very simple to do and well 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:32.430
 Quickly do the little heart in the 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:36.500
 customer's nail brushed brush 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:36.500
 bevelled from side to side 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:51.130
 shape the little hearts pressed shapes 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.350
 Little heart then can still come with the 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.950
 brush make the tip in it if not 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:05:00.880

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:09.030
 joined and formed the little heart joined 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.030
 formed a little heart 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.670
 As you can see, the little heart 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.010
 on the nail 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.750

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.810

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:28.600

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:32.160
 I'll mix the two and I'll go 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.900

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.750

 Then I'll take a good look at the brush in the 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.450
 I start in the middle, it's a little risquinho and I'm going 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:20.950
 working around it to form 

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:23.850
