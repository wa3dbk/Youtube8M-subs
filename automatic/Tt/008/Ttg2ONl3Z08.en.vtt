but I've been jockeying this thing
around<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.529> turn<00:00:19.770> it<00:00:19.890> around<00:00:20.010> out<00:00:20.400> here<00:00:20.449> well<00:00:21.449> I

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
around to turn it around out here well I

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.250 
around to turn it around out here well I
finally<00:00:21.900> got<00:00:22.140> smart<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:23.510> chopped<00:00:24.510> it<00:00:24.630> off<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.199> I

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
weld a piece of pipe in here the pipe is

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.359 
weld a piece of pipe in here the pipe is
a<00:00:27.810> little<00:00:28.140> bit<00:00:28.260> smaller<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.949> can<00:00:29.099> see<00:00:29.220> it's

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
a little bit smaller so you can see it's

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.609 
a little bit smaller so you can see it's
kind<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.670> offset<00:00:30.029> but<00:00:30.929> what<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.109> did<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.410> I

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
kind of offset but what I did is I

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.290 
kind of offset but what I did is I
wrapped<00:00:31.859> some<00:00:31.949> newspaper<00:00:32.610> around<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.059> little

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
wrapped some newspaper around the little

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.270 
wrapped some newspaper around the little
pipe<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.780> shoved<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.140> in<00:00:34.290> here<00:00:34.590> then<00:00:34.860> squared

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
pipe and shoved it in here then squared

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.400 
pipe and shoved it in here then squared
it<00:00:35.399> up<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.850> even<00:00:36.690> though<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:36.989> burns<00:00:37.200> when

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
it up and even though it burns when

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.590 
it up and even though it burns when
you're<00:00:37.559> welding<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.980> doesn't<00:00:38.370> matter<00:00:38.600> but

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
you're welding it doesn't matter but

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.729 
you're welding it doesn't matter but
that<00:00:39.660> kept<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.230> snug

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
that kept it snug

a little t-handle i braised this in here
instead<00:01:49.990> of<00:01:50.140> welding<00:01:50.380> so<00:01:50.650> I<00:01:50.710> could<00:01:50.860> do<00:01:50.950> a

instead of welding so I could do a
little<00:01:51.100> better<00:01:51.280> job<00:01:51.720> just<00:01:52.720> like<00:01:52.900> on<00:01:53.080> this<00:01:53.260> I've

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
little better job just like on this I've

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.810 
little better job just like on this I've
raised<00:01:53.710> it<00:01:53.740> I<00:01:54.010> wanted<00:01:54.340> to<00:01:54.400> be<00:01:54.460> a<00:01:54.550> little<00:01:54.729> bit

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
raised it I wanted to be a little bit

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.940 
raised it I wanted to be a little bit
smoother<00:01:55.270> they<00:01:55.780> want<00:01:56.080> to<00:01:56.170> have<00:01:56.470> spent<00:01:56.740> all<00:01:56.860> the

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
smoother they want to have spent all the

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.160 
smoother they want to have spent all the
time<00:01:57.010> grinding<00:01:57.400> off<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:57.850> weld<00:01:58.060> because<00:01:58.960> your

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
time grinding off the weld because your

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.300 
time grinding off the weld because your
hands<00:01:59.410> going<00:01:59.619> to<00:01:59.680> be<00:01:59.830> on<00:01:59.950> there<00:02:00.130> you<00:02:00.220> don't

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
hands going to be on there you don't

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.430 
hands going to be on there you don't
want<00:02:00.400> to<00:02:00.580> snag<00:02:00.790> it<00:02:00.869> made<00:02:01.869> it<00:02:01.990> four<00:02:02.229> inches

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440
