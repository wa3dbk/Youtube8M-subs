getting them so they would fit my foot
properly<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.040> guess<00:01:47.340> they<00:01:47.520> didn't<00:01:47.820> expect<00:01:48.210> me

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
soft and the fabric fortunately is

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.880 
soft and the fabric fortunately is
pretty<00:02:29.370> thick<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:29.940> I'm<00:02:30.720> just<00:02:31.140> wearing<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.680> bra

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
pretty thick and I'm just wearing a bra

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.810 
pretty thick and I'm just wearing a bra
underneath<00:02:32.280> this<00:02:33.830> mom<00:02:34.830> besides<00:02:35.250> petticoats

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
underneath this mom besides petticoats

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.980 
underneath this mom besides petticoats
but<00:02:37.340> yeah<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.580> can't<00:02:38.820> see<00:02:39.030> that<00:02:39.210> at<00:02:39.390> all<00:02:39.420> can

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
but yeah you can't see that at all can

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.560 
but yeah you can't see that at all can
you<00:02:42.440> so<00:02:43.440> I<00:02:43.860> guess<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:45.060> fabric<00:02:45.420> is<00:02:45.540> thick

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
you so I guess the fabric is thick

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.460 
you so I guess the fabric is thick
enough<00:02:46.040> but<00:02:47.040> I<00:02:47.490> would<00:02:48.120> definitely<00:02:48.570> wear<00:02:49.080> a

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
enough but I would definitely wear a

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.440 
enough but I would definitely wear a
blouse<00:02:49.680> underneath<00:02:50.130> the<00:02:50.580> Jays<00:02:50.790> game<00:02:51.150> just

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
blouse underneath the Jays game just

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.060 
blouse underneath the Jays game just
because<00:02:51.630> I'm<00:02:51.990> worried<00:02:52.260> about<00:02:52.320> my<00:02:52.620> shoulders

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
because I'm worried about my shoulders

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:59.420 
because I'm worried about my shoulders
and<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:56.190> fabric<00:02:56.640> itself<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:58.310> kind<00:02:59.310> of

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
and the fabric itself is kind of

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.550 
and the fabric itself is kind of
stretchy<00:03:01.460> what's<00:03:02.460> though<00:03:02.640> in<00:03:02.820> this<00:03:02.940> group<00:03:03.560> but

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
stretchy what's though in this group but

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.530 
stretchy what's though in this group but
i<00:03:05.390> guess<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:06.630> allows<00:03:06.870> for<00:03:07.260> more<00:03:08.240> free<00:03:09.240> sighs

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.340 
i guess that allows for more free sighs
