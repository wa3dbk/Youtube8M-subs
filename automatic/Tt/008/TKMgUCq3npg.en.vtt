or the gold ring have you any ideas
pause<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.020> video<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.619> continue<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.640> ready

the<00:01:36.740> reason<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.610> metals<00:01:39.000> all<00:01:39.270> have

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
the reason is the metals all have

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.560 
the reason is the metals all have
different<00:01:39.960> reactivities<00:01:40.729> iron<00:01:41.729> corrodes

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
different reactivities iron corrodes

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.990 
different reactivities iron corrodes
faster<00:01:43.259> because<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.100> more<00:01:44.340> reactive<00:01:44.880> than

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
faster because it is more reactive than

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.690 
faster because it is more reactive than
the<00:01:45.149> copper<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.960> gold<00:01:46.310> but<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.490> may<00:01:47.670> be

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
the copper and the gold but you may be

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.060 
the copper and the gold but you may be
wondering<00:01:48.270> why<00:01:48.780> didn't<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.259> aluminium<00:01:49.500> toy

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
wondering why didn't the aluminium toy

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.359 
wondering why didn't the aluminium toy
corrode<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.610> fastest<00:01:51.439> the<00:01:52.439> truth<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.979> the

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
corrode the fastest the truth is the

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.460 
corrode the fastest the truth is the
aluminium<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:54.060> more<00:01:54.390> reactive<00:01:54.570> than<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.229> iron

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
aluminium is more reactive than the iron

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.069 
aluminium is more reactive than the iron
so<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.280> reacts<00:01:56.579> fastest<00:01:57.240> with<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.600> oxygen

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
so it reacts fastest with the oxygen

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.520 
so it reacts fastest with the oxygen
from<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.320> air<00:01:58.439> forming<00:01:59.399> aluminium<00:01:59.579> oxide

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
from the air forming aluminium oxide

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.899 
from the air forming aluminium oxide
aluminium<00:02:01.530> oxide<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.070> very<00:02:02.399> unreactive

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
aluminium oxide is very unreactive

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.630 
aluminium oxide is very unreactive
because<00:02:03.810> once<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.619> oxide<00:02:04.979> layer<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.430> formed

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
because once the oxide layer is formed

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.389 
because once the oxide layer is formed
on<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.850> surface<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:07.049> binds<00:02:07.380> very<00:02:07.560> tightly<00:02:07.860> to

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
on the surface it binds very tightly to

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.850 
on the surface it binds very tightly to
the<00:02:08.640> surface<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.239> metal<00:02:09.450> so<00:02:10.289> no<00:02:10.500> cracks

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
the surface of the metal so no cracks

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.830 
the surface of the metal so no cracks
can<00:02:11.190> form<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:12.060> cause<00:02:12.300> further<00:02:12.540> corrosion

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
can form and cause further corrosion

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.140 
can form and cause further corrosion
here's<00:02:14.380> a<00:02:14.440> challenge<00:02:14.739> how<00:02:15.580> might<00:02:15.790> you<00:02:15.880> used

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
here's a challenge how might you used

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.460 
here's a challenge how might you used
this<00:02:16.510> idea<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:17.739> protect<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.849> iron<00:02:19.120> now<00:02:19.470> the

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
this idea to protect the iron now the

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.130 
this idea to protect the iron now the
answer<00:02:20.890> is<00:02:20.920> that<00:02:21.790> by<00:02:21.970> covering<00:02:22.270> a<00:02:22.569> metal<00:02:22.959> like

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
answer is that by covering a metal like

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.410 
answer is that by covering a metal like
iron<00:02:23.380> with<00:02:23.950> another<00:02:24.310> more<00:02:24.550> reactive<00:02:25.030> metal

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
iron with another more reactive metal

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.320 
iron with another more reactive metal
like<00:02:25.840> zinc<00:02:26.200> is<00:02:26.470> that<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.340> zinc<00:02:27.580> forms<00:02:28.150> the

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
like zinc is that the zinc forms the

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.870 
like zinc is that the zinc forms the
zinc<00:02:28.540> oxide<00:02:29.020> layer<00:02:29.260> quickly<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.640> iron

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
zinc oxide layer quickly the iron

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.050 
zinc oxide layer quickly the iron
underneath<00:02:31.330> is<00:02:31.750> protected<00:02:32.590> this<00:02:33.310> process<00:02:33.849> is

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
underneath is protected this process is

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.600 
underneath is protected this process is
called<00:02:34.269> galvanizing<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.440> can<00:02:35.950> last<00:02:36.130> up<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:36.459> a

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
called galvanizing and can last up to a

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.270 
called galvanizing and can last up to a
hundred<00:02:37.060> years<00:02:37.410> if<00:02:38.410> you<00:02:38.590> think<00:02:38.800> on<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:38.980> metal

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
hundred years if you think on the metal

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.820 
hundred years if you think on the metal
on<00:02:39.400> a<00:02:39.459> bike<00:02:39.930> corrosion<00:02:40.930> can<00:02:41.110> be<00:02:41.170> prevented<00:02:41.769> by

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
on a bike corrosion can be prevented by

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.550 
on a bike corrosion can be prevented by
a<00:02:42.010> paint<00:02:42.459> in<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.700> frame<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:43.180> static<00:02:43.720> part<00:02:43.959> or

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
a paint in the frame a static part or

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.590 
a paint in the frame a static part or
greasing<00:02:45.099> the<00:02:45.220> metal<00:02:45.519> parts<00:02:45.880> like<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.330> chain

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
greasing the metal parts like the chain

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.020 
greasing the metal parts like the chain
which<00:02:46.870> moves<00:02:47.170> or<00:02:47.860> by<00:02:48.100> covering<00:02:48.549> it<00:02:48.760> with<00:02:48.970> a

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
which moves or by covering it with a

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.960 
which moves or by covering it with a
thin<00:02:49.360> layer<00:02:49.569> of<00:02:49.870> a<00:02:50.140> less<00:02:50.440> reactive<00:02:50.799> metal<00:02:51.370> like

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
thin layer of a less reactive metal like

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.330 
thin layer of a less reactive metal like
tin<00:02:52.299> copper<00:02:52.780> or<00:02:53.080> gold<00:02:53.290> but<00:02:53.950> that<00:02:54.069> would<00:02:54.190> be

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
tin copper or gold but that would be

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:02.920 
tin copper or gold but that would be
very<00:02:54.580> expensive

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.989
