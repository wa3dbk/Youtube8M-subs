inches<00:03:00.280> have<00:03:01.239> a<00:03:01.269> roller<00:03:01.540> bearing<00:03:01.900> in<00:03:02.079> so

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
inches have a roller bearing in so

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.979 
inches have a roller bearing in so
they're<00:03:02.680> easy<00:03:03.070> to<00:03:03.220> use<00:03:03.630> you<00:03:04.630> can<00:03:04.720> use<00:03:04.750> it<00:03:04.900> with

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
they're easy to use you can use it with

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.640 
they're easy to use you can use it with
one<00:03:05.170> hand<00:03:05.910> pretty<00:03:06.910> heavy<00:03:07.150> I<00:03:07.450> think<00:03:08.290> there<00:03:08.620> are

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
one hand pretty heavy I think there are

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.920 
one hand pretty heavy I think there are
about<00:03:08.739> sixty<00:03:09.220> bucks<00:03:09.370> apiece<00:03:09.579> and<00:03:10.090> you<00:03:10.780> can

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
about sixty bucks apiece and you can

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:17.150 
about sixty bucks apiece and you can
extend<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.380> arms<00:03:11.590> here<00:03:11.799> or<00:03:12.489> else<00:03:12.730> here<00:03:13.090> uh

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.229 

all-in-all<00:03:18.160> I<00:03:18.220> really<00:03:18.519> don't<00:03:18.670> have<00:03:18.730> much<00:03:19.000> bad

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
all-in-all I really don't have much bad

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.599 
all-in-all I really don't have much bad
to<00:03:19.480> say<00:03:19.660> about<00:03:19.690> the<00:03:19.959> lift<00:03:20.170> but<00:03:21.130> very<00:03:21.340> stable

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
to say about the lift but very stable

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.770 
to say about the lift but very stable
even<00:03:22.060> with<00:03:23.019> this<00:03:23.170> long<00:03:23.440> truck<00:03:23.950> on<00:03:24.190> it<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:25.660> only

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
even with this long truck on it the only

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:34.070 
even with this long truck on it the only
thing<00:03:25.870> I<00:03:26.440> could<00:03:26.980> say<00:03:27.160> that<00:03:27.310> I<00:03:27.400> don't<00:03:27.820> like<00:03:30.510> is

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.150 

these<00:03:35.080> pins<00:03:35.820> will<00:03:36.820> get<00:03:36.970> stuck<00:03:38.160> basically

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
these pins will get stuck basically

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.190 
these pins will get stuck basically
sometimes<00:03:39.370> when<00:03:40.150> you<00:03:40.240> lift<00:03:40.390> this<00:03:40.510> up<00:03:40.750> this<00:03:40.930> pen

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
sometimes when you lift this up this pen

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.260 
sometimes when you lift this up this pen
will<00:03:41.350> get<00:03:41.470> stuck<00:03:41.770> on<00:03:41.920> this<00:03:42.100> weld<00:03:42.400> and

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
will get stuck on this weld and

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.110 
will get stuck on this weld and
basically<00:03:43.810> hold<00:03:44.140> this<00:03:44.350> pin<00:03:44.650> up<00:03:44.890> from<00:03:45.880> going

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
basically hold this pin up from going

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.450 
basically hold this pin up from going
down<00:03:46.300> and<00:03:46.450> go<00:03:46.600> off<00:03:47.070> which<00:03:48.960> kind<00:03:49.960> of<00:03:50.020> a<00:03:50.080> design

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460 
down and go off which kind of a design

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.280 
down and go off which kind of a design
quirk<00:03:51.460> you<00:03:52.150> know<00:03:52.240> it's<00:03:52.420> not<00:03:52.570> a<00:03:52.630> big<00:03:52.930> deal<00:03:53.140> you

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
quirk you know it's not a big deal you

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.780 
quirk you know it's not a big deal you
can<00:03:53.350> just<00:03:53.440> go<00:03:53.680> flip<00:03:54.040> them<00:03:54.250> up<00:03:54.340> and<00:03:54.490> the<00:03:54.580> locks

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
can just go flip them up and the locks

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.060 
can just go flip them up and the locks
will<00:03:54.970> go<00:03:55.060> down<00:03:55.210> in<00:03:55.450> which<00:03:56.410> is<00:03:56.560> kind<00:03:56.680> of<00:03:56.770> a<00:03:56.860> pain

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
will go down in which is kind of a pain

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.120 
will go down in which is kind of a pain
in<00:03:57.160> the<00:03:57.190> butt<00:03:57.430> sometimes<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:59.590> other<00:03:59.740> thing

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
in the butt sometimes the other thing

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.320 
in the butt sometimes the other thing
that<00:04:00.490> I<00:04:00.700> don't<00:04:01.530> particularly<00:04:02.790> it's<00:04:03.790> not<00:04:04.000> a<00:04:04.030> big

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
that I don't particularly it's not a big

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.800 
that I don't particularly it's not a big
deal

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
deal

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
deal
more<00:04:05.560> of<00:04:05.710> a<00:04:05.880> pickiness<00:04:06.880> factor<00:04:07.740> because<00:04:08.740> I

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
more of a pickiness factor because I

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.090 
more of a pickiness factor because I
wish<00:04:09.010> they<00:04:09.160> would<00:04:09.310> have<00:04:09.400> put<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:11.650> holder<00:04:12.070> on

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
wish they would have put the holder on

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.480 
wish they would have put the holder on
the<00:04:12.370> other<00:04:12.580> side<00:04:12.880> as<00:04:13.090> well

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
the other side as well

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.699 
the other side as well
so<00:04:15.490> that<00:04:15.670> way<00:04:15.820> if<00:04:15.970> you're<00:04:16.120> working<00:04:16.540> on<00:04:17.020> this

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
so that way if you're working on this

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.949 
so that way if you're working on this
side<00:04:18.090> you<00:04:19.090> don't<00:04:19.239> have<00:04:19.330> to<00:04:19.450> come<00:04:19.570> back<00:04:19.720> here

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
side you don't have to come back here

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.200 
side you don't have to come back here
and<00:04:20.049> grab<00:04:20.290> it<00:04:20.320> it's<00:04:20.860> just<00:04:20.980> a<00:04:21.190> speed<00:04:21.880> thing

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
and grab it it's just a speed thing

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.090 
and grab it it's just a speed thing
that's<00:04:22.900> why<00:04:23.050> I<00:04:23.080> just<00:04:23.260> got<00:04:23.320> I'm<00:04:23.500> setting<00:04:23.890> here

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
that's why I just got I'm setting here

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.950 
that's why I just got I'm setting here
not<00:04:24.400> a<00:04:24.430> big<00:04:24.700> deal<00:04:24.940> but<00:04:25.150> sometimes<00:04:25.570> I'll<00:04:25.750> kick

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
not a big deal but sometimes I'll kick

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.020 
not a big deal but sometimes I'll kick
it<00:04:26.110> and<00:04:26.620> it'll<00:04:26.770> take<00:04:27.010> off<00:04:28.140> across<00:04:29.140> the<00:04:29.350> floor

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
it and it'll take off across the floor

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.780 
it and it'll take off across the floor
anyway<00:04:31.030> wonders<00:04:31.420> if<00:04:31.540> these<00:04:31.720> are<00:04:32.190> just<00:04:33.190> magnets

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
anyway wonders if these are just magnets

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.200 
anyway wonders if these are just magnets
for<00:04:34.620> lug<00:04:35.620> nuts<00:04:35.860> just<00:04:36.370> throw<00:04:36.580> your<00:04:36.670> lug<00:04:36.850> nuts<00:04:36.880> in

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
for lug nuts just throw your lug nuts in

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.150 
for lug nuts just throw your lug nuts in
there<00:04:37.420> that<00:04:37.630> way<00:04:37.780> they're<00:04:37.990> not<00:04:38.160> usually

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
there that way they're not usually

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.560 
there that way they're not usually
people<00:04:39.400> tend<00:04:39.640> to<00:04:39.700> stick<00:04:39.940> them<00:04:40.060> on<00:04:40.120> the<00:04:40.300> arms

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
people tend to stick them on the arms

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:41.760 
people tend to stick them on the arms
and<00:04:40.720> they<00:04:40.840> knock<00:04:41.020> them<00:04:41.230> off<00:04:41.350> and<00:04:41.590> they're<00:04:41.680> all

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
and they knock them off and they're all

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.620 
and they knock them off and they're all
over<00:04:41.920> the<00:04:42.040> garage<00:04:42.280> that's<00:04:42.820> all<00:04:43.000> those<00:04:43.180> are<00:04:43.420> I

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
over the garage that's all those are I

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.720 
over the garage that's all those are I
got<00:04:43.870> one<00:04:44.050> on<00:04:44.170> each<00:04:44.320> side<00:04:44.350> of<00:04:44.620> the<00:04:45.540> post<00:04:46.540> um<00:04:47.730> the

got one on each side of the post um the
other<00:04:48.790> thing<00:04:48.940> that<00:04:49.120> I<00:04:49.270> would<00:04:49.330> really

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
other thing that I would really

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.040 
other thing that I would really
recommend<00:04:51.850> especially<00:04:52.360> if<00:04:52.720> you're<00:04:52.810> working

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
think walk clear around the vehicle I

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.450

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
can actually get my I have a roll around

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.070 
can actually get my I have a roll around
Carter<00:05:51.970> I<00:05:52.000> can<00:05:52.240> actually<00:05:52.479> squeeze<00:05:52.690> through

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
Carter I can actually squeeze through

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.879 
Carter I can actually squeeze through
here<00:05:53.139> without<00:05:53.500> any<00:05:53.800> trouble<00:05:55.560> but<00:05:56.560> all<00:05:56.680> in<00:05:56.800> all

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:56.889 
here without any trouble but all in all

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:58.500 
here without any trouble but all in all
it's<00:05:57.040> been<00:05:57.190> a<00:05:57.250> really<00:05:57.520> good<00:05:57.669> lift<00:05:57.970> so<00:05:58.210> far<00:05:58.479> I

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
it's been a really good lift so far I

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:03.260 
it's been a really good lift so far I
think<00:05:58.720> I've<00:05:58.840> had<00:05:58.990> it<00:05:59.199> probably<00:05:59.380> about<00:05:59.830> a<00:05:59.889> year

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.520 

we'll<00:06:04.270> get<00:06:04.449> a<00:06:04.479> good<00:06:04.750> better<00:06:05.080> shot<00:06:05.410> of<00:06:05.470> this

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:05.530 
we'll get a good better shot of this

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.189 
we'll get a good better shot of this
thing<00:06:05.800> in<00:06:05.919> the<00:06:06.010> air

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 
thing in the air

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:09.900 
thing in the air
it<00:06:08.199> looks<00:06:08.440> like<00:06:08.560> the<00:06:08.740> back<00:06:08.919> tang<00:06:09.280> was<00:06:09.580> really

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:09.910 
it looks like the back tang was really

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.890 
it looks like the back tang was really
not<00:06:10.350> if<00:06:11.350> you<00:06:11.500> look<00:06:11.650> at<00:06:11.770> the<00:06:11.860> arms<00:06:12.220> they're

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 
not if you look at the arms they're

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.870 
not if you look at the arms they're
centered<00:06:13.900> in<00:06:14.080> the<00:06:14.169> truck<00:06:14.440> I<00:06:14.770> think<00:06:15.639> the

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 
centered in the truck I think the

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.370 
centered in the truck I think the
cameras<00:06:16.300> give<00:06:16.720> it<00:06:16.870> a<00:06:16.930> little<00:06:17.110> bit<00:06:17.199> of<00:06:17.290> an

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 
cameras give it a little bit of an

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.409 
cameras give it a little bit of an
illusion<00:06:17.620> but<00:06:19.080> hanging<00:06:20.080> pretty<00:06:20.380> nice<00:06:20.560> and

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419
