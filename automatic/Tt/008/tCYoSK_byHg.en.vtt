what's up guys it's john and today what

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.649 
what's up guys it's john and today what
i<00:00:02.100> thought<00:00:02.370> i<00:00:02.399> would<00:00:02.520> show<00:00:02.820> you<00:00:02.850> is<00:00:03.240> what<00:00:03.510> is

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
i thought i would show you is what is

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.700 
i thought i would show you is what is
probably<00:00:04.200> the<00:00:04.529> best<00:00:04.980> strategy<00:00:05.460> in<00:00:05.940> extinction

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:06.710 
probably the best strategy in extinction

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.140 
probably the best strategy in extinction
so<00:00:07.710> typically<00:00:08.429> when<00:00:08.610> somebody<00:00:08.940> play's

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
so typically when somebody play's

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.060 
so typically when somebody play's
extinction<00:00:09.780> what<00:00:09.929> they<00:00:10.019> like<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.230> do<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.740> find

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
extinction what they like to do is find

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.060 
extinction what they like to do is find
a<00:00:11.280> nice<00:00:11.580> corner<00:00:12.000> in<00:00:12.330> camp<00:00:12.780> there<00:00:13.080> but<00:00:13.650> what<00:00:13.950> I'm

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
a nice corner in camp there but what I'm

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.070 
a nice corner in camp there but what I'm
here<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.280> tell<00:00:14.519> you<00:00:14.580> is<00:00:14.940> that<00:00:14.969> that<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.570> not<00:00:15.599> the

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
here to tell you is that that is not the

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.349 
here to tell you is that that is not the
best<00:00:16.350> way<00:00:16.619> to<00:00:16.680> play<00:00:16.890> in<00:00:17.190> fact<00:00:17.760> what<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.090> want

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
best way to play in fact what you want

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.300 
best way to play in fact what you want
to<00:00:18.449> do<00:00:18.630> is<00:00:18.900> play<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:19.680> sort<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.130> have<00:00:20.279> a

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
to do is play it is sort of have a

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.820 
to do is play it is sort of have a
passive<00:00:21.029> play<00:00:21.300> style<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:22.380> want<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.740> be

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
passive play style you want to be

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.740 
passive play style you want to be
training<00:00:23.189> like<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.580> guys<00:00:23.760> may<00:00:24.029> have<00:00:24.269> seen<00:00:24.539> in

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
training like you guys may have seen in

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.810 
training like you guys may have seen in
my<00:00:24.960> video<00:00:25.320> that<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.619> uploaded<00:00:26.070> earlier<00:00:26.310> today

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
my video that I uploaded earlier today

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.019 
my video that I uploaded earlier today
so<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:27.840> can<00:00:28.320> actually<00:00:28.500> do<00:00:28.890> zombie<00:00:29.400> trains<00:00:29.789> in

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
so you can actually do zombie trains in

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.540 
so you can actually do zombie trains in
extinction<00:00:30.660> mode<00:00:31.019> by<00:00:31.590> taking<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.189> medic

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
extinction mode by taking the medic

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.580 
extinction mode by taking the medic
class<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.059> upgrading<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.750> all<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.079> way<00:00:34.260> and

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
class and upgrading it all the way and

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.119 
class and upgrading it all the way and
if<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.980> take<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.340> training<00:00:36.120> strategy<00:00:36.890> 28<00:00:37.890> to

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
if you take that training strategy 28 to

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.310 
if you take that training strategy 28 to
the<00:00:38.280> full<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:39.149> can<00:00:39.180> actually<00:00:39.480> use<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:40.110> on

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
the full you can actually use this on

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.190 
the full you can actually use this on
any<00:00:40.739> round<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.550> beat<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.210> without<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.750> problem

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
any round and beat it without a problem

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.410 
any round and beat it without a problem
so<00:00:43.739> you'll<00:00:43.890> notice<00:00:44.070> right<00:00:44.309> here<00:00:44.430> I'm<00:00:44.910> on<00:00:45.059> drill

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
so you'll notice right here I'm on drill

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.479 
so you'll notice right here I'm on drill
number<00:00:45.719> 9<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.860> one<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.219> higher

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
number 9 and this is one of the higher

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.100 
number 9 and this is one of the higher
drills<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.149> game<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.539> was<00:00:48.660> able<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.930> fly

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
drills in the game and I was able to fly

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.660 
drills in the game and I was able to fly
through<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.440> with<00:00:49.620> no<00:00:49.860> problem<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.550> way<00:00:50.640> I

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
through this with no problem the way I

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.549 
through this with no problem the way I
did<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.030> I'm<00:00:51.510> mobile<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.260> watch<00:00:52.379> this

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
did it I'm mobile and watch this

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.959 
did it I'm mobile and watch this
throwing<00:00:52.890> knife<00:00:53.039> hit<00:00:53.219> right<00:00:53.370> here<00:00:53.399> I've<00:00:53.910> just

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
throwing knife hit right here I've just

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.090 
throwing knife hit right here I've just
walked<00:00:54.539> by<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.719> book<00:00:54.989> pot<00:00:55.350> all<00:00:55.590> set<00:00:55.800> up<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.010> him

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
walked by a book pot all set up to him

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.220 
walked by a book pot all set up to him
in<00:00:56.190> boom<00:00:56.430> now<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.820> scorpion<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.539> mine<00:00:57.930> and

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
in boom now that scorpion is mine and

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.930 
in boom now that scorpion is mine and
basically<00:00:58.890> like<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.219> was<00:00:59.340> saying<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.609> way<00:00:59.760> this

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
basically like I was saying the way this

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.029 
basically like I was saying the way this
strategy<00:01:00.510> works<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.260> want<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.500> be<00:01:01.649> mobile

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
strategy works is you want to be mobile

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.009 
strategy works is you want to be mobile
so<00:01:02.430> you'll<00:01:02.579> notice<00:01:02.760> right<00:01:02.940> now<00:01:03.210> I'm<00:01:03.420> basically

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
so you'll notice right now I'm basically

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.140 
so you'll notice right now I'm basically
just<00:01:04.170> running<00:01:04.769> around<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.159> map<00:01:05.369> until<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
just running around the map until the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.080 
just running around the map until the
drill<00:01:06.570> gets<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.650> about<00:01:07.890> fifty<00:01:08.460> percent<00:01:08.490> help

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
drill gets to about fifty percent help

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.789 
drill gets to about fifty percent help
once<00:01:09.540> it's<00:01:09.689> at<00:01:09.780> fifty<00:01:10.020> percent<00:01:10.290> help<00:01:10.530> then<00:01:10.710> I

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
once it's at fifty percent help then I

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.950 
once it's at fifty percent help then I
run<00:01:10.979> over<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.490> fill<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.000> up<00:01:12.090> fill<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.630> just<00:01:12.810> go

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
run over and fill it up fill I just go

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.539 
run over and fill it up fill I just go
and<00:01:13.080> repair<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.650> now<00:01:14.040> you'll<00:01:14.220> notice<00:01:14.400> that

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
and repair it and now you'll notice that

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.730 
and repair it and now you'll notice that
I'm<00:01:14.880> using<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:16.170> shield<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.619> is

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
I'm using the the shield that is

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.190 
I'm using the the shield that is
upgraded<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.490> level<00:01:17.850> three<00:01:18.180> now<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.780> have<00:01:18.900> that

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
upgraded to level three now I have that

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.740 
upgraded to level three now I have that
upgraded<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.100> when<00:01:20.310> i<00:01:20.490> go<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.880> repair<00:01:21.720> a

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
upgraded so that when i go to repair a

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.830 
upgraded so that when i go to repair a
drill<00:01:22.380> i<00:01:22.650> won't<00:01:23.280> go<00:01:23.460> down<00:01:23.490> so<00:01:24.090> i'm<00:01:24.420> just<00:01:24.479> gonna

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
drill i won't go down so i'm just gonna

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.539 
drill i won't go down so i'm just gonna
keep<00:01:25.110> running<00:01:25.380> around<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.860> map<00:01:26.040> killing<00:01:26.430> any

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
keep running around the map killing any

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.700 
keep running around the map killing any
zombies<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:27.119> getting<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.570> my<00:01:27.720> way<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.200> then

I have to because you're gonna need to
repair<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.829> drill<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.310> learned<00:01:32.549> this<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
repair that drill I learned this the

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.300 
repair that drill I learned this the
hard<00:01:32.970> way<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.509> game<00:01:33.750> if<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:34.470> drill<00:01:34.829> reaches

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
hard way this game if that drill reaches

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.030 
hard way this game if that drill reaches
zero<00:01:35.610> your<00:01:35.939> game<00:01:36.210> will<00:01:36.450> end<00:01:36.780> I<00:01:37.049> actually<00:01:37.619> made

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
zero your game will end I actually made

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.010 
zero your game will end I actually made
it<00:01:38.189> all<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.460> way<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.610> about<00:01:38.909> 5<00:01:39.150> 10<00:01:39.450> out<00:01:39.659> doing

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
it all the way to about 5 10 out doing

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.140 
it all the way to about 5 10 out doing
just<00:01:40.229> fine<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.740> then<00:01:40.890> boom<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.369> let<00:01:41.759> my<00:01:41.880> drill

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
just fine and then boom I let my drill

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.760 
just fine and then boom I let my drill
died<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.360> thought<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.840> could<00:01:43.079> let<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.259> go<00:01:43.500> and

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
died I thought I could let it go and

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.560 
died I thought I could let it go and
then<00:01:43.860> just<00:01:44.189> basically<00:01:44.579> restart<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.270> drilling

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
then just basically restart the drilling

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.569 
then just basically restart the drilling
process<00:01:45.649> but<00:01:46.649> that's<00:01:46.860> not<00:01:47.070> how<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.399> works

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
process but that's not how it works

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.510 
process but that's not how it works
unfortunately<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.810> just<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.200> review<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:50.130> best

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
unfortunately so just to review the best

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.789 
unfortunately so just to review the best
strategy<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:51.329> extinction<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.590> be<00:01:52.770> a

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
strategy in extinction is to be a

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.550 
strategy in extinction is to be a
passive<00:01:53.490> trainer<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.329> like<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:54.810> said<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.320> want
