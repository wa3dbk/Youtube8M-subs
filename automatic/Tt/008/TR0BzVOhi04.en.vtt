00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
alright guys so you can see that both of

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.860 
alright guys so you can see that both of
these<00:00:34.590> units<00:00:34.920> are<00:00:35.309> fairly<00:00:35.610> compact<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.570> scoop

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
these units are fairly compact the scoop

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.740 
these units are fairly compact the scoop
a<00:00:37.020> little<00:00:37.050> more<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:37.890> than<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.670> b40<00:00:39.300> if<00:00:39.540> you're

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
a little more so than the b40 if you're

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.330 
a little more so than the b40 if you're
thinking<00:00:40.110> about<00:00:40.230> how<00:00:40.650> much<00:00:40.770> space<00:00:40.949> you're

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
thinking about how much space you're

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.510 
thinking about how much space you're
going<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.579> take<00:00:41.730> up<00:00:41.940> on<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.120> countertop<00:00:42.809> but<00:00:43.680> the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
going to take up on a countertop but the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.889 
going to take up on a countertop but the
big<00:00:44.730> difference<00:00:45.120> between<00:00:45.180> these<00:00:45.660> two

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
big difference between these two

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.420 
big difference between these two
machines<00:00:47.150> initially<00:00:48.150> is<00:00:48.360> how<00:00:48.839> they<00:00:49.110> brew<00:00:49.500> the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
machines initially is how they brew the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.740 
machines initially is how they brew the
scoop<00:00:50.879> brews<00:00:51.600> via<00:00:52.470> a<00:00:52.829> scoop<00:00:53.640> system<00:00:54.150> hence<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
scoop brews via a scoop system hence the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.350 
scoop brews via a scoop system hence the
name<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.769> which<00:00:56.070> we<00:00:56.339> just<00:00:56.579> simply<00:00:57.000> take<00:00:57.030> some

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
name in which we just simply take some

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:06.370 
name in which we just simply take some
coffee<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.190> fill<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.489> up<00:00:59.870> fill<00:01:00.870> up<00:01:00.989> our<00:01:01.110> scoop

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.139 

just<00:01:07.380> go<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.649> the<00:01:07.830> max<00:01:08.039> fill<00:01:08.460> line<00:01:08.490> on<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:09.149 
just go to the max fill line on the

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:10.820 
just go to the max fill line on the
scoop<00:01:09.420> right<00:01:09.660> here<00:01:09.690> and<00:01:10.080> then<00:01:10.440> we<00:01:10.560> just<00:01:10.680> simply

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
scoop right here and then we just simply

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.320 
scoop right here and then we just simply
drop<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.640> into<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.660> scoop<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:14.119> close<00:01:15.119> up

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
drop that into the scoop and close up

these two with the scoop I need to fill

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.190 
these two with the scoop I need to fill
it<00:02:20.519> up<00:02:20.579> with<00:02:20.730> some<00:02:20.970> water<00:02:21.209> before<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:21.810> start

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
it up with some water before I start

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.319 
it up with some water before I start
brewing<00:02:22.470> so<00:02:22.829> I've<00:02:23.100> just<00:02:23.130> got<00:02:23.489> some<00:02:24.120> water

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
brewing so I've just got some water

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:26.330 
brewing so I've just got some water
right<00:02:24.600> here<00:02:24.870> we've<00:02:24.989> got<00:02:25.019> an<00:02:25.290> 8<00:02:25.470> ounce<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:25.920> 14

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
take a little longer to brew because as

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.780 
take a little longer to brew because as
they<00:02:57.900> say<00:02:58.079> it's<00:02:58.260> a<00:02:58.349> drip<00:02:58.590> style<00:02:58.860> machine<00:02:59.250> so

today<00:03:14.510> this<00:03:15.510> way<00:03:15.810> we<00:03:16.200> can<00:03:16.440> test<00:03:16.769> the<00:03:17.579> actual

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
today this way we can test the actual

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.879 
today this way we can test the actual
temperature<00:03:18.900> of<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.109> water<00:03:19.349> that's<00:03:19.620> going<00:03:19.769> to

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
temperature of the water that's going to

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.619 
temperature of the water that's going to
be<00:03:19.980> coming<00:03:20.250> out<00:03:20.340> of<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.579> scoop<00:03:20.819> so<00:03:21.359> let's<00:03:21.510> let

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
be coming out of the scoop so let's let

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.119 
be coming out of the scoop so let's let
that<00:03:21.659> guy<00:03:21.989> do<00:03:22.049> his<00:03:22.319> job<00:03:22.379> and<00:03:22.680> we're<00:03:22.980> going<00:03:23.099> to

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
that guy do his job and we're going to

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.250 
that guy do his job and we're going to
move<00:03:23.280> over<00:03:23.459> here<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.239> beef<00:03:24.420> for<00:03:24.690> tea<00:03:24.870> the

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
move over here to the beef for tea the

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.170 
move over here to the beef for tea the
beef<00:03:25.440> for<00:03:25.680> tea<00:03:25.829> is<00:03:26.010> a<00:03:26.040> little<00:03:26.340> more<00:03:26.519> set<00:03:26.879> it<00:03:27.000> and

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
beef for tea is a little more set it and

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.039 
beef for tea is a little more set it and
forget<00:03:27.239> it

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
forget it

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:31.849 
forget it
because<00:03:28.409> it<00:03:28.680> has<00:03:28.889> namely<00:03:29.670> a<00:03:29.840> 48<00:03:30.840> ounce<00:03:31.139> water

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
because it has namely a 48 ounce water

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.009 
because it has namely a 48 ounce water
tank<00:03:32.010> which<00:03:32.760> is<00:03:32.909> always<00:03:33.060> filled<00:03:33.450> up<00:03:33.659> and<00:03:33.840> ready

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
tank which is always filled up and ready

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:36.619 
tank which is always filled up and ready
to<00:03:34.109> go<00:03:34.439> so<00:03:34.709> that's<00:03:35.099> really<00:03:35.340> useful<00:03:35.939> if<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:36.389> are

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
to go so that's really useful if you are

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.509 
to go so that's really useful if you are
on<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.930> move<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.530> you<00:03:37.920> have<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.129> get<00:03:38.310> up<00:03:38.430> in

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
on the move and you have to get up in

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.220 
on the move and you have to get up in
the<00:03:38.609> morning<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.090> just<00:03:39.239> get<00:03:39.480> going<00:03:39.510> this

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
the morning and just get going this

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.869 
the morning and just get going this
machine<00:03:40.620> is<00:03:40.799> going<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.069> really<00:03:41.280> answer<00:03:41.519> that

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
machine is going to really answer that

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.640 
machine is going to really answer that
need<00:03:42.150> for<00:03:42.420> you<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:42.659> just<00:03:42.870> get<00:03:43.019> a<00:03:43.049> pop<00:03:43.349> of<00:03:43.470> cake

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
need for you to just get a pop of cake

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.390 
need for you to just get a pop of cake
up<00:03:43.829> in<00:03:44.010> and<00:03:44.189> get<00:03:44.670> going<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:46.019> beef<00:03:46.200> 40<00:03:46.590> is<00:03:46.739> an

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
up in and get going the beef 40 is an

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.729 
up in and get going the beef 40 is an
entry-level<00:03:47.790> single<00:03:48.510> serve<00:03:48.690> machine<00:03:49.109> as<00:03:49.349> is

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
entry-level single serve machine as is

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.939 
entry-level single serve machine as is
the<00:03:50.340> scoop<00:03:50.760> and<00:03:50.970> so<00:03:51.780> as<00:03:52.019> a<00:03:52.049> result<00:03:52.319> it<00:03:52.680> doesn't

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 
the scoop and so as a result it doesn't

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:54.800 
the scoop and so as a result it doesn't
have<00:03:53.069> a<00:03:53.099> whole<00:03:53.280> lot<00:03:53.310> of<00:03:53.940> bells<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:54.389> whistles

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
have a whole lot of bells and whistles

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.530 
have a whole lot of bells and whistles
we<00:03:54.989> just<00:03:55.199> have<00:03:55.410> to<00:03:55.709> brew<00:03:56.010> sizes<00:03:56.609> right<00:03:57.180> here<00:03:57.449> in

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
we just have to brew sizes right here in

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.050 
we just have to brew sizes right here in
eight<00:03:57.720> ounce<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.230> a<00:03:58.290> 10<00:03:58.319> ounce<00:03:58.739> brew<00:03:59.129> size<00:03:59.430> so

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
eight ounce and a 10 ounce brew size so

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.059 
eight ounce and a 10 ounce brew size so
pretty<00:04:00.480> basic<00:04:00.720> not<00:04:01.590> a<00:04:01.620> whole<00:04:01.859> lot<00:04:02.040> of

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
pretty basic not a whole lot of

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.460 
pretty basic not a whole lot of
programmability<00:04:02.760> but<00:04:03.629> it<00:04:03.810> does<00:04:03.989> have<00:04:04.169> an<00:04:04.290> auto

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
programmability but it does have an auto

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.259 
programmability but it does have an auto
off<00:04:04.739> feature<00:04:04.769> so<00:04:05.489> it'll<00:04:05.699> heat<00:04:05.879> up<00:04:06.030> when<00:04:06.180> you

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
off feature so it'll heat up when you

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:07.819 
off feature so it'll heat up when you
need<00:04:06.419> it<00:04:06.599> in<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.840> middle<00:04:07.049> turn<00:04:07.260> off<00:04:07.470> if<00:04:07.680> you're

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
need it in the middle turn off if you're

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.589 
need it in the middle turn off if you're
not<00:04:07.859> going<00:04:08.099> to<00:04:08.190> be<00:04:08.280> using<00:04:08.639> it<00:04:08.760> save<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.060> energy

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
not going to be using it save you energy

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.689 
not going to be using it save you energy
save<00:04:10.379> the<00:04:10.560> machine<00:04:10.889> from<00:04:11.159> wear-and-tear

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:11.699 
save the machine from wear-and-tear

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:15.020 
save the machine from wear-and-tear
things<00:04:12.060> like<00:04:12.269> that<00:04:12.530> so<00:04:13.530> it's<00:04:14.099> also<00:04:14.280> very<00:04:14.609> fast

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
things like that so it's also very fast

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.250 
things like that so it's also very fast
I'm<00:04:15.359> just<00:04:15.510> going<00:04:15.629> to<00:04:15.659> go<00:04:15.780> ahead<00:04:15.840> and<00:04:16.019> do<00:04:16.109> the

I'm just going to go ahead and do the

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.830 
I'm just going to go ahead and do the
small<00:04:16.590> brew<00:04:16.919> size<00:04:17.190> on<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.849> beef<00:04:18.000> 40<00:04:18.359> here<00:04:18.659> and

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
small brew size on the beef 40 here and

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.920 
small brew size on the beef 40 here and
just<00:04:19.019> hit<00:04:19.199> the<00:04:19.620> 8<00:04:19.799> ounce<00:04:23.630> and<00:04:24.630> of<00:04:24.720> course

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
just hit the 8 ounce and of course

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.180 
just hit the 8 ounce and of course
you'll<00:04:25.080> notice<00:04:25.349> that<00:04:25.530> in<00:04:25.620> order<00:04:25.800> to<00:04:25.830> get<00:04:26.070> the

you'll notice that in order to get the

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.010 
you'll notice that in order to get the
Machine<00:04:26.490> ready<00:04:26.760> for<00:04:26.970> brewing<00:04:27.150> I<00:04:27.449> just<00:04:27.810> pop

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
Machine ready for brewing I just pop

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.260 
Machine ready for brewing I just pop
open<00:04:28.199> the<00:04:28.440> brew<00:04:28.590> basket<00:04:28.740> close<00:04:29.190> it<00:04:29.370> back<00:04:29.490> up<00:04:29.520> my

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
open the brew basket close it back up my

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.510 
open the brew basket close it back up my
buttons<00:04:30.870> start<00:04:31.380> glowing<00:04:31.740> and<00:04:32.099> then<00:04:32.220> I<00:04:32.250> can

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
buttons start glowing and then I can

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.159 
buttons start glowing and then I can
just<00:04:32.669> choose<00:04:32.880> which<00:04:33.150> brew<00:04:33.389> size<00:04:33.599> I<00:04:33.840> want<00:04:34.050> to

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
just choose which brew size I want to

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.680 
just choose which brew size I want to
use<00:04:34.320> so<00:04:35.099> we<00:04:35.220> can<00:04:35.400> see<00:04:35.580> the<00:04:35.849> scoop<00:04:36.180> just<00:04:36.479> now

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
use so we can see the scoop just now

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.899 
use so we can see the scoop just now
finished<00:04:37.199> brewing<00:04:37.530> and<00:04:37.919> I<00:04:38.280> was<00:04:38.400> talking<00:04:38.820> a

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:38.909 
finished brewing and I was talking a

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:41.000 
finished brewing and I was talking a
little<00:04:39.000> bit<00:04:39.270> about<00:04:39.419> features<00:04:39.690> there<00:04:40.229> and<00:04:40.440> we

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
little bit about features there and we

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.010 
little bit about features there and we
can<00:04:41.159> see<00:04:41.340> that<00:04:41.460> the<00:04:41.580> B<00:04:41.699> 40<00:04:42.060> is<00:04:42.180> already<00:04:42.570> going

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
can see that the B 40 is already going

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.200 
can see that the B 40 is already going
so<00:04:43.580> something<00:04:44.580> that's<00:04:44.610> worth<00:04:44.970> mentioning

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
so something that's worth mentioning

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.740 
so something that's worth mentioning
here<00:04:45.690> as<00:04:45.840> well<00:04:46.169> there's<00:04:46.680> a<00:04:46.770> lot<00:04:47.039> more<00:04:47.190> pressure

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
here as well there's a lot more pressure

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.290 
here as well there's a lot more pressure
in<00:04:48.750> the<00:04:49.050> brew<00:04:49.260> cycle<00:04:49.560> of<00:04:49.919> the<00:04:50.039> B<00:04:50.159> 40<00:04:50.610> than<00:04:51.120> there

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
in the brew cycle of the B 40 than there

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.120 
in the brew cycle of the B 40 than there
is<00:04:51.330> in<00:04:51.870> the<00:04:51.960> scoop<00:04:52.380> in<00:04:52.560> fact<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:52.889> scoop

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
is in the scoop in fact the scoop

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.279 
is in the scoop in fact the scoop
essentially<00:04:54.029> has<00:04:54.150> no<00:04:54.180> pressure<00:04:54.659> because<00:04:55.020> as<00:04:55.169> I

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
essentially has no pressure because as I

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:56.070 
essentially has no pressure because as I
say<00:04:55.529> it

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
say it

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.010 
say it
a drip<00:04:56.439> style<00:04:56.830> coffee<00:04:57.189> machine<00:04:57.759> but<00:04:58.449> it<00:04:58.750> makes

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
a drip style coffee machine but it makes

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.499 
a drip style coffee machine but it makes
use<00:04:59.439> of<00:04:59.470> the<00:05:00.220> standards<00:05:00.729> of<00:05:00.909> single<00:05:01.300> serve

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:01.509 
use of the standards of single serve

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:04.529 
use of the standards of single serve
coffee<00:05:01.810> in<00:05:02.139> a<00:05:02.199> lot<00:05:02.349> of<00:05:02.379> ways<00:05:02.650> so<00:05:03.460> it<00:05:03.759> is<00:05:04.210> still<00:05:04.479> a

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:04.539 
coffee in a lot of ways so it is still a

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:06.029 
coffee in a lot of ways so it is still a
great<00:05:04.750> way<00:05:04.840> to<00:05:05.020> get<00:05:05.289> into<00:05:05.560> single<00:05:05.740> serve

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 
great way to get into single serve

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:07.290 
great way to get into single serve
coffee<00:05:06.280> but<00:05:06.669> it's<00:05:06.789> really<00:05:06.939> going<00:05:07.180> to<00:05:07.240> depend

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
coffee but it's really going to depend

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.869 
coffee but it's really going to depend
on<00:05:07.810> what<00:05:08.080> it<00:05:08.169> is<00:05:08.199> that<00:05:08.319> you<00:05:08.770> want<00:05:09.099> out<00:05:09.340> of<00:05:09.400> your

00:05:09.869 --> 00:05:09.879 
on what it is that you want out of your

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:12.420 
on what it is that you want out of your
single<00:05:10.240> serve<00:05:10.419> machine<00:05:10.979> so<00:05:11.979> let's<00:05:12.189> take<00:05:12.400> a

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
single serve machine so let's take a

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.920 
single serve machine so let's take a
look<00:05:12.669> right<00:05:12.879> now<00:05:12.939> at<00:05:13.090> the<00:05:13.330> temperature

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
look right now at the temperature

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.600 
look right now at the temperature
between<00:05:14.500> these<00:05:15.009> two<00:05:15.250> machines<00:05:15.430> as<00:05:15.909> well

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
between these two machines as well

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.550 
between these two machines as well
alright<00:05:18.610> so<00:05:18.870> immediately<00:05:19.870> we<00:05:20.199> see<00:05:20.409> our

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
alright so immediately we see our

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.379 
alright so immediately we see our
thermometer<00:05:21.159> doing<00:05:21.430> its<00:05:21.580> job<00:05:21.879> on<00:05:21.909> the<00:05:22.180> beef

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
thermometer doing its job on the beef

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:26.249 
thermometer doing its job on the beef
for<00:05:22.810> tea<00:05:23.020> and<00:05:24.120> it<00:05:25.120> looks<00:05:25.300> like<00:05:25.389> it's<00:05:25.719> topping

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:26.259 
for tea and it looks like it's topping

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:31.200 
for tea and it looks like it's topping
out<00:05:27.900> little<00:05:28.900> over<00:05:29.550> 160<00:05:30.550> maybe<00:05:30.849> a<00:05:30.969> little

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
out little over 160 maybe a little

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.580 
out little over 160 maybe a little
higher<00:05:31.569> and<00:05:31.930> then<00:05:32.530> over<00:05:32.770> here<00:05:32.800> on<00:05:33.280> the<00:05:33.430> scoop

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
higher and then over here on the scoop

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:40.140 
higher and then over here on the scoop
we're<00:05:35.590> a<00:05:35.620> little<00:05:35.830> below<00:05:36.780> 160<00:05:37.860> so<00:05:38.860> a<00:05:39.150> little

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
we're a little below 160 so a little

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.540 
we're a little below 160 so a little
above<00:05:40.360> 160<00:05:41.169> on<00:05:41.289> the<00:05:41.409> beef<00:05:41.560> 40<00:05:42.039> and<00:05:42.219> a<00:05:42.280> little

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
above 160 on the beef 40 and a little

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.659 
above 160 on the beef 40 and a little

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
below that on the scoop now most folks

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:49.559 
below that on the scoop now most folks

to<00:05:49.840> 200<00:05:50.620> degrees<00:05:51.069> that<00:05:51.819> may<00:05:51.909> sound<00:05:52.090> a<00:05:52.300> little

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
to 200 degrees that may sound a little

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.659 
to 200 degrees that may sound a little
crazy<00:05:52.840> but<00:05:53.050> we<00:05:53.650> all<00:05:53.800> know<00:05:54.039> that<00:05:54.069> we<00:05:54.340> do<00:05:54.490> get

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
crazy but we all know that we do get

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:56.459 
crazy but we all know that we do get
coffee<00:05:54.939> that's<00:05:55.240> pretty<00:05:55.509> darn<00:05:55.779> hot<00:05:56.080> most<00:05:56.319> of

00:05:56.459 --> 00:05:56.469 
coffee that's pretty darn hot most of

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:58.679 
coffee that's pretty darn hot most of
the<00:05:56.560> time<00:05:56.740> so<00:05:57.099> if<00:05:57.310> you<00:05:57.819> like<00:05:58.060> your<00:05:58.270> coffee<00:05:58.509> a

00:05:58.679 --> 00:05:58.689 
the time so if you like your coffee a

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:00.689 
the time so if you like your coffee a
little<00:05:58.900> hotter<00:05:59.319> with<00:05:59.800> the<00:05:59.949> scoop<00:06:00.310> it<00:06:00.580> is

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:00.699 
little hotter with the scoop it is

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:04.619 
little hotter with the scoop it is
advised<00:06:01.090> that<00:06:01.449> you<00:06:02.490> rinse<00:06:03.490> your<00:06:03.610> mug<00:06:04.060> in<00:06:04.419> some

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:04.629 
advised that you rinse your mug in some

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:06.240 
advised that you rinse your mug in some
hot<00:06:04.810> water<00:06:04.840> or<00:06:05.349> something<00:06:05.650> like<00:06:05.770> that<00:06:05.830> to<00:06:06.129> kind

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
hot water or something like that to kind

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.909 
hot water or something like that to kind
of<00:06:06.370> prime<00:06:06.789> the<00:06:07.029> mug<00:06:07.240> before<00:06:07.750> you<00:06:07.960> brew<00:06:08.259> into<00:06:08.770> it

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 
of prime the mug before you brew into it

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:10.409 
of prime the mug before you brew into it
so<00:06:09.430> that's<00:06:09.550> something<00:06:09.789> to<00:06:09.879> keep<00:06:10.029> in<00:06:10.180> mind

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
so that's something to keep in mind

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:12.570 
so that's something to keep in mind
before<00:06:10.900> tea<00:06:11.229> obviously<00:06:11.349> brews<00:06:11.889> a<00:06:11.919> little<00:06:12.400> bit

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
before tea obviously brews a little bit

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.149 
before tea obviously brews a little bit
hotter<00:06:12.879> and<00:06:13.319> you<00:06:14.319> don't<00:06:14.500> necessarily<00:06:14.650> need<00:06:15.099> to

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:15.159 
hotter and you don't necessarily need to

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:17.309 
hotter and you don't necessarily need to
worry<00:06:15.520> about<00:06:15.729> rinsing<00:06:16.120> the<00:06:16.449> mug<00:06:16.690> in<00:06:16.960> hot<00:06:17.139> water

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:17.319 
worry about rinsing the mug in hot water

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:19.619 
worry about rinsing the mug in hot water
or<00:06:17.529> anything<00:06:17.800> before<00:06:18.279> you<00:06:18.400> get<00:06:18.580> going<00:06:18.969> so<00:06:19.479> when
