and on to it that's when you get a grind
you<00:01:30.960> don't<00:01:31.110> miss<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> grind<00:01:31.740> because<00:01:32.490> you

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
you don't miss a grind because you

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.070 
you don't miss a grind because you
didn't<00:01:32.940> press<00:01:33.120> the<00:01:33.300> button<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.810> missed<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
didn't press the button you missed the

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.540 
didn't press the button you missed the
grind<00:01:34.320> because<00:01:34.410> you<00:01:34.620> didn't<00:01:34.890> land<00:01:35.040> on<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.460> the

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
grind because you didn't land on to the

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.730 
grind because you didn't land on to the
rail<00:01:35.730> takes<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.510> bit<00:01:36.660> of<00:01:36.690> getting<00:01:36.780> used<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.290> but

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
rail takes a bit of getting used to but

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.290 
rail takes a bit of getting used to but
once<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.070> do<00:01:38.220> figure<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.580> out<00:01:38.670> it's<00:01:38.910> just<00:01:39.030> a

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
once you do figure it out it's just a

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.270 
once you do figure it out it's just a
nice<00:01:39.420> rewarding<00:01:40.050> smooth<00:01:40.260> way<00:01:40.440> to<00:01:40.500> play<00:01:40.770> to

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
nice rewarding smooth way to play to

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.410 
nice rewarding smooth way to play to
land<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.610> two<00:01:41.700> different<00:01:41.880> grinds<00:01:42.330> you

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
land in two different grinds you

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.880 
land in two different grinds you
actually<00:01:42.660> adjust<00:01:43.170> your<00:01:43.290> board<00:01:43.560> while<00:01:43.740> you're

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
actually adjust your board while you're

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.040 
actually adjust your board while you're
in<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.070> air<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.430> volleyed<00:01:45.330> coming<00:01:45.690> down<00:01:45.840> on<00:01:45.870> a

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
in the air I volleyed coming down on a

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.140 
in the air I volleyed coming down on a
rail<00:01:46.230> pushing<00:01:46.680> forward<00:01:47.100> that's<00:01:47.640> how<00:01:47.760> my<00:01:47.940> nose

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
rail pushing forward that's how my nose

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.850 
rail pushing forward that's how my nose
will<00:01:48.360> come<00:01:48.510> down<00:01:48.690> to<00:01:48.840> land<00:01:49.080> into<00:01:49.230> a<00:01:49.350> nose<00:01:49.560> grind

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
will come down to land into a nose grind

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.800 
will come down to land into a nose grind
or<00:01:50.430> push<00:01:50.760> forward<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.060> swing<00:01:51.330> it<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.480> the<00:01:51.600> side

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
or push forward and swing it to the side

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.510 
or push forward and swing it to the side
I<00:01:51.840> can<00:01:52.080> turn<00:01:52.410> my<00:01:52.560> nose<00:01:52.620> over<00:01:52.980> to<00:01:53.070> land<00:01:53.220> into<00:01:53.400> a

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
I can turn my nose over to land into a

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.850 
I can turn my nose over to land into a
nose<00:01:53.700> slider<00:01:54.060> bluntslide<00:01:54.540> or<00:01:55.290> just<00:01:55.560> straight

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
nose slider bluntslide or just straight

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.440 
nose slider bluntslide or just straight
to<00:01:56.010> the<00:01:56.100> side<00:01:56.340> my<00:01:56.550> board<00:01:56.790> will<00:01:56.880> turn<00:01:57.030> sideways

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
to the side my board will turn sideways

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.450 
to the side my board will turn sideways
underneath<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.990> skater<00:01:58.260> and<00:01:58.530> land<00:01:59.130> into<00:01:59.340> a

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
underneath the skater and land into a

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.490 
underneath the skater and land into a
boardslide<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.540> it's<00:02:00.660> that<00:02:00.810> board<00:02:01.110> adjust

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
boardslide so it's that board adjust

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.930 
boardslide so it's that board adjust
again<00:02:01.650> the<00:02:01.950> board<00:02:02.160> control<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.760> air<00:02:02.910> that

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
again the board control in the air that

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.960 
again the board control in the air that
sets<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.540> up<00:02:03.570> for<00:02:03.630> different<00:02:04.110> grinds<00:02:04.500> and

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
sets you up for different grinds and

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.740 
sets you up for different grinds and
that's<00:02:05.970> how<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.150> have<00:02:06.240> to<00:02:06.330> do<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.540> in<00:02:06.630> real

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
that's how you have to do it in real

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.660 
that's how you have to do it in real
skateboarding<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.500> that's<00:02:08.100> how<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.310> set<00:02:08.550> up

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
skateboarding and that's how you set up

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.030 
skateboarding and that's how you set up
to<00:02:08.820> a<00:02:08.850> nice<00:02:09.090> smooth<00:02:09.510> animation<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.800> next

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
to a nice smooth animation to the next

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.410 
to a nice smooth animation to the next
thing<00:02:11.220> it's<00:02:11.400> not<00:02:11.459> something<00:02:11.820> you<00:02:11.850> decide<00:02:12.240> at

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
thing it's not something you decide at

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.880 
thing it's not something you decide at
the<00:02:12.450> last<00:02:12.570> second<00:02:13.110> it's<00:02:13.500> something<00:02:13.680> you

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
the last second it's something you

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.280 
the last second it's something you
really<00:02:13.920> do<00:02:14.280> set<00:02:14.580> up<00:02:14.700> for<00:02:14.940> it's<00:02:15.510> really<00:02:16.050> simple

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
really do set up for it's really simple

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.830 
really do set up for it's really simple
what<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.130> do<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.490> what<00:02:17.520> you<00:02:17.760> get<00:02:17.910> you<00:02:18.660> don't

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
what you do is what you get you don't

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.050 
what you do is what you get you don't
have<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.110> memorize<00:02:19.470> or<00:02:19.680> learn<00:02:19.830> anything<00:02:20.100> once

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
have to memorize or learn anything once

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.880 
have to memorize or learn anything once
you've<00:02:21.240> taken<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:21.959> first<00:02:22.170> few<00:02:22.440> minutes<00:02:22.740> and

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
you've taken that first few minutes and

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.320 
you've taken that first few minutes and
the<00:02:23.010> thing<00:02:23.190> clicks<00:02:23.490> in<00:02:23.640> your<00:02:23.760> head<00:02:23.910> that<00:02:23.940> says

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
the thing clicks in your head that says

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.390 
the thing clicks in your head that says
oh<00:02:24.510> that's<00:02:24.930> how<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.290> works<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:26.280> learning

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
oh that's how it works the learning

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.550 
oh that's how it works the learning
curve<00:02:26.640> is<00:02:26.760> just<00:02:26.910> nice<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.120> smooth<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:27.990> you

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
curve is just nice and smooth and you

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.000 
curve is just nice and smooth and you
can<00:02:28.650> become<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:28.860> great<00:02:29.070> skater<00:02:29.370> really<00:02:29.730> quickly
