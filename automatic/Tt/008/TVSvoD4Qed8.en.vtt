the<00:00:17.330> trouble<00:00:18.019> we're<00:00:18.140> trying<00:00:18.380> to<00:00:18.470> perform<00:00:18.830> this

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:19.009 
the trouble we're trying to perform this

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.830 
the trouble we're trying to perform this
is

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.130 

this<00:00:23.840> technique<00:00:24.350> I<00:00:24.500> actually<00:00:24.740> call<00:00:26.140> the

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
this technique I actually call the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.930 
this technique I actually call the
infinite<00:00:27.770> combo<00:00:29.920> let<00:00:30.920> me<00:00:31.070> try<00:00:31.280> and<00:00:31.340> explain<00:00:31.520> it

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
infinite combo let me try and explain it

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.910 
infinite combo let me try and explain it
would<00:00:32.450> be<00:00:32.660> like<00:00:33.790> you<00:00:34.790> performing<00:00:35.540> a<00:00:35.920> combo

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
would be like you performing a combo

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.700 
would be like you performing a combo
stop<00:00:37.370> your<00:00:37.670> combo<00:00:38.210> or<00:00:38.480> canceling<00:00:39.050> your<00:00:39.140> combo

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
stop your combo or canceling your combo

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.660 
stop your combo or canceling your combo

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
with a ninja - which is pressing a twice

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.610 
with a ninja - which is pressing a twice
and<00:00:43.670> then<00:00:43.910> throwing<00:00:44.270> the<00:00:44.510> tag<00:00:44.780> but<00:00:45.110> cancelling

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
and then throwing the tag but cancelling

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.189 
and then throwing the tag but cancelling
your<00:00:45.650> yo<00:00:46.489> tag<00:00:48.100> win<00:00:49.100> a<00:00:49.660> chocolate<00:00:50.660> mess<00:00:50.809> which<00:00:51.080> I

nope

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.309 

instead

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
instead

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.990 
instead

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
try this again maybe you actually use

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:15.200 
try this again maybe you actually use
the<00:03:06.299> CP<00:03:06.750> upon

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.420 

you<00:03:15.420> can<00:03:15.600> actually<00:03:15.780> perform<00:03:16.290> that<00:03:16.800> while<00:03:17.220> the

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
you can actually perform that while the

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.020

opponent<00:03:17.670> still<00:03:18.060> has<00:03:18.300> chakra<00:03:18.870> but<00:03:19.170> it's

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
opponent still has chakra but it's

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.030 
opponent still has chakra but it's
easier<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.240> get

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
easier to get

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.479 
easier to get
I'll<00:03:23.400> talk<00:03:23.640> to<00:03:23.670> pretty<00:03:24.659> much<00:03:24.870> example<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:26.280> you

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
I'll talk to pretty much example and you

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.740 
I'll talk to pretty much example and you
can<00:03:26.700> you<00:03:27.420> can<00:03:27.599> do<00:03:27.780> about<00:03:28.079> a<00:03:28.969> to<00:03:29.969> combo

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.380 
can you can do about a to combo
cancellation<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.890> a<00:03:31.920> full<00:03:32.609> combo

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
cancellation to a full combo

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.020 
cancellation to a full combo
meaning<00:03:34.810> you<00:03:34.990> can<00:03:35.200> start<00:03:35.530> a<00:03:35.590> combo<00:03:35.860> stop<00:03:36.580> it<00:03:36.819> do

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
that little taking in country shows you

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.180 
that little taking in country shows you
starting<00:03:39.850> another<00:03:40.000> combo<00:03:40.569> stop<00:03:40.959> it<00:03:41.230> do<00:03:42.010> that

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
the time ranges that we get in a chopper

00:03:49.209 --> 00:04:00.309 
the time ranges that we get in a chopper
back<00:03:51.090> whether<00:03:52.090> nice<00:03:52.390> enough<00:03:52.750> to<00:03:52.900> serve
