if<00:00:34.079> I'm<00:00:34.290> honest<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.739> think<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.070> steps<00:00:35.309> are<00:00:35.460> a

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
if I'm honest I think the steps are a

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.340 
if I'm honest I think the steps are a
little<00:00:35.730> too<00:00:35.820> close<00:00:36.059> together<00:00:36.270> my<00:00:36.660> stride<00:00:36.960> but

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
little too close together my stride but

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.110 
little too close together my stride but
they<00:00:37.710> are<00:00:37.829> perfect<00:00:38.309> for<00:00:38.399> me<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.579> take<00:00:38.730> two<00:00:38.910> at<00:00:39.030> a

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
they are perfect for me to take two at a

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.430 
they are perfect for me to take two at a
time<00:00:39.149> while<00:00:39.540> pretending<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.989> grass<00:00:40.200> is
