00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
lawsuit that essentially shut the water

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.860 
lawsuit that essentially shut the water
virtually<00:06:03.700> completely<00:06:04.090> off<00:06:04.360> to<00:06:04.600> where<00:06:04.750> we

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
virtually completely off to where we

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:06.180 
virtually completely off to where we
have<00:06:05.020> a<00:06:05.050> year<00:06:05.260> like<00:06:05.410> this<00:06:05.560> year<00:06:05.800> where<00:06:05.950> we<00:06:05.980> have

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
have a year like this year where we have

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.170 
have a year like this year where we have
a<00:06:06.220> hundred<00:06:06.520> and<00:06:06.700> twenty-nine<00:06:07.000> percent

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
a hundred and twenty-nine percent

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.240 
a hundred and twenty-nine percent
rainfall<00:06:07.750> and<00:06:07.990> we're<00:06:08.650> going<00:06:08.770> to<00:06:08.800> only<00:06:09.070> get

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
rainfall and we're going to only get

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.760 
rainfall and we're going to only get
twenty-five<00:06:09.730> percent<00:06:09.910> of<00:06:10.330> our<00:06:10.870> water<00:06:11.170> okay

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
twenty-five percent of our water okay

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.070 
twenty-five percent of our water okay
and<00:06:11.980> so<00:06:12.340> what<00:06:12.550> happens<00:06:12.970> is<00:06:13.180> in<00:06:13.420> my<00:06:13.540> in<00:06:13.750> the<00:06:13.870> San
