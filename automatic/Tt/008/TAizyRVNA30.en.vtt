00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
down on the ground and pick it up from

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.170 
down on the ground and pick it up from
five<00:00:47.830> to<00:00:48.040> eight<00:00:48.190> minutes<00:00:48.220> now<00:00:48.820> that<00:00:49.030> sounds

like a lot and you want to make sure you

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:52.289 
like a lot and you want to make sure you
set<00:00:50.860> no<00:00:51.070> time<00:00:51.309> limit<00:00:51.610> on<00:00:51.670> the<00:00:51.790> map<00:00:51.940> that<00:00:52.119> you're

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:52.299 
set no time limit on the map that you're

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:54.689 
set no time limit on the map that you're
on<00:00:52.420> and<00:00:53.409> if<00:00:53.769> it<00:00:53.979> is<00:00:54.070> in<00:00:54.220> a<00:00:54.280> multiplayer<00:00:54.549> game

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
on and if it is in a multiplayer game

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.609 
on and if it is in a multiplayer game
online<00:00:55.269> it's<00:00:55.809> going<00:00:55.930> to<00:00:55.989> be<00:00:56.049> difficult<00:00:56.199> to<00:00:56.530> be

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:56.619 
online it's going to be difficult to be

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:57.780 
online it's going to be difficult to be
able<00:00:56.739> to<00:00:56.799> pull<00:00:56.949> that<00:00:57.070> off<00:00:57.100> because<00:00:57.400> you<00:00:57.640> need

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
able to pull that off because you need

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.969 
able to pull that off because you need
such<00:00:57.970> a<00:00:58.000> long<00:00:58.239> time<00:00:58.479> to<00:00:58.510> do<00:00:58.780> it<00:00:58.930> but<00:00:59.500> once<00:00:59.860> you

00:00:59.969 --> 00:00:59.979 
such a long time to do it but once you

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:01.410 
such a long time to do it but once you
start<00:01:00.250> to<00:01:00.280> do<00:01:00.460> it<00:01:00.610> you<00:01:00.729> got<00:01:00.850> to<00:01:00.970> throw<00:01:01.210> it<00:01:01.269> down

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
start to do it you got to throw it down

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.729 
start to do it you got to throw it down
and<00:01:01.629> pick<00:01:01.720> it<00:01:01.809> up<00:01:01.900> and<00:01:02.110> do<00:01:02.199> it<00:01:02.290> as<00:01:02.379> quickly<00:01:02.559> as

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
and pick it up and do it as quickly as

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.170 
and pick it up and do it as quickly as
possible<00:01:02.769> that<00:01:03.400> will<00:01:03.549> shorten<00:01:03.850> the<00:01:03.970> amount<00:01:04.000> of

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
possible that will shorten the amount of

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.179 
possible that will shorten the amount of
time<00:01:04.360> that<00:01:04.390> it<00:01:04.570> takes<00:01:04.659> so<00:01:04.989> minimum<00:01:05.830> amount<00:01:06.070> of

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189 
time that it takes so minimum amount of

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:07.440 
time that it takes so minimum amount of
time<00:01:06.340> if<00:01:06.580> you're<00:01:06.670> throwing<00:01:06.880> and<00:01:07.090> picking<00:01:07.360> up

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
time if you're throwing and picking up

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.450 
time if you're throwing and picking up
quickly<00:01:07.689> is<00:01:07.840> about<00:01:08.049> five<00:01:08.290> minutes<00:01:08.560> so<00:01:09.130> when

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
quickly is about five minutes so when

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.280 
quickly is about five minutes so when
that<00:01:09.580> happens<00:01:10.030> then<00:01:10.299> you've<00:01:11.049> kind<00:01:11.260> of

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:11.290 
that happens then you've kind of

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.230 
that happens then you've kind of
overloaded<00:01:11.830> the<00:01:11.860> game<00:01:12.159> all<00:01:12.430> of<00:01:12.670> your<00:01:12.850> bouncing

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
overloaded the game all of your bouncing

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.760 
overloaded the game all of your bouncing
Betties<00:01:13.570> and<00:01:13.600> tactical<00:01:14.200> insertions<00:01:14.619> and

Betties and tactical insertions and

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.020 
Betties and tactical insertions and
stuff<00:01:14.920> like<00:01:15.010> that<00:01:15.070> won't<00:01:15.460> actually<00:01:15.670> show<00:01:15.850> up

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
stuff like that won't actually show up

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.730 
stuff like that won't actually show up
if<00:01:16.390> you<00:01:16.509> throw<00:01:16.719> down<00:01:16.869> a<00:01:16.899> care<00:01:17.109> package<00:01:17.289> that's

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
if you throw down a care package that's

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.990 
if you throw down a care package that's
not<00:01:17.979> going<00:01:18.100> to<00:01:18.189> show<00:01:18.310> up<00:01:18.340> it'll<00:01:18.579> all<00:01:18.850> be

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
not going to show up it'll all be

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.359 
not going to show up it'll all be
invisible<00:01:19.420> now<00:01:20.109> when<00:01:20.409> you<00:01:20.439> shoot<00:01:20.829> a<00:01:20.950> car<00:01:21.189> and

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
invisible now when you shoot a car and

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.760 
invisible now when you shoot a car and
it<00:01:21.429> blows<00:01:21.640> up<00:01:21.700> um<00:01:22.420> it<00:01:22.780> just<00:01:22.810> like<00:01:23.170> bounces<00:01:23.619> into

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
it blows up um it just like bounces into

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.529 
it blows up um it just like bounces into
the<00:01:23.920> air<00:01:24.070> the<00:01:24.340> model<00:01:24.700> doesn't<00:01:24.880> actually<00:01:25.119> go<00:01:25.479> to

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
the air the model doesn't actually go to

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:27.749 
the air the model doesn't actually go to
the<00:01:25.750> burnt<00:01:26.020> version<00:01:26.439> so<00:01:26.679> this<00:01:27.159> car<00:01:27.460> is<00:01:27.609> about

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
the burnt version so this car is about

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.429 
the burnt version so this car is about
to<00:01:28.030> blow<00:01:28.240> up<00:01:28.270> here<00:01:28.659> and<00:01:28.749> it<00:01:28.840> will<00:01:28.869> blow<00:01:29.200> up<00:01:29.289> in<00:01:29.380> a

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:29.439 
to blow up here and it will blow up in a

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.260

blew up but is actually ok and as you

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.700 
blew up but is actually ok and as you
can<00:01:37.539> see<00:01:37.570> here<00:01:37.990> when<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.259> stuff<00:01:38.469> actually

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
can see here when the stuff actually

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.789 
can see here when the stuff actually
gets<00:01:39.159> dropped<00:01:39.700> down<00:01:39.880> onto<00:01:40.119> the<00:01:40.240> ground<00:01:40.799> it's

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
gets dropped down onto the ground it's

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.760 
gets dropped down onto the ground it's
still<00:01:42.270> it's<00:01:43.270> still<00:01:43.450> invisible<00:01:43.869> so<00:01:44.289> everything

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
still it's still invisible so everything

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:45.870 
still it's still invisible so everything
that<00:01:44.799> you<00:01:45.009> throw<00:01:45.219> down<00:01:45.399> is<00:01:45.579> going<00:01:45.729> to<00:01:45.789> be

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
that you throw down is going to be

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.149 
that you throw down is going to be
invisible<00:01:46.090> as<00:01:46.509> far<00:01:47.109> as<00:01:47.140> you<00:01:47.679> know<00:01:47.799> bouncing

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
stuff like that like I said it is a

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.039 
stuff like that like I said it is a
little<00:01:51.850> bit<00:01:51.939> of<00:01:51.969> an<00:01:52.060> exercise<00:01:52.270> in<00:01:52.450> patience<00:01:52.929> to

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
little bit of an exercise in patience to

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:54.450 
little bit of an exercise in patience to
be<00:01:53.109> able<00:01:53.170> to<00:01:53.319> throw<00:01:53.469> it<00:01:53.560> down<00:01:53.710> for<00:01:53.979> that<00:01:54.189> long

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
be able to throw it down for that long

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.580 
be able to throw it down for that long
but<00:01:55.060> it's<00:01:55.450> pretty<00:01:55.600> cool<00:01:55.869> when<00:01:56.049> you<00:01:56.109> do<00:01:56.289> it<00:01:56.409> and

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
but it's pretty cool when you do it and

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.050 
but it's pretty cool when you do it and
it<00:01:56.859> will<00:01:56.950> happen<00:01:57.159> for<00:01:57.429> everyone<00:01:57.579> else<00:01:57.759> so<00:01:57.939> it's

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
it will happen for everyone else so it's

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.340 
it will happen for everyone else so it's
kind<00:01:58.210> of<00:01:58.240> fun<00:01:58.420> to<00:01:58.450> mess<00:01:58.630> with<00:01:58.780> your<00:01:58.899> friends<00:01:59.259> if

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
for the five minutes and then invite

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:03.840 
for the five minutes and then invite
them<00:02:02.619> and<00:02:02.799> then<00:02:02.889> they<00:02:02.979> join<00:02:03.219> in<00:02:03.429> the<00:02:03.490> like<00:02:03.670> wait

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.760 
them and then they join in the like wait
a<00:02:03.939> second<00:02:04.270> what's<00:02:04.420> going<00:02:04.630> on<00:02:04.749> here<00:02:05.049> like<00:02:05.259> the

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
a second what's going on here like the

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.679 
a second what's going on here like the
cars<00:02:06.039> aren't<00:02:06.310> blowing<00:02:06.520> up<00:02:06.819> I<00:02:07.090> can't<00:02:07.359> see<00:02:07.539> these

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
cars aren't blowing up I can't see these

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.210 
cars aren't blowing up I can't see these
bouncing<00:02:08.110> Betties<00:02:08.440> that<00:02:08.590> are<00:02:08.679> killing<00:02:08.890> me

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
bouncing Betties that are killing me

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.550 
bouncing Betties that are killing me
it's<00:02:10.179> it's<00:02:10.420> definitely<00:02:10.929> potential<00:02:11.200> for<00:02:11.380> a<00:02:11.530> lot

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
it's it's definitely potential for a lot

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.680 
it's it's definitely potential for a lot
of<00:02:11.680> fun<00:02:11.890> if<00:02:12.100> you<00:02:12.550> can<00:02:12.790> make<00:02:12.819> it<00:02:13.000> through<00:02:13.300> the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
of fun if you can make it through the

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.480 
of fun if you can make it through the
the<00:02:14.170> trial<00:02:14.530> of<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.010> five<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.400> eight<00:02:15.459> minutes

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
the trial of the five to eight minutes

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.040 
the trial of the five to eight minutes
of<00:02:15.880> throwing<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.270> balancing<00:02:16.569> buddy<00:02:16.720> down<00:02:16.900> and

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
of throwing the balancing buddy down and

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.600 
of throwing the balancing buddy down and
picking<00:02:17.170> it<00:02:17.319> back<00:02:17.380> up<00:02:17.500> but<00:02:18.100> like<00:02:18.220> I<00:02:18.310> said<00:02:18.370> you

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
picking it back up but like I said you

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.040 
picking it back up but like I said you
can<00:02:18.640> shorten<00:02:19.060> it<00:02:19.180> down<00:02:19.270> to<00:02:19.420> five<00:02:19.600> minutes<00:02:19.930> or

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
can shorten it down to five minutes or

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.900 
can shorten it down to five minutes or
so<00:02:20.230> by<00:02:20.530> doing<00:02:20.590> it<00:02:21.070> quickly<00:02:21.280> so<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:21.730> kind<00:02:21.880> of

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
so by doing it quickly so it kind of

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.520 
so by doing it quickly so it kind of
depends<00:02:22.150> on<00:02:22.240> how<00:02:22.330> fast<00:02:22.510> you<00:02:22.720> do<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:22.990> but<00:02:23.110> you

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
depends on how fast you do it but you

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.020 
depends on how fast you do it but you
will<00:02:23.710> essentially<00:02:24.100> overload<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.700> game<00:02:24.880> of

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
will essentially overload the game of

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.450 
will essentially overload the game of
that<00:02:25.150> pole

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
that pole

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.310 
that pole
and<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:26.240> game<00:02:26.420> is<00:02:26.570> not<00:02:26.690> going<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:26.900> be<00:02:26.990> having<00:02:27.110> a

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
and the game is not going to be having a

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.750 
and the game is not going to be having a
good<00:02:27.440> time<00:02:27.650> everything's<00:02:28.160> kind<00:02:28.370> of<00:02:28.430> glitching

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
good time everything's kind of glitching

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.070 
good time everything's kind of glitching
out<00:02:28.880> and<00:02:29.150> freaking<00:02:29.570> and<00:02:29.690> everything<00:02:29.990> like

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
out and freaking and everything like

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.080 
out and freaking and everything like
that<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.560> it's<00:02:31.100> just<00:02:31.400> it's<00:02:31.580> just<00:02:31.700> a<00:02:31.880> really
