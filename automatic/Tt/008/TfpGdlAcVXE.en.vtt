00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.200
So sudden I forget to breathe

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.900
Your steady heart gives mine a reckless beat

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.800
Here we are under star-lit skies

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I see them sparkle while I'm looking in your eyes

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.900
And I could ask nothing more than this

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.200
I'm satisfied with the way this is

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.000
Here we are and we don't really care

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Where we are

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.000
What to do

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.000
When to stop

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.900
I don't care where we're going

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.500
As long as I'm with you

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.800
Let's hit the road and not stop driving

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.900
'Til the night is through

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.800
I don't care when we're stopping

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.400
As long as you're with me

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.500
Captivity never felt so free

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.400
So sudden I forget to breathe

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.400
Your steady heart gives mine a reckless beat

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.000
Here we are under star-lit skies

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.900
I see them sparkle while I'm looking in your eyes

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.000
And I could ask nothing more than this

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.000
I'm satisfied with the way this is

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.500
