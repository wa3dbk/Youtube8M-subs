another<00:01:59.690> setting<00:02:00.380> that<00:02:00.470> came<00:02:00.800> out<00:02:00.920> of<00:02:01.040> Landsat

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
another setting that came out of Landsat

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.960 
another setting that came out of Landsat
a<00:02:02.090> very<00:02:02.810> very<00:02:03.789> reputable<00:02:05.619> European<00:02:06.619> states

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
a very very reputable European states

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.609 
a very very reputable European states
where<00:02:07.970> they<00:02:08.090> analyzed<00:02:08.539> all<00:02:09.020> the<00:02:09.140> studies<00:02:09.500> that

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
where they analyzed all the studies that

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.070 
where they analyzed all the studies that
have<00:02:09.739> been<00:02:09.770> done<00:02:09.890> Arnold<00:02:10.369> therapy<00:02:10.940> and<00:02:11.510> they

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
have been done Arnold therapy and they

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.810 
have been done Arnold therapy and they
found<00:02:12.260> per<00:02:12.470> neck<00:02:12.650> mean<00:02:12.890> and<00:02:13.130> what<00:02:13.489> they<00:02:13.610> found

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
found per neck mean and what they found

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.840 
found per neck mean and what they found
that<00:02:14.060> it<00:02:14.209> is<00:02:14.420> as<00:02:14.920> effective<00:02:15.920> as<00:02:16.459> any<00:02:16.580> other

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
that it is as effective as any other

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.040 
that it is as effective as any other
form<00:02:17.150> of<00:02:17.239> treatment<00:02:17.450> including

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
form of treatment including

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.050 
form of treatment including
pharmaceuticals<00:02:18.820> but<00:02:19.820> their

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
pharmaceuticals but their

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.400 
pharmaceuticals but their
recommendations<00:02:20.780> of<00:02:20.900> course<00:02:21.140> was<00:02:21.380> that

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
recommendations of course was that

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.220 
recommendations of course was that
because<00:02:22.130> of<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:22.489> safety<00:02:22.790> factor<00:02:23.360> it<00:02:23.600> certainly

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
because of a safety factor it certainly

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.550 
because of a safety factor it certainly
is<00:02:24.650> more<00:02:24.890> than<00:02:25.100> cages<00:02:25.550> to<00:02:25.640> be<00:02:25.760> used<00:02:26.000> and

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
is more than cages to be used and

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.080 
is more than cages to be used and
combining<00:02:27.560> that<00:02:27.739> with<00:02:27.800> what<00:02:28.700> we're<00:02:28.880> doing

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
combining that with what we're doing

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.880 
combining that with what we're doing
with<00:02:29.209> the<00:02:29.330> Tanna<00:02:29.540> device<00:02:29.900> is<00:02:30.200> we're<00:02:30.470> using<00:02:30.680> an

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
with the Tanna device is we're using an

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.720 
with the Tanna device is we're using an
array<00:02:31.190> of<00:02:31.430> super<00:02:31.940> luminous<00:02:32.269> diodes<00:02:33.070> and<00:02:34.070> we

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
array of super luminous diodes and we

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.120 
array of super luminous diodes and we
power<00:02:35.000> them<00:02:35.209> in<00:02:35.300> a<00:02:35.360> very<00:02:35.540> specific<00:02:35.780> manner<00:02:36.130> so

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
power them in a very specific manner so

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.580 
power them in a very specific manner so
that<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:37.700> delivers<00:02:37.970> about<00:02:38.209> 700<00:02:38.959> milliwatts<00:02:39.350> of

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
that it delivers about 700 milliwatts of

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.810 
that it delivers about 700 milliwatts of
power<00:02:39.650> over<00:02:40.610> all<00:02:41.030> at<00:02:41.450> some<00:02:42.459> 870<00:02:43.459> nanometers

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
power over all at some 870 nanometers

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.699 
power over all at some 870 nanometers
which<00:02:44.060> is<00:02:44.269> actually<00:02:44.690> when<00:02:44.840> it's<00:02:44.989> on<00:02:45.200> you<00:02:45.440> can't

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
which is actually when it's on you can't

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.250 
which is actually when it's on you can't
see<00:02:45.980> it<00:02:46.070> it's<00:02:46.700> it's<00:02:46.970> beyond<00:02:47.329> the<00:02:47.600> visible<00:02:47.780> part

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
see it it's it's beyond the visible part

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.470 
see it it's it's beyond the visible part
of<00:02:48.350> the<00:02:48.440> spectrum<00:02:48.470> so<00:02:49.010> that's<00:02:49.730> why<00:02:49.910> we<00:02:50.090> put<00:02:50.360> in

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
of the spectrum so that's why we put in

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.940 
of the spectrum so that's why we put in
here<00:02:50.660> we<00:02:50.840> put<00:02:51.310> we<00:02:52.310> have<00:02:52.519> these<00:02:53.799> three<00:02:54.799> red

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
here we put we have these three red

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.210 
here we put we have these three red
lights<00:02:55.010> so<00:02:55.579> that<00:02:55.610> you<00:02:55.850> know<00:02:56.000> that<00:02:56.030> it's<00:02:56.299> on

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
lights so that you know that it's on

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.259 
lights so that you know that it's on
that's<00:02:58.220> really<00:02:58.610> why<00:02:58.730> those<00:02:58.940> are<00:02:59.120> there

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
that's really why those are there

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.120 
that's really why those are there
otherwise<00:02:59.480> you<00:02:59.720> cannot<00:03:00.019> see<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.350> 870

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
otherwise you cannot see the 870

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.020 
otherwise you cannot see the 870
nanometers<00:03:01.430> and<00:03:01.579> that's<00:03:01.730> eight<00:03:02.000> hundred

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
nanometers and that's eight hundred

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.449 
nanometers and that's eight hundred
centimeters<00:03:02.930> is<00:03:03.290> what<00:03:03.530> goes<00:03:03.709> deep<00:03:04.010> into<00:03:04.340> your

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
centimeters is what goes deep into your

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.690 
centimeters is what goes deep into your
tissue<00:03:05.110> about<00:03:06.110> 25<00:03:06.590> to<00:03:06.799> 30<00:03:07.040> millimeters<00:03:07.549> deep

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
tissue about 25 to 30 millimeters deep

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.400 
tissue about 25 to 30 millimeters deep
into<00:03:07.970> your<00:03:08.120> tissue<00:03:08.329> and<00:03:08.989> that<00:03:09.079> does<00:03:09.260> a<00:03:09.290> couple

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
into your tissue and that does a couple

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.069 
into your tissue and that does a couple
of<00:03:09.709> things<00:03:09.910> what<00:03:10.910> that<00:03:11.060> does<00:03:11.269> is<00:03:11.480> that<00:03:11.630> that's

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
of things what that does is that that's

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.130 
of things what that does is that that's
that<00:03:12.620> felt<00:03:13.070> by<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.370> body<00:03:13.640> is<00:03:13.820> a<00:03:13.850> heating<00:03:14.299> so

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
that felt by the body is a heating so

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.720 
that felt by the body is a heating so
when<00:03:15.350> you<00:03:15.440> get<00:03:15.590> that<00:03:15.739> heating<00:03:16.070> sensation<00:03:16.610> the

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
when you get that heating sensation the

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.460 
when you get that heating sensation the
body's<00:03:17.000> response<00:03:17.150> is<00:03:17.690> to<00:03:18.079> increase

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
body's response is to increase

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.860 
body's response is to increase
circulation<00:03:18.829> to<00:03:19.430> that<00:03:19.549> area<00:03:19.910> so<00:03:20.690> by

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
circulation to that area so by

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.539 
circulation to that area so by
increasing<00:03:21.230> circulation<00:03:21.680> you<00:03:22.160> bring<00:03:22.370> more

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
increasing circulation you bring more

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.449 
increasing circulation you bring more
blood<00:03:22.850> flow<00:03:23.150> so<00:03:23.530> you're<00:03:24.530> getting<00:03:24.799> more<00:03:24.920> oxygen

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
blood flow so you're getting more oxygen

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.009 
blood flow so you're getting more oxygen
and<00:03:25.610> you're<00:03:25.760> getting<00:03:25.970> more<00:03:26.120> nutrients<00:03:26.690> to

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
and you're getting more nutrients to

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.960 
and you're getting more nutrients to
that<00:03:27.170> area<00:03:27.530> that's<00:03:27.709> being<00:03:28.010> heated<00:03:28.160> up<00:03:28.400> so

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
that area that's being heated up so

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.550 
that area that's being heated up so
that's<00:03:29.180> called<00:03:29.359> therapeutic<00:03:29.959> healing<00:03:30.290> its

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
that's called therapeutic healing its

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.770 
that's called therapeutic healing its
ability<00:03:30.980> to<00:03:31.010> heat<00:03:31.370> deep<00:03:32.090> in<00:03:32.269> the<00:03:32.359> tissue

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
ability to heat deep in the tissue

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.569 
ability to heat deep in the tissue
without<00:03:33.079> having<00:03:33.440> to<00:03:33.590> heat<00:03:33.829> the<00:03:33.980> outside<00:03:34.340> so

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
without having to heat the outside so

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:35.830 
without having to heat the outside so
you<00:03:34.670> don't<00:03:34.820> get<00:03:34.880> a<00:03:34.940> burning<00:03:35.329> on<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.450> outside

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
you don't get a burning on the outside

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.870 
you don't get a burning on the outside
right<00:03:36.079> the<00:03:36.980> other<00:03:37.100> thing<00:03:37.280> is<00:03:37.430> is<00:03:37.640> that<00:03:37.730> you

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
right the other thing is is that you

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.190 
right the other thing is is that you
have<00:03:38.060> a<00:03:38.090> cellular<00:03:38.630> response<00:03:39.049> so<00:03:39.829> you<00:03:39.890> get<00:03:40.220> some

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
have a cellular response so you get some

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.979 
have a cellular response so you get some
you<00:03:41.530> get<00:03:41.739> the<00:03:41.860> release<00:03:42.129> of<00:03:42.280> what's<00:03:42.459> called<00:03:42.989> the

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
you get the release of what's called the

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.830 
you get the release of what's called the
the<00:03:44.620> chroma<00:03:44.890> force<00:03:45.250> and<00:03:45.879> your<00:03:46.120> cells<00:03:46.360> respond

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
the chroma force and your cells respond

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.930 
the chroma force and your cells respond
to<00:03:47.050> the<00:03:47.170> wavelength<00:03:47.620> of<00:03:47.769> the<00:03:47.890> light<00:03:48.069> and<00:03:48.340> so

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
to the wavelength of the light and so

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.449 
to the wavelength of the light and so
you<00:03:49.000> get<00:03:49.330> a<00:03:49.360> release<00:03:49.750> of<00:03:49.959> ATP<00:03:50.560> which<00:03:50.950> is<00:03:51.129> really

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
you get a release of ATP which is really

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.030 
you get a release of ATP which is really
cellular<00:03:51.879> energy<00:03:52.060> so<00:03:52.750> again<00:03:52.989> you're<00:03:53.170> boosting

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
cellular energy so again you're boosting

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.040 
cellular energy so again you're boosting
your<00:03:54.069> recovery<00:03:54.790> system<00:03:55.180> your<00:03:55.420> your<00:03:55.660> your

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
your recovery system your your your

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.990 
your recovery system your your your
healing<00:03:56.379> system<00:03:56.769> so<00:03:57.280> you<00:03:57.340> get<00:03:57.489> a<00:03:57.519> much<00:03:57.730> faster

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
healing system so you get a much faster

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.960 
healing system so you get a much faster
response<00:03:58.830> so<00:03:59.830> that's<00:03:59.980> that's<00:04:00.250> really<00:04:00.580> from

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
response so that's that's really from

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.339 
response so that's that's really from
the<00:04:01.060> physics<00:04:01.450> side<00:04:01.569> of<00:04:01.720> things<00:04:01.870> of<00:04:02.080> how<00:04:02.230> it

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
the physics side of things of how it

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:04.470 
the physics side of things of how it
works<00:04:02.530> what<00:04:03.489> helps<00:04:03.760> to<00:04:03.819> handle<00:04:04.090> work<00:04:04.209> even

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
works what helps to handle work even

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.839 
works what helps to handle work even
more<00:04:04.630> effectively<00:04:05.110> is<00:04:05.170> the<00:04:05.260> fact<00:04:05.500> that<00:04:05.849> you'll

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
more effectively is the fact that you'll

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.240 
more effectively is the fact that you'll
notice<00:04:07.060> the<00:04:07.269> inside<00:04:07.690> of<00:04:07.989> the<00:04:08.080> device<00:04:08.230> is<00:04:08.830> all

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
notice the inside of the device is all

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.160 
notice the inside of the device is all
made<00:04:09.459> of<00:04:09.610> reflective<00:04:10.120> surfaces<00:04:10.599> and<00:04:10.810> you<00:04:10.959> have

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
made of reflective surfaces and you have

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.289 
made of reflective surfaces and you have
to<00:04:11.319> have<00:04:11.470> the<00:04:11.620> device<00:04:11.769> in<00:04:12.129> contact<00:04:12.700> with<00:04:13.150> your

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
to have the device in contact with your

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:14.610 
to have the device in contact with your
skin<00:04:13.480> for<00:04:14.080> it<00:04:14.170> to<00:04:14.290> work

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
skin for it to work

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.990 
skin for it to work
as<00:04:14.709> soon<00:04:14.860> as<00:04:14.920> I<00:04:15.010> take<00:04:15.160> it<00:04:15.220> off<00:04:15.430> my<00:04:15.610> skin<00:04:15.880> it

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
as soon as I take it off my skin it

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.020 
as soon as I take it off my skin it
doesn't<00:04:16.150> work<00:04:16.859> so<00:04:17.859> by<00:04:18.070> keeping<00:04:18.340> it<00:04:18.489> in<00:04:18.519> contact

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
doesn't work so by keeping it in contact

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.699 
doesn't work so by keeping it in contact
what<00:04:19.239> we<00:04:19.329> get<00:04:19.510> is<00:04:19.600> a<00:04:19.840> physics<00:04:20.320> principle

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
what we get is a physics principle

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.980 
what we get is a physics principle
called<00:04:20.829> photon<00:04:21.340> recycling<00:04:21.660> so<00:04:22.660> that<00:04:22.810> takes

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
called photon recycling so that takes

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.590 
called photon recycling so that takes
the<00:04:23.139> energy<00:04:23.290> that<00:04:23.680> we're<00:04:23.830> creating<00:04:24.010> and<00:04:24.600> any

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
the energy that we're creating and any

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.510 
the energy that we're creating and any
energy<00:04:26.139> that<00:04:26.320> doesn't<00:04:26.530> hit<00:04:26.800> your<00:04:26.919> skin<00:04:27.160> at<00:04:27.250> 90

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
energy that doesn't hit your skin at 90

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.020 
energy that doesn't hit your skin at 90
degrees<00:04:27.850> is<00:04:28.000> either<00:04:28.150> reflected<00:04:28.389> or<00:04:28.930> refracted

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
degrees is either reflected or refracted

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.640 
degrees is either reflected or refracted
so<00:04:31.030> we<00:04:31.180> collect<00:04:31.600> those<00:04:31.780> photons<00:04:32.229> again<00:04:32.530> and

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
so we collect those photons again and

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.920 
so we collect those photons again and
reflect<00:04:32.979> them<00:04:33.070> back<00:04:33.340> into<00:04:33.790> the<00:04:33.910> skin<00:04:34.180> so<00:04:34.780> we

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
reflect them back into the skin so we

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.570 
reflect them back into the skin so we
get<00:04:35.080> a<00:04:35.110> bump<00:04:35.410> in<00:04:35.560> power<00:04:35.770> so<00:04:35.979> that<00:04:36.010> allows<00:04:36.370> us<00:04:36.400> to

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
get a bump in power so that allows us to

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.800 
get a bump in power so that allows us to
deliver<00:04:36.790> more<00:04:37.090> power<00:04:37.360> than<00:04:37.600> you<00:04:37.630> would

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
deliver more power than you would

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.360 
deliver more power than you would
typically<00:04:38.139> get<00:04:38.350> out<00:04:38.470> of<00:04:38.590> a<00:04:38.650> device<00:04:38.950> like<00:04:39.130> this

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
typically get out of a device like this

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.790 
typically get out of a device like this
so<00:04:39.580> we<00:04:39.669> get<00:04:39.790> clinical<00:04:40.240> levels<00:04:40.540> of<00:04:40.660> power<00:04:41.200> out

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
so we get clinical levels of power out

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.250 
so we get clinical levels of power out
of<00:04:41.860> a<00:04:42.010> handheld<00:04:42.460> rechargeable<00:04:43.120> device<00:04:43.330> so

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
of a handheld rechargeable device so

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:53.640 
of a handheld rechargeable device so
that's<00:04:44.350> that's<00:04:44.590> really<00:04:44.770> what<00:04:44.860> Han<00:04:45.070> is<00:04:45.160> about

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.330 

you

in our clinical study - eating a small
sample<00:05:01.960> initially<00:05:02.440> so<00:05:03.070> we<00:05:03.160> can<00:05:03.310> see<00:05:03.520> the

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
sample initially so we can see the

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.640 
sample initially so we can see the
actual<00:05:03.880> Effie<00:05:04.330> want<00:05:04.840> something<00:05:05.170> very<00:05:05.200> common

actual Effie want something very common

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.760 
actual Effie want something very common
and<00:05:06.010> we<00:05:06.670> looked<00:05:06.970> at<00:05:07.240> what<00:05:07.600> you<00:05:08.050> commonly<00:05:08.410> know

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
and we looked at what you commonly know

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.280 
and we looked at what you commonly know
as<00:05:08.800> golfer's<00:05:09.700> elbow<00:05:09.820> or<00:05:10.300> tennis<00:05:10.600> elbow<00:05:10.750> we

30% decrease in the amount of swelling

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.540 
30% decrease in the amount of swelling
we<00:05:26.050> had<00:05:26.200> a<00:05:26.230> 72<00:05:26.710> percent<00:05:26.800> decrease<00:05:27.520> in

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
we had a 72 percent decrease in

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.110 
we had a 72 percent decrease in
perceived<00:05:28.150> pain<00:05:28.510> and<00:05:29.140> with<00:05:29.290> a<00:05:29.320> 50%<00:05:30.120> overall

conditions<00:05:32.830> and<00:05:33.010> this<00:05:33.610> aside<00:05:34.120> was<00:05:34.300> conducted

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
conditions and this aside was conducted

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.190 
conditions and this aside was conducted
over<00:05:34.780> a<00:05:34.960> two-week<00:05:35.260> period<00:05:35.890> with<00:05:36.820> a<00:05:37.200> 20-person

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
over a two-week period with a 20-person

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.160 
over a two-week period with a 20-person
sample<00:05:38.710> size<00:05:38.890> and<00:05:39.460> we<00:05:39.750> include<00:05:40.750> it<00:05:40.870> in<00:05:40.990> there

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.170 
sample size and we include it in there

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.960 
sample size and we include it in there
so<00:05:41.590> we<00:05:41.680> could<00:05:41.830> have<00:05:41.950> something<00:05:42.220> to<00:05:42.430> contrast

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
so we could have something to contrast

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.740 
so we could have something to contrast
against<00:05:43.390> to<00:05:43.780> be<00:05:43.900> sure<00:05:44.140> that<00:05:44.290> wasn't<00:05:44.590> just<00:05:45.070> a

against to be sure that wasn't just a

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.430 
against to be sure that wasn't just a
small<00:05:46.750> sample<00:05:47.140> size

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
small sample size

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:48.660
