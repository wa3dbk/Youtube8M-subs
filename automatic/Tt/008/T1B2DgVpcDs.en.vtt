00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
very minimal compared to the rewards

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.250 
very minimal compared to the rewards
that<00:05:04.970> could<00:05:05.210> potentially<00:05:05.660> be<00:05:05.780> for<00:05:06.110> somebody

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
that could potentially be for somebody

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.420 
that could potentially be for somebody
who<00:05:06.470> doesn't<00:05:06.650> have<00:05:06.830> enough<00:05:07.010> food<00:05:07.190> for<00:05:07.220> the
