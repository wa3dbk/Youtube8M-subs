the new fuel economy leaders but then
McLaren<00:00:16.650> comes<00:00:16.920> out<00:00:17.100> with<00:00:17.220> this<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:18.029> p1<00:00:18.600> this

is a Cara I first saw as a concept of

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.650 
is a Cara I first saw as a concept of
last<00:00:22.470> year's<00:00:22.800> Paris<00:00:23.189> Auto<00:00:23.340> Show<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:24.000> then<00:00:24.630> I

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
last year's Paris Auto Show and then I

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.290 
last year's Paris Auto Show and then I
expected<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.380> would<00:00:25.410> probably<00:00:25.830> just<00:00:25.980> have

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
expected it would probably just have

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
that's a really powerful engine and it's
