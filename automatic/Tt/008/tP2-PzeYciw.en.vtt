00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.990
 good morning today is Friday 6 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.379
 February and I am in the cito section 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.810
 at the base stations of the british 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.820
 in languages ​​per season where I want to target 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.029
 you go direction 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.310
 hochbrixen connection to find arthur 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.590
 my head carter to chef wife elmo 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.779
 call it there 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:36.000
 you cross that bridge and get the 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.960
 so-called shadow job that goes there 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.510
 up 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.850
 the mist in the mist to the ski area 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.070
 of lesson and by going from you that is well 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.680
 exactly where I'm going 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.219
 then help have a little sight 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:53.129
 but we'll see a lot later 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.590
 arrived at the gorp 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:00.270
 you are just on the border of clouds 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.829
 the mist and the sun but it is one 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.719
 I ship the face 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.710
 yes it will be a little less when you go 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.020
 downstairs skis 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.070
 then you see a lot where we are here 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.040
 right on the border 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.040
 what is such a thick eighteen hundred meters 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.990
 what are you looking for 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.530
 muscle mist we go whole once 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.530
 light snow 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.270
 yes you were under the middle station 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.850
 the open pink 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.930
 in fact it clears up under the 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.250
 fog 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.690
 I'm standing here at the refrigerant station 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:44.400
 historical and from a sorry swift 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.630
 the last century and I stand on the 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.650
 practice meadow 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.530
 in westendorf 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.480
 after about an hour and a half the 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.140
 spring break 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:59.320
 and this village will be completely full again 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.090
 with Dutch people and that is also true 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.370
 cozy 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.270
 but for the rest it is real here 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.830
 great conditions are perfect 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.030
 you now really have perfect 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.860
 snow quality just incredibly good 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.630
 and if the weather just stays that way 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.090
 next two weeks 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.190
 And that looks like it will likely 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.280
 put some more sun on it but also 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.950
 We don't hate that, so I 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.580
 expect the conditions here 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.280
 west village 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.510
 but certainly also in that welt but also in 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.670
 the whole 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.670
 is open again is perfect 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.340
 also in the field of best care 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.920
 even key west caught 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.890
 or one I am on the edge of 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.280
 the ski area from at kirchberg 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.890
 and kids we don't want to go there 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.950
 more than that we stay nice in westendorp 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.180
 slopes are top I just have a small one 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.849
 layer of ice 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.140
 but it was spotted on a black one 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.810
 slope of style 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.510
 yes the snow goes there quickly 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:30.230
 from and the ear iron just give 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:35.269
 not just let good stand is 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.500
 their park of westendorf and all 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.630
 beautiful hills that good 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.459
 prepared are preparation machines 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.830
 are animals under still busy to whole 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.260
 great shame to make them 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.440
 and here on the mino 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.530
 berg time really stood still 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.680
 we stay here in the 60s and that is 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.319
 also noticeable by those who are in again 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.440
 it houses it can be a brother 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:03.920
 from one of the companions of 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.930
 zizi top or that also has a beard 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.680
 from here in tokyo 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:12.430
 but always here in the sixties and 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.430
 seventy music 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.070
 I'm back on throw everything at 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.720
 especially a job 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.420
 it 's after four o'clock it's time to go 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.010
 to go down he was bad for a day 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.960
 foggy are bit between seventeen 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.120
 one hundred and twelve hundred meters 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.580
 below it all finds it as if 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.680
 the view good but the in between 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.200
 it was equally t ride well so I 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.610
 still the go down towards the 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.350
 camping 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.400
 but that will be all right, which is also good 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:46.680
 I think that's the crocus 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.580
 you don't have to worry about that anymore 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.040
 to sit 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.180
 snow there is enough snow quality 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.920
 good 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.340
 we understood that we did the temperature 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.940
 intake you go high but it stays 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.350
 just good is certainly different 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:07.400
 past years with this I want 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:07.400
 close and I say hello again
