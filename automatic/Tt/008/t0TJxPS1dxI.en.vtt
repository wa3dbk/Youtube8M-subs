00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.890
 continue to review children's bicycles 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.529
 brand stealth we are still with you in 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.570
 shop bike rider and I took her May 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.680
 and now it goes to the present 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.390
 sports will fly rather bolides 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.820
 stealth pilot 170 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.279
 in front of you are two bikes 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:35.150
 small wheel diameter of 12 inches and 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.930
 the biggest 20 still in this series is 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.910
 race cars 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:43.220
 with wheels 14 16 and 18 inches that is you 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.140
 can pick up a bike for a child 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.560
 almost any age for 2 s 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.780
 half years and above in my opinion 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.960
 important factor in children's bike 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.900
 is the safety of stealth and lod with 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.510
 this is all right soft handle protection 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.460
 elements on the steering wheel and on the rally that too 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.110
 not unimportant 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.049
 the seat and steering wheel are adjustable as per 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.689
 height and slope want now 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.810
 will grow with your child you 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.170
 be able to customize it for comfort 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.720
 skating 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.510
 it hurts your child separately 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.380
 pay attention to stels bike 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:23.750
 pilot 170 with a diameter of wheels you it 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.350
 the secret is as close as possible to an adult 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.120
 bikes here are already aluminum 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.100
 lightweight aluminum double frame 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.850
 the rim 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.710
 universal protector which 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.860
 allows contacts on asphalt and on 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.780
 off road and front handbrake 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.820
 but all these bikes remain 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.470
 the ability to brake pedals 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.140
 learning to ride such a bike 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.000
 your child can boldly change 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.680
 on teenage mountain bike stels 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.540

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.729

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.170

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.409

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.820
 and take test and the whole family 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.939

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.739
