this is like what do you think it means
well<00:01:16.240> I<00:01:16.270> didn't<00:01:16.630> get<00:01:16.720> to<00:01:16.780> look<00:01:17.020> at<00:01:17.140> it<00:01:17.259> closely

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
well I didn't get to look at it closely

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:25.639 
well I didn't get to look at it closely
but<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:20.710> seems<00:01:21.009> like<00:01:21.399> the<00:01:21.909> song<00:01:22.240> is<00:01:23.220> perhaps

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
but it seems like the song is perhaps

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:31.889 
but it seems like the song is perhaps
being<00:01:26.649> used<00:01:27.039> to<00:01:27.640> describe<00:01:30.299> some<00:01:31.299> experience

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
being used to describe some experience

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:34.260

that<00:01:32.229> is<00:01:32.470> that's<00:01:33.159> not<00:01:33.369> necessary<00:01:33.490> positive

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
that is that's not necessary positive

kill<00:01:51.670> herself<00:01:51.789> for<00:01:52.149> years<00:01:52.360> I<00:01:52.539> guess<00:01:52.659> it's<00:01:52.899> just

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
kill herself for years I guess it's just

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
with other people's lives in a sense of

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.279 
with other people's lives in a sense of
weeks<00:02:03.520> we<00:02:03.970> hold<00:02:04.240> was<00:02:04.599> the<00:02:04.750> famous<00:02:04.929> lady

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
weeks we hold was the famous lady

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:07.499 
weeks we hold was the famous lady
certain<00:02:05.679> expectation<00:02:06.399> and<00:02:06.970> when<00:02:07.240> they<00:02:07.330> don't

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
certain expectation and when they don't

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.779 
certain expectation and when they don't
fulfill<00:02:07.780> those<00:02:07.899> expectations<00:02:08.369> great<00:02:09.369> and<00:02:09.609> you

turned<00:02:10.479> them<00:02:10.600> down<00:02:10.630> let<00:02:11.560> him<00:02:11.650> down<00:02:11.799> and<00:02:12.070> I

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
turned them down let him down and I

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.190 
turned them down let him down and I
think<00:02:12.940> that<00:02:13.060> that<00:02:13.090> that<00:02:13.570> says<00:02:13.810> something

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
think that that that says something

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.560 
think that that that says something
because<00:02:14.739> I<00:02:15.010> think<00:02:15.070> it<00:02:15.340> would<00:02:15.459> take<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:16.510> would

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
because I think it would take it would

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.259 
because I think it would take it would
take<00:02:16.870> her<00:02:17.079> to<00:02:17.650> die<00:02:17.859> actually<00:02:18.519> in<00:02:18.700> order<00:02:19.030> for

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
take her to die actually in order for

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.870 
take her to die actually in order for
something<00:02:20.079> to<00:02:20.230> happen<00:02:20.500> like<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.310> Anna<00:02:21.489> Nicole

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
something to happen like the Anna Nicole

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.220 
something to happen like the Anna Nicole
case<00:02:22.150> you<00:02:22.810> know<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:22.959> me<00:02:23.170> she<00:02:23.350> was<00:02:23.859> this<00:02:24.819> great

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
case you know to me she was this great

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.479 
case you know to me she was this great
personality<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:26.410> I<00:02:26.769> think<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.069> had<00:02:27.220> to<00:02:27.310> take<00:02:27.459> a

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
personality and I think it had to take a

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.490 
personality and I think it had to take a
tragedy<00:02:28.030> in<00:02:28.239> order<00:02:28.510> for<00:02:28.780> people<00:02:28.900> to<00:02:29.079> honestly

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
tragedy in order for people to honestly

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.590 
tragedy in order for people to honestly
realize<00:02:29.980> her<00:02:30.160> issues<00:02:30.519> so<00:02:30.970> instead<00:02:31.239> of<00:02:31.299> playing

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
realize her issues so instead of playing

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.099 
realize her issues so instead of playing
into<00:02:32.109> the<00:02:32.910> hype<00:02:33.910> of<00:02:33.940> like<00:02:34.329> oh<00:02:34.450> my<00:02:34.600> gosh<00:02:34.750> she<00:02:34.959> did

this again we actually need to take a

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.420 
this again we actually need to take a
step<00:02:37.269> back<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:37.510> realize<00:02:37.780> that<00:02:37.930> she's<00:02:38.260> human

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430
