00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.380
 I'll be with that idea 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.600
 king 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.430
 it's called fracking and it's a technique that 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.590
 is revolutionizing the exploitation of 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.080
 Natural gas in the US allows it to explode 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.700
 deposits until now inaccessible the 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.190
 problem is that the technique contaminates 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.560
 Near aquifers basically consists 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.620
 in drilling on the earth's surface 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.260
 a hole of 4000 meters then in 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.110
 horizontal do the same thing and that 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.170
 fly it with explosives once it has 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.720
 done that gets to 5000 atmospheres of 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.710
 pressure a tremendous pressure a mixture 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:56.370
 of sand water and a cocktail of 600 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.900
 highly toxic chemicals 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.150
 whose composition is secret because 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.449
 companies are covered by the legislation of 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.400
 patents and that brings out the gas 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.590
 natural that is in small bubbles 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.050
 put into the shale in the ore of 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.090
 blackboard and that could not be extracted from 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.950
 Another way 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.170
 and it has been practiced in different countries 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.909
 where there is already controversy because the one 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.049
 what happens with this technique because it gives me 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.899
 as a picture is worth more than a thousand 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.829
 words I summon you to imagine 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:28.229
 this a citizen approaches his tap 

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:31.560
 of drinking water from the kitchen of the 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:34.649
 bathroom opens it takes a lighter 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.959
 turn it on it about and as if it were 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:40.530
 almost the fruit of a biblical curse the 

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:43.619
 water the water burns because because the 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.959
 methane is the natural gas has been filtered 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.880
 through the cracks of the faults 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:50.039
 that have caused that 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.560
 so aggressive treatment until the 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.770
 aquifers that feed the 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.909
 wells reservoirs lakes rivers 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.619
 but of course if only because gas 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.280
 thing would have a pass but it is that clear 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:08.399
 we talked before a cocktail of 600 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.049
 highly toxic products that can 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.239
 generate and that in fact there has already been 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.450
 cases reported in the USA in others 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.420
 countries 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.030
 congenital malformations death 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.810
 animals not only of river animals 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.180
 not from cattle even that gas just 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.370
 filtering into the air that is breathed in 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.370
 Crystal nearby areas 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.810
 women's absent gemma ward 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.060
 casmen semenya to be grouped about 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.370
 true but if that were all the danger 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.349
 because the truth is that the thing would be 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.340
 tremendously serious but there is still 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.489
 plus 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.010
 it turns out that the united kingdom has established 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.319
 a moratorium on fracking because 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.530
 after carrying these practices in the 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.769
 counted from lan to be there was a series of 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.560
 earthquakes a consequence of in those 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.810
 deep layers of the earth's crust 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.670
 generate a damage that you do not know 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.680
 absolutely nothing since neither 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.170
 can go down there is a geologist to see what 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.010
 has passed and tails and whose consequences 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:26.410
 in extending to tens or hundreds of 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.940
 kilometers of serious situations of 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.820
 fact 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.340
 countries like France itself 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:36.580
 Lower ireland of northern bulgaria have already 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.450
 This method of extraction is prohibited but 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.820
 for example in the USA five wells are made 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.410
 of this style every day and the 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.140
 truth is that the population is very 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.480
 alarmed the manipulation with aims 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.030
 commercial and perhaps others that do not 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.610
 they count exploring the territory the 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.590
 depth of the earth and destroying 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.120
 galliano destroying mother earth with 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.830
 consequences that do not seem to be 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.210
 they matter but in the end all 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.520
 we are victims now 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.380
 we change the theme oil and pf 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.410
 He agreed with his counterpart from the United States 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:11.590
 chevron the exploitation jointly 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.750
 of dead cow this formation the 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.870
 clear objective oil extraction 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.790
 The investment exceeds 15 billion 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.280
 of dollars and here the details we are 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.870
 approximately 130 kilometers from the 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.510
 capital of neuquÃ©n we are in the 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.730
 Mapuche community and the layman here 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.430
 inaugurated the first extraction well 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.070
 unconventional gas and oil through 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.660
 of hydro fracture this is the first well 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.010
 from Latin America let's see 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.690
 what conditions are you then 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:42.700
 this place we take a servant 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.430
 with the water that is born here from the wall 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.700
 black the water was not contaminated in 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.560
 that time the water was still good 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:54.340
 we started opening our eyes same as 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.590
 which is that there are wines and 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.990
 the hospital of zapala came to do 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.949
 a study and she told us not to 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:02.680
 let's drink bad water 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:04.150
 let's start to see everything together and that the 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.680
 fight is not only about 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.720
 indigenous communities but of all the 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.000
 society because tomorrow that 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.880
 are polluting our rivers our 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.440
 water map not only the Mapuche go to 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.440
 get out contaminated but all 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:23.910
 and pp launches exploration on Wednesday 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.940
 of two deposits one oil and 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.190
 another non-conventional gas in the 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:34.180
 Province of Chubut 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:38.080
 elpozo 914 work team 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:38.080
 start drilling 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:54.669
 do not 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.650
 ah 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.070
 plus 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.640
 two 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.500
 no no
