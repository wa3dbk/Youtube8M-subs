00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 and so for a start I fry the onions with 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.710
 carrot in a small amount 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:12.349
 vegetable oil it will serve 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:16.859
 the basis for our sauce 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:19.160
 in the meantime, I've already prepared stuffing it 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.560
 your home beef plus pork and 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:26.910
 mixed it with onions with one 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.310
 head and salted and peppered here at 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.820
 I have about 500 grams 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.030
 I also added carrot and onion 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.620
 a little garlic somewhere 2 cloves to 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.180
 it was piquant 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.610
 but it is as if further on in 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:51.170
 fried onions carrot and garlic I 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.170
 add 2 cups of water to boiling water 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:01:01.469
 further I add to this sauce us not yet 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.439
 ready somewhere 3 tablespoons sour cream 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.900
 in fact it is possible and more from this 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:15.930
 how would the sauce not get the other way around 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:21.689
 will become even more tender and now I still 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:25.409
 a little bit of his salt still now 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:32.159
 leave it to boil as soon as this 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:34.020
 the sauce will boil it must be removed then 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.259
 I take in general the main culprits 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.420
 this dish is my pasta nests 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.030
 I do n't know such a company 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.360
 called but the type is Italian and so here 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.909
 they look and so they become 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.860
 take it easy I 'll go to boiling water 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:56.340
 but literally for one minute in order 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.219
 lest they fall apart 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.270
 several things at once 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:15.360
 questions 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:19.440
 but one minute so I put 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.420
 our nests in the pan well you can 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.879
 any in general to the form put me 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:33.959
 It turned out in the end so 6 8 10 stuff and 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:36.599
 Now I would like them farshiruem stuffing and 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.840
 I have a little bad nests because 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.370
 which is very difficult they somehow here 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.310
 very strong intertwined accounts 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.590
 just cram that stuffing 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:52.220
 that he has quite a lot so I 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:03:02.100
 I think that there is stuffing I do not fit 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:03:06.239
 nest because they are very but how 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.220
 get you out I got more 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.430
 many nests that fit 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.319
 considering that I'm still on 2 these days 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.790
 pasta dyspnea bad less just 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:19.290
 roll out such minced balls and also 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.910
 isolated by this sauce 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:27.950
 I think that is also good turn 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:32.609
 just such mini meatballs I will have 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:37.200
 not meatballs more precisely not yoke and more 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:41.180
 our sauce is ready and now I'm all for it 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.180
 our form by this 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:59.150
 and the last thing is that the posts as flooded 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:04:02.320
 sauce I sprinkle all our dishes on top 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.320
 grated cheese 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.630
 like this 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:24.310
 180 degrees and weathered fasten and 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:28.350
 This is how it looks like when I have it. 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:32.350
 got out of the oven as we see cheese 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:36.340
 melted on the surface and meat 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.259
 It turns out very very juicy and generally 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.259
 it's just great. 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:45.250
 tasty dish and so it looks like 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:48.340
 everything in cut form turns out very 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.530
 tasty juicy and it is very good 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.120
 alternative 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:55.060
 pasta on the fleet let's say so because 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:58.210
 that, in principle, the same ones are used here 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:01.330
 pasta and the same stuffing just more 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.580
 such interesting interpretations like this 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.180
 was a recipe thank you very much for watching 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.180
 bye everyone
