again<00:00:01.290> that<00:00:01.650> shim<00:00:01.979> seems<00:00:02.370> to<00:00:02.580> be<00:00:02.730> a<00:00:02.760> little<00:00:03.120> bit

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
again that shim seems to be a little bit

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.509 
again that shim seems to be a little bit
too<00:00:03.480> low<00:00:03.720> because<00:00:04.049> it's<00:00:06.319> but<00:00:07.319> we<00:00:07.740> have<00:00:07.919> not<00:00:08.130> yet

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
too low because it's but we have not yet

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.790 
too low because it's but we have not yet
adjusted<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.420> height<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:09.929> saddle<00:00:10.139> it<00:00:10.469> may

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
adjusted the height of the saddle it may

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.970 
adjusted the height of the saddle it may
be<00:00:11.210> perfectly<00:00:12.210> okay<00:00:12.330> once<00:00:13.139> we<00:00:13.380> determine

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
be perfectly okay once we determine

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.860 
be perfectly okay once we determine
whether<00:00:14.519> it's<00:00:14.790> within<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.269> range<00:00:15.480> of<00:00:15.750> the

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
whether it's within the range of the

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.050 
whether it's within the range of the
saddle<00:00:16.320> adjustment<00:00:16.830> height<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.850> this

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
saddle adjustment height so in this

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.529 
saddle adjustment height so in this
particular<00:00:18.449> case<00:00:19.550> this<00:00:20.550> particular<00:00:20.939> kind<00:00:21.390> of

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
particular case this particular kind of

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.320 
particular case this particular kind of
saddle<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:21.990> Wilkinson<00:00:22.529> style<00:00:22.859> saddle<00:00:23.250> has<00:00:23.939> a

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
saddle of Wilkinson style saddle has a

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.259 
saddle of Wilkinson style saddle has a
locking<00:00:25.230> mechanism<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:26.130> lock<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.640> vertically

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
locking mechanism to lock it vertically

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.740 
locking mechanism to lock it vertically
this<00:00:27.570> way<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.170> also<00:00:28.260> locks<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:29.039> in<00:00:29.160> place

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
this way and it also locks it in place

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.389 
this way and it also locks it in place
horizontally<00:00:30.750> for<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.500> intonation<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.279> we

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
horizontally for the intonation so we

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.120 
horizontally for the intonation so we
want<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.669> loosen<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.300> lock<00:00:33.719> with<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> correct

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
want to loosen that lock with a correct

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.400 
want to loosen that lock with a correct
allen<00:00:35.550> wrench<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.090> then<00:00:36.870> let's<00:00:38.840> bring<00:00:39.840> up<00:00:40.050> the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
allen wrench and then let's bring up the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.720 
allen wrench and then let's bring up the
saddle<00:00:40.829> height<00:00:41.510> and<00:00:42.510> find<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.050> correct<00:00:43.730> allen

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
saddle height and find the correct allen

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.510 
saddle height and find the correct allen
wrench<00:00:44.969> for<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.390> saddle<00:00:45.809> adjustments<00:00:46.590> this

one<00:00:47.789> looks<00:00:48.000> like<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:48.420> about<00:00:48.539> right<00:00:50.539> let's

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
one looks like it's about right let's

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.150 
one looks like it's about right let's
see<00:00:51.780> if<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.260> enough<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.949> make<00:00:53.100> a

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
see if this is enough to make a

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
see if this is enough to make a
difference<00:00:54.320> and<00:00:55.320> whether<00:00:56.309> it's<00:00:56.610> within<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
difference and whether it's within the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.560 
difference and whether it's within the

going<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.140> wrong<00:01:01.320> direction<00:01:05.600> now<00:01:06.600> if<00:01:06.869> you<00:01:07.020> can

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
going the wrong direction now if you can

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.030 
going the wrong direction now if you can
see<00:01:07.470> this<00:01:07.650> up<00:01:08.369> close<00:01:08.720> you<00:01:09.720> can<00:01:09.930> see<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.740> this

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
see this up close you can see that this

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
see this up close you can see that this
is<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> screw<00:01:11.960> that<00:01:12.960> fits<00:01:13.020> under<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.760> saddle

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
is a screw that fits under the saddle

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.700 
is a screw that fits under the saddle
and<00:01:15.450> helps<00:01:16.409> force<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.159> up<00:01:17.990> see<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.110> coming<00:01:19.530> up

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
and helps force it up see it coming up

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.440 
and helps force it up see it coming up
now<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:22.189> want<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.310> make<00:01:23.460> sure<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.180> is

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
now I want to make sure that this is

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.440 
now I want to make sure that this is
good<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.930> loose<00:01:25.830> enough<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.270> doesn't

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
good and loose enough so that it doesn't

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.030 
good and loose enough so that it doesn't
interfere<00:01:28.020> with<00:01:29.869> our<00:01:30.869> adjustment<00:01:31.500> here<00:01:31.799> ooh

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.330 

getting<00:01:35.040> get<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.490> there<00:01:35.700> we<00:01:36.060> may<00:01:36.450> be<00:01:36.920> we<00:01:37.920> may<00:01:38.280> be

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
getting get in there we may be we may be

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.780 
getting get in there we may be we may be
close<00:01:38.790> enough<00:01:39.860> when<00:01:40.860> we<00:01:41.009> make<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:41.460> final

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
close enough when we make this final

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.350 
close enough when we make this final
these<00:01:42.329> adjustments<00:01:43.259> on<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.680> saddle<00:01:44.070> height

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
these adjustments on the saddle height

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:54.010 
these adjustments on the saddle height
to<00:01:46.759> have<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.000> neck<00:01:48.210> set<00:01:48.540> correctly

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.340 

it<00:01:54.829> may<00:01:55.130> have<00:01:55.430> to<00:01:55.609> go<00:01:55.759> up<00:01:55.969> higher<00:01:56.270> this<00:01:57.079> one

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
it may have to go up higher this one

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.940 
it may have to go up higher this one
seems<00:01:57.679> to<00:01:57.859> be<00:01:58.450> locking<00:01:59.450> it<00:01:59.630> from<00:02:00.350> going<00:02:00.590> up

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
seems to be locking it from going up

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:24.860 
seems to be locking it from going up
high<00:02:01.219> enough

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.890 

hmmm<00:02:25.870> I<00:02:27.450> think<00:02:28.450> that<00:02:29.019> this<00:02:29.230> may<00:02:29.470> get<00:02:29.769> us<00:02:29.950> there

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
hmmm I think that this may get us there

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:45.140 
hmmm I think that this may get us there
maybe<00:02:31.900> high<00:02:32.290> enough

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:56.740 

it's<00:02:46.170> free<00:02:47.170> sounding<00:02:47.940> that's<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:49.150> good<00:02:49.420> sign

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:12.750 

I<00:03:04.960> think<00:03:05.960> that<00:03:06.230> that<00:03:06.440> worked<00:03:07.660> now<00:03:08.660> you<00:03:08.720> can<00:03:09.020> see

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.890 

it's<00:03:13.760> free<00:03:14.350> it's<00:03:15.350> free<00:03:15.650> to<00:03:15.890> fret<00:03:16.610> the<00:03:17.330> action

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
it's free it's free to fret the action

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.550 
it's free it's free to fret the action
at<00:03:18.320> this<00:03:18.620> end<00:03:18.890> is<00:03:19.160> much<00:03:19.790> much<00:03:20.120> much<00:03:20.360> closer<00:03:20.810> to

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
at this end is much much much closer to

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.690 
at this end is much much much closer to
the<00:03:21.709> same<00:03:21.950> height<00:03:22.370> at<00:03:22.760> this<00:03:23.180> end<00:03:24.280> so<00:03:25.280> that's

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
the same height at this end so that's

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.970 
the same height at this end so that's
the<00:03:25.940> process<00:03:26.209> so<00:03:26.990> I'll<00:03:27.170> go<00:03:27.350> ahead<00:03:27.380> and<00:03:27.709> put<00:03:27.860> the

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
the process so I'll go ahead and put the

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.040 
the process so I'll go ahead and put the
rest<00:03:28.190> of<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.400> strings<00:03:28.700> on<00:03:28.910> here<00:03:29.239> and<00:03:29.690> make<00:03:29.900> the

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
rest of the strings on here and make the

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.020 
rest of the strings on here and make the
final<00:03:30.410> adjustments<00:03:31.010> on<00:03:31.160> the<00:03:31.310> heights<00:03:31.670> of<00:03:31.910> the

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
final adjustments on the heights of the

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.860 
final adjustments on the heights of the
saddles<00:03:32.420> this<00:03:32.660> way<00:03:32.870> in<00:03:33.140> order<00:03:33.680> to<00:03:34.570> get<00:03:35.570> it<00:03:35.720> all

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
saddles this way in order to get it all

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.810 
saddles this way in order to get it all
set<00:03:36.170> and<00:03:36.410> we<00:03:36.650> should<00:03:36.890> be<00:03:37.040> ready<00:03:37.190> to<00:03:37.340> go<00:03:37.489> to<00:03:37.670> the

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
set and we should be ready to go to the

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.330 
set and we should be ready to go to the
next<00:03:38.030> step
