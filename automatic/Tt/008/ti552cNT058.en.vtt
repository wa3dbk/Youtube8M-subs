now is one that we work with for a long
time

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
time

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.330 
time
the<00:00:41.370> first<00:00:41.670> day<00:00:41.940> our<00:00:42.180> first<00:00:42.570> game<00:00:43.280> at<00:00:44.280> the

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
event in Jupiter Florida he just popped

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.570 
event in Jupiter Florida he just popped
up<00:00:48.870> three<00:00:49.740> times<00:00:51.800> so<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.920> can<00:00:52.950> miss<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.280> lot<00:00:53.520> of

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
up three times so you can miss a lot of

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.700 
up three times so you can miss a lot of
things<00:00:53.940> sometimes<00:00:54.870> when<00:00:55.260> you're<00:00:55.380> at<00:00:55.560> the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
things sometimes when you're at the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.940 
things sometimes when you're at the
event<00:00:56.070> watch<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.030> just<00:00:57.120> one<00:00:57.390> time<00:00:57.590> but<00:00:58.590> when

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:58.950 
event watch it just one time but when

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.530 
event watch it just one time but when
you're<00:00:59.040> videotape<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.790> and<00:00:59.970> watch<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.450> again

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
you're videotape it and watch it again

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.740 
you're videotape it and watch it again
and<00:01:00.840> again<00:01:01.020> again<00:01:01.340> things<00:01:02.340> begin<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.060> stick

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
and again again things begin to stick

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.430 
and again again things begin to stick
out<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:05.270> one<00:01:06.270> button<00:01:06.570> we<00:01:06.869> work<00:01:07.110> with<00:01:07.290> with

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:07.440 
out and one button we work with with

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.990 
out and one button we work with with
this<00:01:07.530> player<00:01:07.860> was<00:01:08.899> to<00:01:09.899> change<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.610> timing<00:01:11.610> of

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
this player was to change the timing of

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.810 
this player was to change the timing of
his<00:01:12.300> adrenaline<00:01:12.960> as<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:14.130> can<00:01:14.250> see<00:01:14.520> his

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
his adrenaline as you can see his

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.310 
his adrenaline as you can see his
mechanics<00:01:15.420> look<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:16.530> know<00:01:16.619> fine<00:01:17.149> but<00:01:18.320> before

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
mechanics look you know fine but before

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.850 
mechanics look you know fine but before
the<00:01:19.770> mechanics<00:01:20.280> are<00:01:20.430> unfolding<00:01:21.860> his

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
the mechanics are unfolding his

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.010 
the mechanics are unfolding his
adrenaline<00:01:23.280> button<00:01:23.759> had<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.179> be<00:01:24.300> pushed<00:01:24.630> the

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
adrenaline button had to be pushed the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.960 
adrenaline button had to be pushed the
right<00:01:25.229> way<00:01:25.410> and<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.490> right<00:01:26.640> time<00:01:28.970> fortunately

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
right way and the right time fortunately

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.510 
right way and the right time fortunately
for<00:01:30.179> this<00:01:30.330> hitter<00:01:30.840> he<00:01:31.350> only<00:01:31.560> had<00:01:31.710> one<00:01:31.740> game<00:01:32.220> his

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
for this hitter he only had one game his

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.940 
for this hitter he only had one game his
birthday<00:01:32.970> there<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.539> he<00:01:34.350> made<00:01:34.530> the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
birthday there and he made the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.520 
birthday there and he made the
adjustments<00:01:35.610> for<00:01:36.119> his<00:01:36.300> adrenaline<00:01:36.690> and<00:01:37.020> his

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
adjustments for his adrenaline and his

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.160 
adjustments for his adrenaline and his
timing<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.069> his<00:01:38.160> drilling<00:01:38.610> how<00:01:39.330> it<00:01:39.479> fits<00:01:39.780> into

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
timing of his drilling how it fits into

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.169 
timing of his drilling how it fits into
it<00:01:40.319> the<00:01:40.410> pitcher<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.399> how<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.640> fits<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.149> with

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
it the pitcher and how it fits in with

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.180 
it the pitcher and how it fits in with
his<00:01:42.690> hitting<00:01:43.560> model<00:01:44.069> for<00:01:44.280> timing<00:01:44.759> he<00:01:45.690> took<00:01:45.899> off

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
his hitting model for timing he took off

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.680 
his hitting model for timing he took off
the<00:01:47.190> line<00:01:47.789> drives<00:01:48.890> doubles<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.429> a<00:01:51.270> lot<00:01:51.660> of

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
the line drives doubles and a lot of

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.039 
the line drives doubles and a lot of
good<00:01:51.810> hits

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.730 

so<00:01:56.049> I<00:01:56.079> strongly<00:01:56.740> consider<00:01:57.430> this<00:01:57.640> offseason<00:01:58.740> if

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
so I strongly consider this offseason if

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.679 
so I strongly consider this offseason if
you<00:01:59.979> if<00:02:00.399> you<00:02:00.640> go<00:02:00.909> to<00:02:00.969> work<00:02:01.240> with<00:02:01.390> your<00:02:01.479> kiddos

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 
you if you go to work with your kiddos

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.350 
you if you go to work with your kiddos
you<00:02:02.680> can't<00:02:03.159> excite<00:02:03.430> unfortunately<00:02:04.149> and

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
you can't excite unfortunately and

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.260 
you can't excite unfortunately and
that's<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.720> last<00:02:05.729> resource<00:02:06.729> is<00:02:06.939> going<00:02:07.119> to<00:02:07.180> go

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
that's the last resource is going to go

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.089 
that's the last resource is going to go
attack<00:02:07.630> the<00:02:07.780> ball<00:02:07.960> as<00:02:08.170> your<00:02:08.319> mechanics<00:02:08.950> in

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
attack the ball as your mechanics in

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.600 
attack the ball as your mechanics in
your<00:02:09.220> technique<00:02:10.500> but<00:02:11.500> before<00:02:11.980> you<00:02:12.220> movement

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
your technique but before you movement

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.880 
your technique but before you movement
start<00:02:12.849> you<00:02:13.810> need<00:02:13.989> to<00:02:14.110> be<00:02:14.200> in<00:02:14.319> sync<00:02:14.680> with

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
start you need to be in sync with

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.920 
start you need to be in sync with
yourself<00:02:15.370> as<00:02:15.519> a<00:02:15.550> hitter<00:02:15.849> you<00:02:16.330> need<00:02:16.569> to<00:02:16.690> be<00:02:16.810> in

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
yourself as a hitter you need to be in

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.190 
yourself as a hitter you need to be in

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
sync with yourself with the pitchers

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.479 
sync with yourself with the pitchers
delivery<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:21.900> we've<00:02:22.900> been<00:02:23.110> learning<00:02:23.950> that

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
delivery and we've been learning that

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.390 
delivery and we've been learning that
every<00:02:25.300> picture<00:02:25.569> has<00:02:25.780> a<00:02:25.840> common<00:02:26.200> denominator

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
every picture has a common denominator

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.699 
every picture has a common denominator
and<00:02:27.400> once<00:02:27.700> you<00:02:27.849> get<00:02:28.000> in<00:02:28.209> synced<00:02:28.750> with<00:02:28.930> the

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
and once you get in synced with the

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.220 
and once you get in synced with the
pitchers<00:02:30.130> common<00:02:30.519> denominator<00:02:31.090> you're<00:02:32.049> on

pitchers common denominator you're on

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.440 
pitchers common denominator you're on
board<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:32.860> there's<00:02:33.519> very<00:02:33.790> little<00:02:34.000> thinking

that goes on at a home plate up to that

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:44.820 
that goes on at a home plate up to that
point<00:02:41.069> this<00:02:42.069> hitter<00:02:42.430> again<00:02:43.799> readjusted<00:02:44.799> his
