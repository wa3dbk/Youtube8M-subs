00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.790
 told a joke 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:20.440
 It seems that this term is a man who 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.440
 goes down the street 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:29.270
 I was carrying a mail ambition 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:33.290
 question today is from an envelope here this is going 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:35.090
 to pamplona but of course I already 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.629
 God feared that he wanted to send 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.629
 Barcelona 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.239
 they released those 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:11.000
 one meal that I'm thinking about is molding 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.000
 themes 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:33.250
 and here it charges 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.420
 I think that's a normal would be two 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.890
 tornadoes 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.890
 because it goes 426 the sea 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.670
 crossing of life waters sons of bitches 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.830
 has seen 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.100
 I'm uncle, I'm a nuclear engineer 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.100
 for rod 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.490
 I had saved this because I have a 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.490
 director then is this shit 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.230
 time to react 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.020
 visibility dancing 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.010
 good good good 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.210
 the king was not the area of ​​the 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.460
 parakeet 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.460
 today visual support and him 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.599
 ahead 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.630
 there was 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.650
 in which he comes 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.650
 and we do 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:04:03.209
 downward 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:04:03.209
 sometimes I'm not alive 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.530
 yes 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.370
 apparently up to minutes 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.109
 towards the tower 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.220
 etc 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.750
 as a feeder 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.400
 I'm the one on the right by the 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.210
 right in my case my case goes through there 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.210
 here 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:46.909
 on the play there I 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.909
 and I'm going to do that 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.139
 in kings they created then 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.650
 this superman comic 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:03.160
 but that this bunch of the whole game does not 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:06.630
 Pay close attention to schedules 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.630
 is something 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:21.830
 now let me let me be happy and bring 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.830
 in red now 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.840
 and with the pole the player 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:37.669
