00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:09.820
 launched in the summer of 2011 the q3 is for 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:11.830
 the smallest suv moment of the range 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.870
 audi under the q5 and the big q7 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.550
 the q3 has just undergone a small restylage 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.380
 which essentially touches the grille 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.940
 and the lights in the front spotlights 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.920
 now incorporates LED daytime running lights 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.090
 and a bi- xenon technology in series on 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.410
 all versions while he 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.890
 was previously an option to 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.750
 1000 euros 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.920
 other changes concern 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.170
 engines with a drop in 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.460
 co2 emissions in some cases our 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.230
 model uses a four incident 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.100
 petrol with partial deactivation 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.870
 decided who did not evolve in co2 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.999
 inside the restyling and discreet the 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.589
 q3 remains the only audi with art 1 to 

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:43.870
 have the mmi positioned vertically 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:45.370
 on the center console and not between 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.379
 the two seats before the shot 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.549
 the ergonomics are less but the quality 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.960
 presentation is in accordance with the 

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:51.370
 brand standards and even seems 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.139
 have progressed on the occasion of 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.909
 restyling with less noise 

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:56.409
 the rear seats are sufficient in 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:58.299
 me habitability remains absolute 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:00.010
 one of the weakest in the category 

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:01.749
 ditto side trunk where we you 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.249
 advise to take the option kit from 

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:07.450
 repair to release some 

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:09.040
 cubic decimetres on the q3 this 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.720
 petrol engine of an available 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.400
 that in two-wheel drive this block is 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.840
 able to go from 2 to 4 cm and 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.610
 reciprocally quite 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.680
 transparent to the driver in order to 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.510
 to consume less while driving 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.680
 very discreet available at low speed 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.240
 they then willingly 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.220
 tours but there is no point in going beyond 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.880
 5000 turns he runs out of steam and becomes 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.160
 too noisy 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.990
 the equivalent tronic box of the dlg 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.880
 is true to herself fast and 12 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.530
 as for the chassis part apart 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.290
 some loss of motor skills it is 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.700
 convincing watch 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:38.140
 our test model shod with wheels of 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.910
 17 inches was revealed at once 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.600
 comfortable and relatively dynamic a 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.940
 good compromise 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.890
 budget side what q3 is on the paper the 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.659
 more sober of the category with 136 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.220
 grams per km of co2 announced for 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.080
 our model with 17 inch wheels 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.970
 however our measurements revealed that he 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.770
 was very close to a mazda cx-5 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.530
 gasoline or even in 3008 with hall 1 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.450
 6 thp in manual box however a 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.280
 thing is safe side tariff this q3 is at 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.350
 top of the lot our test model 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.970
 appears at 36000 euros excluding options and 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.540
 at this price the equipment is far 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.540
 to be bloated
