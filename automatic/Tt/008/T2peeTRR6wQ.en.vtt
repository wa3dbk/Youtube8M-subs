00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:03.280
 the Minister of French Community Education is with us 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.920
 we are Marie-Dominique simonet in oneself then it is also your return 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:09.660
 with this new cap our impressions how it went 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.619
 today 

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:14.269
 for me it went well there was at the same time a lot of emotion 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.869
 as we have just seen during this small school but at all the village 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:24.339
 the organizing power the neighbors the parents are all those united 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:27.639
 behind school and then yes there was also a lot of road from 

00:00:27.639 --> 00:00:28.710
 discovery 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.130
 in the noon time in another high school and primary also for 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:34.420
 make sure 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.730
 in the shadow of ideas at the stove and therefore a school that is called in 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.270
 positive discrimination with passion of talent I wanted to christ 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.920
 is also in this school so you talked about positive discrimination 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.100
 we also saw this solidarity 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.780
 with his students who are going 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.300
 have courses in prefabricated modules we also know that by 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.650
 example in brussels are a lot of school asking for renovations 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.310
 do I revisit the French community has enough money to 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.660
 renovate his some schools really need it so some the 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.710
 really making that help 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.909
 not one of the topics and who really occupied the previous government to 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.110
 them to put in place a system that will accelerate 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.230
 for renovating schools and at the same time accelerating this 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.460
 renovation by putting double glazing by rebuilding 9 can be made 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.810
 savings and so that's an entire ranch that will occupy us for a lot 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.360
 it is under this legislature that is much more demands than 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.600
 financial capacity but it will have to be inventive florent other site 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.330
 who are at risk 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.500
 of cup and many other trends in the fight against school failure% and 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.860
 school chic important primary very important secondary one in two students 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.220
 What is the problem with our French committees? 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.370
 it's the lack 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.170
 so it's a moment that teaching is not good 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.810
 no no it's not it's not the lack of coaching because 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.820
 comparatively 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.240
 to other countries we are not the libinois framing this not the quality 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.820
 of our teachers 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.300
 that's my opinion these are two multiple factors 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.440
 and so at it is true schools 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.560
 yes 20% of our schools in the French community welcome 80% of children 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.310
 the most fragile or the most difficult where the weakest so that's a 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.229
 aspect and also the fact that 

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:19.449
 depending on the regions where there are children whose French is not 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:23.359
 the mother tongue is symbolic and we have a little for a culture of 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:26.729
 repetition we are used to that and we are quite surprised when we see the 

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:30.289
 statistics from neighboring countries well yes there is a whole series of 

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:34.119
 hikes in neighboring countries europe that do not practice like this and I do not 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:37.799
 do not think our doubts our students evening - malaga have stuck their cause either 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.029
 more brilliant 

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:43.379
 it is this way of apprehending a hepatitis to remedy right away at 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.079
 within the class c is therefore to deformations% the teachers 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.669
 knowledgeable they do not take students out of the classroom. 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:54.059
 class and right away to see them bring a help help because 

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:56.839
 that the repetitions you said it is especially in primary in 

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:58.809
 first and second year primary 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:00.439
 stay with us minister
