00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.709
 Friends Hello my name is Olga I 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:16.539
 from nature 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:19.220
 straight hair and of course I actually them 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.949
 twist I like twisted 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:26.029
 hair well i don't like twists them 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:29.599
 termo devices curling or irons 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.380
 as it dries hair and they are faster 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.260
 break down 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.930
 me with several ways how to wind 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.589
 hair without curlers and 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.809
 and that's such a thermo device and I want 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:44.119
 with these ways to share with you 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:51.799
 if you are interested in this topic 

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:54.860
 so stay the first way is all 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:57.470
 known method using both daughter for 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:00.140
 hair i will also use here 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.080
 such a spray tick to give for 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.840
 styling it for put curls and curls 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.590
 I will be called it a little bit 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:13.900
 dissolve the hair out slightly wet 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.310
 can do it on wet hair a 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.130
 also we were taught of course important and she 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:25.060
 will last longer also 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.060
 the bang too will be wound slightly 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:35.540
 This method I do most often and I think 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:39.430
 many familiar with this way just 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.430
 we take on each side strand 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.930
 ran for a comb so we comb 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.920
 our hide and seek take from each side and 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.210
 one strand 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.790
 I even twist a little bit of branches and here 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:00.110
 here here 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:01.990
 I pass under our bezel so further we take 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.390
 okay 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.390
 and doing the same manipulations 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:18.150
 so when we all have already chosen our 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.830
 headbands 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.120
 the most important thing at the end 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.530
 back and here these are the last one below 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.230
 the bundle is fixed invisible 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:33.610
 you are simply invisible and fix to 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:36.310
 He broke up on me over time 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.610
 day after i'll take you other curls 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.530
 come out of such a hairstyle from such 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.410
 kind of twisting with this hairstyle 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.940
 the weapon after you was walking for three hours and now 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.940
 I will shoot 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.460
 these are the jumps of my finger 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.530
 In this version I also used 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:27.060
 styling spray high 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:29.930
 cleaned your hair and curled them so 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.930
 big harness 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.330
 further went 2 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:45.420
 lard or half a day then unwound and 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.420
 got lush and big waves 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.250
 autumn and now I caught them important 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:11.760
 itched to one side it's like what 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:15.840
 very light waves and so here i am 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:21.239
 spinning now will dress on 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:25.139
 the street and i usually when I get dressed or there 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:30.060
 food on the street and the wind should be an example 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:33.449
 then I twist them and fill it up in 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:36.840
 a sweater with this method is certainly not very 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:39.660
 looks like if you canâ€™t see them on the street 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.510
 especially refuel that you didn't hold 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.000
 so here it is twisting 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:49.139
 resist and so here we leave 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000
 spin you spin again and with 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:55.260
 time they get a little 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:58.169
 such a light wave like this 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:02.520
 took place on the street about 2 o'clock now 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:09.389
 let's see how they got me here 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:12.020
 such here the light waves turned out on 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.020
