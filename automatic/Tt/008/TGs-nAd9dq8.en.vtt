I would drive away from every shoot

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.270 
I would drive away from every shoot
whether<00:02:35.570> it<00:02:35.720> was<00:02:35.840> a<00:02:35.870> ranch<00:02:36.200> or<00:02:36.530> a<00:02:36.590> farm<00:02:36.950> and

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
whether it was a ranch or a farm and

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.330 
whether it was a ranch or a farm and
just<00:02:38.410> felt<00:02:39.410> like<00:02:39.500> I<00:02:39.650> had<00:02:39.770> taken<00:02:39.950> a<00:02:40.130> life's

worth<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:40.670> lessons<00:02:41.060> with<00:02:41.210> each<00:02:41.360> photo<00:02:41.630> shoot

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960
