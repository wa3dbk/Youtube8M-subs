00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.910
 hello together and get to one 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.830
 new video from your pc is my name 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.300
 Niklas and I introduce you today 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:21.000
 asus eee pad hd7 as the name already 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.900
 betrays hd7 have it here with a 7 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.810
 inch tablet to do 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.179
 the display triggers with 1280 x 800 pixels 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.940
 on there he also keep the hd in the 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.329
 names therefore ever the hd ready 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.910
 resolution is achieved and now want 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.760
 Let's start with good things 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.260
 we've got a look 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.559
 little similarities from the outside 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.590
 also with the nexus 7 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.579
 the scope of delivery includes once the 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.710
 instruction manual then this 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.199
 USB cable to allow the tablet to work with the PC 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.190
 can be connected and still this 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.180
 power adapter is quite cool gimmick 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.040
 nevertheless here 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:09.210
 this little tablet stand with these 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.340
 you can stop the tablet then stand down 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.640
 if you are with a 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.530
 Bluetooth keyboard would work then 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.570
 you put this on it just like that 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.220
 landscape or portrait as you like and 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.020
 can work quite comfortably with it 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.600
 Next, I want to open a little 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.590
 the connections the design of the hd7 moped 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.439
 going in last maybe brings 3 102 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.950
 gram on the scale and a maximum 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.540
 Thickness of 10 8 millimeters you can do that 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.640
 yes also relatively good at watching now 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.340
 in the camera setting on the 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.250
 back over and it's a 5 megapixel 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:48.649
 camera and down here we still see the 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.649
 stereo speakers that are installed 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.000
 then we have the volume here 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.689
 feeling on the right side and the 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.689
 lock button 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.850
 really quite narrow and 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.730
 the back is also very handy here 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.429
 although the micro SD card slot with 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.210
 which the memory can be expanded 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.320
 and then up here 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:17.740
 micro-usb connection and the 35 mm audio 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:20.020
 Dirt of the front is also still 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.320
 a 12 megapixel camera for 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.260
 video telephony installed 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.270
 performance comes at e moped 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.510
 hd7 a quad core processor for use 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.770
 which clocks at 1.2 gigahertz and how 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.630
 it will be seen as equal 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:39.010
 operating system we have android in the 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:41.350
 version 4.2.1 but with light 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.030
 Adjustments on the part of asus such as goal 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.220
 at this notification bar 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.770
 looks with the example of the 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.170
 brightness control 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:54.340
 This looks natural with normal android 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.840
 everything a little different but most 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.220
 he changes diaz has made are 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.650
 but quite useful 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.400
 otherwise the operation is relative 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.350
 fast forward 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.050
 we have a gigabyte of memory 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.530
 yes still and the connection to the outside world 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:12.010
 takes the HD7 via wireless or bluetooth 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.200
 4.0 on the but really very fast 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.810
 the whole we will in my video of 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.900
 call us 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:22.840
 in time, I can say more 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.989
 that technically clear 4 x 12 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.980
 It has got a lot going on though 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:32.799
 of course with models like smartphone 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.170
 Top models like the HTC Bonn or Sony 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.540
 xperia of course she can not 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.330
 keep up but you have to consider 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.420
 that you tablet it just 150 euros 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.310
 Amazon costs and you get for it 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.489
 but already delivered a lot 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.040
 now have video call against 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:54.250
 also as soon as the plot so that we can 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.180
 memo patch hd7 actually everyone 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.830
 can recommend 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.870
 who does not have much money for a tablet 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.519
 want to spend 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.220
 because for the 150 euro you get yes 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.659
 really much 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.159
 yes that was it from me i would 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:07.530
 look forward to our youtube channel 

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:10.190
 also subscribe and say goodbye to me 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.190
