was<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.439> failure<00:01:07.950> not<00:01:08.729> because<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.270> its<00:01:09.450> idea

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
was a failure not because of its idea

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.190 
was a failure not because of its idea
which<00:01:10.590> was<00:01:10.860> way<00:01:11.369> ahead<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.670> its<00:01:11.790> time<00:01:12.049> it<00:01:13.049> was

which was way ahead of its time it was

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.530 
which was way ahead of its time it was
actually<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> failure<00:01:14.010> because<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.790> was<00:01:14.970> so<00:01:15.210> new

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
actually a failure because it was so new

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.719 
actually a failure because it was so new
it<00:01:15.869> was<00:01:16.110> not<00:01:16.350> understood<00:01:16.710> how<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.189> use<00:01:17.369> the

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
World War one were not very effective

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.810 
World War one were not very effective
not<00:01:22.110> because<00:01:22.470> of<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.740> design<00:01:23.130> but<00:01:23.580> because

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
not because of the design but because

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.999 
not because of the design but because
the<00:01:24.030> design<00:01:24.390> had<00:01:24.840> not<00:01:24.990> been<00:01:25.170> perfected<00:01:25.710> and

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
the design had not been perfected and

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.950 
the design had not been perfected and
the<00:01:26.549> generals<00:01:26.909> didn't<00:01:27.450> really<00:01:27.689> know<00:01:27.810> how<00:01:27.930> to

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
the generals didn't really know how to

the generals didn't really know how to
use<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.320> there<00:01:28.500> wasn't<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.860> rule<00:01:29.070> book<00:01:29.310> printed

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
use it there wasn't a rule book printed

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.330 
use it there wasn't a rule book printed
called<00:01:30.119> tank<00:01:30.570> 101<00:01:31.110> somebody<00:01:31.650> could<00:01:31.799> refer<00:01:32.100> to

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
called tank 101 somebody could refer to

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.280 
called tank 101 somebody could refer to
to<00:01:32.640> understand<00:01:33.060> how<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.479> use<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.689> tank<00:01:33.990> how<00:01:34.229> to

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
to understand how to use a tank how to

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.719 
to understand how to use a tank how to
deploy<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:35.070> everything<00:01:35.310> had<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.549> be

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
deploy it so everything had to be

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.969 
deploy it so everything had to be
learned<00:01:35.970> from<00:01:36.210> scratch<00:01:36.840> which<00:01:37.439> essentially

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
learned from scratch which essentially

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.580 
learned from scratch which essentially
means<00:01:38.130> learn<00:01:38.549> by<00:01:38.850> mistake<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.409> beginning

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
means learn by mistake so the beginning

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.319 
means learn by mistake so the beginning
of<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:40.979> tank<00:01:41.250> was<00:01:41.490> not<00:01:41.700> very<00:01:42.060> successful

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
of the tank was not very successful

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.649 
of the tank was not very successful
however<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.649> did<00:01:44.280> unlock<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.090> stalemate<00:01:45.390> on

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
however it did unlock the stalemate on

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.660 
however it did unlock the stalemate on
the<00:01:45.750> Western<00:01:46.170> Front<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.860> allow<00:01:47.189> some

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
the Western Front and allow some

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.270 
the Western Front and allow some
movement<00:01:48.299> now<00:01:48.960> we<00:01:49.020> walk<00:01:49.409> ourselves<00:01:49.590> into

Germans and the Allies learned totally

because they were on the receiving end
and<00:02:15.330> they<00:02:15.690> saw<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.110> tank<00:02:16.560> as<00:02:16.740> a<00:02:16.770> breakthrough

unhindered the tank to the infantry and

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.479 
unhindered the tank to the infantry and

it<00:03:41.910> still<00:03:42.269> makes<00:03:42.540> a<00:03:42.720> pretty<00:03:43.200> good<00:03:43.230> pillbox<00:03:43.709> in

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
so forth so the tank there became very

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.060 
so forth so the tank there became very

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
you needed it when you needed it so it

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.089
