00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
just so you guys know a lot of people a

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.240 
just so you guys know a lot of people a
lot<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.409> people<00:01:28.500> having<00:01:28.770> trouble<00:01:29.040> with<00:01:29.130> this<00:01:29.190> I

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
lot of people having trouble with this I

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.060 
lot of people having trouble with this I
think<00:01:29.370> it<00:01:29.550> was<00:01:29.640> because<00:01:29.760> the<00:01:30.030> first<00:01:30.270> bit<00:01:30.479> and

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
think it was because the first bit and

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.350 
think it was because the first bit and
because<00:01:32.070> people<00:01:32.340> said<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.580> needed<00:01:32.760> 30<00:01:33.090> kills

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
because people said you needed 30 kills

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.870 
because people said you needed 30 kills
but<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.740> don't<00:01:35.010> you<00:01:35.190> just<00:01:35.340> finish<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.760> round

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
but you don't you just finish the round

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.730 
but you don't you just finish the round
that's<00:01:36.270> what<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.420> found<00:01:36.630> cuz<00:01:36.840> i<00:01:36.900> got<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.530> 30

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
that's what I found cuz i got the 30

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.050 
that's what I found cuz i got the 30
kills<00:01:37.979> got<00:01:38.159> more<00:01:38.340> than<00:01:38.370> 30<00:01:38.640> kills<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:38.970> then

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
kills got more than 30 kills and then

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.190 
kills got more than 30 kills and then
left<00:01:39.300> I<00:01:40.250> didn't<00:01:41.250> work<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.370> way<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:42.360> obvious<00:01:43.110> I

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
left I didn't work that way so obvious I

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.240 
left I didn't work that way so obvious I
so<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.380> think<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.650> need<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.799> just<00:01:43.950> end<00:01:44.190> the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
so I think you need to just end the

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.510 
so I think you need to just end the
round<00:01:44.370> which<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:44.729> fair<00:01:44.909> enough<00:01:44.940> ah<00:01:45.890> if<00:01:46.890> you

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
round which is fair enough ah if you

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.130 
round which is fair enough ah if you

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
charges that's the only difference as

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.289

in blue I'm

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.120 
in blue I'm
you<00:02:06.270> know<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.390> lockup<00:02:06.690> a<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:07.320> there<00:02:07.560> real<00:02:07.860> use

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
you know I lockup a is there real use

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.320 
you know I lockup a is there real use
for<00:02:08.160> other<00:02:08.460> than<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.700> being<00:02:08.729> more<00:02:08.940> powerful

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
for other than it being more powerful

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.990 
for other than it being more powerful
well<00:02:09.509> not<00:02:09.780> really<00:02:09.960> because<00:02:10.430> the<00:02:11.430> asset<00:02:11.700> gap<00:02:11.850> is

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
well not really because the asset gap is

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.790 
well not really because the asset gap is
only<00:02:12.150> good<00:02:12.330> for<00:02:12.360> getting<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:12.810> out<00:02:12.990> of<00:02:13.020> sticky

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
only good for getting you out of sticky

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.430 
only good for getting you out of sticky
situations<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:15.390> tomahawk<00:02:15.840> is<00:02:16.020> pretty

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
situations and the tomahawk is pretty

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.860 
situations and the tomahawk is pretty
much<00:02:16.590> there<00:02:16.860> just<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.520> make<00:02:17.640> crawlers<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.270> for

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
much there just to make crawlers and for

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.610 
much there just to make crawlers and for
you<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.260> retrieve<00:02:20.270> those<00:02:21.270> lovely<00:02:21.870> skulls<00:02:22.200> and

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
you to retrieve those lovely skulls and

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.680 
you to retrieve those lovely skulls and
the<00:02:23.280> any<00:02:23.670> power-ups<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:24.270> see<00:02:24.360> lying<00:02:24.540> around

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
the any power-ups you see lying around

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.450 
the any power-ups you see lying around
that<00:02:24.780> you<00:02:24.930> might<00:02:25.020> not<00:02:25.110> be<00:02:25.200> able<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.380> get<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.620> but

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
that you might not be able to get to but

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.330 
that you might not be able to get to but
I<00:02:26.520> suppose<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.820> is<00:02:26.880> kind<00:02:27.090> of<00:02:27.150> useful<00:02:27.740> and<00:02:28.740> more

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
I suppose it is kind of useful and more

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.160 
I suppose it is kind of useful and more
powerful<00:02:29.670> for<00:02:30.210> a<00:02:30.240> little<00:02:30.360> bit<00:02:30.480> longer<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:31.110> don't

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
powerful for a little bit longer I don't

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.930 
powerful for a little bit longer I don't
know<00:02:31.380> how<00:02:31.470> long<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.800> lasts<00:02:32.160> but<00:02:32.400> I<00:02:32.640> definitely

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
know how long it lasts but I definitely

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.710 
know how long it lasts but I definitely
deemed<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:34.650> golden<00:02:35.400> spork<00:02:35.880> as<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.360> most

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
deemed the the golden spork as the most

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.410 
deemed the the golden spork as the most
useful<00:02:37.440> thing<00:02:37.470> to<00:02:37.710> get<00:02:38.010> early<00:02:38.220> on<00:02:38.490> I<00:02:38.700> mean<00:02:39.360> a

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
useful thing to get early on I mean a

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.030 
useful thing to get early on I mean a
one<00:02:39.630> hit<00:02:39.810> kill<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:40.110> whatever<00:02:40.380> it<00:02:40.470> is<00:02:40.530> around<00:02:40.740> 30

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
one hit kill to whatever it is around 30

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.500 
one hit kill to whatever it is around 30
something<00:02:41.550> I<00:02:41.640> didn't<00:02:41.880> even<00:02:41.940> get<00:02:42.180> to<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.360> point

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
something I didn't even get to the point

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.690 
something I didn't even get to the point
where<00:02:43.290> haven't<00:02:44.130> even<00:02:44.190> got<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.520> point

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
where haven't even got to the point

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.030 
where haven't even got to the point
where<00:02:44.910> it<00:02:45.090> stops<00:02:45.300> being<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.630> one<00:02:46.500> hit<00:02:46.680> kill<00:02:46.709> but

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
where it stops being a one hit kill but

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.920 
where it stops being a one hit kill but
