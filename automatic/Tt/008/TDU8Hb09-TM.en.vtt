00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.830
 expected a snowy version of the clock around the lancia lybra this 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.240
 soak up to a dichotomy this is apparent from 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.860
 it is in five has run the outside track the car came Bart de jong 

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:12.639
 and 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:14.419
 the award it 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:16.749
 completely ready to help start late 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:18.150
 but first 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.150
 as a home the foundation twice 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.079
 the couple is interested in brus time 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.359
 the former prof 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:30.789
 behind the face 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.300
 prof 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.300
 the 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.270
 he was so young with the woman's proud owner 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.640
 more or less of this a lancia lybra it became 3 0 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.870
 would take it into account 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.870
 who 2 when we do 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.380
 it is a very nice car 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.210
 rider wonderfully tasty 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.930
 want the house 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.380
 good sound system so that's all I can do earlier 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.450
 enjoy as long as you drive 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.640
 that is a bit dependent on today's inspection 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.090
 for me going through a difficult time for liar anyway i have to do away 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.890
 already had a lot of forest 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.530
 Trains had a good chance of firing 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.070
 it also by he also from other candidates 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.790
 what's coming next 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.120
 they want a fifth of them 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.000
 also a role 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.750
 there are also a number of things to come as I say 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.230
 that will be a bit kiele kiele from the other side yes I can just get along 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.620
 continue to win once 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.620
 look for all lottery tickets 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.830
 but 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.970
 just think that this was not the most terrible thing that the Netherlands is called 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.850
 doubt hold much worse or must do on foot what it owns 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.509
 people what a strange story 

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:22.719
 yes some small things that helped that is just that 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.409
 Fog glass yesterday was before 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.769
 the interior 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.449
 there are some worn out here and there, but they are not things said yes 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:36.349
 because my worries what is worth something to me is the engines 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:39.349
 the countries where is psv gas hopes 

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:42.339
 the train was two 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:45.129
 indicated that we have the previous inspections 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.839
 we also had calves after a leaky exhaust 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:50.839
 through life difficult to estimate now what the cost of that 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:56.249
 of the fall 

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:59.979
 if i let some of them approve the members look for what 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:01.959
 a repair 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:03.579
 what we laughed about 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.579
 made the decision about what he can do 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.979
 after the inspection and I do not even dare to be unnatural that goal is 

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:17.059
 especially was coming 

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:21.369
 yes the exhaust emissions are not expected that I thought I was good 

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:24.369
 Expired Mendez initially that it was over 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:29.729
 and probably again to do with the exhaust manifold the city is what 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:34.389
 a scary turn on loose yes then an ordinary for unpacking and I will certainly continue 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.599
 then again 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:40.069
 it seems to do we will see it 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.549
