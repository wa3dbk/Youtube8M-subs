00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:13.420
 There is no crochet way Amigurumi Hen Let's do 9 or this time 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:21.600
 We divide into two of the first part second part and comment 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:29.539
 The important point to learn anew is the next three and the second one is the other packing method 1 end 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:35.750
 This time I will explain the other stuffing and thread clearing next time. 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:37.010
 What is actually knitting here is this which was knitted with the North Throw 85 crochet with the north 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.940
 is 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:45.920
 It will be a little smaller with the croup 's brother with the wave 's brother 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:52.230
 Smaller if woven with tube 45. 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:55.590
 If you get used to knitting with a thick needle, you will practice if you try a thin needle little by little 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.430
 By the way, this old has a baseball team in all 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.850
 The first four bullets are almost the same as the base- knitted salt 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.780
 Let's compare the number of eyes 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:12.590
 The first one is woven into the Omami six eyes 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:15.880
 The point here first has become to much of repeated six times since the 6 eyes basic 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.940
 Fine knit O is a set of tightening is the same 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.920
 In fact Anta et al up to here 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.970
 Let's see what happens 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.750
 To yo knitted in one side 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:29.850
 The person who started from the beginning does not enter 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:33.390
 Those who started with six people are rounded 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.880
 Let's continue knitting 9 as it is 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:43.080
 Followed by 5 steps 6 abandon 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:46.140
 There is no increase or decrease because the wind does not increase or decrease because it only knits the same number of eyes as the previous bullet 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:50.930
 One at a time for the top of the previous stage 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.930
 In addition, it is a simple task of only knitting the top knitting 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:07.170
 At the beginning of the group, 24 chains of rising chains 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:08.520
 And finally pull knit to Dan is over and also of rising when reflected in the six-stage 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.270
 Glance the chain stitch 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:15.420
 It is the flow of 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:19.530
 It was in such a state for the solderer up to the sixth stage 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:25.110
 The wind let's count or have become 24 F just in case 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:27.140
 If you do not have 24 eyes, you are skipping stitches somewhere if you do not knit the eyes of the pull-out knitting 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.710
 Please check if there is 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.680
 Up to this point is almost the same as when you weave salt in the basics section . 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.210
 Main subject is here 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:41.270
 To form a balloon from here 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:45.860
 We need to deflate the fabric, which means we need to reduce the number of dreams 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:48.980
 Here, a new technique of reducing eyes appears 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:55.580
 Display the number of items in the 7th row and the knitting pattern 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:56.720
 A new symbol came out, and this is a reduction in the symbol of the eye . 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.870
 I will 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.870
 It is the reverse of putting the goddess into the tight- knit 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:08.300
 Let's reduce here and explain the eyes before knitting the seventh row 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.620
 about 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.980
 When we want to reduce the number of 92 people 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:18.360
 First put the needle at the first eye 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.360
 Thread and pull out 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:31.440
 If you pull out the thread again here, you will become a normal fine knitting 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:35.030
 But here I put the needle in the next eye in this unfinished state 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.030
 Thread and pull out 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:43.690
 The needle has three loops 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.290
 And put a thread and put 3 loops together 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.290
 Pull out 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:54.510
 Two crochets have now been knitted at once 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:57.989
 As two people became the eyes of eyes, it was reduced 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.390
 Fasten the first fine knitting in the unfinished state 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:05.540
 It is point to be reflected in the next eye 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.540
 I think you can get used to quickly if you look at the crochet 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:13.060
 Let's weave the 7th row 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.060
 When you first knit up standing hair 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.610
 Hosoami is one iteration first reduced to Parliament 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.970
 Mami once 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.520
 The second floor and reduce 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:40.139
 Stop the first in the unfinished state 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:43.340
 If you put the needle in the next eye and it takes 3 loops 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.340
 Go to the ceremony together 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.780
 At 34 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:04.300
 Reduced eyes 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:08.159
 This is repeated six times in one set 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.159
 Lastly draw it out and knit it 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:17.689
 We finished knitting the seventh step with this 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:19.980
 The number of eyes decreased by 6 because there were 6 reductions 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:26.160
 It is 18 laps around 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:29.660
 By the way, some of you may notice here, but the edge is spread over the knitting head 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:34.040
 What is actually knitted is waiting 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:38.030
 Water is a mechanism that spreads salt as the number of groups increases 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:44.510
 There are some aspects that are not suitable for expressing oneness 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:50.150
 So in the course of this course, it will be more likely to show only the table of the residence number 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:57.140
 Also in the state where you are actually reading, the beginning of knitting has come to the near side 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:58.500
 So it is easy to see when the upper group goes up from the bottom as the way of drawing the figure and the table is knitting 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:04.500
 Become 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:07.480
 Panic not especially also because it is common that in this overstuffed Ami is written in the notation from the bottom to the top 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:14.170
 Please calm down and watch 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:17.040
 So let's finish the first part by knitting the eighth step middle stage 9 next time so far 

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:17.040
 I was upset
