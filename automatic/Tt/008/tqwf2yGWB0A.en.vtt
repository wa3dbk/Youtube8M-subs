00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.020
 after this video was then concluded with 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:10.180
 daily reports 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.370
 I got a total cold 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.469
 I have eaten on Easter Sunday at my 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.000
 nephew probably infected I have with 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.070
 my sister has phoned and has 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.199
 so that probably exactly the same 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.039
 Symptoms that somehow really came like 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:25.660
 with the suggestion hammer against the head 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.039
 Headache here, everything completely to me 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.650
 have me while I'm talking 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.119
 rolls were completely tight I had like that 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.950
 slight dizziness because that 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.230
 really also on this balance 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.250
 Center has gone to NASA 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.810
 were to be taken completely to unitary day 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.610
 Absolutely who will be totally itchy me 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.740
 Could not set to promise without 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.440
 cough and I really had absolute 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.970
 head and body aches 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.380
 There was really no sport anymore 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.060
 That's why I think so 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.330
 be let me for the week me first 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.250
 spared and rested and then was too 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:01.270
 no longer madjidi my dearest 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:03.220
 ally but boiled onion 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.979
 I do not usually have that raw 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.380
 his agave thick juice made that was 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.969
 then my daily companion unfortunately so 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.770
 disgusting she sounds that too 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:13.539
 just tastes sweet by that yes there 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.670
 I do not build my nose anyway 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:18.429
 but you have tasted thoroughly 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.020
 continued to hold on was the food 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:23.469
 not quite normal 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.189
 eaten as before so challenge 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:27.219
 compliant 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:29.829
 it was just that I was really one 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:32.380
 court on the day of breakfast a court am 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:33.999
 also not the portion size 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.950
 which was stated in the book 

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:39.520
 and so one or the other snack so 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.549
 fruits or vegetables well ok I have none 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.960
 I have no soot banana no more 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.499
 or something eaten 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.659
 I really have a cabana banana 

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:50.740
 or something like that 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:55.020
 that was really enough for me 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:57.100
 All day and just drink a lot 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.719
 I really got along with that 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.670
 So, what I've done really 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.920
 these divorce numbers are not sugar 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.570
 no no empty carbohydrate and such 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.979
 I've sometimes a perfectly good 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.899
 made a slice of tomato in the evening 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:12.099
 but wholegrain bread is allowed on it 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.980
 but what I just did not do it 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.569
 Unfortunately, the time with the sport 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.970
 now slowly dre goes since the 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.190
 now on thursday in the 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.110
 second week so two days 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.080
 probably before I'm so stupid 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.430
 and publish and there are 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.750
 actually pretty good her again 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.370
 maybe still a little bit like that 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.569
 my nose still a bit walk and down 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.600
 and I have this too 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.769
 coughing that I cough so strong 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.190
 must thus can no longer speak 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.690
 but actually it is very nice again 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.860
 relatively well so the circumstances 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.180
 it really is accordingly 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.310
 again become much better and 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.930
 were very fast around normally 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.790
 so attract inflammation and at 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.470
 me forever so I 'll go 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.370
 once a sauce on the boil and the 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.530
 drink 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.410
 Now that my nose is not closed anymore 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:00.930
 is it already the plaintiff but me 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:04.000
 believe she helps and again I do 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.220
 yes, that was my first week, I hope so 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.959
 you liked it even if it was not 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.519
 quite as planned was like I wanted to 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.230
 actually as motivating and 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.700
 but we were sportier as you see 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.459
 Life is not always predictable 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.750
 and planable 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.549
 then you just have to 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.840
 are used to it then resign ourselves 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.590
 Just try it again in the 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.390
 next week 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.070
 he has meanwhile already said 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.900
 thursday the second week and me 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.630
 can anticipate a bit too 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.980
 already with athletes at the beginning of this week 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.799
 still not good but i hope so 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.320
 the next few days with out so good 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.359
 with this cold then again 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.359
 possible to go running yet 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:43.540
 and to do the normal exercises 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:45.910
 after the app but I thought I would drink 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.440
 first still another theory me yet 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.019
 a little bit out and I hope we in 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.900
 our next week again all healthy 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:55.600
 and cheerfully for the second week 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.740
 my reach all then is hopefully 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.690
 The weather is better now 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.120
 a bit sun is but so far 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.010
 just talk about that, therefore I wish you 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.050
 but a sunny day and for one 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.470
 healthy days and the next week then 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.470
 shoots
