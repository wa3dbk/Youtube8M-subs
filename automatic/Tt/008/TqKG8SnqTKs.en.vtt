to maybe be overconfident or lazy before
the<00:01:45.090> interview<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.600> just<00:01:45.689> try<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.170> wing<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.470> so

think<00:01:47.520> about<00:01:47.610> what<00:01:48.000> information<00:01:48.630> you<00:01:48.780> need

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
think about what information you need

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.960 
think about what information you need
from<00:01:49.229> your<00:01:49.380> subject<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:50.100> what<00:01:50.610> type<00:01:50.939> of

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
from your subject and what type of

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.120 
from your subject and what type of
questions<00:01:51.659> will<00:01:52.079> get<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.350> response<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.920> want

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
questions will get the response you want

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.520 
questions will get the response you want
there's<00:01:53.939> also<00:01:54.149> room<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.479> improvise<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:55.320> course

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
there's also room to improvise of course

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.770 
there's also room to improvise of course
so<00:01:56.070> if<00:01:56.310> your<00:01:56.460> subject<00:01:56.909> starts<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.360> talk<00:01:57.600> about

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
so if your subject starts to talk about
