you

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.070 

remember<00:04:21.729> how<00:04:21.880> I<00:04:21.910> said<00:04:22.060> I<00:04:22.240> was<00:04:22.479> looking<00:04:22.630> for<00:04:23.020> an

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
remember how I said I was looking for an

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.140 
remember how I said I was looking for an
overdrive<00:04:23.500> pedal<00:04:23.530> with<00:04:24.010> a<00:04:24.040> low<00:04:24.490> mids<00:04:24.790> boost

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
overdrive pedal with a low mids boost

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.770 
overdrive pedal with a low mids boost
well<00:04:25.930> big<00:04:26.199> muffs<00:04:26.500> along<00:04:27.070> with<00:04:27.280> twins

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
well big muffs along with twins

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.670 
well big muffs along with twins
characteristically<00:04:28.780> lack<00:04:29.050> mids

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
characteristically lack mids

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.400 
characteristically lack mids
so<00:04:30.280> check<00:04:30.639> out<00:04:30.820> how<00:04:31.030> the<00:04:31.090> snapper<00:04:31.720> beats<00:04:32.110> the

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
so check out how the snapper beats the

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.580 
so check out how the snapper beats the
muff<00:04:32.710> up<00:04:33.120> I'm<00:04:34.120> going<00:04:34.389> to<00:04:34.510> start<00:04:34.840> with<00:04:34.990> just<00:04:35.320> my
