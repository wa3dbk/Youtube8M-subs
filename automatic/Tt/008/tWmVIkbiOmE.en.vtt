now that is not an indictment on any
photographer<00:00:26.679> that's<00:00:26.919> ever<00:00:27.160> existed<00:00:27.460> on<00:00:27.970> this

photographer that's ever existed on this
planet<00:00:28.480> I'll<00:00:28.570> bet<00:00:28.960> Ansel<00:00:29.349> Adams<00:00:29.800> took<00:00:30.039> images

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189

that<00:00:30.609> were<00:00:30.699> crooked<00:00:30.970> no<00:00:31.689> probably<00:00:32.079> not<00:00:32.169> but

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
that were crooked no probably not but

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
maybe if you got a tripod that's cool

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.350 
maybe if you got a tripod that's cool
but<00:00:35.920> I'm<00:00:36.010> not<00:00:36.129> using<00:00:36.340> a<00:00:36.520> tripod<00:00:36.640> most<00:00:37.149> of<00:00:37.300> the

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
this one

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.520 
this one
come<00:01:42.640> into<00:01:43.060> it<00:01:43.180> now<00:01:43.329> see<00:01:43.570> the<00:01:43.689> horizon<00:01:44.320> line

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
come into it now see the horizon line

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.160 
come into it now see the horizon line
right<00:01:44.799> here<00:01:45.070> I<00:01:45.219> want<00:01:45.789> that<00:01:45.939> to<00:01:46.060> be<00:01:46.149> straight<00:01:46.509> so

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
right here I want that to be straight so

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.980 
right here I want that to be straight so
what<00:01:47.320> do<00:01:47.380> I<00:01:47.439> do<00:01:47.530> I<00:01:47.829> draw<00:01:48.340> a<00:01:48.579> line<00:01:48.880> on<00:01:49.180> that<00:01:49.659> angle

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
what do I do I draw a line on that angle

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.649 
what do I do I draw a line on that angle
and<00:01:50.619> what<00:01:50.740> I'm<00:01:50.829> saying<00:01:51.220> is<00:01:51.490> make<00:01:51.789> that<00:01:52.060> angle

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:52.659 
and what I'm saying is make that angle

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.929 
and what I'm saying is make that angle
90<00:01:52.930> degrees<00:01:53.530> at<00:01:54.250> least<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:54.579> way<00:01:54.670> we're<00:01:54.850> doing

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
90 degrees at least the way we're doing

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:55.649 
90 degrees at least the way we're doing
it<00:01:55.119> right<00:01:55.270> now

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
it right now

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.319 
it right now
so<00:01:55.960> I'm<00:01:56.049> gonna<00:01:56.140> get<00:01:56.350> right<00:01:56.470> about<00:01:56.710> here

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
so I'm gonna get right about here

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.029 
so I'm gonna get right about here
doesn't<00:01:58.329> matter<00:01:58.479> how<00:01:58.600> long<00:01:58.810> the<00:01:58.990> line<00:01:59.170> is<00:01:59.200> just

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
doesn't matter how long the line is just

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.730 
doesn't matter how long the line is just
make<00:02:00.250> sure<00:02:00.429> it<00:02:00.610> replicates<00:02:01.450> the<00:02:01.780> angle<00:02:02.470> of

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
make sure it replicates the angle of

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.980 
make sure it replicates the angle of
what<00:02:03.220> you<00:02:03.369> see<00:02:03.610> on<00:02:03.640> that<00:02:04.030> horizon<00:02:04.299> on<00:02:04.659> the<00:02:04.750> path

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
what you see on that horizon on the path

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.350 
what you see on that horizon on the path
and<00:02:05.289> then<00:02:05.829> let<00:02:06.460> go<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:07.780> grow<00:02:08.289> or<00:02:08.619> shrink

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
and then let go so grow or shrink

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.900 
and then let go so grow or shrink
basically<00:02:10.360> places<00:02:11.019> the<00:02:11.200> image<00:02:11.590> inside<00:02:11.890> of<00:02:12.670> the

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
basically places the image inside of the

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.300 
basically places the image inside of the
original<00:02:13.450> area<00:02:13.720> say<00:02:14.260> five<00:02:14.500> by<00:02:14.680> seven<00:02:14.739> whatever

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
original area say five by seven whatever

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.770 
original area say five by seven whatever
and<00:02:15.549> it<00:02:16.480> shrinks<00:02:16.870> it<00:02:17.200> so<00:02:17.950> it'll<00:02:18.099> still<00:02:18.430> fit

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
and it shrinks it so it'll still fit

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.960 
and it shrinks it so it'll still fit
that's<00:02:19.780> what<00:02:20.019> it<00:02:20.110> does<00:02:20.290> when<00:02:20.860> we<00:02:21.069> press<00:02:21.370> undo

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
that's what it does when we press undo

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.420 
that's what it does when we press undo
my<00:02:22.330> favorite<00:02:22.840> key<00:02:22.989> in<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.170> world<00:02:23.349> let's<00:02:24.160> go<00:02:24.340> to

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
my favorite key in the world let's go to

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.520 
my favorite key in the world let's go to
the<00:02:24.549> next<00:02:24.700> one<00:02:24.970> which<00:02:25.239> is<00:02:25.269> remove<00:02:25.870> background

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
the next one which is remove background

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.380 
the next one which is remove background
I<00:02:26.650> said<00:02:26.830> this<00:02:26.980> is<00:02:27.099> my<00:02:27.250> favorite<00:02:27.730> in<00:02:27.849> most<00:02:28.150> cases

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
I said this is my favorite in most cases

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.500 
I said this is my favorite in most cases
it<00:02:28.660> is<00:02:28.690> I'm<00:02:29.620> gonna<00:02:29.769> come<00:02:29.980> here<00:02:30.160> again<00:02:30.480> again<00:02:31.480> I

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
it is I'm gonna come here again again I

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.380 
it is I'm gonna come here again again I
want<00:02:31.720> to<00:02:31.780> watch<00:02:31.930> that<00:02:32.170> line<00:02:32.730> draw<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:34.120> just

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
want to watch that line draw and just

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.420 
want to watch that line draw and just
make<00:02:34.690> sure<00:02:34.989> you<00:02:35.260> get<00:02:35.470> that<00:02:35.739> line<00:02:36.099> or<00:02:36.340> that

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
make sure you get that line or that

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.539 
make sure you get that line or that
horizon<00:02:36.790> angle<00:02:37.360> I<00:02:37.510> like<00:02:38.470> this<00:02:38.650> one<00:02:38.829> and<00:02:39.310> what

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
horizon angle I like this one and what

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.850 
horizon angle I like this one and what
it<00:02:39.640> does<00:02:39.880> basically<00:02:40.150> it<00:02:40.810> will<00:02:40.989> grow<00:02:41.380> it<00:02:41.590> in<00:02:41.769> a

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
it does basically it will grow it in a

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.309 
it does basically it will grow it in a
sense<00:02:42.130> to<00:02:42.459> fill<00:02:42.819> in<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.390> white<00:02:43.599> area<00:02:44.049> so<00:02:44.260> you

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
sense to fill in the white area so you

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.289 
sense to fill in the white area so you
are<00:02:44.650> losing<00:02:45.010> a<00:02:45.489> little<00:02:45.760> bit<00:02:45.910> of<00:02:46.030> information

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
are losing a little bit of information

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:48.660 
are losing a little bit of information
on<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.959> sides<00:02:47.200> depending<00:02:48.069> on<00:02:48.160> how<00:02:48.310> much<00:02:48.489> the

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
on the sides depending on how much the

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.539 
on the sides depending on how much the
angle<00:02:49.000> is<00:02:49.180> but<00:02:50.140> it<00:02:50.290> saves<00:02:50.650> you<00:02:50.980> from<00:02:51.010> having<00:02:51.400> to

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
angle is but it saves you from having to

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.130 
angle is but it saves you from having to
figure<00:02:51.850> out<00:02:52.000> what<00:02:52.180> to<00:02:52.299> do<00:02:52.450> if<00:02:52.750> you<00:02:52.870> got<00:02:53.019> all

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
figure out what to do if you got all

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.940 
figure out what to do if you got all
those<00:02:53.260> white<00:02:53.560> areas<00:02:54.150> let's<00:02:55.150> press<00:02:55.420> on<00:02:55.569> do<00:02:55.950> so

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
those white areas let's press on do so

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.860 
those white areas let's press on do so
you're<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.190> last<00:02:57.370> one<00:02:57.639> and<00:02:57.790> this<00:02:58.359> one<00:02:58.540> is

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
you're the last one and this one is

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.920 
you're the last one and this one is
original<00:02:59.680> size<00:03:00.269> so<00:03:01.269> if<00:03:01.329> we<00:03:01.420> come<00:03:01.600> back<00:03:01.750> over

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
original size so if we come back over

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.809 
original size so if we come back over
here<00:03:02.049> one<00:03:02.350> more<00:03:02.590> time<00:03:02.889> and<00:03:03.430> give<00:03:03.670> ourselves

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 
here one more time and give ourselves

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:05.879 
here one more time and give ourselves
that<00:03:04.480> angle<00:03:04.959> and<00:03:05.350> it<00:03:05.440> doesn't<00:03:05.650> matter<00:03:05.799> how

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:05.889 
that angle and it doesn't matter how

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:08.009 
that angle and it doesn't matter how
long<00:03:06.069> just<00:03:06.130> get<00:03:06.579> the<00:03:06.670> angle<00:03:06.940> right<00:03:07.090> you<00:03:07.840> say

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
long just get the angle right you say

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.569 
long just get the angle right you say
well<00:03:08.230> that<00:03:08.440> kind<00:03:08.980> of<00:03:09.040> looks<00:03:09.190> like<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.400> first

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
well that kind of looks like the first

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.910 
well that kind of looks like the first
one<00:03:09.989> remember<00:03:10.989> what<00:03:11.200> this<00:03:11.350> one<00:03:11.590> looks<00:03:11.620> like

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
one remember what this one looks like

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.309 
one remember what this one looks like
see<00:03:12.579> how<00:03:12.700> we've<00:03:12.880> lost<00:03:13.120> information<00:03:13.569> here

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
see how we've lost information here

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.509 
see how we've lost information here
original<00:03:15.310> size<00:03:15.519> here<00:03:16.359> and<00:03:16.660> here<00:03:17.470> if<00:03:17.889> we<00:03:18.130> undo

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
original size here and here if we undo

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.400 
original size here and here if we undo
just<00:03:18.790> as<00:03:18.910> a<00:03:18.940> review<00:03:19.209> let's<00:03:19.930> go<00:03:20.049> back<00:03:20.200> to<00:03:20.319> this

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
just as a review let's go back to this

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.610 
just as a review let's go back to this
one

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
one

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.690 
one
you're<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:21.830> same<00:03:22.040> thing

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
you're the same thing

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.990 
you're the same thing
watch<00:03:23.849> your<00:03:24.060> angle

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
watch your angle

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.990 
watch your angle
shrunk<00:03:26.600> it<00:03:26.870> to<00:03:27.590> fit<00:03:28.010> the<00:03:28.340> original<00:03:28.790> area

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
shrunk it to fit the original area

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.580 
shrunk it to fit the original area
that's<00:03:29.390> the<00:03:29.510> difference<00:03:29.960> it's<00:03:30.140> saying<00:03:30.290> I<00:03:30.410> will

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
that's the difference it's saying I will

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.530 
that's the difference it's saying I will
not<00:03:30.800> get<00:03:31.040> rid<00:03:31.220> of<00:03:31.280> anything<00:03:31.760> you're<00:03:32.420> gonna

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
not get rid of anything you're gonna

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.060 
not get rid of anything you're gonna
have<00:03:32.780> to<00:03:32.900> deal<00:03:33.140> with<00:03:33.320> the<00:03:33.410> white<00:03:33.560> areas<00:03:33.950> I'll

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
have to deal with the white areas I'll

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.980 
have to deal with the white areas I'll
let<00:03:34.220> you<00:03:34.310> figure<00:03:34.520> that<00:03:34.760> out<00:03:34.940> but<00:03:35.690> I'm<00:03:35.810> gonna

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
let you figure that out but I'm gonna

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.170 
let you figure that out but I'm gonna
give<00:03:36.320> you<00:03:36.560> the<00:03:36.860> whole<00:03:37.070> image<00:03:37.460> no<00:03:37.700> matter<00:03:37.880> what

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
give you the whole image no matter what

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.970 
give you the whole image no matter what
you<00:03:38.330> do<00:03:38.540> that's<00:03:39.110> the<00:03:39.290> difference

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
you do that's the difference

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.950 
you do that's the difference
straightening<00:03:40.790> an<00:03:40.910> image<00:03:41.180> is<00:03:41.360> really<00:03:41.630> easy

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:41.960 
straightening an image is really easy

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.530 
straightening an image is really easy
but<00:03:42.290> again<00:03:42.620> you<00:03:43.400> may<00:03:43.580> have<00:03:43.610> a<00:03:43.790> straight<00:03:44.209> image

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
but again you may have a straight image

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.540 
but again you may have a straight image
that<00:03:44.930> you<00:03:45.020> want<00:03:45.230> a<00:03:45.290> slight<00:03:45.530> angle<00:03:45.740> on<00:03:46.040> and<00:03:46.280> this

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
that you want a slight angle on and this

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.550 
that you want a slight angle on and this
tool<00:03:46.790> will<00:03:47.030> do<00:03:47.209> just<00:03:47.540> a<00:03:47.660> good<00:03:47.810> job<00:03:48.080> at<00:03:48.260> making

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
tool will do just a good job at making

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.040 
tool will do just a good job at making
an<00:03:48.920> unstraight<00:03:49.550> angle<00:03:49.910> as<00:03:50.030> it<00:03:50.390> does<00:03:50.570> making<00:03:50.959> a

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
an unstraight angle as it does making a

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.120 
an unstraight angle as it does making a
straight<00:03:51.290> angle<00:03:51.820> onto<00:03:52.820> the<00:03:52.940> next
