change the degrees to Celsius instead of

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.260 
change the degrees to Celsius instead of
Fahrenheit<00:02:08.280> mine's<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:08.700> Fahrenheit<00:02:09.090> right

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
Fahrenheit mine's in Fahrenheit right

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
now you can remove Los Angeles so if you

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.580 
now you can remove Los Angeles so if you
don't<00:02:12.750> want

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
don't want

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.280 
don't want
the<00:02:14.490> CD<00:02:14.820> name<00:02:15.000> in<00:02:15.270> here<00:02:15.810> where<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.260> says

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
the CD name in here where it says

weather format 1 that's where the CD
name<00:02:19.980> is<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:20.430> if<00:02:20.520> you<00:02:20.640> don't<00:02:20.940> want<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.300> you

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
backspace' and just make sure there's

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.170 
backspace' and just make sure there's
nothing<00:02:27.270> in<00:02:27.480> there<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:29.280> explains<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:29.880> all<00:02:29.940> here

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
nothing in there it explains it all here

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.880 
nothing in there it explains it all here
but<00:02:30.420> if<00:02:30.600> you<00:02:30.720> want<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:30.959> change<00:02:31.140> Celsius<00:02:31.650> then

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
but if you want to change Celsius then

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
but if you want to change Celsius then
you<00:02:31.980> type<00:02:32.190> in<00:02:32.450> CL<00:02:33.450> instead<00:02:34.080> of<00:02:34.550> FH<00:02:35.550> which<00:02:35.760> would

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
you type in CL instead of FH which would

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.790 
you type in CL instead of FH which would
be<00:02:36.030> 4<00:02:36.180> Fahrenheit<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:36.870> that's<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.560> would<00:02:37.650> go

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
be 4 Fahrenheit and that's that would go

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.040 
be 4 Fahrenheit and that's that would go
in<00:02:37.920> this<00:02:38.070> section<00:02:38.340> what<00:02:38.880> weather<00:02:39.330> format<00:02:39.750> to

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
in this section what weather format to

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.350 
in this section what weather format to
the<00:02:40.890> process<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.430> might<00:02:41.670> sound<00:02:41.940> complicated

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
the process it might sound complicated

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.150 
the process it might sound complicated
but<00:02:42.720> once<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:43.020> read<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.380> and<00:02:43.620> install<00:02:43.920> it's

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
but once you read it and install it's

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.330 
but once you read it and install it's
super<00:02:44.490> easy<00:02:44.520> and<00:02:44.970> then<00:02:45.810> you<00:02:46.140> can<00:02:46.739> just<00:02:47.010> have

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
super easy and then you can just have

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.490 
super easy and then you can just have
your<00:02:47.550> new<00:02:47.940> status<00:02:48.239> bar<00:02:48.420> so<00:02:48.690> anytime<00:02:49.080> you<00:02:49.380> look

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
to launch it it'll actually just be here

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.420 
to launch it it'll actually just be here
on<00:02:57.300> your<00:02:57.780> status<00:02:57.930> bar<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:58.410> if<00:02:58.500> I<00:02:58.620> jump<00:02:59.220> into<00:02:59.370> the

well
the<00:03:03.360> default<00:03:03.930> weather<00:03:04.110> app<00:03:04.290> on<00:03:04.440> your<00:03:04.530> phone

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
and obviously it's 70 degrees just like

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.280 
and obviously it's 70 degrees just like
it<00:03:07.440> says<00:03:07.590> right<00:03:07.620> here<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:09.540> icon<00:03:09.900> is<00:03:10.080> sunny

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
just like it is here so that's kind of

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.940 
just like it is here so that's kind of
how<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:12.570> works<00:03:12.750> it's<00:03:13.080> super<00:03:13.440> simple<00:03:13.590> little

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
how it works it's super simple little

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.830 
how it works it's super simple little
tweak<00:03:14.160> it<00:03:14.400> makes<00:03:14.910> it<00:03:15.090> a<00:03:15.120> lot<00:03:15.270> easier<00:03:15.330> and

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
tweak it makes it a lot easier and

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.440 
tweak it makes it a lot easier and
quicker<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:16.290> see<00:03:16.500> current<00:03:17.040> weather<00:03:17.269> on<00:03:18.269> your

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
phone you will have to enter in a new

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.539 
phone you will have to enter in a new
code<00:03:21.450> depending<00:03:22.440> on<00:03:22.560> what<00:03:22.769> CD<00:03:23.010> here<00:03:23.250> and<00:03:23.459> it

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
code depending on what CD here and it

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.670 
code depending on what CD here and it
doesn't<00:03:23.850> automatically<00:03:24.330> adjust<00:03:24.810> so<00:03:25.410> just

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
doesn't automatically adjust so just

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.110 
doesn't automatically adjust so just
make<00:03:26.040> sure<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.250> keep<00:03:26.370> that<00:03:26.430> in<00:03:26.580> mind<00:03:26.850> if<00:03:27.000> you're

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
make sure to keep that in mind if you're

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.970
