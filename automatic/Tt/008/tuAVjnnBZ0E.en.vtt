00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
like I just told you that a cafe house

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.009 
like I just told you that a cafe house
piano<00:01:00.899> music<00:01:01.500> which<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.609> also<00:01:02.789> very<00:01:03.030> nice<00:01:03.359> what

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
piano music which is also very nice what

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.539 
piano music which is also very nice what
I<00:01:04.049> thought<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.589> could<00:01:04.860> be<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:05.040> little<00:01:05.369> bit

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
I thought it could be a little bit

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.670 
I thought it could be a little bit
better<00:01:05.670> maybe<00:01:05.790> with<00:01:06.540> some<00:01:06.570> kind<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.229> baseline

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
better maybe with some kind of baseline

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.490 
better maybe with some kind of baseline
so<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.280> will<00:01:08.580> just<00:01:08.610> try<00:01:09.000> now<00:01:09.240> play<00:01:10.020> one<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.260> those

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
so I will just try now play one of those

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.510

which<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.189> also<00:01:50.369> quite<00:01:50.670> useful<00:01:51.180> if<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.540> don't

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
which is also quite useful if you don't

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.980 
which is also quite useful if you don't
know<00:01:51.960> which<00:01:52.229> ppm<00:01:52.740> at<00:01:53.280> Rikers<00:01:53.759> for<00:01:53.790> example<00:01:54.450> the

know which ppm at Rikers for example the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.030 
know which ppm at Rikers for example the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
CDJ 400 won't ever never recognize which

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.469 
CDJ 400 won't ever never recognize which
ppm<00:01:59.549> has<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.409> piano<00:02:01.409> song<00:02:01.950> or<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.700> song<00:02:03.000> with<00:02:03.180> just

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
ppm has a piano song or a song with just

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.190 
ppm has a piano song or a song with just
some<00:02:03.930> little<00:02:04.259> tiny<00:02:04.829> high<00:02:05.250> hat<00:02:05.659> because<00:02:06.659> the

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
some little tiny high hat because the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.949 
some little tiny high hat because the
software<00:02:07.380> ain't<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.160> good<00:02:08.369> as<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:09.420> human

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
software ain't that good as a human

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.089 
software ain't that good as a human
human<00:02:10.440> ear<00:02:10.790> so<00:02:11.790> we<00:02:11.940> can<00:02:12.150> just

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
human ear so we can just

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.850 
human ear so we can just
tap<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.280> BPM<00:02:14.959> with<00:02:15.959> your<00:02:16.170> fingers<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.560> the

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
tap the BPM with your fingers and the

software in yours djm 400 will recognize

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.640 
software in yours djm 400 will recognize
this<00:02:20.700> ppm<00:02:21.239> and<00:02:21.450> then<00:02:21.660> you<00:02:21.750> can<00:02:21.989> lay<00:02:22.290> some

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
this ppm and then you can lay some

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.050 
this ppm and then you can lay some
effects<00:02:23.069> even<00:02:23.280> over<00:02:24.019> piano<00:02:25.019> music<00:02:25.849> alright<00:02:26.849> so

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
effects even over piano music alright so

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.820 
effects even over piano music alright so
here<00:02:27.269> we<00:02:27.360> go<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:28.069> I<00:02:29.780> think<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.140> I<00:02:31.260> hope<00:02:31.530> that

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
here we go and I think and I hope that

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.580 
here we go and I think and I hope that
you<00:02:32.519> won't<00:02:32.849> have<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.269> puke<00:02:33.540> in<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.049> first<00:02:34.260> 10

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
you won't have to puke in the first 10

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.809 
you won't have to puke in the first 10
seconds<00:02:35.160> or<00:02:35.510> in<00:02:36.510> the<00:02:36.660> LA<00:02:37.049> next<00:02:37.410> head<00:02:37.739> and<00:02:37.920> next

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
seconds or in the LA next head and next

00:02:38.819 --> 00:03:00.280 
seconds or in the LA next head and next
two<00:02:38.940> minutes<00:02:39.090> so<00:02:40.080> we'll<00:02:41.040> just<00:02:41.129> give<00:02:41.430> it<00:02:41.519> a<00:02:41.580> try

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:13.850 

Oh

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:38.840 

you

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.450 

as<00:03:39.850> you<00:03:40.060> can<00:03:40.210> see<00:03:40.510> I'm<00:03:41.290> only<00:03:41.560> trying<00:03:42.130> to<00:03:42.310> beat

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.460 
as you can see I'm only trying to beat

as you can see I'm only trying to beat

pitch control on the white feature you

00:03:49.960 --> 00:04:04.020 
pitch control on the white feature you
will<00:03:50.110> get<00:03:50.260> lost<00:03:50.500> in<00:03:50.800> and<00:03:51.160> totally<00:03:51.580> off<00:03:52.000> bees

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:11.670 

oh<00:04:05.040> sounds<00:04:06.040> quite<00:04:06.250> horribly<00:04:10.440> slow<00:04:11.440> to<00:04:11.590> the

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
oh sounds quite horribly slow to the

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:27.790 
oh sounds quite horribly slow to the
ground

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:58.550 

LOL

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.790 

now<00:04:59.560> this<00:04:59.710> is<00:04:59.919> a<00:05:00.190> wrong<00:05:01.090> feature<00:05:01.500> it<00:05:02.500> just

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
now this is a wrong feature it just

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:19.940 
now this is a wrong feature it just
keeps<00:05:03.430> on<00:05:03.580> repeating<00:05:03.790> me<00:05:04.240> one<00:05:05.139> of<00:05:05.169> the<00:05:05.530> tones

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:23.430 

all<00:05:20.950> right<00:05:21.100> so<00:05:21.310> that<00:05:21.490> was<00:05:21.640> a<00:05:21.669> nice<00:05:21.970> droid<00:05:22.440> it

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
all right so that was a nice droid it

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.400 
all right so that was a nice droid it
was<00:05:23.680> horribly<00:05:24.580> rough<00:05:25.240> at<00:05:25.600> one<00:05:25.900> point<00:05:26.140> and<00:05:26.730> as<00:05:27.730> I

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
was horribly rough at one point and as I

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.580 
was horribly rough at one point and as I
don't<00:05:29.550> suggest<00:05:30.550> to<00:05:31.030> touch<00:05:31.780> the<00:05:31.960> pitch<00:05:32.110> control

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
don't suggest to touch the pitch control

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.030 
don't suggest to touch the pitch control
because<00:05:32.919> if<00:05:33.790> you<00:05:34.120> use<00:05:34.300> the<00:05:34.330> pitch<00:05:34.630> control<00:05:35.140> for

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.040 
because if you use the pitch control for

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.730 
because if you use the pitch control for
about<00:05:36.460> one<00:05:36.729> millimeter<00:05:36.910> on<00:05:37.720> white<00:05:38.410> feature

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
about one millimeter on white feature

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.219 
about one millimeter on white feature
you<00:05:39.040> will<00:05:39.070> jump<00:05:39.520> about<00:05:39.820> two<00:05:40.240> or<00:05:40.389> three<00:05:40.660> percent

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
you will jump about two or three percent

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:43.590 
you will jump about two or three percent
so<00:05:41.740> you<00:05:42.130> can't<00:05:42.460> it<00:05:42.760> is<00:05:42.940> it<00:05:43.240> is<00:05:43.330> quite

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 
so you can't it is it is quite

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.710 
so you can't it is it is quite
impossible<00:05:43.630> to<00:05:44.260> bees<00:05:44.560> protect<00:05:45.190> precise<00:05:46.090> in

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
impossible to bees protect precise in

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.110 
impossible to bees protect precise in
beat<00:05:47.710> matching<00:05:47.890> with<00:05:48.220> the<00:05:48.250> pitch<00:05:48.490> controls<00:05:48.940> or

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
beat matching with the pitch controls or

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.380 
beat matching with the pitch controls or
what<00:05:49.210> I<00:05:49.240> just<00:05:49.540> tried<00:05:50.729> to<00:05:51.729> do<00:05:51.850> it<00:05:51.940> with<00:05:51.970> the<00:05:52.210> jog

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
what I just tried to do it with the jog

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.779 
what I just tried to do it with the jog
wheel<00:05:53.100> and<00:05:54.100> what<00:05:55.090> we<00:05:55.240> have<00:05:55.360> seen<00:05:55.630> the<00:05:56.080> tab<00:05:56.320> I

00:05:56.779 --> 00:05:56.789 
wheel and what we have seen the tab I

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:00.330 
wheel and what we have seen the tab I
didn't<00:05:57.789> know<00:05:57.970> how<00:05:58.810> much<00:05:58.840> or<00:05:59.410> how<00:05:59.470> fast<00:06:00.130> the

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
didn't know how much or how fast the

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.029 
didn't know how much or how fast the
song<00:06:00.520> in<00:06:00.669> here<00:06:00.850> was<00:06:01.030> the<00:06:01.660> CDJ<00:06:02.110> 400<00:06:02.560> was<00:06:02.710> showing

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:03.039 
song in here was the CDJ 400 was showing

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:07.560 
song in here was the CDJ 400 was showing
me<00:06:03.190> about<00:06:03.660> 118<00:06:04.660> BPM<00:06:05.140> for<00:06:05.770> this<00:06:05.890> piano<00:06:06.460> song<00:06:06.880> but

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570 
me about 118 BPM for this piano song but

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.350 
me about 118 BPM for this piano song but
as<00:06:08.350> you<00:06:08.500> can<00:06:08.650> imagine<00:06:08.710> that<00:06:09.310> piano<00:06:09.820> song<00:06:10.120> has

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
as you can imagine that piano song has

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.050 
as you can imagine that piano song has
never<00:06:10.630> been<00:06:10.810> and<00:06:11.110> never<00:06:11.350> will<00:06:11.650> probably<00:06:12.490> be

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
never been and never will probably be

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.730 
never been and never will probably be
about<00:06:13.479> a<00:06:13.860> 118<00:06:14.860> BPM<00:06:15.250> so<00:06:16.090> I<00:06:16.479> tapped<00:06:16.780> with<00:06:17.530> my

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
about a 118 BPM so I tapped with my

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:23.070 
about a 118 BPM so I tapped with my
finger<00:06:18.070> and<00:06:19.710> the<00:06:20.710> real<00:06:21.100> BPM<00:06:21.550> was<00:06:22.090> something

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
finger and the real BPM was something

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:28.080 
finger and the real BPM was something
about<00:06:23.760> 90<00:06:24.760> 93<00:06:26.010> something<00:06:27.010> about<00:06:27.190> that<00:06:27.400> but<00:06:27.700> you

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
about 90 93 something about that but you

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.150 
about 90 93 something about that but you
should<00:06:28.390> always<00:06:28.600> keep<00:06:29.020> in<00:06:29.169> mind<00:06:29.410> those<00:06:29.770> tracks

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160 
should always keep in mind those tracks

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.070 
should always keep in mind those tracks
made<00:06:30.460> by<00:06:30.520> piano<00:06:31.000> day<00:06:31.240> or<00:06:31.390> play<00:06:31.600> they<00:06:31.960> are

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 
made by piano day or play they are

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.659 
made by piano day or play they are
played<00:06:32.320> by<00:06:32.350> a<00:06:32.590> real<00:06:32.830> band<00:06:33.070> so<00:06:33.370> there<00:06:33.550> is<00:06:33.640> a

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:33.669 
played by a real band so there is a

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:37.770 
played by a real band so there is a
drama<00:06:34.000> and<00:06:34.270> as<00:06:35.140> a<00:06:35.200> drama<00:06:35.560> is<00:06:35.800> also<00:06:36.640> no<00:06:37.180> computer

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:37.780 
drama and as a drama is also no computer

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.800 
drama and as a drama is also no computer
but<00:06:38.169> a<00:06:38.200> human<00:06:38.560> it<00:06:39.550> could<00:06:39.820> be<00:06:40.030> that<00:06:40.060> he's

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:40.810 
but a human it could be that he's

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.730 
but a human it could be that he's
sometimes<00:06:41.500> not<00:06:42.430> in<00:06:42.820> beat<00:06:43.240> with<00:06:43.450> himself<00:06:43.690> so<00:06:44.169> at

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:44.740 
sometimes not in beat with himself so at

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:46.500 
sometimes not in beat with himself so at
one<00:06:45.130> part<00:06:45.430> in<00:06:45.580> the<00:06:45.669> truck<00:06:45.910> he<00:06:46.030> plays<00:06:46.270> a<00:06:46.300> little

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:46.510 
one part in the truck he plays a little

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.469
