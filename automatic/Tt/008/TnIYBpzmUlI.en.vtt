 hello friends and welcome to a new 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.360
 video tutorial on how to make your games 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.720
 faster PCs does not require downloading 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.849
 nothing the first thing we have to do is 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.560
 Create a shortcut on the desktop 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:28.250
 of the game they want to increase their 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.259
 performance then to that same game you 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.880
 we give right click properties and we 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:34.660
 we go to the window that says 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.660
 compatibility 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.140
 in this window you will have everything without 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.239
 in this way, what we are going to 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.280
 to do is tick from the second to 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.280
 down to be able to increase yourself 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.410
 performance that will look a little ugly 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.809
 the graphics but in the case of the far 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.390
 cry 3 and the prototype will not change much 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:57.379
 we give in applying and we close the 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.390
 window 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.730
 now I will show you a before and after 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.930
 of the game so they can see the effect that 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.930
 cause this technique 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:19.320
 is awake good not at all you have 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.320
 the arm desensitized for tata or 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.010
 as you will have seen in this short video the 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.409
 character of anis roger meets the 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.540
 actions but how is the game so slow 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.729
 and its same performance as the actions 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.659
 of this same character are behind 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:41.360
 I notice that the resolution is in 1380 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.780
 for I do not know how much x of now we see the 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.780
 after 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.370
 he is awake good 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.110
 You not quite have the arm 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.110
 desensitized to treaties 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.460
 swimming in the storm is brave but 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.220
 sunbathe 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.350
 on a beach with pirates is not a 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.750
 madness it shows a great change true 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.060
