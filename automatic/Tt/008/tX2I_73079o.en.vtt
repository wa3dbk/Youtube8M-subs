00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.420
 hi cybernaut 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.519
 let's start putting things on our website 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.629
 come if the cursor is waiting for us to wait 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:13.139
 we write arch 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.719
 we put 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.719
 company 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.960
 two points station 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.960
 and we are going to put here service 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.819
 I'm going to press the int key 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:34.220
 by pressing the key intro disgusted let's get used to reading here below in 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.449
 disgusted a new 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:37.460
 paragraph you see it p 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.540
 a new paragraph has been created following paragraph and paragraph leaves me a line 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.250
 in white 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.940
 it can be 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.600
 let's put another text here 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.460
 Cocker 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.460
 we offer 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.670
 I'm going to press the clash inc again 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.070
 notice that between paragraph and paragraph will always leave us an intro 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.890
 to have to write everything I have a copied text I'm going to paste 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.810
 do not imagine that I've already written all this 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.579
 continuing to write to the end he makes me jump automatic tracking 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:17.810
 you do not want intro if you do not want there to be 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.700
 a change of 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.320
 now let's see how to format all this 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.330
 we open the properties window 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.200
 here we have them 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.200
 notice that we have typical properties of a text 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.189
 alignments 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:34.370
 no pitas 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.650
 we will see what the cdc css puesteros in cascade mean that same 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.020
 we want here 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.720
 here we have to define 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.040
 the size of a text 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.040
 since we have to define typography 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.590
 let's see how it works 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.260
 for example we select the word companies as if it were 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.050
 a formal word processor 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.820
 I keep pressing tita trail care that has not taken both together then 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.820
 I come back a little bit here crawled 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.130
 how we want that text to be, we are going to change the color because in the part of 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.809
 down in the sale of properties here says 

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:12.279
 color I detest click or 

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:15.659
 it looks like a panel of color because it hurt any color 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.589
 the blue 

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:23.059
 I'm going to girls out since October of this text to see if you do not have this post 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.649
 kind 

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:26.709
 very well look for the opposite witness 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:31.409
 you can select it again because they do not want to doctor instead of keeping 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.389
 tight and drag tighten tic tic twice 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:36.789
 Yamel murdered 

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:40.129
 I come here to the task the sale of properties and pulse mÃ©rida 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:42.279
 and another numerical 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:45.239
 today Friday click or off 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.869
 we already have them ready 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:49.869
 very well now the word that we offer 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.190
 let's put it ahead look at a way to change the size messi had 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:57.019
 inside 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.499
 did not select now I want the whole paragraph to be bigger 

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:03.189
 not just an alert 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.309
 Well, he selected and I come here 

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:07.639
 where it says format 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:08.709
 keko here 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.939
 and it tells us about the headers in footwear 1 is the biggest headline 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:14.400
 two 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.640
 it's a little smaller and so down very well headed 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.510
 the machine will keep like a title and then you do not have to select anything if 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.579
 I tell you in the head or two 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.049
 mel bet all this paragraph at each state 2 do not have to select 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.079
 nothing 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.499
 if you wanted to just apply hunt size change 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:37.299
 to a text for example again the word company selected 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.179
 instead of format you'll have to do it here by size 

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:42.269
 click or here 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.199
 here I will tell you for example bigger 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:47.669
 and we have it bigger 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:53.099
 summing up here in paragraph we'll say for a whole paragraph instead in 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.400
 popcorn size these selected 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.879

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:58.989

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:27.279

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.610
