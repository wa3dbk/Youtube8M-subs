00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.990 
pretty sure that it wasn't really going
to<00:04:04.569> use<00:04:04.750> powers<00:04:05.260> again<00:04:05.530> I<00:04:05.769> think<00:04:06.010> I<00:04:06.430> think<00:04:06.819> the

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
to use powers again I think I think the

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.280 
to use powers again I think I think the
weather<00:04:07.180> one<00:04:07.450> works

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:18.530 

so<00:04:13.700> that<00:04:14.700> happened<00:04:15.530> so<00:04:16.530> um<00:04:17.180> honestly<00:04:18.180> I'm<00:04:18.450> a

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
so that happened so um honestly I'm a

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.270 
so that happened so um honestly I'm a
little<00:04:18.570> bit<00:04:19.020> stumped<00:04:19.620> so<00:04:19.800> I<00:04:19.830> would<00:04:20.040> just

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
little bit stumped so I would just

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.560 
little bit stumped so I would just
normally<00:04:20.970> it<00:04:21.060> would<00:04:21.150> ask<00:04:21.300> a<00:04:21.420> specific

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
normally it would ask a specific

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.900 
normally it would ask a specific
question<00:04:21.930> but<00:04:22.560> you<00:04:22.890> really<00:04:23.040> can't<00:04:23.340> argue<00:04:23.640> with

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
question but you really can't argue with

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.420 
question but you really can't argue with
that<00:04:24.060> logic<00:04:24.410> I'm<00:04:25.410> just<00:04:25.620> gonna<00:04:25.770> ask<00:04:25.950> them<00:04:26.220> to

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
that logic I'm just gonna ask them to

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.000 
that logic I'm just gonna ask them to
reinforce<00:04:27.030> one<00:04:27.720> point<00:04:28.020> from<00:04:28.200> their<00:04:28.350> argument

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
reinforce one point from their argument

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.840 
reinforce one point from their argument
so<00:04:29.370> Masood<00:04:30.110> okay<00:04:31.110> I'm<00:04:31.320> gonna<00:04:31.500> stick<00:04:31.800> with<00:04:31.860> a

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
so Masood okay I'm gonna stick with a

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.830 
so Masood okay I'm gonna stick with a
