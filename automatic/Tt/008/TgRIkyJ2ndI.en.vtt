00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
and how to play a bit and we can go into

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.700 
and how to play a bit and we can go into
divisions<00:00:21.720> and<00:00:21.930> we<00:00:22.020> can<00:00:22.170> go<00:00:22.350> for<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.680> big

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.050 
divisions and we can go for the big
money<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.220> I'm<00:00:23.279> not<00:00:23.310> really<00:00:23.490> sure<00:00:23.580> how<00:00:23.880> much

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
money so I'm not really sure how much

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.400 
money so I'm not really sure how much
money<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.420> get<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.779> coins<00:00:24.990> wires

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
money you get and coins wires

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.320 
money you get and coins wires
I<00:00:25.560> don't<00:00:26.070> know<00:00:26.369> much<00:00:26.490> bet<00:00:26.699> what's<00:00:26.939> better<00:00:27.150> for

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
I don't know much bet what's better for

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.759 
I don't know much bet what's better for
getting<00:00:27.390> coins<00:00:27.720> really<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.230> think<00:00:28.349> single

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
getting coins really I think single

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:29.509 
getting coins really I think single
matches<00:00:28.890> might<00:00:29.070> be<00:00:29.160> better<00:00:29.310> for<00:00:29.369> getting

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
matches might be better for getting

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.160 
matches might be better for getting
coins<00:00:29.849> this<00:00:29.939> year<00:00:30.179> right<00:00:30.449> this<00:00:30.599> guy's<00:00:30.750> 64

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.640 
talking for bran inside and that's what
you<00:01:16.350> should<00:01:16.530> be<00:01:16.619> doing<00:01:16.759> so<00:01:18.229> I'm<00:01:19.229> not<00:01:19.590> sure

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650
