00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
to get it on my device a little bit

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.680 
to get it on my device a little bit
early<00:00:13.920> so<00:00:14.099> I<00:00:14.400> just<00:00:14.610> what<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:14.820> do<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:15.030> little<00:00:15.450> quick

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
early so I just what I do a little quick

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.410 
early so I just what I do a little quick
hands-on<00:00:16.500> demo<00:00:16.859> with<00:00:17.130> it<00:00:17.279> so<00:00:17.820> what<00:00:18.060> I'm<00:00:18.210> going

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
hands-on demo with it so what I'm going

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.900 
hands-on demo with it so what I'm going
to<00:00:18.539> do<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:19.080> just<00:00:19.560> click<00:00:19.830> apply<00:00:20.130> here<00:00:20.400> as<00:00:20.820> you

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
to do is just click apply here as you

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.330 
to do is just click apply here as you
can<00:00:20.970> see<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.650> assume<00:00:22.650> it's<00:00:22.949> basically

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
can see it I I assume it's basically

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.429 
can see it I I assume it's basically
exactly<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.939> same<00:00:24.119> as<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.359> old<00:00:24.390> temple<00:00:25.289> run

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
exactly the same as the old temple run

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.779 
exactly the same as the old temple run
but<00:00:25.680> kind<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.070> just<00:00:26.189> revamped<00:00:26.580> so<00:00:27.420> if<00:00:27.990> we<00:00:28.050> just

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
but kind of just revamped so if we just

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.979 
but kind of just revamped so if we just
go<00:00:29.789> ahead<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.029> do<00:00:30.300> this<00:00:32.630> so<00:00:33.630> all<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.840> the

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
go ahead and do this so all of the

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.260 
go ahead and do this so all of the
graphics<00:00:34.410> are<00:00:34.680> have<00:00:35.340> been<00:00:35.489> redone<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.910> staff

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
graphics are have been redone the staff

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.580 
graphics are have been redone the staff

continually me failing so we'll see how

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.930 
continually me failing so we'll see how
good<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.620> actually<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:53.250> becomes<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:53.760> I'll

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
good it actually it becomes this I'll

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
how this goes ok you don't have to

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.710 
how this goes ok you don't have to
direct<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:18.950> you<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.040> course<00:01:20.130> can<00:01:21.030> turn<00:01:21.420> and

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
direct it but you of course can turn and

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:33.649 
direct it but you of course can turn and
things<00:01:23.150> just<00:01:24.150> like<00:01:24.360> that

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.160 

it's<00:01:34.499> quite<00:01:34.770> it's<00:01:35.219> quite<00:01:35.399> good<00:01:35.700> um<00:01:36.170> pretty

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
it's quite it's quite good um pretty

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.289 
it's quite it's quite good um pretty
much<00:01:37.469> the<00:01:37.890> same<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.159> far<00:01:38.700> i'm<00:01:38.909> not<00:01:39.060> sure<00:01:39.210> if

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
much the same so far i'm not sure if

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.510 
much the same so far i'm not sure if
there<00:01:39.479> will<00:01:39.539> be<00:01:39.600> new<00:01:39.899> things<00:01:40.200> added<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.310> or

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
there will be new things added to it or

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.760 
there will be new things added to it or
things<00:01:41.819> come<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:42.539> later<00:01:42.960> maybe<00:01:45.380> but<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:46.590> far

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
things come in later maybe but so far

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.099 
things come in later maybe but so far
it's<00:01:46.950> pretty<00:01:47.159> similar<00:01:47.490> it's<00:01:47.700> just<00:01:47.880> new<00:01:48.119> new

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:49.109 
it's pretty similar it's just new new

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:50.630 
it's pretty similar it's just new new
graphics<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.740> stuff<00:01:49.829> i'm<00:01:50.100> sure<00:01:50.399> they<00:01:50.579> could

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
graphics and stuff i'm sure they could

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.039 
graphics and stuff i'm sure they could
have<00:01:50.819> put<00:01:50.969> this<00:01:51.060> into<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.390> whole<00:01:51.539> diversion

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
have put this into the whole diversion

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.709 
have put this into the whole diversion
but<00:01:52.799> obviously<00:01:53.609> you<00:01:54.030> know<00:01:54.149> money<00:01:54.450> grabbing

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719 
but obviously you know money grabbing

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:57.499 
but obviously you know money grabbing
that<00:01:54.929> kind<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.229> stuff<00:01:56.270> if<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.450> doesn't

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
that kind of stuff if this doesn't

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.260 
that kind of stuff if this doesn't
change<00:01:57.810> i'm<00:01:58.289> gonna<00:01:58.439> go<00:01:58.590> ahead<00:01:58.709> and<00:01:58.829> finish<00:01:59.069> it

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
change i'm gonna go ahead and finish it

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.870 
change i'm gonna go ahead and finish it
are<00:02:00.270> there<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.509> go<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:01.109> you<00:02:01.140> can<00:02:01.289> tap<00:02:01.880> double

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
are there you go so you can tap double

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.279 
are there you go so you can tap double
tap<00:02:03.030> somewhere<00:02:03.450> on<00:02:03.569> the<00:02:03.659> screen<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.109> you<00:02:04.200> can

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
tap somewhere on the screen and you can

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.770 
tap somewhere on the screen and you can
activate<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.799> power<00:02:05.509> it<00:02:06.509> looks<00:02:06.719> like<00:02:06.950> a<00:02:08.780> little

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
activate a power it looks like a little

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.869 
activate a power it looks like a little
bit<00:02:09.869> odd<00:02:09.989> i'm<00:02:10.769> not<00:02:10.950> sure<00:02:11.099> what<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.280> does<00:02:11.579> but

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
bit odd i'm not sure what that does but

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.979 
bit odd i'm not sure what that does but
