lessons that I've got up on the site

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:17.340 
lessons that I've got up on the site
these<00:01:15.999> lines<00:01:16.420> in<00:01:16.630> between<00:01:16.689> are<00:01:16.990> called<00:01:17.139> bar

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
these lines in between are called bar

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.190 
these lines in between are called bar
lines<00:01:17.619> so<00:01:18.369> often<00:01:19.209> you<00:01:19.329> have<00:01:19.479> like<00:01:19.689> four<00:01:19.959> four

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
lines so often you have like four four

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.599 
lines so often you have like four four
or<00:01:20.259> three<00:01:20.350> four<00:01:20.799> tells<00:01:21.100> you<00:01:21.159> how<00:01:21.249> many<00:01:21.310> beats

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:21.609 
or three four tells you how many beats

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:23.099 
or three four tells you how many beats
in<00:01:21.789> a<00:01:21.850> bar<00:01:22.029> but<00:01:22.240> this<00:01:22.299> is<00:01:22.359> just<00:01:22.659> about<00:01:22.869> how<00:01:23.049> to

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:23.109 
in a bar but this is just about how to

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:25.859 
in a bar but this is just about how to
read<00:01:23.469> the<00:01:23.499> actual<00:01:23.950> chart<00:01:24.189> self<00:01:24.609> so<00:01:25.479> what<00:01:25.749> we've

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
read the actual chart self so what we've

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.929 
read the actual chart self so what we've
got<00:01:25.990> there<00:01:26.109> is<00:01:26.170> one<00:01:26.319> bar<00:01:26.529> of<00:01:26.560> G<00:01:26.889> one<00:01:27.369> bar<00:01:27.549> of<00:01:27.579> C

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
got there is one bar of G one bar of C

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:29.789 
got there is one bar of G one bar of C
their<00:01:28.240> major<00:01:28.479> chords<00:01:28.929> and<00:01:29.139> then<00:01:29.319> this<00:01:29.409> double

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
their major chords and then this double

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.109 
their major chords and then this double
line<00:01:29.920> with<00:01:30.069> a<00:01:30.130> double<00:01:30.399> dot<00:01:30.609> what<00:01:30.789> that<00:01:30.909> means

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
line with a double dot what that means

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.679 
line with a double dot what that means
is<00:01:31.359> repeat<00:01:31.859> so<00:01:32.859> then<00:01:33.819> you've<00:01:33.939> got<00:01:34.090> a<00:01:34.270> bar<00:01:34.509> of<00:01:34.599> a

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
is repeat so then you've got a bar of a

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:36.690 
is repeat so then you've got a bar of a
minor<00:01:35.020> that's<00:01:35.649> what<00:01:35.829> the<00:01:35.920> dilemma<00:01:36.099> stands<00:01:36.459> for

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
minor that's what the dilemma stands for

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.279 
minor that's what the dilemma stands for
a<00:01:36.729> minor<00:01:36.939> and<00:01:37.209> then<00:01:37.329> a<00:01:37.389> bar<00:01:37.569> of<00:01:37.689> D<00:01:37.899> and<00:01:38.170> the

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
a minor and then a bar of D and the

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.050 
a minor and then a bar of D and the
double<00:01:38.649> line<00:01:38.799> at<00:01:38.979> the<00:01:39.069> end<00:01:39.219> with<00:01:39.399> no<00:01:39.639> double

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
double line at the end with no double

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.120 
double line at the end with no double
dot<00:01:40.240> is<00:01:40.479> means<00:01:41.049> the<00:01:41.139> end<00:01:41.380> of<00:01:41.590> that<00:01:41.740> particular

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
dot is means the end of that particular

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.300 
dot is means the end of that particular
chord<00:01:42.700> sequence<00:01:43.349> so<00:01:44.349> this<00:01:44.590> chord<00:01:44.889> sequence

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
chord sequence so this chord sequence

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.889 
chord sequence so this chord sequence
here<00:01:45.549> sorry<00:01:45.909> I'm<00:01:46.029> going<00:01:46.240> out<00:01:46.359> shot<00:01:46.599> there<00:01:46.779> this

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
here sorry I'm going out shot there this

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.349 
here sorry I'm going out shot there this
chord<00:01:47.139> sequence<00:01:47.469> here<00:01:47.619> G<00:01:47.919> C<00:01:48.310> double<00:01:49.240> line

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:49.359 
chord sequence here G C double line

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:51.749 
chord sequence here G C double line
double<00:01:49.749> dot<00:01:49.929> a<00:01:50.139> minor<00:01:50.649> D<00:01:50.919> should<00:01:50.979> be<00:01:51.279> played

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
double dot a minor D should be played

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:59.489 
double dot a minor D should be played
like<00:01:52.450> this<00:01:53.429> G<00:01:55.079> C<00:01:56.159> back<00:01:57.159> to<00:01:57.189> G<00:01:57.810> C<00:01:58.810> that's<00:01:59.349> the

00:01:59.489 --> 00:01:59.499 
like this G C back to G C that's the

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:02.789 
like this G C back to G C that's the
repeat<00:01:59.829> then<00:02:00.279> a<00:02:00.520> minor<00:02:01.029> D<00:02:01.929> but<00:02:02.409> as<00:02:02.499> you<00:02:02.619> can<00:02:02.739> see

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
repeat then a minor D but as you can see

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.539 
repeat then a minor D but as you can see
that<00:02:03.069> uses<00:02:03.340> an<00:02:03.459> awful<00:02:03.729> lot<00:02:03.819> more<00:02:03.999> space<00:02:04.329> so

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
that uses an awful lot more space so

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.100 
that uses an awful lot more space so
that's<00:02:06.549> why<00:02:06.759> people<00:02:06.789> use<00:02:07.149> the<00:02:07.569> repeats<00:02:07.899> on

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
that's why people use the repeats on

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.690 
that's why people use the repeats on
because<00:02:08.289> you<00:02:08.380> might<00:02:08.530> be<00:02:08.649> repeating<00:02:09.039> 20<00:02:09.459> bars

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
because you might be repeating 20 bars

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.060 
because you might be repeating 20 bars
so<00:02:10.060> you<00:02:10.119> have<00:02:10.330> to<00:02:10.479> write<00:02:10.660> out<00:02:10.690> an<00:02:11.620> awful<00:02:11.920> lot<00:02:12.040> of

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
so you have to write out an awful lot of

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.800 
so you have to write out an awful lot of
space<00:02:12.220> and<00:02:12.880> the<00:02:13.090> other<00:02:13.210> thing<00:02:13.450> is<00:02:13.570> these

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
space and the other thing is these

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.840 
space and the other thing is these
repeat<00:02:14.170> marks<00:02:14.500> can<00:02:14.740> occur<00:02:15.070> anywhere<00:02:15.490> in<00:02:15.790> a

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
repeat marks can occur anywhere in a

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:16.890 
repeat marks can occur anywhere in a
piece<00:02:16.090> of<00:02:16.120> music

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
piece of music

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.369

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
armed with a double dot that means you

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.479 
armed with a double dot that means you
go<00:02:22.390> you<00:02:23.049> you<00:02:23.260> go<00:02:23.439> back<00:02:23.470> you<00:02:23.829> repeat<00:02:24.189> the<00:02:24.310> bit

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
go you you go back you repeat the bit

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.009 
go you you go back you repeat the bit
that's<00:02:24.670> in<00:02:24.909> the<00:02:25.090> double<00:02:25.390> line<00:02:25.540> in<00:02:25.810> between

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
that's in the double line in between

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.229 
that's in the double line in between
here<00:02:26.409> the<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:26.709> minor<00:02:27.040> and<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.489> D<00:02:27.700> chord<00:02:28.030> so

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
here the a minor and the D chord so

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.610 
here the a minor and the D chord so
that's<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.540> bit<00:02:28.659> you<00:02:28.780> repeat<00:02:29.079> where<00:02:29.349> the<00:02:29.439> two

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
that's the bit you repeat where the two

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.380 
that's the bit you repeat where the two
dots<00:02:29.829> are<00:02:29.980> facing<00:02:30.280> inwards<00:02:30.519> in<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:31.120> first

dots are facing inwards in the first

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.170 
dots are facing inwards in the first
example<00:02:31.810> you<00:02:32.709> don't<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.640> reason<00:02:33.879> there's<00:02:34.030> no

before<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.549> G<00:02:36.790> is<00:02:37.000> because<00:02:37.390> that<00:02:37.629> means<00:02:37.780> you

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
before the G is because that means you

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.179 
before the G is because that means you
go<00:02:38.049> back<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.349> the<00:02:38.439> beginning<00:02:38.799> if<00:02:38.890> there's<00:02:39.069> no
