00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
down a technical defect pattern because

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.630 
down a technical defect pattern because
I<00:00:58.320> tell<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.530> placed<00:00:58.800> easy<00:00:59.039> now<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.460> we<00:00:59.550> have

to block down it says that in Chad so
I've<00:01:02.609> even<00:01:02.879> we<00:01:03.030> created<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.750> little<00:01:04.260> thing<00:01:05.040> I

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
I've even we created that little thing I

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.980 
I've even we created that little thing I
think<00:01:05.489> it's<00:01:05.580> pretty<00:01:05.790> cool<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.240> then<00:01:06.720> once<00:01:06.900> you

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
think it's pretty cool and then once you

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.030 
think it's pretty cool and then once you
activate<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:08.189> says<00:01:08.460> octave<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.409> yeah<00:01:10.409> it's

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
activate it it says octave and yeah it's

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.060 
activate it it says octave and yeah it's
exactly<00:01:11.520> like<00:01:11.640> how<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:13.530> game<00:01:13.770> of

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
exactly like how it is on the game of

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.070 
exactly like how it is on the game of
course<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.000> aqua<00:01:15.390> divots<00:01:15.659> attacks<00:01:15.930> on

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
course the aqua divots attacks on

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.960 
course the aqua divots attacks on
pigment<00:01:16.530> they<00:01:17.990> don't<00:01:18.990> have<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.470> head<00:01:19.970> layer

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
pigment they don't have the head layer

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.480 
pigment they don't have the head layer
on<00:01:21.360> them<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.229> also<00:01:22.380> they<00:01:22.650> attack<00:01:22.920> users<00:01:23.340> I

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
on them and also they attack users I

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.539 
on them and also they attack users I
spawn<00:01:23.960> and<00:01:24.960> also<00:01:25.439> little<00:01:25.680> babies<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:26.430> one

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
spawn and also little babies so this one

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.109 
spawn and also little babies so this one
right<00:01:26.670> there<00:01:27.140> but<00:01:28.140> yeah<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.710> try<00:01:29.549> we<00:01:29.700> playing<00:01:29.939> it

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
right there but yeah I try we playing it

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.149 
right there but yeah I try we playing it
as<00:01:30.270> good<00:01:30.509> as<00:01:30.570> possible<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.740> think<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:32.100> will

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
as good as possible and I think it will

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.219 
as good as possible and I think it will
talk<00:01:32.340> pretty<00:01:32.549> well<00:01:35.150> and<00:01:36.150> even<00:01:36.360> spawns<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.900> side

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
talk pretty well and even spawns a side

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.190 
talk pretty well and even spawns a side
thing<00:01:37.950> what's<00:01:38.280> actually<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:38.790> does<00:01:39.000> do<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.540> the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
thing what's actually it does do in the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.999 
thing what's actually it does do in the
in<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:41.159> View<00:01:41.369> button<00:01:41.689> so<00:01:42.689> yeah<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:43.380> pretty

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
in the View button so yeah it's pretty

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.210 
in the View button so yeah it's pretty
cool<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.990> let<00:01:45.990> me<00:01:46.110> show<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.409> how<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:46.979> thing

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
cool and let me show you how this thing

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.730 
cool and let me show you how this thing
works

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.399 

that<00:01:52.740> is<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.100> satisfying<00:01:53.810> so<00:01:54.810> study<00:01:55.110> right

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
that is so satisfying so study right

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.980 
that is so satisfying so study right
here<00:01:55.740> we<00:01:56.250> have<00:01:56.280> one<00:01:56.729> these<00:01:56.880> very<00:01:57.180> very<00:01:57.659> fast

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
here we have one these very very fast

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.670 
here we have one these very very fast
clocks

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
clocks

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.749 
clocks
it<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:59.490> just<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.659> redstone<00:02:01.049> clock<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.610> is

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
it is just a redstone clock and it is

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.810 
it is just a redstone clock and it is
looking<00:02:03.090> for<00:02:03.420> if<00:02:03.750> this<00:02:04.590> area<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:05.070> blocks<00:02:05.460> is

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
looking for if this area of blocks is

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.800 
looking for if this area of blocks is
the<00:02:06.570> same<00:02:07.039> look<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.190> same<00:02:08.399> as<00:02:08.700> how<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.509> over

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
the same look the same as how it is over

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.140 
the same look the same as how it is over
here<00:02:10.080> so<00:02:10.860> basically<00:02:10.979> it's<00:02:11.580> a<00:02:11.640> setting<00:02:11.910> for

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
here so basically it's a setting for

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.640 
here so basically it's a setting for
that<00:02:12.390> when<00:02:13.050> I

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
that when I

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.580 
that when I
oh that<00:02:14.159> here<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.329> that's<00:02:15.510> how<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:16.439> know

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
oh that here and that's how you know

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.580 
oh that here and that's how you know
that<00:02:17.069> happened<00:02:17.659> and<00:02:18.659> if<00:02:18.959> it<00:02:19.049> successfully

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
that happened and if it successfully

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.720 
that happened and if it successfully
does<00:02:19.799> check<00:02:20.519> that<00:02:20.790> then<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:22.049> goes<00:02:22.260> into<00:02:22.730> this

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
does check that then it goes into this

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.220 
does check that then it goes into this
whetstone<00:02:24.329> and<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:25.110> locks<00:02:25.620> this<00:02:26.430> what's<00:02:27.230> its

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
whetstone and it locks this what's its

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.559 
whetstone and it locks this what's its
toxic<00:02:28.650> saying<00:02:29.159> not<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.760> correct<00:02:29.970> pattern<00:02:30.209> in

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
toxic saying not the correct pattern in

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.319 
toxic saying not the correct pattern in
chat<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:32.250> actually<00:02:32.400> have<00:02:32.790> nothing<00:02:32.939> right

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
chat and I actually have nothing right

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.349 
chat and I actually have nothing right
here<00:02:33.629> that's<00:02:34.200> detecting<00:02:34.769> for<00:02:35.040> this<00:02:35.909> block

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:36.359 
here that's detecting for this block

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:38.839 
here that's detecting for this block
right<00:02:36.390> here<00:02:36.599> just<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.409> diamond<00:02:37.829> block<00:02:38.099> you

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
right here just the diamond block you

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.970 
right here just the diamond block you
see<00:02:38.879> it's<00:02:39.209> right<00:02:39.390> there<00:02:39.659> and<00:02:40.349> if<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.590> does<00:02:40.739> and

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
see it's right there and if it does and

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.069 
see it's right there and if it does and
that's<00:02:41.040> what<00:02:41.250> activates<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:42.329> not<00:02:42.480> my<00:02:42.629> parent

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
that's what activates the not my parent

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.220 
that's what activates the not my parent
thing<00:02:43.230> when<00:02:43.379> I<00:02:43.409> design<00:02:43.739> block<00:02:44.040> down<00:02:44.310> and

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
thing when I design block down and

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.899 
thing when I design block down and
trying<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.440> look<00:02:46.530> like<00:02:46.680> just<00:02:47.040> like<00:02:47.430> how<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:47.790> is

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909 
trying to look like just like how it is

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:53.509 
trying to look like just like how it is
in<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.239> game<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:50.480> also<00:02:51.480> we<00:02:52.260> also<00:02:52.440> have<00:02:52.799> these

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
in the game and also we also have these

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:57.830 
in the game and also we also have these
being<00:02:53.849> activated<00:02:54.269> as<00:02:54.599> well<00:02:55.340> so<00:02:56.340> if<00:02:56.730> assess<00:02:57.599> we

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
being activated as well so if assess we

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.759 
being activated as well so if assess we
do<00:02:58.079> build<00:02:58.769> that<00:02:59.180> then<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.540> down<00:03:01.200> activates

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
do build that then it down activates

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.879 
do build that then it down activates
this<00:03:02.069> and<00:03:02.370> this<00:03:03.030> just<00:03:03.359> active<00:03:03.720> and<00:03:03.930> this<00:03:04.560> what

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
this and this just active and this what

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.220 
this and this just active and this what
that's<00:03:05.099> does<00:03:05.310> it's<00:03:05.519> clones<00:03:05.819> it<00:03:06.180> just<00:03:06.810> clones

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
that's does it's clones it just clones

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.129 
that's does it's clones it just clones
that<00:03:08.209> room<00:03:09.209> right<00:03:09.239> there

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
that room right there

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.140 
that room right there
which<00:03:10.889> in<00:03:11.280> if<00:03:11.609> you<00:03:11.700> look<00:03:11.819> like<00:03:11.939> the<00:03:12.030> outside

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
which in if you look like the outside

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.460 
which in if you look like the outside
right<00:03:12.480> it<00:03:12.569> looks<00:03:12.780> like<00:03:12.900> nothing<00:03:13.109> but<00:03:13.260> like

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
right it looks like nothing but like

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.550 
right it looks like nothing but like
another<00:03:13.680> reactor<00:03:14.159> but<00:03:15.000> going<00:03:15.180> inside<00:03:15.540> it<00:03:15.870> is

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
another reactor but going inside it is

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.479 
another reactor but going inside it is
the<00:03:17.430> room<00:03:17.699> you<00:03:18.090> walk<00:03:18.780> in<00:03:19.169> and<00:03:19.919> those<00:03:20.220> if<00:03:20.400> you

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
the room you walk in and those if you

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.030 
the room you walk in and those if you
move<00:03:20.639> here's<00:03:20.849> two<00:03:21.000> ways<00:03:21.180> that<00:03:21.959> clones<00:03:22.650> some

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
move here's two ways that clones some

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.150 
move here's two ways that clones some
more<00:03:23.220> areas<00:03:23.849> versus<00:03:24.540> clones<00:03:24.810> in<00:03:25.109> this<00:03:25.769> area

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
more areas versus clones in this area

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.460 
more areas versus clones in this area
and<00:03:26.370> our<00:03:26.549> area<00:03:26.879> into<00:03:27.599> the<00:03:27.720> middle<00:03:28.049> cuz<00:03:28.260> those

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
and our area into the middle cuz those

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.099 
and our area into the middle cuz those
chains<00:03:28.829> actually<00:03:29.069> all<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.180> time<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.959> new

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
chains actually all the time the new

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:33.619 
chains actually all the time the new
glowstone<00:03:31.650> up<00:03:31.949> there<00:03:32.280> but<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.940> but<00:03:33.419> these

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
glowstone up there but the but these

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.689 
glowstone up there but the but these
blocks<00:03:33.959> do<00:03:34.199> glow<00:03:34.500> so<00:03:34.769> I<00:03:34.829> make<00:03:35.129> like<00:03:35.310> it<00:03:35.489> glows

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:35.699 
blocks do glow so I make like it glows

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:38.210 
blocks do glow so I make like it glows
by<00:03:36.329> putting<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:37.470> go<00:03:37.650> something<00:03:37.949> like<00:03:38.040> there

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
by putting and go something like there

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.129 
by putting and go something like there
and<00:03:38.549> then<00:03:39.060> walk<00:03:39.180> out<00:03:39.299> pretty<00:03:39.629> well<00:03:39.690> I<00:03:40.019> think

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
and then walk out pretty well I think

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.129 
and then walk out pretty well I think
the<00:03:41.010> rest<00:03:41.250> of<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.609> command<00:03:42.599> blocks<00:03:42.900> basically

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
the rest of the command blocks basically

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.969 
the rest of the command blocks basically
most<00:03:43.979> of<00:03:44.190> them<00:03:44.370> does<00:03:44.879> Amin<00:03:45.299> sorry<00:03:45.840> pigment<00:03:46.319> now

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:46.979 
most of them does Amin sorry pigment now

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:51.770 
most of them does Amin sorry pigment now
I<00:03:47.340> tried<00:03:48.180> really<00:03:48.780> hard<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:49.519> make<00:03:50.519> them<00:03:50.819> so<00:03:51.419> they

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
I tried really hard to make them so they

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.770 
I tried really hard to make them so they
spawn<00:03:52.139> don't<00:03:53.069> melee<00:03:53.400> angry<00:03:53.819> and<00:03:54.060> this<00:03:54.540> way<00:03:54.720> you

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
spawn don't melee angry and this way you

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.110 
spawn don't melee angry and this way you
can<00:03:54.840> do<00:03:55.049> that<00:03:55.199> I<00:03:55.500> did<00:03:55.949> a<00:03:56.010> ton<00:03:56.220> of<00:03:56.280> research<00:03:56.400> and

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
can do that I did a ton of research and

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.969 
can do that I did a ton of research and
there<00:03:57.329> seems<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.569> be<00:03:57.629> no<00:03:57.810> way<00:03:57.930> to<00:03:57.959> work<00:03:58.319> I<00:03:58.590> mean

00:03:58.969 --> 00:03:58.979 
there seems to be no way to work I mean

00:03:58.979 --> 00:04:03.050 
there seems to be no way to work I mean
I<00:03:59.280> deemed<00:03:59.609> it<00:03:59.760> like<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.500> the<00:04:01.639> anger<00:04:02.639> attack

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
I deemed it like the the anger attack

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.789 
I deemed it like the the anger attack
but<00:04:03.780> that<00:04:03.959> never<00:04:04.199> worked

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
but that never worked

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.099 
but that never worked
I<00:04:04.919> don't<00:04:05.459> know<00:04:05.549> I<00:04:05.579> spoke<00:04:06.030> frankly<00:04:06.329> it<00:04:07.049> just

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
I don't know I spoke frankly it just

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:08.750 
I don't know I spoke frankly it just
didn't<00:04:07.530> work<00:04:07.560> for<00:04:07.709> me<00:04:07.979> so<00:04:08.099> I<00:04:08.159> just<00:04:08.310> can't<00:04:08.579> give

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
didn't work for me so I just can't give

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.640 
didn't work for me so I just can't give
up<00:04:08.849> on<00:04:09.030> that<00:04:09.470> yeah

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
up on that yeah

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.530 
up on that yeah
and<00:04:10.739> then<00:04:11.159> it<00:04:11.310> kind<00:04:11.459> of<00:04:11.609> ends<00:04:11.849> here<00:04:12.239> fall<00:04:12.419> the

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
and then it kind of ends here fall the

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.509 
and then it kind of ends here fall the
pigments<00:04:12.959> spawning<00:04:13.199> and<00:04:13.560> then<00:04:14.280> it<00:04:14.400> just

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
pigments spawning and then it just

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.710 
pigments spawning and then it just
clones<00:04:14.819> in<00:04:15.090> this<00:04:15.780> and<00:04:16.370> this<00:04:17.370> these<00:04:18.329> are<00:04:18.539> is

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
clones in this and this these are is

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.830 
clones in this and this these are is
this<00:04:19.169> is<00:04:19.320> is<00:04:19.699> it<00:04:20.699> just<00:04:20.760> clones<00:04:21.120> in<00:04:21.299> that<00:04:21.539> to

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
this is is it just clones in that to

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.659 
this is is it just clones in that to
there<00:04:22.019> and<00:04:22.349> you<00:04:22.800> tell<00:04:23.010> few<00:04:23.190> command<00:04:23.490> box

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
there and you tell few command box

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.820 
there and you tell few command box
because<00:04:23.849> this<00:04:23.969> area<00:04:24.270> cell<00:04:24.539> big<00:04:24.779> other<00:04:25.620> needs

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
because this area cell big other needs

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.450 
because this area cell big other needs
to<00:04:26.159> be<00:04:26.729> cloned<00:04:27.029> by

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
to be cloned by

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.550 
to be cloned by
half<00:04:27.699> and<00:04:28.000> on<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:28.449> other<00:04:28.600> half<00:04:28.870> because<00:04:29.470> you

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
half and on the other half because you

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.219 
half and on the other half because you
try<00:04:29.919> calling<00:04:30.160> all<00:04:30.460> in<00:04:30.669> it's<00:04:31.060> going<00:04:31.270> to<00:04:31.360> say<00:04:31.600> you

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
try calling all in it's going to say you

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.920 
try calling all in it's going to say you
can't<00:04:32.470> clone<00:04:32.770> like<00:04:33.100> too<00:04:34.030> many<00:04:34.120> blocks<00:04:34.509> in<00:04:34.810> at

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
can't clone like too many blocks in at

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.320 
can't clone like too many blocks in at
once<00:04:35.520> probably<00:04:36.520> because<00:04:36.699> of<00:04:36.729> lagging<00:04:37.030> these

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
once probably because of lagging these

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.200 
once probably because of lagging these
this<00:04:37.539> is<00:04:37.690> actually<00:04:38.050> really<00:04:38.710> nice<00:04:38.949> it<00:04:39.699> is<00:04:39.940> very

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
this is actually really nice it is very

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.230 
this is actually really nice it is very
cool<00:04:40.539> but<00:04:41.289> as<00:04:41.590> a<00:04:41.650> spell<00:04:42.039> of<00:04:42.069> tensile<00:04:42.669> but

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
cool but as a spell of tensile but

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.110 
cool but as a spell of tensile but
sometimes<00:04:43.539> it's<00:04:43.660> forgot<00:04:43.960> how<00:04:44.889> the<00:04:44.949> items<00:04:45.789> walk

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
sometimes it's forgot how the items walk

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.610 
sometimes it's forgot how the items walk
and<00:04:46.539> then<00:04:46.930> you're<00:04:47.050> probably<00:04:47.139> wondering<00:04:47.530> about

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
and then you're probably wondering about

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.240 
and then you're probably wondering about
that<00:04:48.090> well<00:04:49.090> when<00:04:49.840> this<00:04:50.020> thing<00:04:50.259> spawns<00:04:50.650> a<00:04:50.889> toxic

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
that well when this thing spawns a toxic

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.469 
that well when this thing spawns a toxic
automatically<00:04:51.729> does<00:04:51.910> that<00:04:51.940> I<00:04:52.270> don't<00:04:52.419> even

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 
automatically does that I don't even

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:54.689 
automatically does that I don't even
need<00:04:52.630> any<00:04:52.780> common<00:04:53.169> box<00:04:53.319> to<00:04:53.440> do<00:04:53.560> that<00:04:53.740> because<00:04:54.490> I

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:54.699 
need any common box to do that because I

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:58.800 
need any common box to do that because I
just<00:04:54.729> have<00:04:55.060> basic<00:04:55.840> redstone<00:04:56.500> right<00:04:56.770> here<00:04:57.810> and

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
just have basic redstone right here and

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.469 
just have basic redstone right here and
it<00:04:59.440> is<00:04:59.590> very<00:04:59.620> dark<00:05:00.250> right<00:05:00.490> here<00:05:00.729> okay<00:05:01.030> let's

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
it is very dark right here okay let's

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:06.680 
it is very dark right here okay let's
get<00:05:01.630> a<00:05:01.889> night<00:05:02.889> vision<00:05:03.160> potion<00:05:03.250> real<00:05:03.610> quick

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.010 

silicon<00:05:07.690> rx<00:05:08.139> T<00:05:08.259> what's<00:05:08.410> going<00:05:08.590> on<00:05:08.710> here<00:05:09.039> okay

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
silicon rx T what's going on here okay

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.020 
silicon rx T what's going on here okay
also<00:05:11.020> is<00:05:11.770> one<00:05:11.919> thing<00:05:12.250> that<00:05:12.400> I<00:05:12.460> missed<00:05:12.729> in<00:05:12.970> that

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
also is one thing that I missed in that

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.150 
also is one thing that I missed in that
a<00:05:13.270> line<00:05:13.660> of<00:05:13.870> command<00:05:14.349> blocks<00:05:14.650> there's<00:05:15.070> one

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
a line of command blocks there's one

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.520 
a line of command blocks there's one
command<00:05:15.430> block<00:05:15.460> that<00:05:15.669> summons<00:05:16.090> a<00:05:16.530> whetstone

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
command block that summons a whetstone

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.290 
command block that summons a whetstone
block<00:05:17.979> and<00:05:18.280> then<00:05:18.370> someone<00:05:18.639> from<00:05:18.669> the<00:05:18.820> L<00:05:18.970> block

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
block and then someone from the L block

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.249 
block and then someone from the L block
and<00:05:19.930> what<00:05:20.169> that<00:05:20.320> does<00:05:20.650> is<00:05:21.070> much<00:05:21.820> so<00:05:22.090> where<00:05:22.330> but

00:05:23.249 --> 00:05:23.259 
and what that does is much so where but

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:26.309 
and what that does is much so where but
somewhere<00:05:23.800> in<00:05:23.919> here<00:05:24.310> it<00:05:24.789> summons<00:05:25.630> a<00:05:25.840> whetstone

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:26.319 
somewhere in here it summons a whetstone

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:28.890 
somewhere in here it summons a whetstone
block<00:05:26.919> and<00:05:27.370> I<00:05:27.789> mean<00:05:28.150> we<00:05:28.210> take<00:05:28.360> it<00:05:28.449> away<00:05:28.539> that's

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
block and I mean we take it away that's

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.510 
block and I mean we take it away that's
what<00:05:29.050> it<00:05:29.139> does<00:05:29.349> and<00:05:29.650> I<00:05:29.680> tell<00:05:30.220> them<00:05:30.280> to<00:05:30.400> write

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
what it does and I tell them to write

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.659 
what it does and I tell them to write
here<00:05:30.759> IQ<00:05:31.060> acting<00:05:31.360> all<00:05:31.479> the<00:05:31.599> sweats<00:05:31.840> down<00:05:32.110> and

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
here IQ acting all the sweats down and

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.520 
here IQ acting all the sweats down and
this<00:05:33.669> is<00:05:33.820> just<00:05:34.030> a<00:05:34.240> regular<00:05:34.720> clock<00:05:35.080> it<00:05:35.380> just

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
this is just a regular clock it just

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.070 
this is just a regular clock it just
goes<00:05:35.650> round<00:05:35.860> in<00:05:36.070> circles<00:05:36.340> I<00:05:36.909> giving<00:05:37.840> all<00:05:37.990> these

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
goes round in circles I giving all these

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.670 
goes round in circles I giving all these
chakras<00:05:38.349> and<00:05:39.690> yeah<00:05:40.690> that's<00:05:41.110> basically<00:05:41.169> all<00:05:41.530> it

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 
chakras and yeah that's basically all it

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.860 
chakras and yeah that's basically all it
does<00:05:41.919> and<00:05:42.190> since<00:05:42.729> drop<00:05:43.000> was<00:05:43.150> all<00:05:43.360> random

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
does and since drop was all random

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.100 
does and since drop was all random
that's<00:05:44.349> how<00:05:44.590> the<00:05:44.650> item<00:05:45.159> is<00:05:45.310> all<00:05:45.490> random<00:05:46.110> that's

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
that's how the item is all random that's

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.680 
that's how the item is all random that's
going<00:05:47.349> to<00:05:47.409> fit<00:05:47.620> like<00:05:47.800> a<00:05:47.919> video<00:05:48.240> before<00:05:49.240> I<00:05:49.449> go<00:05:49.659> I

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 
going to fit like a video before I go I

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.469 
going to fit like a video before I go I
just<00:05:49.719> want<00:05:49.990> to<00:05:50.080> say<00:05:50.259> I'm<00:05:50.500> sorry<00:05:50.849> for<00:05:51.849> the<00:05:52.180> long
