ideas<00:00:55.449> here's<00:00:56.449> my<00:00:56.540> tip<00:00:56.900> for<00:00:56.930> coaches<00:00:57.530> I<00:00:57.769> think

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
ideas here's my tip for coaches I think

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.280 
ideas here's my tip for coaches I think
in<00:00:58.460> coaching<00:00:58.879> there's<00:00:59.120> two<00:00:59.780> things<00:01:00.019> that<00:01:00.170> are

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
in coaching there's two things that are

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.350 
in coaching there's two things that are
important<00:01:00.800> what<00:01:01.220> you<00:01:01.250> coach<00:01:01.850> and<00:01:02.120> how<00:01:02.300> he

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
important what you coach and how he

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.280 
important what you coach and how he
coach<00:01:02.659> it<00:01:02.870> and<00:01:03.640> for<00:01:04.640> us<00:01:04.760> what<00:01:05.210> is<00:01:05.449> the<00:01:05.510> curva

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
coach it and for us what is the curva

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.770 
coach it and for us what is the curva
coaching<00:01:06.710> program<00:01:07.220> with<00:01:08.120> all<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.360> drills<00:01:08.570> and

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
coaching program with all the drills and

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.690 
coaching program with all the drills and
games<00:01:08.960> and<00:01:09.290> they're<00:01:09.770> made<00:01:09.920> to<00:01:09.950> be<00:01:10.100> fun<00:01:10.370> but<00:01:10.580> of

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
games and they're made to be fun but of

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.550 
games and they're made to be fun but of
course<00:01:10.909> they're<00:01:11.120> meant<00:01:11.630> to<00:01:11.720> improve<00:01:12.170> players

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
course they're meant to improve players

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.010 
course they're meant to improve players
and<00:01:12.799> I<00:01:12.830> think<00:01:12.860> that's<00:01:13.130> what<00:01:13.250> all<00:01:13.370> coaches<00:01:13.760> do

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
and I think that's what all coaches do

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.200 
and I think that's what all coaches do
the<00:01:15.020> second<00:01:15.380> part<00:01:15.409> is<00:01:15.830> how<00:01:16.280> you<00:01:16.340> coach<00:01:16.729> you

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
the second part is how you coach you

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.500 
the second part is how you coach you
know<00:01:17.330> what<00:01:17.600> you<00:01:17.750> say<00:01:17.960> but<00:01:18.950> um<00:01:19.190> here<00:01:19.700> is<00:01:20.030> one<00:01:20.210> tip

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
know what you say but um here is one tip

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.480 
know what you say but um here is one tip
it's<00:01:20.780> not<00:01:20.900> only<00:01:21.020> what<00:01:21.140> you<00:01:21.440> say<00:01:21.680> but<00:01:22.010> when<00:01:22.310> and

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
it's not only what you say but when and

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.180 
it's not only what you say but when and
where<00:01:22.640> you<00:01:22.790> say<00:01:23.030> it<00:01:23.380> in<00:01:24.380> my<00:01:24.530> personal<00:01:24.950> opinion

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
where you say it in my personal opinion

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.150 
where you say it in my personal opinion
a<00:01:25.460> lot<00:01:25.610> of<00:01:25.700> coaches<00:01:26.120> maybe<00:01:26.720> speak<00:01:27.440> a<00:01:27.680> little

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
a lot of coaches maybe speak a little

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.060 
a lot of coaches maybe speak a little
too<00:01:28.400> long<00:01:28.610> and<00:01:28.850> may<00:01:29.390> be<00:01:29.420> in<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.690> wrong<00:01:29.810> place

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
too long and may be in the wrong place

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.140 
too long and may be in the wrong place
so<00:01:31.070> you<00:01:31.130> remember<00:01:31.520> we're<00:01:31.640> dealing<00:01:31.760> with<00:01:31.940> young

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
so you remember we're dealing with young

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.120 
so you remember we're dealing with young
players<00:01:32.510> their<00:01:33.020> attention<00:01:33.470> needs<00:01:33.950> to<00:01:34.070> be

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
players their attention needs to be

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.470 
players their attention needs to be
focused<00:01:34.400> on<00:01:34.760> what<00:01:34.910> they're<00:01:35.060> doing<00:01:35.330> because

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480 
focused on what they're doing because

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.000 
focused on what they're doing because
it's<00:01:35.930> what<00:01:36.350> they're<00:01:36.500> doing<00:01:36.800> that<00:01:36.920> will

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
it's what they're doing that will

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.590 
it's what they're doing that will
improve<00:01:37.280> them<00:01:37.490> if<00:01:37.700> you<00:01:37.820> interfere<00:01:38.120> if<00:01:38.480> you

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
improve them if you interfere if you

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.390 
improve them if you interfere if you
stop<00:01:38.870> them<00:01:39.050> too<00:01:39.230> much<00:01:39.410> then<00:01:39.710> you<00:01:39.920> break<00:01:40.190> that

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
stop them too much then you break that

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.580 
stop them too much then you break that
repetition<00:01:40.640> and<00:01:41.420> I<00:01:41.810> don't<00:01:42.110> think<00:01:42.410> that's

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
repetition and I don't think that's

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.100 
repetition and I don't think that's
helpful<00:01:42.980> to<00:01:43.520> them<00:01:43.640> learning<00:01:43.910> the<00:01:44.540> particular

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
helpful to them learning the particular

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.340 
helpful to them learning the particular

build all other parts of the gamer for
example<00:02:12.560> if<00:02:12.709> you<00:02:13.190> have<00:02:13.400> this<00:02:13.519> technical

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
example if you have this technical

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.899 
example if you have this technical
foundation<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:14.629> can<00:02:14.810> build<00:02:15.670> tactical<00:02:16.670> on<00:02:16.730> it

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:16.909 
foundation you can build tactical on it

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:19.690 
foundation you can build tactical on it
you<00:02:17.690> can<00:02:17.810> improve<00:02:18.140> plays<00:02:18.319> physically<00:02:18.920> you<00:02:19.550> can

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
you can improve plays physically you can

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.869 
you can improve plays physically you can
improve<00:02:20.060> players<00:02:20.360> mentally<00:02:20.930> if<00:02:21.080> you<00:02:22.040> have<00:02:22.430> the

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
improve players mentally if you have the

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.869 
improve players mentally if you have the
foundation<00:02:23.840> of<00:02:23.989> technique<00:02:24.739> then<00:02:25.519> all<00:02:25.849> other

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
foundation of technique then all other

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.460 
foundation of technique then all other
parts<00:02:26.300> of<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.510> game<00:02:26.659> can<00:02:26.870> be<00:02:26.900> built<00:02:27.170> on<00:02:27.290> them

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
parts of the game can be built on them

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.740 
parts of the game can be built on them
and<00:02:27.560> that's<00:02:28.280> what<00:02:28.459> we<00:02:28.580> try<00:02:28.819> to<00:02:28.849> do<00:02:29.180> in<00:02:29.390> all<00:02:29.629> the

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
and that's what we try to do in all the

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.429 
and that's what we try to do in all the
curva<00:02:29.989> coaching<00:02:30.409> programs<00:02:30.859> not<00:02:31.489> only<00:02:31.549> the<00:02:31.849> USA

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:32.439 
curva coaching programs not only the USA

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:34.670 
curva coaching programs not only the USA
because<00:02:33.439> we're<00:02:33.620> in<00:02:33.769> 17<00:02:34.159> different

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
because we're in 17 different

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.490 
because we're in 17 different
trees<00:02:34.859> now<00:02:35.040> but<00:02:35.579> all<00:02:35.700> over<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:36.000> world<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.500> our

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
trees now but all over the world and our

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.309 
trees now but all over the world and our
focus<00:02:38.069> is<00:02:38.370> on<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:39.299> individual<00:02:39.870> player<00:02:40.079> I

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
focus is on the individual player I

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.990 
focus is on the individual player I
think<00:02:40.530> that's<00:02:40.650> what<00:02:40.829> makes<00:02:41.040> maybe<00:02:41.459> cover

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
think that's what makes maybe cover

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.860 
think that's what makes maybe cover
coaching<00:02:42.840> different<00:02:43.200> from<00:02:43.469> other<00:02:43.680> programs

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
coaching different from other programs

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.720 
coaching different from other programs
maybe<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:45.959> lot<00:02:46.200> of<00:02:46.290> other<00:02:46.439> programs<00:02:46.680> focused<00:02:47.670> on

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
maybe a lot of other programs focused on

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.110 
maybe a lot of other programs focused on
the<00:02:47.819> so-called<00:02:47.969> team<00:02:48.420> game<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:49.049> I<00:02:50.000> think<00:02:51.000> our

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
the so-called team game and I think our

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.000 
the so-called team game and I think our
focus<00:02:51.329> is<00:02:51.540> not<00:02:52.109> so<00:02:52.230> much<00:02:52.290> on<00:02:52.469> the<00:02:52.560> team<00:02:52.769> game

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
focus is not so much on the team game

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.330 
focus is not so much on the team game
but<00:02:53.250> on<00:02:53.400> individual<00:02:54.060> development<00:02:55.010> and<00:02:56.010> we

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
but on individual development and we

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.520 
but on individual development and we
regarded<00:02:56.819> probably<00:02:57.420> up<00:02:57.540> there<00:02:57.750> as<00:02:58.049> far<00:02:58.319> as

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
regarded probably up there as far as

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.459 
regarded probably up there as far as
individual<00:02:59.370> player<00:02:59.549> development<00:02:59.819> and<00:03:00.469> this

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:01.469 
individual player development and this

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:03.349 
individual player development and this
we<00:03:01.650> do<00:03:01.859> bye<00:03:02.189> first<00:03:02.700> of<00:03:02.790> all<00:03:02.819> training<00:03:03.150> our
