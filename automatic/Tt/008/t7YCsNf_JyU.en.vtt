glide<00:00:28.859> which<00:00:29.130> was<00:00:29.310> pretty<00:00:29.550> disappointing<00:00:30.210> but

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
glide which was pretty disappointing but

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.359 
glide which was pretty disappointing but
not<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.170> big<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.439> deal<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.800> decided<00:00:32.099> gonna

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
not that big of a deal I decided gonna

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.880

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
a leaf storm now considering the fact

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.210 
a leaf storm now considering the fact
that<00:02:49.690> he<00:02:49.930> could<00:02:50.170> have<00:02:50.200> gone<00:02:50.440> in<00:02:50.500> a<00:02:50.709> duck<00:02:50.920> trio

00:02:53.009 --> 00:02:53.019 
that's why I went for leaf storm but I

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.390 
that's why I went for leaf storm but I
really<00:02:53.470> should<00:02:53.500> have<00:02:53.739> gone<00:02:53.860> from<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.160> bolts

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400

really should have gone from the bolts
which<00:02:54.579> there<00:02:54.849> because<00:02:55.510> why<00:02:55.870> would<00:02:56.079> you<00:02:56.170> just

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
which there because why would you just

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.490 
which there because why would you just
let<00:02:56.530> your<00:02:57.480> your<00:02:58.480> dugtrio<00:02:58.959> die<00:02:59.170> right<00:02:59.349> there

let your your dugtrio die right there

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.809 
let your your dugtrio die right there
why<00:02:59.680> would<00:02:59.860> you<00:02:59.950> risk<00:03:00.099> that<00:03:00.340> so<00:03:00.519> I<00:03:00.549> should<00:03:00.730> have
