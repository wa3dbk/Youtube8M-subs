00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.830
 So my team does not call for something 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.710
 to a layer 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.110
 four hours shift since 14 o'clock have 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:24.849
 We confessed to work the world here 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:27.279
 controls negative events 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.930
 someone who ran through because he was 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.110

 so what namely one coaster ride 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.840

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.390
 here also without ribbon there are 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:48.370
 By contrast it can already be over 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:51.670
 gadgets no no would be sad if 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.409
 one that should be okay so far we 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.500
 We are not paying anything for it 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:58.600
 volunteer here but I am 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:03.190
 previously been 13 years ago 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.449
 and I've paid for it and I'll say it like that 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.740
 that's how it's calculated 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.299
 many bands play here and what you do 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.970

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:13.240
 then single concert actually 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.799
 you should pay the money already 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.689
 have over and you have yourself 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.400
 in between, eight layers are required 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:20.500
 time to look at captain and what do you have 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:27.409
