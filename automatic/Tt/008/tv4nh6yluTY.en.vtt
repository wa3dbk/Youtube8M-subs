00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
like forever 21 I guess but it's like a

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.439 
like forever 21 I guess but it's like a
little<00:00:22.380> more<00:00:22.769> fashion-forward<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:24.150> would<00:00:24.330> say

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
little more fashion-forward I would say

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.450

wearing<00:03:09.430> white<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.090> black<00:03:10.330> I<00:03:10.540> just<00:03:10.720> think<00:03:10.930> it

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
wearing white and black I just think it

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.050 
wearing white and black I just think it
looks<00:03:11.080> obviously<00:03:11.920> good<00:03:12.070> with<00:03:12.190> everything<00:03:12.760> and

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
looks obviously good with everything and

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.360 
looks obviously good with everything and
it<00:03:13.480> does<00:03:13.690> have<00:03:13.960> these<00:03:14.200> pockets<00:03:14.860> on<00:03:15.010> the<00:03:15.130> side

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
it does have these pockets on the side

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.490 
it does have these pockets on the side
which<00:03:15.670> our<00:03:15.970> fake<00:03:16.420> pockets<00:03:16.870> it<00:03:17.020> unzips<00:03:17.440> and

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
which our fake pockets it unzips and

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.020 
which our fake pockets it unzips and
everything<00:03:17.890> I<00:03:18.010> tried<00:03:18.280> to<00:03:18.370> stick<00:03:18.550> my<00:03:18.670> phone<00:03:18.880> in

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
everything I tried to stick my phone in

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.449 
everything I tried to stick my phone in
there<00:03:19.180> when<00:03:19.390> I<00:03:19.420> tried<00:03:19.720> it<00:03:19.840> on<00:03:19.959> and<00:03:20.440> it's<00:03:21.220> a<00:03:21.310> fake

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
there when I tried it on and it's a fake

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.750 
there when I tried it on and it's a fake
good<00:03:21.880> so<00:03:22.270> that's<00:03:22.989> kind<00:03:23.290> of<00:03:23.550> frustrating<00:03:24.550> but

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
good so that's kind of frustrating but

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.790 
good so that's kind of frustrating but
oh<00:03:25.030> well<00:03:25.300> it's<00:03:25.510> not<00:03:25.600> a<00:03:25.630> big<00:03:25.840> deal<00:03:26.020> and<00:03:26.290> it's

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
oh well it's not a big deal and it's

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.490 
oh well it's not a big deal and it's
just<00:03:27.280> like<00:03:27.430> really<00:03:27.610> flowy<00:03:28.300> in<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.780> front<00:03:29.200> and

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
just like really flowy in the front and

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.979 
just like really flowy in the front and
fall<00:03:30.400> is<00:03:30.550> really<00:03:30.790> pretty<00:03:31.030> so<00:03:31.390> I<00:03:31.570> thought<00:03:31.780> that

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
fall is really pretty so I thought that

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.570 
fall is really pretty so I thought that
was<00:03:32.170> a<00:03:32.200> great<00:03:32.590> thing<00:03:32.950> to<00:03:33.190> wear<00:03:33.370> with

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
was a great thing to wear with

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.199 
was a great thing to wear with
everything<00:03:34.980> next<00:03:35.980> is<00:03:36.100> this<00:03:36.280> romper<00:03:36.610> and<00:03:37.090> I

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
everything next is this romper and I

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:38.790 
everything next is this romper and I
typically<00:03:37.600> wear<00:03:37.810> a<00:03:37.840> size<00:03:38.080> small<00:03:38.440> so<00:03:38.620> that's

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
typically wear a size small so that's

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.220 
typically wear a size small so that's
what<00:03:38.950> I<00:03:38.980> got<00:03:39.190> this<00:03:39.790> definitely<00:03:40.420> is<00:03:40.870> like<00:03:41.110> an

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
what I got this definitely is like an

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.470 
what I got this definitely is like an
extra<00:03:41.500> small<00:03:41.920> I<00:03:42.190> mean<00:03:42.430> I'll<00:03:42.790> probably<00:03:42.970> wear

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
extra small I mean I'll probably wear

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.750 
extra small I mean I'll probably wear
this<00:03:43.690> but<00:03:44.020> I<00:03:44.560> don't<00:03:45.310> know<00:03:45.400> I<00:03:45.430> just<00:03:45.489> feel<00:03:45.730> like

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
this but I don't know I just feel like

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.979 
this but I don't know I just feel like
it's<00:03:45.940> a<00:03:45.970> little<00:03:46.060> bit<00:03:46.209> too<00:03:46.390> tight<00:03:46.570> and<00:03:46.750> a<00:03:46.810> little

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
it's a little bit too tight and a little

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.310 
it's a little bit too tight and a little
bit<00:03:47.080> too<00:03:47.200> short<00:03:47.470> so<00:03:47.790> hopefully<00:03:48.790> I<00:03:49.270> still<00:03:49.810> can

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
bit too short so hopefully I still can

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.340 
bit too short so hopefully I still can
wear<00:03:50.560> this<00:03:50.770> it<00:03:51.160> has<00:03:51.370> red<00:03:52.239> lace<00:03:52.540> on<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:52.989> bottom

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
wear this it has red lace on the bottom

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.199 
wear this it has red lace on the bottom
that<00:03:53.860> is<00:03:54.040> really<00:03:54.370> pretty<00:03:54.610> and<00:03:54.880> it's<00:03:55.060> like

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
that is really pretty and it's like

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.260 
that is really pretty and it's like
pretty<00:03:56.020> long<00:03:56.290> you<00:03:57.040> can<00:03:57.190> see<00:03:57.370> that<00:03:57.610> on<00:03:57.760> my<00:03:57.910> hand

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
pretty long you can see that on my hand

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.300 
pretty long you can see that on my hand
and<00:03:58.840> it<00:03:59.020> goes<00:03:59.200> all<00:03:59.410> the<00:03:59.440> way<00:03:59.560> around<00:03:59.980> and<00:04:00.220> it

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
and it goes all the way around and it

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.010 
and it goes all the way around and it
has<00:04:00.489> the<00:04:00.670> same<00:04:00.850> legs<00:04:01.150> here<00:04:01.510> on<00:04:01.660> the<00:04:01.750> front

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
it's very simple and I thought it was

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.540 
it's very simple and I thought it was
really<00:04:05.770> pretty<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:08.260> next<00:04:08.500> thing<00:04:08.709> is<00:04:08.920> this<00:04:09.220> top

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.590 
will wear it a bunch this summer and
then<00:04:35.530> I<00:04:35.590> got<00:04:35.950> this<00:04:36.310> shirt<00:04:36.820> that<00:04:37.150> I<00:04:37.180> thought<00:04:37.420> was

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
then I got this shirt that I thought was

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.600 
then I got this shirt that I thought was
just<00:04:37.720> really<00:04:37.930> cute<00:04:38.230> this<00:04:38.380> only<00:04:38.530> came<00:04:38.770> in<00:04:38.980> one

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.850 
just really cute this only came in one
size<00:04:39.910> so<00:04:40.360> I<00:04:40.600> was<00:04:40.840> kind<00:04:41.110> of<00:04:41.170> hoping<00:04:41.470> it<00:04:41.740> was

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
size so I was kind of hoping it was

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.680 
size so I was kind of hoping it was
gonna<00:04:41.980> fall<00:04:42.280> in<00:04:42.430> like<00:04:42.640> the<00:04:42.760> medium<00:04:43.150> range<00:04:43.300> but

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
gonna fall in like the medium range but

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.620 
gonna fall in like the medium range but
something's<00:04:44.470> like<00:04:44.590> a<00:04:44.620> large<00:04:45.010> um<00:04:45.580> we're<00:04:46.390> trying

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
something's like a large um we're trying
