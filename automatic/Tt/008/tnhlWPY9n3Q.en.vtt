00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.090 
guess I don't really know what to
consider<00:02:23.320> that<00:02:23.770> but<00:02:24.340> you're<00:02:24.550> really<00:02:26.100> going

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
consider that but you're really going

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.440 
consider that but you're really going
out<00:02:27.310> with<00:02:27.370> it<00:02:27.610> because<00:02:27.730> you're<00:02:27.970> not<00:02:28.090> supposed

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
out with it because you're not supposed

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.680 
out with it because you're not supposed

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
to talk about the Nazis or anything like

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.780 
to talk about the Nazis or anything like
that<00:02:31.810> on<00:02:31.990> robots<00:02:32.470> it's<00:02:32.680> right<00:02:33.190> in<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.370> tos<00:02:33.970> no

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
that on robots it's right in the tos no

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.720 
that on robots it's right in the tos no
behavior<00:02:36.790> like<00:02:36.820> that<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:38.220> yeah<00:02:39.220> so<00:02:39.550> that's

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
behavior like that and yeah so that's

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.160 
behavior like that and yeah so that's
one<00:02:40.090> of<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.270> first<00:02:40.390> reasons<00:02:40.810> that<00:02:40.900> probably

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
one of the first reasons that probably

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.100 
one of the first reasons that probably
got<00:02:41.290> him<00:02:41.380> in<00:02:41.530> second<00:02:42.490> reason<00:02:42.640> you<00:02:43.510> go<00:02:43.660> on<00:02:43.840> to

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
got him in second reason you go on to

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.870 
got him in second reason you go on to
the<00:02:44.500> front<00:02:44.740> page<00:02:44.890> you're<00:02:45.400> usually<00:02:45.520> going<00:02:45.730> to

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
the front page you're usually going to

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.120
