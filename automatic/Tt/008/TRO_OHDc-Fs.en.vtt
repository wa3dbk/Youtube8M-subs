00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:07.160
 good friends of youtube in this case 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.620
 today I bring a video about how 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:13.190
 be root or root 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:16.309
 a cell phone the original 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.599
 l 72 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.699
 in this case we are going to use an application 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:24.070
 an easy and simple application not very 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.820
 heavy 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.939
 that will do the work for us 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:34.030
 we do not need a pc to 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.100
 do it or you do not need to know about 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:40.660
 computers 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:43.980
 you do not need to take all that development 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.300
 sometimes it is difficult for many users 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.180
 in this case it is only with one application 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:53.559
 in a bar not to take a minute 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:57.070
 closed in this case what is going to do 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:59.489
 this application here I extract the 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.489
 application 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.700
 is this 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.700
 excuse me 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:22.050
 here they are way ruth manage to see in the 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:27.970
 lower left 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:34.100
 here is brown that has the logo 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:38.390
 the qr codes of that same here 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:42.110
 then here we are given two options as 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.970
 they will see aranorn spin up 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.840
 says select 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.950
 an option to run root not 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.160
 install superuser install 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.960
 superuser a rhythm in this case 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.430
 We install and comes supervisor 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.970
 defect and we leave it there that is 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.790
 necessary and the last option they see 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:05.090
 there a root that will come out in the 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:08.110
 case they are already root as in my case a 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.649
 routers basically stop being root 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.599
 remove group 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.590
 then they give the first option and 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:19.519
 such superior 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.519
 to install the super user 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:28.099
 and they give the option gandalf in my case 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.950
 It worked perfectly with the option 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.739
 slacker 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.080
 but if in your case you do not 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.840
 works with the band option they give to the 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.319
 aragorn option no problem does not happen 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:44.200
 There is no risk with this 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.910
 application is simple simple easy and 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.489
 it only takes once you get the option 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.260
 gandalf I have the option for a hundred was 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.599
 ask that the restart one more time and another 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:58.390
 more time and it's simple is not going to leave 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:00.330
 the some letters that say in English that 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:04.560
 is going to tell you what 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:09.300
 they are already ruth is ready and to restart 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.450
 they give ok and button on and restart 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.670
 do not 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.950
 they do not restart and it's going to install 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.319
 the application of 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.069
 superuser in this case is here the 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.069
 pirate here 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.920
 straight 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.190
 good in your case 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.440
 it is this 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:36.010
 this already have applications that use 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:39.680
 superuser all applications are 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.859
 beautiful perfect for 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.219
 get the most out of being the 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:47.959
 rhythm that the battery doctor has 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:50.349
 who do not believe it is important because 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.900
 it helps us keep our battery 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:57.469
 blue all day the clean master that we 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:01.090
 helped to clear clean up modify even 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:03.710
 clean system files the big says 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:08.200
 what 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:08.200
 puts us on standby 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.830
 let's say it like that 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.930
 to applications that we do not want to 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:21.560
 we consume resources 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:25.250
 it does not freeze it, it does not freeze it, it does not 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.370
 that puts us to hibernate stand-by something 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.980
 A) Yes 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:36.370
 the founders are already looking at the applications 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.370
 so that they do not consume memory resources 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:43.050
 cpu and all those things 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:45.720
 well also this 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.759
 we have the link 12 is due to move to 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.060
 applications from the internal memory to the 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:53.879
 external memory easily link the 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.830
 it is very important not only to pass it 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:59.099
 the skills have been at random the 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:02.129
 link takes the application the data the 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:04.349
 cache memory and everything else does not let 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:06.689
 nothing in the internal memory the road 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:10.619
 manager for 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:13.379
 put a hand to the rom download the 

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:15.409
 Little things that we want 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:20.739
 for the rom 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:20.739
 the letters backgrounds 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.080
 the things we want not even a 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:30.050
 rom we can download and things like 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:35.080
 she is clinics that is good to do 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.080
 videos how is the shopper 2 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:46.500
 we extended RAM memory uses memory 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:49.970
 external microsd as we assimilate the 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.970
 space that we want 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:06:00.270
 the titanium backup that is very important 

00:05:56.029 --> 00:06:02.939
 to make an android to make copies 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.919
 security backup all 

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:08.459
 applications with all the data with 

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:10.379
 everything and when we are going to install them 

00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:14.500
 application with all data lines 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:18.100
 everything leaves us intact 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.810
 Complete application to make copy of 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.979
 security 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:25.669
 and also in this application here 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:28.099
 wet and that is very beautiful what can 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:30.439
 download to your pc also exists for pc 

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:31.999
 that makes us synchronize the 

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:33.949
 cell applications with the 

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:38.090
 Low uses a computer us 

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:39.289
 full market a wit and a friend 

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:41.300
 of the trouble to be looking for 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:43.310
 applications if you did not use that application in 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.909
 the pc here I do not use it much I'm going to 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:49.099
 spend even more data on the pc even 

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:51.409
 to update while I connect it to 

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:53.350
 the pcm updates the applications is 

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:56.590
 amazing 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:59.230
 and all the games that want to put us 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:02.820
 to the light sauce 

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.820
 well that 's all 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:09.440
 give him the video if you liked opinion 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.960
 comment 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:15.090
 ask the questions you want already 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.370
 I'm going to see how you can 

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:19.420
 help them 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:22.350
 and that's it 

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.350
 until next time
