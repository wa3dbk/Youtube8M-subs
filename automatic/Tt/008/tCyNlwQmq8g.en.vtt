00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.269
 hello guys and girls here is the max 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.730
 and I have the worst this morning 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.019
 what I do not belong well not what I am 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.869
 I 've heard but what I last 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.730
 time has been quite terrible 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.380
 bad might be in my feed 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.579
 looked at youtube today 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.140
 because I have extra 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.970
 once again on youtube rausgesucht just around 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.140
 to post a comment 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.099
 this morning xavier naidoo covert boy 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.260
 from the doctors 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.610
 I have the only center for as held 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.110
 they announced that in the council he yes 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.870
 my role is kidding me 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.399
 usually always in the radio runs a lot 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.109
 shit yes that's why higher is almost the 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.010
 almost the radio but I have not wanted 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:44.390
 that's crazy now 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.390
 somehow such a self-production where it 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.940
 no, no, that's the way it is 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.980
 that xavier naidoo really has 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.559
 boy covered by the doctors and it is 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.940
 bad it is cruel is really cruel 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.920
 I do not want that so much 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.379
 rumreiten may have indeed some 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.690
 xavier naidoo fans among us but me 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.040
 it was bad so who is looking for music 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.659
 any people on the bag too 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.100
 go or which people to me 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.800
 distribute this is just right 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.659
 xavi why does that have to be 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.640
 the way was not really easy 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.689
 when I had to listen to it that was 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.909
 Bad then I prefer to hear me 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.159
 heino an heino was actually quite 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.110
 funny heino has also last 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.750
 somehow made such a new cover cd 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.159
 Where did the doctors of me say 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.140
 think of the dead pants of rammstein 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.350
 and something has covered that should also 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.659
 It's very funny, especially it's a clock 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.090
 can also roll the r as horny as 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.020
 rammstein singer 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.369
 that means it actually has quite good 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.710
 I will not fit through it 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.710
 to the big court there are however 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.619
 I could hear that much better 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.240
 as xavier naidoo the doctors cover that 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.869
 you have to be really why he's doing us so 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.030
 what 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.100
 What's that supposed to be? 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.619
 Bad things in bad things 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.390
 are the new channel design is also on 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.189
 begin 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.100
 yes there it is not around and 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.960
 there are a few things you want to ask 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.960
 because who is not on a channel 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.189
 was in the last so today, so to speak 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.360
 Now maybe go on it and 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.900
 look at that because I have 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.580
 converted to the new channel design 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:16.069
 at the latest from 5 june is the duty 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.720
 and that's why I'd rather not wait until 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.220
 youtube quasi forcedly surrounded but 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.680
 can arrange that 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.000
 I have a new banner in it 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.890
 Of course, that's a bit silly 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.150
 there is no car player there is one more 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.740
 link under the banner 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.720
 there are no links left 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.970
 it can be clicked in the banner it 's all 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.890
 a little stupid somehow of the principle 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.180
 ago I find the new channel which are 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.970
 actually really good 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.830
 So it makes sense that the 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.750
 channel looks the same 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.310
 in quotes if I'm on now 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.290
 watching the smartphone on the tablet 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.900
 or watch TV on an ultra hd 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.040
 youtube app on it is from the approach 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.560
 actually useful 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:56.540
 that's what webdesigners are all about 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.810
 long time headache makes and in 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.360
 Last time also increased now 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.010
 river found in webdesign stories 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.720
 or especially web 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.980
 Applications programmed that stop 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.640
 Try these applications too 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.360
 program 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.160
 from mobile phone to stop finally to 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.880
 watching TV I can tell you that is 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.040
 not easy 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.750
 I do not know much about 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.500
 web stories in the field I am 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.450
 not so active 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.090
 However, I know a few people who 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.120
 program ruby ​​and rails 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:29.269
 web applications in rails and they are there 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.040
 Extremely regular puke for layout 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:32.060
 for applications just stop 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.040
 everything must be presented 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.730
 however, there is no alternative 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.940
 that's how one should say these days 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.530
 so versatile represent the devices so 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.480
 You can no longer have a group of equipment 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.920
 neglect to look at it quite a lot 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.540
 People on the smartphone are watching it all 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.730
 many people on the tablet s good whole 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.989
 many people on the desktop pc that is 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.850
 not easy to say 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.950
 i would have let me all tablet and 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.900
 Smartphone user outside 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.670
 it just will not work today 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.870
 my side has the most possible 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.580
 Many people should judge and that is 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.470
 of course youtube too and if i am for 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:07.670
 my statistics are looked at 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:10.010
 meanwhile almost exactly 50 of the calls 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.440
 from smartphones that has become pretty nice 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.150
 that was two years ago 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.680
 somehow 25 percent or so that has 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.510
 already quite changed that is in the 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.350
 principle, of course, that makes sense as 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.330
 they do it now 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.640
 I do not say anything against that 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.020
 problem is just that you can do it now 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.440
 nothing more can do on his 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.640
 channel 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.080
 you can not do anything anymore 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.880
 adjust the only thing at 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.600
 can adjust is 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.580
 the avatar picture and the banner so great 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.570
 banner I have a good and good one now 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.520
 clean new banner 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.230
 Incidentally, you can now with one 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.000
 powered by elgato lettering of 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:43.150
 originally supposed to be a link 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
 but should not be a link because stop 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.200
 left in bavaria no longer work 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.550
 and then what not? 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.830
 can also make the videos clever 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.010
 sorting and everything it is very 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.770
 of course everything is standardized now 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.080
 for the users maybe not so 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.780
 bad if you can say here everyone 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.550
 channel works the same way 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.690
 serve 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.670
 So that means you 're not just from the 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.990
 year from the will of the channel 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.490
 operator depending on what I 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.050
 to think clever but one was yes 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.390
 that was not the same with the old design 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.040
 also very uniform, it would 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.660
 really synonymous almost every channel the same 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.460
 for me as the operator is a bit 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.450
 shit, for example, I can do that 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:21.490
 do not sort correctly 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.920
 For example, I want such a best 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.270
 of list show no playlist but 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.400
 such a best-of sorting 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.650
 For example, I would have to do that now 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.380
 miss a video every day 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:34.000
 and that day then somehow there 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.980
 link no idea it is totally stupid 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.730
 not in addition, above all one 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:41.140
 strange snow garden presents video as 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.940
 most popular video with me trainer far 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.590
 I have about a million calls 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.540
 Not that this video if anyone 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.400
 The video was meant for people 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.780
 the ones who know me already those 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.970
 Looked at other videos at the construction site 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.350
 have and I 'm up your end box estro 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.990
 youtube who have no idea 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.880
 What's the matter, that's why I have mine 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.890
 I think I turn off comments 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.540
 turn off the rating I have 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.940
 do not mind it as honest as such 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.870
 nonsense 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.920
 Now I am almost finished with a fabric 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.170
 Now I can you I can you 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.400
 perhaps what also such a thing 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.700
 I have to do something right first 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:15.430
 put in place in the 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.140
 Gameplay from 20 May where it is justin 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.510
 went biebers monkey I 

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.170
 falsely claims the video 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.800
 or 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:25.540
 the gameplay would be from rescue hd of that 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.160
 By the way, the video is the gameplay of 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.260
 today 

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:31.930
 this is not the player of the 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.430
 Gameplays is said to be almost gaming 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.620
 I have also afterwards as a 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.930
 Day later noticed and changed 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.610
 but yes, stupid and I can 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.910
 not change now i call already 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.950
 extra whenever I am 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:44.240
 Download guest gameplays with the 

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:46.310
 Youtube names before that but there I have 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.290
 somehow reversed by doing so 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.820
 can happen and I have one 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.020
 he has written private message 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.420
 he now want something I was 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.290
 when the video should say or him without a word 

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:57.140
 should let 

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:58.600
 and should the gaming means i should get one 

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.820
 greet all farmers 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:05.750
 yes i have done now apparently 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:07.310
 a friend of agriculture and no 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.410
 intention can happen 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:11.750
 I'm trying too poorly try too 

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.280
 avoid however I have determined 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:16.100
 meanwhile on my network run 

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.430
 I still classic 70 gameplay 

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.650
 his 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:22.190
 who, although as I said all the 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:23.740
 player names before that but well it happens 

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:28.010
 sometimes that keeps you a bit 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:30.080
 somehow somehow still so trusted 

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:31.310
 what the new channel design and that is 

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.010
 Now my question to you all 

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.750
 must judge what video should I then 

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:37.880
 Show as trailer for 

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:39.440
 non-subscribers if someone is now 

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.480
 one did not subscribe to mine 

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.890
 channell I can give him a trailer 

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.210
 Show and I do not want 

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.890
 let trailer show but I want 

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:48.230
 show a video completely like that 

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:50.660
 as it is and what do you mean which 

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:53.570
 video of mine i do not know how much 

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:55.940
 I have 470 ever presented then mine 

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:57.650
 channel as the best and best 

00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:00.290
 is best suited as a trailer 

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:01.400
 video for the new channel design 

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:03.200
 that would really interest me 

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.210
 currently I have the ultras killer in it 

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.680
 if I 'm interested in it 

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:08.720
 I think I still get so many today 

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.790
 matches of people who said hey look 

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.310
 I've been watching you since then and have so 

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:14.210
 I thought that fits very well 

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:15.500
 please write something in the comments 

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:17.060
 you think what a video as useful 

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.300
 is and makes up for the next 

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.300
 matches
