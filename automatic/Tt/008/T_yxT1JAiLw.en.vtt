this this is kind of a cool method so
when<00:03:40.290> you<00:03:40.350> see<00:03:40.440> my<00:03:40.590> pinky<00:03:40.920> coming<00:03:41.220> in<00:03:41.340> there

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
when you see my pinky coming in there

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:42.979 
when you see my pinky coming in there
what<00:03:42.000> it's<00:03:42.120> doing<00:03:42.360> is<00:03:42.480> it's<00:03:42.660> just<00:03:42.690> kind<00:03:42.959> of

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
what it's doing is it's just kind of

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.039 
what it's doing is it's just kind of
like<00:03:43.310> it's<00:03:44.310> pressing<00:03:44.610> down<00:03:44.880> kind<00:03:45.239> of<00:03:45.329> really

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
like it's pressing down kind of really

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.870 
like it's pressing down kind of really
lightly<00:03:46.260> all<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.680> strings<00:03:46.950> so<00:03:47.610> it's<00:03:47.760> not

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
lightly all the strings so it's not

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.819 
lightly all the strings so it's not
pressing<00:03:48.480> down<00:03:48.630> so<00:03:48.959> anything<00:03:49.260> rings<00:03:49.530> it's

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
pressing down so anything rings it's

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.289 
pressing down so anything rings it's
just<00:03:50.010> barely<00:03:50.640> touching<00:03:51.030> it

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
just barely touching it

00:03:51.299 --> 00:04:15.790 
just barely touching it
to<00:03:51.540> get<00:03:51.660> that<00:03:51.810> kind<00:03:52.049> of<00:03:52.110> chucks<00:03:52.350> down

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.860 

takes<00:04:16.489> a<00:04:16.610> while<00:04:16.640> let's<00:04:17.090> kind<00:04:17.300> of<00:04:17.360> get<00:04:17.480> used<00:04:17.660> to

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
takes a while let's kind of get used to

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.560 
takes a while let's kind of get used to
those<00:04:18.380> kind<00:04:18.410> of<00:04:18.709> rhythms<00:04:19.150> take<00:04:20.150> some<00:04:20.360> work

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
those kind of rhythms take some work

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.480 
those kind of rhythms take some work
even<00:04:21.560> if<00:04:21.620> you<00:04:21.709> don't<00:04:21.890> have<00:04:22.040> those<00:04:22.220> Chuck

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
even if you don't have those Chuck

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.280 
even if you don't have those Chuck
sounds<00:04:22.880> it<00:04:23.330> still<00:04:23.600> sounds<00:04:23.870> good<00:04:23.990> like<00:04:24.140> if<00:04:24.230> I

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
sounds it still sounds good like if I

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:42.760 
sounds it still sounds good like if I
was<00:04:24.410> just<00:04:24.500> doing<00:04:24.560> just<00:04:24.860> a<00:04:25.010> G<00:04:25.250> to<00:04:25.310> a<00:04:25.430> C<00:04:41.770> messing

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
was just doing just a G to a C messing

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.620 
was just doing just a G to a C messing
up<00:04:42.920> and<00:04:43.100> messing<00:04:43.160> around<00:04:43.970> with<00:04:44.270> this<00:04:44.390> this

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
up and messing around with this this

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.030 
up and messing around with this this
rhythm<00:04:44.960> and<00:04:45.140> doing<00:04:45.320> the<00:04:45.410> stuff<00:04:45.470> on<00:04:45.740> your<00:04:45.860> own

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
rhythm and doing the stuff on your own

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.760 
rhythm and doing the stuff on your own
works<00:04:46.670> really<00:04:46.910> good<00:04:47.150> as<00:04:47.300> well<00:04:47.560> now<00:04:48.560> I'm<00:04:48.680> just

works really good as well now I'm just
gonna<00:04:48.890> kind<00:04:49.130> of<00:04:49.220> improvise<00:04:49.670> I'm<00:04:49.850> going<00:04:49.970> to

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
gonna kind of improvise I'm going to

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.430 
gonna kind of improvise I'm going to
take<00:04:50.180> that<00:04:50.300> basic<00:04:50.510> rhythm<00:04:50.960> that<00:04:51.080> I<00:04:51.140> was<00:04:51.260> doing

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
take that basic rhythm that I was doing

00:04:51.440 --> 00:05:21.510 
take that basic rhythm that I was doing
and<00:04:51.710> I'm<00:04:52.070> just<00:04:52.250> gonna<00:04:52.370> kind<00:04:52.610> of

trying<00:05:28.430> to<00:05:28.490> learn<00:05:28.550> these<00:05:28.730> rhythms<00:05:28.910> when<00:05:29.390> I<00:05:29.450> was

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
trying to learn these rhythms when I was

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.510 
trying to learn these rhythms when I was
just<00:05:30.020> starting<00:05:30.380> was<00:05:30.530> was<00:05:30.890> really<00:05:31.130> tricky<00:05:31.460> at

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
first but to take some time with it you

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.470 
first but to take some time with it you
should<00:05:34.070> be<00:05:34.160> able<00:05:34.220> to<00:05:34.340> get<00:05:34.460> it<00:05:34.550> no<00:05:34.670> problem<00:05:35.000> cool

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
should be able to get it no problem cool

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.800 
should be able to get it no problem cool
alright<00:05:36.020> thanks<00:05:36.260> for<00:05:36.290> watching<00:05:36.380> see
