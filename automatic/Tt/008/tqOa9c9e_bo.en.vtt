00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
magnifying glass here we can expand our

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:10.140 
magnifying glass here we can expand our
coup<00:00:59.679> saying<00:01:06.180> these<00:01:07.180> are<00:01:07.390> your<00:01:08.790> just<00:01:09.790> do<00:01:09.970> this

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
coup saying these are your just do this

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.670 
coup saying these are your just do this
with<00:01:10.360> it<00:01:10.509> will<00:01:10.780> you<00:01:10.900> be<00:01:10.960> able<00:01:11.140> to<00:01:11.290> see<00:01:11.500> but<00:01:11.619> if

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
with it will you be able to see but if

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.969 
with it will you be able to see but if
you<00:01:11.740> pluck<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.369> move<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:14.409> can<00:01:14.590> pitch<00:01:14.740> Bend

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
you pluck and move you can pitch Bend

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.120 
you pluck and move you can pitch Bend
this<00:01:15.130> way<00:01:15.310> in<00:01:15.430> the<00:01:15.490> good<00:01:15.640> ways<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:17.049> then<00:01:17.979> if

this way in the good ways and then if

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:28.109 
this way in the good ways and then if
you<00:01:18.280> move<00:01:18.520> this<00:01:18.970> way<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.979> add<00:01:21.100> vibrato<00:01:27.119> and

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
you move this way you add vibrato and

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:35.440 
you move this way you add vibrato and
then<00:01:28.299> this<00:01:28.450> is<00:01:28.630> you<00:01:28.840> can<00:01:29.020> move

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450

that's nice in the middle now there's a
little<00:01:38.580> information<00:01:38.730> button<00:01:39.270> here<00:01:39.600> which

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
little information button here which

allows you to do certain things you
gives<00:01:42.900> you<00:01:42.990> some<00:01:43.230> instructions<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.830> how<00:01:43.980> to

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
gives you some instructions on how to

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.750 
gives you some instructions on how to
play<00:01:44.910> it<00:01:45.060> properly<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:46.580> change<00:01:47.580> the

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
play it properly and change the

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.390 
play it properly and change the
background<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.330> stuff<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.710> tuning<00:01:50.250> you

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
background and stuff and the tuning you

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.670 
background and stuff and the tuning you
can<00:01:50.580> set<00:01:50.760> the<00:01:50.880> route<00:01:51.120> when<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.170> set<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.500> route

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
can set the route when you set the route

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.380 
can set the route when you set the route
so<00:01:52.860> obviously<00:01:53.250> some<00:01:53.790> clothes<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.060> say

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
so obviously some clothes that say

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.340 
so obviously some clothes that say
that's<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.380> C<00:01:55.850> cuz<00:01:56.850> it's<00:01:57.030> certain<00:01:57.479> route<00:01:57.990> C

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
that's the C cuz it's certain route C

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.980 
that's the C cuz it's certain route C
and<00:01:59.010> also<00:01:59.400> allows<00:01:59.760> you<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.940> do<00:02:00.150> custom<00:02:00.600> tuning

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
and also allows you to do custom tuning

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.650 
and also allows you to do custom tuning
advanced<00:02:01.530> tuning<00:02:01.860> if<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.220> like<00:02:02.400> and<00:02:02.670> if<00:02:03.540> we

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
advanced tuning if you like and if we

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.499 
advanced tuning if you like and if we
turn<00:02:03.870> this<00:02:04.190> tuning<00:02:05.190> shortcut<00:02:05.700> on<00:02:05.850> here<00:02:08.509> was

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
turn this tuning shortcut on here was

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.390 
turn this tuning shortcut on here was
that<00:02:09.540> there<00:02:09.869> might<00:02:10.679> be<00:02:10.800> able<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.040> see<00:02:11.190> along

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
that there might be able to see along

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.390 
that there might be able to see along
here<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:13.230> notes<00:02:13.470> of<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:13.860> strings<00:02:14.160> as

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
here is the the notes of the strings as

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.710 
here is the the notes of the strings as
well<00:02:14.580> so<00:02:15.270> you<00:02:15.900> can<00:02:16.050> see<00:02:16.260> where<00:02:16.440> you're<00:02:16.590> going

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
well so you can see where you're going

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.910 
well so you can see where you're going
also<00:02:18.720> we<00:02:19.380> have<00:02:19.680> here<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.850> ability<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.390> save

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
also we have here the ability to save

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.560 
also we have here the ability to save
something<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.070> we've<00:02:23.340> recorded<00:02:23.760> so<00:02:24.239> we<00:02:24.270> can

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
something that we've recorded so we can

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.680 
something that we've recorded so we can
record<00:02:24.870> as<00:02:25.110> well<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:26.300> obviously<00:02:27.300> we<00:02:27.450> can<00:02:27.600> do

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
record as well and obviously we can do

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.590 
record as well and obviously we can do
that<00:02:27.870> by<00:02:27.989> hitting<00:02:28.170> record<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:30.030> let's<00:02:30.300> just

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
that by hitting record and let's just

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.380 
that by hitting record and let's just
stop<00:02:30.930> there<00:02:31.200> but<00:02:31.440> also<00:02:31.650> so<00:02:32.130> we<00:02:32.280> can<00:02:32.310> load<00:02:33.180> in

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
stop there but also so we can load in

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.060 
stop there but also so we can load in
some<00:02:33.510> demo<00:02:34.050> songs<00:02:34.320> that<00:02:34.470> they've<00:02:34.650> put<00:02:34.860> in<00:02:34.950> with

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
in the background so we're gonna get

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.150 
in the background so we're gonna get
like<00:04:18.840> a<00:04:18.870> Chinese<00:04:19.290> garden<00:04:19.620> field<00:04:19.799> going<00:04:19.980> on

unless<00:04:22.109> I<00:04:22.260> use<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:23.040> iPad<00:04:23.430> into<00:04:23.940> a<00:04:24.060> completely

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
unless I use the iPad into a completely

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:31.070 
unless I use the iPad into a completely
separate<00:04:25.020> thing<00:04:25.230> so<00:04:28.820> so<00:04:29.820> the<00:04:30.720> good<00:04:30.900> thing
