I'm<00:00:15.080> am<00:00:15.320> using<00:00:15.620> the<00:00:15.770> 120<00:00:16.460> palette<00:00:16.820> from<00:00:17.060> Celia

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
I'm am using the 120 palette from Celia

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.160 
I'm am using the 120 palette from Celia
makeup<00:00:18.050> to<00:00:18.200> do<00:00:18.350> this

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.260 

you<00:00:21.620> don't<00:00:21.860> have<00:00:22.010> to<00:00:22.160> do<00:00:22.310> this<00:00:22.520> but<00:00:23.000> if<00:00:23.120> you're

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
you don't have to do this but if you're

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.730 
you don't have to do this but if you're
getting<00:00:23.510> used<00:00:23.690> to<00:00:23.840> cutting<00:00:24.080> the<00:00:24.200> crease<00:00:24.560> I

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
getting used to cutting the crease I

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.070 
getting used to cutting the crease I
guess<00:00:24.920> that<00:00:25.160> it's<00:00:25.310> nice<00:00:25.610> to<00:00:25.970> have<00:00:26.119> this<00:00:26.420> for

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
guess that it's nice to have this for

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.050 
guess that it's nice to have this for
blending<00:00:27.529> and<00:00:27.619> stuff<00:00:27.980> but<00:00:28.550> you<00:00:28.670> could<00:00:28.850> take<00:00:29.029> a

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
blending and stuff but you could take a

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.839 
blending and stuff but you could take a
piece<00:00:29.360> of<00:00:29.390> tape<00:00:29.720> and<00:00:30.670> pretend<00:00:31.670> there's<00:00:31.790> a

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849 
piece of tape and pretend there's a

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:33.850 
piece of tape and pretend there's a
visible<00:00:32.300> line<00:00:32.480> going<00:00:32.840> from<00:00:32.870> the<00:00:33.200> end<00:00:33.470> of<00:00:33.710> your
