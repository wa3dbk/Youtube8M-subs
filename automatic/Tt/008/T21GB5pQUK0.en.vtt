game so basically what I think is going

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.950 
game so basically what I think is going
to<00:00:49.289> be<00:00:49.320> by<00:00:49.890> far<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.430> best<00:00:50.969> team<00:00:51.180> based<00:00:51.390> vehicle

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
to be by far the best team based vehicle

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.250 
to be by far the best team based vehicle
in<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.199> game<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.809> I'm<00:00:54.809> not<00:00:54.989> really<00:00:55.140> sure

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
in this game is the I'm not really sure

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.450 
in this game is the I'm not really sure
what<00:00:55.559> it's<00:00:55.680> called<00:00:55.829> under<00:00:56.219> something<00:00:56.370> called

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
an assault boat but the salt though is

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.150 
an assault boat but the salt though is
it<00:00:59.940> can<00:01:00.090> hold<00:01:00.239> six<00:01:00.600> people<00:01:00.930> has<00:01:01.230> two<00:01:01.680> machine

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
guns on each side of it that holds up it

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.630 
guns on each side of it that holds up it
can<00:01:05.489> actually<00:01:05.640> shoot<00:01:05.970> tank<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.720> tank<00:01:07.640> shells

they<00:02:27.660> switched<00:02:27.900> it<00:02:28.020> around<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.470> little<00:02:28.500> bit<00:02:28.800> of

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
they switched it around a little bit of

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.420 
they switched it around a little bit of
a<00:02:28.980> decrease<00:02:29.400> there<00:02:30.860> but<00:02:31.860> most<00:02:32.190> of<00:02:32.340> all

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
a decrease there but most of all

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.390 
a decrease there but most of all
everything<00:02:33.000> else<00:02:33.180> should<00:02:33.510> be<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.990> same<00:02:34.400> jets

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
everything else should be the same jets

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.110 
everything else should be the same jets
about<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.970> same<00:02:37.160> yeah<00:02:38.160> most<00:02:38.580> of<00:02:38.700> vehicles<00:02:39.030> are

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
about the same yeah most of vehicles are

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.970 
about the same yeah most of vehicles are
going<00:02:39.270> to<00:02:39.330> be<00:02:39.420> around<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.720> same<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:40.200> the

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
going to be around the same and the

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.010 
going to be around the same and the
Blackhawk<00:02:41.460> i<00:02:41.610> think<00:02:41.850> is<00:02:41.970> being<00:02:42.210> upgraded<00:02:42.390> to

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
Blackhawk i think is being upgraded to

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.200 
Blackhawk i think is being upgraded to
having<00:02:43.530> more<00:02:43.680> machine<00:02:44.040> guns<00:02:44.340> in<00:02:44.550> it<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.880> will

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
having more machine guns in it and will

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.150 
having more machine guns in it and will
stand<00:02:45.420> more<00:02:45.660> power<00:02:45.900> because<00:02:46.140> if<00:02:46.860> you're<00:02:47.070> in

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
stand more power because if you're in

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.080 
stand more power because if you're in
one<00:02:47.250> of<00:02:47.310> those<00:02:47.400> things<00:02:47.640> you're<00:02:47.760> just<00:02:47.970> like<00:02:48.060> a

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
one of those things you're just like a

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.320 
one of those things you're just like a
sitting<00:02:48.390> duck<00:02:48.510> really<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:50.270> yeah<00:02:51.270> so<00:02:51.920> uh<00:02:53.330> like

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
sitting duck really and yeah so uh like

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.900 
sitting duck really and yeah so uh like
I<00:02:54.450> said<00:02:54.480> boat<00:02:55.380> i<00:02:55.590> think<00:02:55.920> is<00:02:56.040> done<00:02:56.220> by<00:02:56.430> far<00:02:56.700> going

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
I said boat i think is done by far going

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.180 
I said boat i think is done by far going
to<00:02:56.970> be<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:58.280> best<00:03:00.530> vehicle<00:03:01.530> in<00:03:01.740> battlefield<00:03:02.160> 4

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
to be the best vehicle in battlefield 4

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.060 
to be the best vehicle in battlefield 4
but<00:03:02.730> that's<00:03:03.030> just<00:03:03.120> my<00:03:03.330> opinion<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.920> so<00:03:04.920> yeah

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
but that's just my opinion and so yeah

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.130 
but that's just my opinion and so yeah
this<00:03:05.340> is<00:03:05.460> kind<00:03:05.610> of<00:03:05.640> in<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.790> short<00:03:06.090> video<00:03:06.300> today
