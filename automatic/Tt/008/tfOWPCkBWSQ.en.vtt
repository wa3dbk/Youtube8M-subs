00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
teasers I know that I learned a lot as

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.310 
teasers I know that I learned a lot as
far<00:00:18.530> as<00:00:18.940> teasers<00:00:19.940> come<00:00:20.150> into<00:00:20.390> play<00:00:20.630> a<00:00:20.660> lot<00:00:20.990> more

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
far as teasers come into play a lot more

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.490 
far as teasers come into play a lot more
in<00:00:21.620> the<00:00:22.130> NFL<00:00:22.550> than<00:00:23.420> they<00:00:23.570> do<00:00:23.630> in<00:00:23.750> college<00:00:24.110> and

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
in the NFL than they do in college and

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.800 
in the NFL than they do in college and
so<00:00:24.650> I<00:00:24.680> learned<00:00:24.980> not<00:00:25.460> to<00:00:25.670> do<00:00:25.820> teasers<00:00:26.300> as<00:00:26.480> far<00:00:26.690> as

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
so I learned not to do teasers as far as

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.570 
so I learned not to do teasers as far as
college<00:00:27.080> football<00:00:27.440> yeah<00:00:27.740> people<00:00:28.430> talk<00:00:28.550> about

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
college football yeah people talk about

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.550 
college football yeah people talk about
that<00:00:28.910> all<00:00:29.030> the<00:00:29.060> time<00:00:29.180> I<00:00:29.480> never<00:00:29.810> do<00:00:30.050> teasers<00:00:30.410> in

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
that all the time I never do teasers in

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.380 
that all the time I never do teasers in
college<00:00:30.800> football<00:00:30.950> just<00:00:31.310> the<00:00:31.700> variance<00:00:32.119> is<00:00:32.240> so

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
college football just the variance is so

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.030 
college football just the variance is so
high<00:00:32.570> and<00:00:32.930> when<00:00:33.350> you've<00:00:33.470> got<00:00:33.650> you<00:00:34.010> know

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
high and when you've got you know

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.750 
high and when you've got you know
spreads<00:00:34.579> and<00:00:35.710> totals<00:00:36.710> in<00:00:36.950> you<00:00:37.280> know<00:00:37.340> 80

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
spreads and totals in you know 80

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.819 
spreads and totals in you know 80
sometimes<00:00:38.390> I<00:00:38.570> mean<00:00:38.720> we've<00:00:39.410> seen<00:00:39.620> it<00:00:39.739> a<00:00:39.800> few

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
sometimes I mean we've seen it a few

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.340 
sometimes I mean we've seen it a few
times<00:00:40.060> it<00:00:41.060> makes<00:00:41.210> more<00:00:41.420> of<00:00:41.480> a<00:00:41.600> variance<00:00:42.020> I<00:00:42.200> mean

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
times it makes more of a variance I mean

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.900 
times it makes more of a variance I mean
the<00:00:42.710> games<00:00:43.190> we're<00:00:43.340> talking<00:00:43.550> about<00:00:43.640> it<00:00:43.880> now

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910

got<00:01:17.720> an<00:01:17.810> Atlanta<00:01:18.140> team<00:01:18.170> that<00:01:18.530> came<00:01:18.799> into<00:01:18.979> the

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
got an Atlanta team that came into the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.469 
got an Atlanta team that came into the
season<00:01:19.250> high<00:01:19.520> expectations<00:01:20.180> coming<00:01:20.270> off<00:01:20.450> a

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
season high expectations coming off a

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.750 
season high expectations coming off a
really<00:01:20.750> strong<00:01:21.229> air<00:01:21.500> have<00:01:22.159> not<00:01:22.400> played<00:01:22.729> well

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
really strong air have not played well

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.609 
really strong air have not played well
and<00:01:23.240> if<00:01:23.510> you<00:01:23.600> go<00:01:23.720> back<00:01:23.900> I<00:01:24.110> think<00:01:24.290> it<00:01:24.380> all<00:01:24.470> comes

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
and if you go back I think it all comes

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.800 
and if you go back I think it all comes
down<00:01:24.770> to<00:01:24.890> basically<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:25.880> red<00:01:26.030> zone<00:01:26.060> I<00:01:26.479> mean

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
down to basically the red zone I mean

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.690 
down to basically the red zone I mean
the<00:01:26.900> Atlanta<00:01:27.229> cannot<00:01:27.590> run<00:01:27.799> the<00:01:27.920> football<00:01:28.100> when

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
the Atlanta cannot run the football when

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.830 
the Atlanta cannot run the football when
you<00:01:28.760> cannot<00:01:28.970> run<00:01:29.119> the<00:01:29.240> football<00:01:29.420> and<00:01:29.659> you<00:01:29.720> get

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
you cannot run the football and you get

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.330 
you cannot run the football and you get
down<00:01:29.960> to<00:01:30.110> your<00:01:30.140> 10-yard<00:01:30.619> line<00:01:30.770> 20<00:01:31.130> yard<00:01:31.280> line

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
down to your 10-yard line 20 yard line

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.920 
down to your 10-yard line 20 yard line
the<00:01:31.939> opposition<00:01:32.390> knows<00:01:32.570> what<00:01:32.750> you're<00:01:32.869> going

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
the opposition knows what you're going

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.359
