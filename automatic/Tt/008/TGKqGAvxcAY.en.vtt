heavy<00:01:10.840> lifting<00:01:10.960> and<00:01:11.500> creating<00:01:12.369> our<00:01:12.550> final

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
heavy lifting and creating our final

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.240 
heavy lifting and creating our final
image<00:01:13.179> with<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:13.720> camera<00:01:14.110> which<00:01:14.560> is<00:01:14.800> improved

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
image with the camera which is improved

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.690 
image with the camera which is improved
over<00:01:15.759> the<00:01:15.909> original<00:01:16.119> C<00:01:16.509> 100<00:01:17.140> so<00:01:17.680> what<00:01:18.250> is<00:01:18.430> this

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
over the original C 100 so what is this

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.090 
over the original C 100 so what is this
image<00:01:19.240> processor<00:01:19.840> actually<00:01:20.049> doing<00:01:20.680> well

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
image processor actually doing well

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.170 
image processor actually doing well
we're<00:01:21.549> capturing<00:01:22.210> a<00:01:22.479> 4k<00:01:23.229> image<00:01:23.619> and<00:01:23.890> then<00:01:24.640> the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
we're capturing a 4k image and then the

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.289 
we're capturing a 4k image and then the
camera<00:01:25.780> is<00:01:25.960> taking<00:01:26.350> that<00:01:26.710> and<00:01:26.950> it's<00:01:27.549> using<00:01:27.970> a

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
camera is taking that and it's using a

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:31.280 
camera is taking that and it's using a
new<00:01:28.570> advanced<00:01:29.320> debayering<00:01:30.280> algorithm<00:01:30.970> it's

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
new advanced debayering algorithm it's

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.050 
new advanced debayering algorithm it's
taking<00:01:32.290> the<00:01:32.409> RGB<00:01:32.890> channels<00:01:33.310> and<00:01:33.490> breaking<00:01:33.939> it

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
taking the RGB channels and breaking it

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.010 
taking the RGB channels and breaking it
up<00:01:34.180> into<00:01:34.360> three<00:01:35.250> separate<00:01:36.250> 8-megapixel<00:01:37.020> 4k

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
up into three separate 8-megapixel 4k

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.280 
up into three separate 8-megapixel 4k
signals<00:01:38.950> and<00:01:39.220> then<00:01:39.850> that's<00:01:40.149> being<00:01:40.540> taken<00:01:41.049> and

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
signals and then that's being taken and

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.670 
signals and then that's being taken and
actually<00:01:41.740> scaled<00:01:42.189> down<00:01:42.549> to<00:01:43.270> create<00:01:43.659> our<00:01:43.960> final

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
actually scaled down to create our final

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.569 
actually scaled down to create our final
1920<00:01:45.610> by<00:01:45.820> 1080<00:01:46.299> Full<00:01:46.750> HD<00:01:46.930> image<00:01:47.680> and<00:01:47.920> the

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
1920 by 1080 Full HD image and the

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:50.580 
1920 by 1080 Full HD image and the
byproduct<00:01:49.000> of<00:01:49.360> all<00:01:49.509> of<00:01:49.630> this<00:01:49.780> engineering

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
byproduct of all of this engineering

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.380 
byproduct of all of this engineering
that's<00:01:50.710> inside<00:01:51.009> of<00:01:51.040> the<00:01:51.220> camera<00:01:51.430> we've<00:01:52.090> got

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
that's inside of the camera we've got

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.830 
that's inside of the camera we've got
less<00:01:53.229> false<00:01:53.530> colors<00:01:53.920> we<00:01:54.790> have<00:01:55.030> reduced<00:01:55.600> more<00:01:55.810> a

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
less false colors we have reduced more a

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.010 
less false colors we have reduced more a
less<00:01:56.649> jaggies<00:01:57.219> in<00:01:57.399> the<00:01:57.490> image<00:01:57.820> and<00:01:58.030> then<00:01:58.659> we

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
less jaggies in the image and then we

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.010 
less jaggies in the image and then we
also<00:01:59.229> have<00:01:59.770> less<00:02:00.310> noise<00:02:00.700> which<00:02:01.509> is<00:02:01.689> allowing

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
also have less noise which is allowing

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.560 
also have less noise which is allowing
the<00:02:02.259> camera<00:02:02.590> now<00:02:02.740> to<00:02:02.799> go<00:02:03.100> to<00:02:03.159> even<00:02:03.430> higher<00:02:03.610> ISO

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
the camera now to go to even higher ISO

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.160 
the camera now to go to even higher ISO
so<00:02:04.630> we<00:02:05.290> could<00:02:05.500> go<00:02:05.619> to<00:02:05.649> 80,000<00:02:06.640> on<00:02:06.759> the<00:02:07.149> C<00:02:07.420> 100<00:02:07.990> on

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
so we could go to 80,000 on the C 100 on

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.009 
so we could go to 80,000 on the C 100 on
the<00:02:08.590> mark<00:02:08.860> 2<00:02:09.070> we<00:02:09.280> can<00:02:09.429> go<00:02:09.549> to<00:02:09.610> 102<00:02:10.479> thousand

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
the mark 2 we can go to 102 thousand

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.140 
the mark 2 we can go to 102 thousand
four<00:02:11.230> hundred<00:02:11.380> ISO<00:02:12.070> so<00:02:12.640> now<00:02:12.790> that<00:02:12.850> we've<00:02:13.030> gone

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
four hundred ISO so now that we've gone

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.300 
four hundred ISO so now that we've gone
over<00:02:13.209> that<00:02:13.450> let's<00:02:14.290> talk<00:02:14.530> about<00:02:14.590> some<00:02:15.100> of<00:02:15.220> the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
over that let's talk about some of the

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.890 
over that let's talk about some of the
external<00:02:15.700> features<00:02:15.910> that<00:02:16.329> I'm<00:02:16.630> really

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
external features that I'm really

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.870 
external features that I'm really
excited<00:02:17.140> about<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.280> first<00:02:18.519> thing<00:02:18.670> I<00:02:18.730> want

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
excited about and the first thing I want

to talk to you about is this new OLED

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.310 
to talk to you about is this new OLED
display<00:02:21.070> on<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.609> camera<00:02:21.970> so<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.750> improved

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
display on the camera so the improved

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.320 
display on the camera so the improved
ergonomics<00:02:23.620> of<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.370> c100<00:02:24.970> mark

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
ergonomics of the c100 mark

camera and one of my favorite things is

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.160 
camera and one of my favorite things is
a<00:02:35.560> new<00:02:35.890> OLED<00:02:36.340> display<00:02:36.880> which<00:02:37.450> does<00:02:37.720> a<00:02:37.750> lot<00:02:37.990> of

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
a new OLED display which does a lot of

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.380 
a new OLED display which does a lot of
different<00:02:38.500> things<00:02:38.680> but<00:02:39.040> really<00:02:39.550> one<00:02:40.180> of<00:02:40.210> the

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
different things but really one of the

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.270 
different things but really one of the
major<00:02:40.600> things<00:02:40.960> is<00:02:41.170> that<00:02:41.410> you<00:02:41.470> can<00:02:41.620> put<00:02:42.070> it<00:02:42.160> in

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
major things is that you can put it in

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.940 
major things is that you can put it in
basically<00:02:42.880> any<00:02:43.150> position<00:02:43.720> tilt<00:02:44.560> it<00:02:44.680> all<00:02:44.830> the

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
basically any position tilt it all the

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.940 
basically any position tilt it all the
way<00:02:45.040> down<00:02:45.180> tilt<00:02:46.180> it<00:02:46.330> all<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.690> way<00:02:46.810> up<00:02:46.840> and<00:02:47.200> you

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
way down tilt it all the way up and you

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.240 
way down tilt it all the way up and you
can<00:02:48.130> also<00:02:48.310> tilt<00:02:48.760> it<00:02:49.320> directly<00:02:50.320> facing

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
can also tilt it directly facing

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.370 
can also tilt it directly facing
somebody<00:02:51.580> so<00:02:52.090> this<00:02:52.240> is<00:02:52.360> great<00:02:52.600> for<00:02:52.630> spot<00:02:53.080> news

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
somebody so this is great for spot news

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.830 
somebody so this is great for spot news
coverage<00:02:53.920> if<00:02:54.160> you're<00:02:54.700> doing<00:02:54.910> webcasts<00:02:55.720> and

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
coverage if you're doing webcasts and

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.540 
coverage if you're doing webcasts and
you're<00:02:55.960> presenting<00:02:56.500> now<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:56.980> other<00:02:57.310> thing

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
you're presenting now the other thing

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.060 
you're presenting now the other thing
that<00:02:57.580> I<00:02:57.730> can<00:02:57.910> do<00:02:58.060> with<00:02:58.270> this<00:02:58.450> is<00:02:59.350> I<00:02:59.530> can<00:02:59.710> rotate

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
that I can do with this is I can rotate

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.160 
that I can do with this is I can rotate
it<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.550> put<00:03:00.610> it<00:03:00.940> on<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.270> side<00:03:01.510> of<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.990> camera

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
it and put it on the side of the camera

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.780 
it and put it on the side of the camera
system<00:03:02.440> so<00:03:02.800> we<00:03:02.920> can<00:03:02.950> actually<00:03:03.220> look<00:03:03.520> at<00:03:03.700> the

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
system so we can actually look at the

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.850 
system so we can actually look at the
image<00:03:04.060> from<00:03:04.210> the<00:03:04.300> side<00:03:04.570> this<00:03:05.080> is<00:03:05.140> great<00:03:05.560> when

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
image from the side this is great when

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.800 
image from the side this is great when
you're<00:03:06.010> conducting<00:03:06.190> interviews<00:03:06.790> by<00:03:07.330> yourself

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
you're conducting interviews by yourself

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.690 
you're conducting interviews by yourself
and<00:03:08.050> you<00:03:08.230> need<00:03:08.410> to<00:03:08.560> see<00:03:08.740> a<00:03:08.770> reference<00:03:09.100> of<00:03:09.550> the

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
and you need to see a reference of the

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.250 
and you need to see a reference of the
person<00:03:10.060> that<00:03:10.090> you're<00:03:10.420> interviewing<00:03:10.840> and

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
person that you're interviewing and

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.900 
person that you're interviewing and
you're<00:03:11.770> off<00:03:11.920> to<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.190> side<00:03:12.490> of<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.730> camera

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
you're off to the side of the camera

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.270 
you're off to the side of the camera
system<00:03:13.210> and<00:03:13.540> then<00:03:14.050> I<00:03:14.140> can<00:03:14.290> also<00:03:14.440> rotate<00:03:14.830> this

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
system and then I can also rotate this

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.090 
system and then I can also rotate this
back<00:03:15.730> into<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.810> camera<00:03:17.140> body<00:03:17.320> itself<00:03:17.530> and

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
back into the camera body itself and

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.450 
back into the camera body itself and
this<00:03:18.550> has<00:03:18.820> a<00:03:19.090> lot<00:03:19.360> of<00:03:19.420> distinct<00:03:20.020> advantages<00:03:20.620> to

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
this has a lot of distinct advantages to

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.640 
this has a lot of distinct advantages to
me<00:03:21.640> and<00:03:21.940> it<00:03:22.060> automatically<00:03:22.720> detects<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.410> flip

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
me and it automatically detects the flip

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.410 
me and it automatically detects the flip
so<00:03:23.920> that<00:03:24.100> all<00:03:24.250> of<00:03:24.280> our<00:03:24.520> menus<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:25.030> everything

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
so that all of our menus and everything

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.050 
so that all of our menus and everything
are<00:03:25.660> right-side<00:03:26.290> up<00:03:26.500> this<00:03:27.100> is<00:03:27.370> great<00:03:27.550> for

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
are right-side up this is great for

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.270 
are right-side up this is great for
really<00:03:28.510> two<00:03:28.750> applications<00:03:29.530> obviously<00:03:30.070> for

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
really two applications obviously for

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.070 
really two applications obviously for
operating<00:03:30.850> the<00:03:30.970> camera<00:03:31.330> from<00:03:31.510> behind<00:03:31.870> the

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
operating the camera from behind the

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.810 
operating the camera from behind the
camera<00:03:32.290> system<00:03:32.560> but<00:03:33.220> also<00:03:33.370> when<00:03:33.640> we're

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
camera system but also when we're

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.699 
camera system but also when we're
rigging<00:03:34.239> the<00:03:34.390> camera<00:03:34.780> system<00:03:34.930> to<00:03:35.320> things<00:03:35.560> like

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
rigging the camera system to things like

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.010 
rigging the camera system to things like
something<00:03:36.400> like<00:03:36.550> a<00:03:36.580> free<00:03:36.880> fly<00:03:37.090> systems<00:03:37.570> movi

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
something like a free fly systems movi

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.190 
something like a free fly systems movi
we<00:03:38.560> now<00:03:38.770> can<00:03:39.190> see<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.670> image<00:03:40.030> we<00:03:40.690> don't<00:03:40.989> in

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
we now can see the image we don't in

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.170 
we now can see the image we don't in
fact<00:03:41.230> have<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:41.709> have<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.220> grip<00:03:42.400> unit<00:03:42.760> on<00:03:42.910> here

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
fact have to have the grip unit on here

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.790 
fact have to have the grip unit on here
and<00:03:43.330> the<00:03:43.420> reason<00:03:43.810> we<00:03:43.930> don't<00:03:44.050> have<00:03:44.170> to<00:03:44.470> have<00:03:44.620> it

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
and the reason we don't have to have it

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.590 
and the reason we don't have to have it
and<00:03:45.010> I'm<00:03:45.250> just<00:03:45.280> going<00:03:45.489> to<00:03:45.580> move<00:03:45.790> this<00:03:45.970> EVF<00:03:46.420> out

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
and I'm just going to move this EVF out

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.940 
and I'm just going to move this EVF out

welcome upgrade to this mark ii camera

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.340 
welcome upgrade to this mark ii camera
it's<00:04:08.620> got<00:04:08.860> this<00:04:09.040> 68<00:04:09.700> degree<00:04:10.090> tilt<00:04:10.390> and<00:04:10.720> it<00:04:11.170> has

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
it's got this 68 degree tilt and it has

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.380 
it's got this 68 degree tilt and it has
this<00:04:11.560> really<00:04:11.890> comfortable<00:04:12.520> large<00:04:12.820> eye<00:04:13.030> Cup

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
this really comfortable large eye Cup

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.050 
this really comfortable large eye Cup
which<00:04:13.690> makes<00:04:13.989> operation<00:04:14.650> very<00:04:15.070> easy<00:04:15.370> and<00:04:15.700> it's

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
which makes operation very easy and it's

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.880 
which makes operation very easy and it's
also<00:04:16.270> reversible<00:04:16.900> so<00:04:17.230> if<00:04:17.380> you're<00:04:17.500> using<00:04:17.650> on

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
also reversible so if you're using on

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.830 
also reversible so if you're using on
your<00:04:18.070> left<00:04:18.310> or<00:04:18.520> your<00:04:18.580> right<00:04:18.730> eye<00:04:19.120> you<00:04:19.450> can<00:04:19.660> do

your left or your right eye you can do

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.400 
your left or your right eye you can do
that<00:04:20.020> so<00:04:20.620> these<00:04:21.160> two<00:04:21.489> things<00:04:21.519> alone<00:04:22.300> in<00:04:22.690> terms

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
that so these two things alone in terms

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.740 
that so these two things alone in terms
of<00:04:23.620> usability<00:04:23.950> with<00:04:24.490> the<00:04:24.610> c100<00:04:25.270> mark<00:04:25.510> ii

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
of usability with the c100 mark ii

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.170 
of usability with the c100 mark ii

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.960 
pushing down here on the camera system
there's<00:05:03.820> also<00:05:04.120> now<00:05:04.540> a<00:05:04.920> silent<00:05:05.920> push<00:05:06.370> on<00:05:06.610> these

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
there's also now a silent push on these

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.490 
there's also now a silent push on these
buttons<00:05:07.360> so<00:05:07.450> they<00:05:07.570> don't<00:05:07.840> make<00:05:07.990> a<00:05:08.020> clicking

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500

sound<00:05:08.530> like<00:05:09.040> they<00:05:09.190> did<00:05:09.400> on<00:05:09.520> the<00:05:09.790> original<00:05:09.990> c100

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
sound like they did on the original c100

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:12.840 
sound like they did on the original c100

and the layout of our buttons has

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.430 
and the layout of our buttons has
changed<00:05:13.300> slightly<00:05:13.480> because<00:05:14.020> we've<00:05:14.200> now

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
changed slightly because we've now

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.520 
changed slightly because we've now
introduced<00:05:15.100> these<00:05:15.580> new<00:05:15.940> buttons<00:05:16.330> on<00:05:16.570> the<00:05:17.110> OLED

assignable button which is part of the

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.690 
assignable button which is part of the
OLED<00:05:43.630> over<00:05:43.990> here<00:05:44.320> and<00:05:44.500> that<00:05:44.950> can<00:05:45.220> actually<00:05:45.430> be

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
OLED over here and that can actually be

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.270 
OLED over here and that can actually be
used<00:05:45.880> in<00:05:46.360> its<00:05:46.570> default<00:05:46.780> for<00:05:47.230> the<00:05:47.320> display<00:05:47.770> but

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.280 
used in its default for the display but

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.980 
used in its default for the display but
you<00:05:48.370> can<00:05:48.490> also<00:05:48.640> assign<00:05:49.060> it<00:05:49.270> to<00:05:49.300> a<00:05:49.450> different

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
you can also assign it to a different

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.260 
you can also assign it to a different
function<00:05:50.200> we'll<00:05:51.040> take<00:05:51.220> a<00:05:51.250> look<00:05:51.490> at<00:05:51.640> the<00:05:51.790> SD

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
function we'll take a look at the SD

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.220 
function we'll take a look at the SD
card<00:05:52.630> slots<00:05:53.260> and<00:05:53.620> you'll<00:05:54.130> see<00:05:54.430> that<00:05:54.670> they<00:05:54.910> have

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
card slots and you'll see that they have

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:57.960 
card slots and you'll see that they have
transparent<00:05:56.230> windows<00:05:56.920> so<00:05:57.520> you<00:05:57.580> can<00:05:57.790> actually

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
transparent windows so you can actually

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.240 
transparent windows so you can actually
make<00:05:58.390> sure<00:05:58.420> that<00:05:58.780> there<00:05:58.930> are<00:05:59.080> cards<00:05:59.530> inside<00:06:00.040> of

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.250 
make sure that there are cards inside of

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.280 
make sure that there are cards inside of
there<00:06:00.490> so<00:06:00.910> that's<00:06:01.120> another<00:06:01.450> nice<00:06:02.020> feature

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:02.290 
there so that's another nice feature

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.070 
there so that's another nice feature
there's<00:06:03.070> a<00:06:03.220> view<00:06:03.760> finder<00:06:04.000> button<00:06:04.570> on<00:06:04.750> the

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
there's a view finder button on the

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.080 
there's a view finder button on the
camera<00:06:05.440> system<00:06:05.800> so<00:06:06.250> you<00:06:06.340> can<00:06:06.610> just<00:06:06.790> press<00:06:07.060> that

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
camera system so you can just press that

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.200 
camera system so you can just press that
and<00:06:07.510> it<00:06:07.630> will<00:06:07.750> turn<00:06:08.050> off<00:06:08.410> the<00:06:08.680> EVF<00:06:09.160> if<00:06:09.370> you<00:06:09.970> want

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:10.210 
and it will turn off the EVF if you want

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.510 
and it will turn off the EVF if you want
it<00:06:10.300> to<00:06:10.480> so<00:06:10.810> if<00:06:10.960> you're<00:06:11.110> using<00:06:11.380> the<00:06:11.620> OLED<00:06:12.010> we<00:06:12.310> can

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
it to so if you're using the OLED we can

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.940 
it to so if you're using the OLED we can
actually<00:06:12.850> save<00:06:13.120> power<00:06:13.450> the<00:06:14.080> new<00:06:14.320> battery

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:14.950 
actually save power the new battery

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.280 
actually save power the new battery
release<00:06:15.250> it's<00:06:15.910> now<00:06:16.150> on<00:06:16.360> the<00:06:16.450> back<00:06:16.660> which<00:06:17.020> makes

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:17.290 
release it's now on the back which makes

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:19.500 
release it's now on the back which makes
it<00:06:17.440> easier<00:06:17.800> to<00:06:17.890> release<00:06:18.430> the<00:06:18.640> battery<00:06:18.820> and<00:06:19.180> if

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:19.510 
it easier to release the battery and if

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.480 
it easier to release the battery and if
I<00:06:19.630> rotate<00:06:19.960> the<00:06:20.350> camera<00:06:20.530> system<00:06:21.010> here<00:06:21.280> you'll

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
I rotate the camera system here you'll

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.580 
I rotate the camera system here you'll
see<00:06:21.700> that<00:06:21.850> the<00:06:22.000> start/stop<00:06:22.690> record<00:06:23.110> button<00:06:23.410> is

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
see that the start/stop record button is

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.940 
see that the start/stop record button is
now<00:06:23.980> red<00:06:24.670> it<00:06:24.970> seems<00:06:25.840> small<00:06:26.110> but<00:06:26.350> it's<00:06:26.740> also

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:26.950 
now red it seems small but it's also

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.370 
now red it seems small but it's also
huge<00:06:27.550> there<00:06:28.240> is<00:06:28.390> now<00:06:28.570> a<00:06:28.600> built-in<00:06:29.080> microphone

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380 
huge there is now a built-in microphone

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.830 
huge there is now a built-in microphone
on<00:06:30.010> the<00:06:30.190> exterior<00:06:30.520> of<00:06:30.730> the<00:06:31.000> camera<00:06:31.360> body<00:06:31.510> and

on the exterior of the camera body and
when<00:06:32.620> we're<00:06:32.830> just<00:06:33.130> using<00:06:33.460> the<00:06:33.670> camera<00:06:34.030> in<00:06:34.150> its

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
when we're just using the camera in its

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.170 
when we're just using the camera in its
smallest<00:06:34.800> configuration<00:06:35.800> we<00:06:36.370> just<00:06:36.640> have<00:06:36.940> the

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.180 
smallest configuration we just have the

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.910 
smallest configuration we just have the
grip<00:06:37.390> unit<00:06:37.750> and<00:06:37.930> the<00:06:38.050> camera<00:06:38.350> body<00:06:38.500> and<00:06:38.680> maybe

a<00:06:39.010> small<00:06:39.310> lens<00:06:39.550> and<00:06:39.850> we<00:06:40.120> have<00:06:40.360> taken<00:06:40.810> off<00:06:40.960> this

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:41.170 
a small lens and we have taken off this

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.290 
a small lens and we have taken off this
handle<00:06:41.560> unit<00:06:41.860> we<00:06:42.340> now<00:06:42.550> have<00:06:42.760> this<00:06:42.910> really

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300 
handle unit we now have this really

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.630 
handle unit we now have this really
really<00:06:43.450> compact<00:06:44.110> camera<00:06:44.620> that<00:06:45.010> can<00:06:45.190> still<00:06:45.460> get

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:45.640 
really compact camera that can still get

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.250 
really compact camera that can still get
reference<00:06:46.060> audio<00:06:46.300> when<00:06:46.780> you're<00:06:46.930> doing

reference audio when you're doing

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.230 
reference audio when you're doing
run-and-gun<00:06:47.740> and<00:06:48.130> maybe<00:06:48.700> when<00:06:48.940> you're<00:06:49.090> in<00:06:49.180> a

run-and-gun and maybe when you're in a
multicam<00:06:49.750> situation<00:06:50.440> so<00:06:51.160> in<00:06:51.660> situations

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050 
multicam situation so in situations

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.170 
multicam situation so in situations
where<00:06:53.139> you<00:06:53.379> might<00:06:53.590> be<00:06:53.770> doing<00:06:54.069> multicam<00:06:54.819> shoots

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:55.180 
where you might be doing multicam shoots

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.409 
multicam and in stock footage type
situations<00:07:23.740> so<00:07:24.460> one<00:07:24.699> last<00:07:24.940> thing<00:07:25.090> I<00:07:25.210> want<00:07:25.360> to

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:25.419 
situations so one last thing I want to

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:27.209 
situations so one last thing I want to
talk<00:07:25.569> about<00:07:25.719> before<00:07:26.050> we<00:07:26.289> jump<00:07:26.530> into<00:07:26.620> the<00:07:26.889> menus

00:07:27.209 --> 00:07:27.219 
talk about before we jump into the menus

00:07:27.219 --> 00:07:29.129 
talk about before we jump into the menus
with<00:07:27.400> the<00:07:27.430> camera<00:07:27.759> system<00:07:27.940> is<00:07:28.389> external

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:29.139 
with the camera system is external

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:32.760 
with the camera system is external
recording<00:07:29.620> and<00:07:29.979> with<00:07:30.370> this<00:07:30.580> new<00:07:31.080> digit<00:07:32.080> DV<00:07:32.469> 4

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:32.770 
recording and with this new digit DV 4

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:34.680 
recording and with this new digit DV 4
processor<00:07:33.370> which<00:07:33.969> is<00:07:34.000> improving<00:07:34.569> the

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:34.690 
processor which is improving the

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:36.420 
processor which is improving the
internal<00:07:35.259> recording<00:07:35.710> the<00:07:35.800> camera<00:07:36.099> we<00:07:36.310> can

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:36.430 
internal recording the camera we can

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.219 
internal recording the camera we can
also<00:07:36.580> take<00:07:36.819> advantage<00:07:36.940> of<00:07:37.389> it<00:07:37.539> using<00:07:37.900> this<00:07:37.990> 8

00:07:38.219 --> 00:07:38.229 
also take advantage of it using this 8

00:07:38.229 --> 00:07:41.490 
also take advantage of it using this 8
bit<00:07:38.379> 4<00:07:38.680> -<00:07:38.860> 2<00:07:39.270> external<00:07:40.270> recording<00:07:40.719> option<00:07:41.289> and

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:41.500 
bit 4 - 2 external recording option and

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.709 
bit 4 - 2 external recording option and
so<00:07:41.889> we<00:07:42.009> can<00:07:42.129> use<00:07:42.310> our<00:07:42.430> HDMI<00:07:43.000> out<00:07:43.180> and<00:07:43.449> we<00:07:43.569> can

00:07:43.709 --> 00:07:43.719 
so we can use our HDMI out and we can

00:07:43.719 --> 00:07:45.869 
so we can use our HDMI out and we can
use<00:07:44.020> in<00:07:44.289> this<00:07:44.409> case<00:07:44.620> a<00:07:44.680> really<00:07:45.099> small<00:07:45.550> external

00:07:45.869 --> 00:07:45.879 
use in this case a really small external

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:47.610 
use in this case a really small external
recorder<00:07:46.449> which<00:07:46.629> is<00:07:46.780> the<00:07:46.900> Atom<00:07:47.199> most<00:07:47.319> ninja

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:47.620 
recorder which is the Atom most ninja

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.860 
recorder which is the Atom most ninja
star<00:07:47.860> and<00:07:48.099> we<00:07:48.520> can<00:07:48.669> bypass<00:07:48.849> the<00:07:49.270> internal

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:49.870 
star and we can bypass the internal

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:52.110 
star and we can bypass the internal
codecs<00:07:50.349> we<00:07:50.800> can<00:07:50.919> go<00:07:51.009> to<00:07:51.069> higher<00:07:51.310> bit<00:07:51.580> rates<00:07:51.819> and

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:52.120 
codecs we can go to higher bit rates and

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.719 
codecs we can go to higher bit rates and
we<00:07:52.389> can<00:07:52.569> record<00:07:52.930> pro<00:07:53.289> res<00:07:53.530> externally<00:07:54.370> with

00:07:54.719 --> 00:07:54.729 
we can record pro res externally with

00:07:54.729 --> 00:07:56.459 
we can record pro res externally with
the<00:07:54.879> camera<00:07:55.240> so<00:07:55.659> that's<00:07:55.810> really<00:07:56.139> really

00:07:56.459 --> 00:07:56.469 
the camera so that's really really

00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:57.779 
the camera so that's really really
exciting<00:07:56.889> because<00:07:57.039> we<00:07:57.190> get<00:07:57.310> that<00:07:57.430> improved

00:07:57.779 --> 00:07:57.789 
exciting because we get that improved

00:07:57.789 --> 00:08:00.269 
exciting because we get that improved
color<00:07:58.029> we<00:07:58.750> get<00:07:58.870> the<00:07:59.020> reduced<00:07:59.380> Moray<00:07:59.800> the

00:08:00.269 --> 00:08:00.279 
color we get the reduced Moray the

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:02.129 
color we get the reduced Moray the
reduced<00:08:00.639> jaggies<00:08:01.180> all<00:08:01.449> of<00:08:01.599> the<00:08:01.719> things<00:08:01.930> that

00:08:02.129 --> 00:08:02.139 
reduced jaggies all of the things that

00:08:02.139 --> 00:08:04.529 
reduced jaggies all of the things that
the<00:08:02.229> digit<00:08:02.529> DV<00:08:02.860> 4<00:08:03.069> processor<00:08:03.580> gives<00:08:03.849> us<00:08:04.060> but

00:08:04.529 --> 00:08:04.539 
the digit DV 4 processor gives us but

00:08:04.539 --> 00:08:07.230 
the digit DV 4 processor gives us but
with<00:08:04.810> external<00:08:05.139> recording<00:08:05.740> as<00:08:05.889> well<00:08:06.029> so<00:08:07.029> now

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:07.240 
with external recording as well so now

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.939 
with external recording as well so now
it's<00:08:07.270> time<00:08:07.630> to<00:08:07.779> jump<00:08:07.990> into<00:08:08.169> the<00:08:08.380> internal

00:08:08.939 --> 00:08:08.949 
it's time to jump into the internal

00:08:08.949 --> 00:08:10.620 
it's time to jump into the internal
menus<00:08:09.340> and<00:08:09.550> take<00:08:09.789> a<00:08:09.819> look<00:08:10.060> at<00:08:10.180> some<00:08:10.360> of<00:08:10.389> those

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:10.630 
menus and take a look at some of those

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:14.400 
menus and take a look at some of those
new<00:08:10.900> features<00:08:10.930> so<00:08:11.770> let's<00:08:11.979> get<00:08:12.130> into<00:08:12.370> that
