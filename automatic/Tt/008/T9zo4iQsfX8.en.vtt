00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:14.549
 In this video I want to show you 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:18.270
 how to make a clutch on an ec engine 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.640
 mounted on it I use one like that 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.289
 called water pump pliers in this 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.920
 Case with a small plastic insert 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.080
 but is not necessary one 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:32.579
 screwdriver with about 2 mm wide 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:41.430
 and a cross key with 10 mm 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:46.610
 hexagon we are increasing here 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:50.280
 demonstration a new engine carbon 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:53.250
 long live clutch which consists of three 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:57.149
 Clutch baking a flywheel 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:02.550
 and three medium clutch springs 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:05.840
 For this we need the mother 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.260
 usually every year from his 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:14.700
 old engine still owns 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:19.680
 i have a grand slam here why 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.320
 motor and start with the assembly now 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.090
 The brass cone should be at the very back 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.210
 put it flush then we put the 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.979
 Mount the protective disk on it as 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.979
 very first mother 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.740
 be sure that the mother is on it 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.530
 each case minimal over the pins over it 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.780
 is that after running the bell free 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.549
 can 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:54.299
 very important that the mother really 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:58.560
 is firmly tightened 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:02.200
 Please not too tight not the clutch 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.759
 write or slice and 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.570
 The crankshaft should damage it 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:11.110
 enough you have to do something compassionate 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:15.700
 but that 's how the montage of the 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:19.840
 bakken takes place after we have checked 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.510
 in which direction the motor turns 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.660
 if he runs in this case it is like 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.739
 with almost all other engines too 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.640
 counterclockwise 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:32.650
 we are looking at the clutch cheek here 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.180
 now as a little fish 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.310
 it has the head and here the tail 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.860
 the swimming in this direction thus 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.370
 he should also ask for it after assembly 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.010
 turn around so she can open herself and 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.620
 can close again 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.070
 First, I set the small error 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.160
 on 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:55.440
 very important the long part here in 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:03:01.120
 this not in the near future part is in 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:03.400
 I put it on it first half way 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.160
 that the error already on the pin 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.769
 then I'll take one 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:13.480
 screwdriver and want here now 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:19.470
 simply that father over the press 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:22.930
 bug down and then very important 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:29.799
 that you are missing here in this well 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:35.319
 sits just we proceed to the second 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:41.230
 baking service principle 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:45.400
 overtake and now at the end of the 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:49.239
 third bake something trickier there 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:52.389
 now I'll be pretty tight hereby 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:57.000
 easy with my index finger the lot 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:04:01.200
 to overtake again 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:05.129
 suppress the error 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:12.989
 Zack pay attention that all three 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:12.989
 stuck and the clutch is mounted
