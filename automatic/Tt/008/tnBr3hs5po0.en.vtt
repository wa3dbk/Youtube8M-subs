00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.480 

then<00:05:02.710> we're<00:05:02.800> going<00:05:02.890> to<00:05:02.980> bring<00:05:03.070> it<00:05:03.190> around<00:05:03.280> the

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
then we're going to bring it around the

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.520 
then we're going to bring it around the
other<00:05:03.550> way<00:05:04.050> I'm<00:05:05.050> going<00:05:05.200> to<00:05:05.260> do<00:05:05.410> a<00:05:05.650> little<00:05:06.040> not

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
other way I'm going to do a little not

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:14.690 
other way I'm going to do a little not
right<00:05:08.530> at<00:05:08.680> the<00:05:08.800> edge<00:05:11.970> and<00:05:12.970> then<00:05:13.810> you<00:05:13.900> just<00:05:14.080> pull

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
right at the edge and then you just pull

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.440 
right at the edge and then you just pull
at<00:05:15.700> the<00:05:15.760> fabric<00:05:17.580> so<00:05:18.580> it<00:05:18.610> gets<00:05:18.760> bigger<00:05:19.090> and

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
at the fabric so it gets bigger and

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.500 
at the fabric so it gets bigger and
bigger<00:05:19.680> and<00:05:20.680> fuller<00:05:21.610> and<00:05:21.940> if<00:05:22.060> you<00:05:22.150> don't<00:05:22.330> want

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
bigger and fuller and if you don't want

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.670 
bigger and fuller and if you don't want
them<00:05:22.660> not<00:05:22.810> right<00:05:23.020> there<00:05:23.200> you<00:05:23.290> can<00:05:23.440> always

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
them not right there you can always

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.990 
them not right there you can always
twist<00:05:23.950> it<00:05:24.070> around<00:05:24.160> and<00:05:24.490> put<00:05:24.580> the<00:05:24.670> knot<00:05:24.820> in<00:05:24.940> the

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
twist it around and put the knot in the

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.520 
twist it around and put the knot in the
back<00:05:25.060> and<00:05:25.450> the<00:05:25.570> more<00:05:25.750> that<00:05:25.780> you<00:05:25.960> play<00:05:26.260> with<00:05:26.410> it

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
back and the more that you play with it

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.200 
back and the more that you play with it
you'll<00:05:26.650> never<00:05:26.830> get<00:05:27.010> it<00:05:27.040> the<00:05:27.460> same<00:05:27.730> way<00:05:27.970> each

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
you'll never get it the same way each

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.440 
you'll never get it the same way each
time<00:05:28.320> the<00:05:29.320> more<00:05:29.530> that<00:05:29.650> you<00:05:29.710> play<00:05:30.010> with<00:05:30.190> it<00:05:30.450> the

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
time the more that you play with it the

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.390 
time the more that you play with it the
drape<00:05:31.750> your<00:05:31.900> looks<00:05:32.320> and<00:05:32.560> the<00:05:32.710> fuller<00:05:32.950> looks

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
drape your looks and the fuller looks

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.820 
drape your looks and the fuller looks
now<00:05:33.910> this<00:05:34.060> works<00:05:34.360> great<00:05:34.720> with<00:05:34.930> a<00:05:35.170> higher<00:05:35.440> top

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
now this works great with a higher top

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.710 
now this works great with a higher top
so<00:05:36.040> that<00:05:36.100> you<00:05:36.250> really<00:05:36.550> don't<00:05:36.670> see<00:05:36.970> any<00:05:37.180> skin

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
so that you really don't see any skin

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.990 
so that you really don't see any skin
may<00:05:38.530> be<00:05:38.590> more<00:05:38.830> of<00:05:38.920> a<00:05:39.010> longer<00:05:39.250> sleeve<00:05:39.610> this<00:05:39.850> is

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
may be more of a longer sleeve this is

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.800 
may be more of a longer sleeve this is
more<00:05:40.210> for<00:05:40.420> cooler<00:05:41.380> weather<00:05:42.210> fall<00:05:43.210> going<00:05:43.540> into

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
more for cooler weather fall going into

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.410 
more for cooler weather fall going into
winter<00:05:44.850> another<00:05:45.850> way<00:05:46.030> to<00:05:46.060> tie<00:05:46.360> your<00:05:46.540> shawl<00:05:46.810> is

winter another way to tie your shawl is

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.590 
winter another way to tie your shawl is
to<00:05:49.420> loop<00:05:49.930> it<00:05:50.080> through<00:05:50.140> and<00:05:50.710> by<00:05:51.100> that<00:05:51.310> I<00:05:51.550> mean

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
to loop it through and by that I mean

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.970 
to loop it through and by that I mean
here's<00:05:52.600> the<00:05:52.780> loop<00:05:52.990> and<00:05:53.710> we're<00:05:53.830> actually

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:53.980 
here's the loop and we're actually

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.300 
here's the loop and we're actually
looping<00:05:54.460> the<00:05:54.580> fabric<00:05:55.030> through<00:05:56.100> and<00:05:57.100> then

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
looping the fabric through and then

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.300 
looping the fabric through and then
we're<00:05:57.460> going<00:05:57.550> to<00:05:57.610> take<00:05:57.910> one<00:05:58.950> and<00:05:59.950> we're<00:06:00.190> going

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
we're going to take one and we're going

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.520 
we're going to take one and we're going
to<00:06:00.340> loop<00:06:00.610> it<00:06:00.760> through<00:06:00.820> again<00:06:01.480> just<00:06:02.140> off<00:06:02.320> the

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:02.530 
to loop it through again just off the

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:09.360 
to loop it through again just off the
top<00:06:02.740> and<00:06:05.190> pull<00:06:06.190> it<00:06:06.370> and<00:06:06.520> then<00:06:07.090> tie<00:06:07.360> this<00:06:07.440> into<00:06:08.440> a

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
top and pull it and then tie this into a

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:11.970 
top and pull it and then tie this into a
little<00:06:09.640> not<00:06:10.440> so<00:06:11.440> you<00:06:11.530> have<00:06:11.650> a<00:06:11.680> really

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:11.980 
little not so you have a really

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.700 
little not so you have a really
intricate<00:06:12.520> knot<00:06:13.240> right<00:06:13.930> at<00:06:14.140> the<00:06:14.290> neck<00:06:14.500> and

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 
intricate knot right at the neck and

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.190 
intricate knot right at the neck and
it's<00:06:14.860> just<00:06:15.070> a<00:06:15.160> loop<00:06:15.370> through<00:06:15.640> with<00:06:16.090> a<00:06:16.120> knot<00:06:16.390> now

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.200 
it's just a loop through with a knot now

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.260 
it's just a loop through with a knot now
here's<00:06:17.440> a<00:06:17.500> really<00:06:17.800> fun<00:06:18.190> way<00:06:18.460> to<00:06:18.730> tie<00:06:19.090> your

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:24.600 
here's a really fun way to tie your
shawl<00:06:19.540> we're<00:06:20.500> going<00:06:20.710> to<00:06:20.860> open<00:06:21.070> it<00:06:21.310> up<00:06:21.460> and<00:06:23.610> at

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
shawl we're going to open it up and at

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.870 
shawl we're going to open it up and at
each<00:06:24.820> end<00:06:25.830> we're<00:06:26.830> going<00:06:27.010> to<00:06:27.190> make<00:06:27.340> a<00:06:27.520> knot

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 
each end we're going to make a knot

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:33.210 
each end we're going to make a knot
right<00:06:28.600> at<00:06:28.840> the<00:06:28.990> corner<00:06:30.480> just<00:06:31.480> like<00:06:31.660> that

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:33.220 
right at the corner just like that

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.820 
right at the corner just like that
then<00:06:33.910> at<00:06:34.030> the<00:06:34.150> other<00:06:34.180> end<00:06:34.600> we're<00:06:35.470> going<00:06:35.650> to

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:35.830 
then at the other end we're going to

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:42.460 
then at the other end we're going to
make<00:06:36.010> another<00:06:36.880> knot

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:42.470 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.970 

so<00:06:43.010> we<00:06:43.130> have<00:06:43.280> two<00:06:43.520> knots<00:06:43.730> at<00:06:44.030> the<00:06:44.360> end<00:06:44.980> then

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:45.980 
so we have two knots at the end then

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.710 
so we have two knots at the end then
we're<00:06:46.100> going<00:06:46.220> to<00:06:46.280> tie<00:06:46.550> it<00:06:46.610> right<00:06:47.240> around<00:06:47.480> her

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:47.720 
we're going to tie it right around her

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:54.430 
we're going to tie it right around her
neck

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:54.440 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.950 

so<00:06:55.070> in<00:06:55.190> the<00:06:55.280> back<00:06:55.460> it<00:06:56.150> looks<00:06:56.450> like<00:06:56.540> three

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.040 
so in the back it looks like three
pretty<00:06:57.230> little<00:06:57.470> nuts<00:06:57.680> so<00:06:58.610> now<00:06:58.760> you<00:06:58.820> have<00:06:59.050> the

this one is one of my favorites it's a

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.260 
this one is one of my favorites it's a
little<00:07:19.730> more<00:07:19.850> intricate<00:07:20.390> but<00:07:21.350> the<00:07:21.500> outcome<00:07:21.650> is
