00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
down because of how long my stop frame

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:39.250 
down because of how long my stop frame
is<00:04:31.460> so<00:04:32.270> I'm<00:04:32.330> just<00:04:32.450> going<00:04:32.570> to<00:04:32.630> extend<00:04:32.990> that<00:04:38.260> turn

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
is so I'm just going to extend that turn

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.460 
is so I'm just going to extend that turn
this<00:04:39.380> off<00:04:40.870> pull<00:04:41.870> this<00:04:41.960> over

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
this off pull this over

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.740 
this off pull this over
I<00:04:42.760> think<00:04:43.760> 250<00:04:44.720> is<00:04:44.780> okay<00:04:46.150> and<00:04:47.150> if<00:04:47.330> you<00:04:47.450> notice

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
I think 250 is okay and if you notice

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.510 
I think 250 is okay and if you notice
when<00:04:47.870> I<00:04:47.930> come<00:04:48.110> back<00:04:48.260> here<00:04:48.650> you<00:04:48.950> see<00:04:49.220> cropped

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
when I come back here you see cropped

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.880 
when I come back here you see cropped
off<00:04:49.700> right<00:04:50.090> where<00:04:50.330> sixty<00:04:50.840> was<00:04:51.020> that's

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
off right where sixty was that's

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.170 
off right where sixty was that's
something<00:04:52.190> you<00:04:52.250> need<00:04:52.340> to<00:04:52.460> be<00:04:52.550> careful<00:04:52.700> of<00:04:53.060> when

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
something you need to be careful of when

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.610 
something you need to be careful of when
the<00:04:53.270> importing<00:04:53.720> zone<00:04:53.990> you<00:04:54.170> have<00:04:54.320> to<00:04:54.440> make<00:04:54.590> sure

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
the importing zone you have to make sure

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.590 
the importing zone you have to make sure
that<00:04:54.920> your<00:04:55.130> time<00:04:55.760> line<00:04:55.970> is<00:04:56.150> long<00:04:56.300> enough<00:04:56.480> to

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
that your time line is long enough to

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.530 
that your time line is long enough to
support<00:04:57.110> it<00:04:57.230> so<00:04:57.760> what<00:04:58.760> I'm<00:04:58.910> going<00:04:59.120> to<00:04:59.210> have<00:04:59.360> to

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
support it so what I'm going to have to

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.380 
support it so what I'm going to have to
do<00:04:59.630> is<00:04:59.960> I'm<00:05:00.920> going<00:05:01.220> to<00:05:01.340> have<00:05:01.520> to<00:05:01.760> delete<00:05:02.270> this

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
do is I'm going to have to delete this

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:09.600 
do is I'm going to have to delete this
and<00:05:02.630> re-import<00:05:02.900> it<00:05:03.490> so<00:05:04.490> echo<00:05:05.270> file<00:05:06.340> import<00:05:07.660> so

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
and re-import it so echo file import so

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:19.420 
and re-import it so echo file import so
and<00:05:10.610> I<00:05:11.150> get<00:05:11.330> my<00:05:12.340> introduction<00:05:13.340> again<00:05:18.130> and<00:05:19.130> I'll

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
and I get my introduction again and I'll

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:24.490 
and I get my introduction again and I'll
also<00:05:19.610> extend<00:05:20.150> my<00:05:20.390> head<00:05:20.690> so<00:05:21.610> go<00:05:22.610> down<00:05:22.820> I<00:05:23.500> think

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
also extend my head so go down I think

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.680 
also extend my head so go down I think
that's<00:05:24.710> fine<00:05:24.920> enough<00:05:25.420> to<00:05:26.420> hear<00:05:27.020> 180<00:05:28.690> notice

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
that's fine enough to hear 180 notice

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:34.110 
that's fine enough to hear 180 notice
extend<00:05:30.080> my<00:05:30.170> frames<00:05:30.500> from<00:05:31.340> a<00:05:31.460> face<00:05:32.320> right<00:05:33.320> there

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
extend my frames from a face right there

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.910 
extend my frames from a face right there
doesn't<00:05:35.120> have<00:05:35.240> anything<00:05:35.450> so<00:05:35.840> I'm<00:05:36.770> really

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:36.920 
doesn't have anything so I'm really

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.030 
doesn't have anything so I'm really
extend<00:05:37.280> that<00:05:38.230> now<00:05:39.230> when<00:05:39.380> you<00:05:39.410> go<00:05:39.470> to<00:05:39.560> this<00:05:39.740> zone

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 
extend that now when you go to this zone

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.610 
extend that now when you go to this zone
you<00:05:40.280> can<00:05:40.520> go<00:05:41.030> right<00:05:41.510> click<00:05:41.750> it<00:05:41.900> and<00:05:42.140> go<00:05:42.530> to

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620 
you can go right click it and go to

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.610 
you can go right click it and go to
layer<00:05:42.890> properties<00:05:43.960> and<00:05:44.960> you<00:05:45.080> will<00:05:45.230> see<00:05:45.380> the

you<00:05:48.410> can<00:05:48.440> add<00:05:48.680> more<00:05:48.980> but<00:05:49.220> these<00:05:49.340> are<00:05:49.400> the<00:05:49.760> ones

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
you can add more but these are the ones

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.810 
you can add more but these are the ones
that<00:05:50.030> your<00:05:50.330> soul<00:05:50.690> will<00:05:51.410> will<00:05:52.070> be<00:05:52.100> used<00:05:52.490> when

your animal dies so and you'd have to

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:56.860 
your animal dies so and you'd have to
draw<00:05:55.250> these<00:05:55.430> yourself<00:05:55.910> so<00:05:56.450> you<00:05:56.540> can<00:05:56.690> draw<00:05:56.840> your

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
draw these yourself so you can draw your

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.890 
draw these yourself so you can draw your
own<00:05:57.020> custom<00:05:57.440> lips<00:05:57.680> and<00:05:58.360> you<00:05:59.360> can<00:05:59.480> also<00:05:59.630> make

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
own custom lips and you can also make

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.930 
own custom lips and you can also make
other<00:06:00.080> lip<00:06:00.290> positions<00:06:00.770> say<00:06:01.160> for<00:06:01.520> example<00:06:01.880> if

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:01.940 
other lip positions say for example if

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:03.760 
other lip positions say for example if
you<00:06:02.000> want<00:06:02.180> to<00:06:02.240> use<00:06:02.360> someone<00:06:02.900> used<00:06:03.110> saying<00:06:03.440> L

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
you want to use someone used saying L

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.580 
you want to use someone used saying L
and<00:06:04.100> you'd<00:06:05.000> have<00:06:05.150> the<00:06:05.270> tongue<00:06:05.510> falling<00:06:06.350> back

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
and you'd have the tongue falling back

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.250 
and you'd have the tongue falling back
into<00:06:06.890> the<00:06:07.130> mouth<00:06:07.310> so<00:06:08.270> this<00:06:08.600> isn't<00:06:08.780> here<00:06:09.110> but

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260 
into the mouth so this isn't here but

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.590 
into the mouth so this isn't here but
you<00:06:09.380> can<00:06:09.560> add<00:06:10.400> your<00:06:10.580> own<00:06:10.640> and

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.450 
we'll get into it so I'm going to draw

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:18.580 
we'll get into it so I'm going to draw
ABCD<00:06:15.080> efg<00:06:15.190> and<00:06:16.190> X<00:06:16.870> X<00:06:17.870> is<00:06:18.020> when<00:06:18.230> there<00:06:18.500> is<00:06:18.530> no

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
ABCD efg and X X is when there is no
