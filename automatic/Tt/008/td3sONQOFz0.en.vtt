their own hips as well the risk factor

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.650 
their own hips as well the risk factor
of<00:03:44.850> Tai<00:03:45.570> Chi<00:03:45.600> from<00:03:46.410> my<00:03:46.650> observation<00:03:47.459> is<00:03:47.700> very

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
of Tai Chi from my observation is very

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.210 
of Tai Chi from my observation is very
very<00:03:49.170> low<00:03:50.480> yoga<00:03:51.480> on<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:51.840> other<00:03:51.930> hand<00:03:52.290> I've

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
very low yoga on the other hand I've

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.810 
very low yoga on the other hand I've
seen<00:03:53.550> like<00:03:54.330> I<00:03:54.480> already<00:03:54.930> said<00:03:55.200> buff<00:03:55.820> well

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
seen like I already said buff well

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.540 
seen like I already said buff well
students<00:03:57.600> and<00:03:57.750> teachers<00:03:58.380> have<00:03:58.680> been<00:03:59.010> injured

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
students and teachers have been injured

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.410 
students and teachers have been injured
so<00:04:00.180> I<00:04:00.570> would<00:04:00.870> say<00:04:01.050> the<00:04:01.230> respecter<00:04:01.860> of<00:04:02.360> yoga<00:04:03.360> is

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
so I would say the respecter of yoga is

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.110 
so I would say the respecter of yoga is
a<00:04:03.510> little<00:04:03.750> bit<00:04:03.900> higher<00:04:04.140> than<00:04:04.500> Tai<00:04:04.739> Chi<00:04:05.130> however

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
a little bit higher than Tai Chi however

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.309 
a little bit higher than Tai Chi however
again<00:04:06.480> I'm

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
again I'm

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.360 
again I'm
a<00:04:07.379> Tai<00:04:08.249> Chi<00:04:08.640> and<00:04:08.909> yoga<00:04:09.269> instructor<00:04:10.170> and<00:04:10.370> I

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
a Tai Chi and yoga instructor and I

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.970 
a Tai Chi and yoga instructor and I
believe<00:04:11.819> in<00:04:12.030> teaching<00:04:12.239> a<00:04:12.689> way<00:04:12.870> that<00:04:13.319> my

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
believe in teaching a way that my

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.759 
believe in teaching a way that my
students<00:04:14.519> cannot<00:04:14.939> get<00:04:15.209> injured<00:04:15.780> so<00:04:16.019> the

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
students cannot get injured so the

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.009 
students cannot get injured so the
injury<00:04:17.100> factors<00:04:17.549> very<00:04:17.850> low<00:04:18.120> for<00:04:18.539> my<00:04:18.690> classes

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
injury factors very low for my classes

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.770 
injury factors very low for my classes
and<00:04:19.970> now<00:04:20.970> for<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.720> purpose<00:04:22.289> of<00:04:22.590> both<00:04:23.430> Tai<00:04:24.419> Chi

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
and now for the purpose of both Tai Chi

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.420 
and now for the purpose of both Tai Chi
and<00:04:25.080> yoga<00:04:26.030> tai<00:04:27.030> chi<00:04:27.530> original<00:04:28.530> purpose<00:04:29.130> was

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
and yoga tai chi original purpose was

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.900 
and yoga tai chi original purpose was
actually<00:04:30.419> in<00:04:30.570> China<00:04:30.840> to<00:04:31.229> teach<00:04:31.770> people<00:04:32.490> how<00:04:32.880> to

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
actually in China to teach people how to

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.810 
actually in China to teach people how to
fight<00:04:33.419> without<00:04:34.259> being<00:04:34.770> trouble<00:04:35.310> from<00:04:35.699> the

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
fight without being trouble from the

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.400 
fight without being trouble from the
government<00:04:36.360> and<00:04:37.520> yoga's<00:04:38.599> original<00:04:39.599> and<00:04:39.870> still

government and yoga's original and still

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.260 
government and yoga's original and still
I<00:04:40.919> would<00:04:41.220> say<00:04:41.720> purpose<00:04:42.720> of<00:04:43.050> yoga<00:04:43.289> is<00:04:44.070> not<00:04:44.460> the

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
I would say purpose of yoga is not the

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.020 
I would say purpose of yoga is not the
benefit<00:04:45.750> of<00:04:45.930> flexibility<00:04:46.830> and<00:04:47.130> range<00:04:47.400> motion

benefit of flexibility and range motion

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.400 
benefit of flexibility and range motion
even<00:04:48.780> though

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410
