00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 good friends of the channel I am 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.170
 encourages that and we are today in another chapter 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.120
 of competes champions as you know the 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.550
 counter ping does not influence that you go to 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.679
 win the game yes or yes but it gives you a 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.929
 small advantage over your good rival 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.340
 let's start, let's talk about 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.140
 first champion that is because as you know 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.090
 because he is a carrie character 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.050
 pretty good quite comfortable is to say 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.820
 powerful not because of the issue of hurting 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.199
 true while it 's hitting but 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.539
 first I will speak who can tell 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.250
 and what a hayling cut will do is one of 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.260
 the best options there are for the subject 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.030
 of the range it has and the stamina that 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.030
 has in line with the traps being given 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.350
 safety in the lane as you know 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.360
 also Caijing has also an escape 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.280
 good with the network and its definitive is very 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.250
 good to try that when you touch it 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.560
 Escape to hook it and to kill it 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.060
 then we go with driver driver is more or 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.010
 less of the same driver his character 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.840
 that with the bonus q the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.720
 strength bonus you earn is very 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.630
 very powerful this makes it give an advantage 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.120
 because quite strong and also according to 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:05.970
 how are driver positions usually win 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.920
 the combats of one's bot against 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.410
 one or two against two then we talk about 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.450
 how code mount gains a small advantage 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:15.750
 on any for the subject of the 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.610
 spit the attack in distance and 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.550
 also the speed passive attack that 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.050
 get 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.820
 now let's talk about the points 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.650
 strong because it 's very good 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.090
 fighting against 20 because well if it's 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.040
 true that it is a character of the beats that 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.140
 there is very powerful but cork and in the ellis 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.000
 and more or less of my game can 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.500
 karabin without any problem doing that 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.120
 in the game she stays shorter 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.550
 what cut on the skin 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.350
 then we have the theme of istana tristana 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.970
 is a very good carrie character but 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.500
 listening against a conquered and left 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.120
 quite short since any one deduces 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.310
 armor does a lot of damage and can 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.470
 harass a lot your rival with the cv besides 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.910
 In short, it makes Cristina have 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.550
 that move too much and do not let him 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.650
 disease is real is a pretty case 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.450
 complex you know that a real is one of the 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.880
 more powerful powerful rails there are 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.770
 no but I want to add one thing is real 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.230
 it's a pretty good lane but because 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.690
 can with him because he can harm him 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.330
 which has because on very high basis the 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.610
 Passive is very good meta gets me ar 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.500
 with the e makes it real I can not 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.000
 endure both the damage and in case of 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.560
 that you have to continue harassing the 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.830
 enemy with the rockets you finish 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.540
 knocking him down 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.640
 now let's talk about feel champion 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.950
 which is fit first we will talk about that 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.200
 champion can do is the pine suppose 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.350
 we started by other important root 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.960
 because rise offers madness but rice 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.880
 has a lot of endurance is a champion that 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.370
 many experiences besides that their 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.850
 unique vision is to say aw fuck a lot 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.590
 to fit and the cv gives you enough problems 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.330
 when in addition to definitive root does 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.100
 that endures even more it fights the 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.290
 spell destruction then we have 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.180
 love of mordecai caisse I know because we 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.090
 you leave in a one against one is very good 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.310
 with the one that crushes you with the &amp; is 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.500
 harassing from a distance his definitive can 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.570
 give you the problems that you always have 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.709
 I also want to tell you that we have to 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.810
 caix is ​​a character that has a lot 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.850
 survival thanks to your shield there 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.160
 that more or less the same here nor is it a 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.510
 very powerful killer character in addition to 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.730
 that when he comes to you with the one that makes you 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.680
 sea ​​that does a lot of damage to you 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.330
 has a pretty important thing that 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.370
 its definitive, not its definitive, gives you a 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.200
 kick and can give you even three before 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.120
 that you run away now we're going to 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.650
 talk about 5 asks you to free beat as your 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.840
 Very fast movement character and 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.750
 pretty strong is a perfect with 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.070
 titanic 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.770
 in terms of skills and 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.750
 trying to make the fit combo is not going to 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.550
 leave if you are a character with so much 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.410
 mobility that relieves does not have many 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.090
 hopes of winning you cart is more or 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.440
 less the same thing repeat a repeat 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.540
 counter pindó significant that it is worth 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.610
 to win but cards is a character 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.290
 that if it is true has its wall has 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.840
 his aura of the ground just in case feat 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.850
 I fell close but I was hitting the combo 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.250
 and you can escape without any problem 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.140
 of sk tur plus the definitive one can be 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.830
 cancel if you pick up the stick right on the 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:56.350
 moment he is going to throw you requiem then 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.060
 the last one is gaga dredges with some 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.010
 analysis and others that do not but you see a 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.380
 thing is a character that is true very 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.090
 very strong with your kite can be 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.570
 fucking but I repeat the same thing 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:10.810
 from before fit has a lot of movement fit 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:14.470
 can avoid a lot of damage of bleachers can 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.850
 harass you add more than him to him and he is one 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.340
 of the perfect points of the gib against 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.810
 he now we talk about the last champion not 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.489
 of this concept chapter of 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.720
 champions that is the 'bund' we are going to 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.889
 speak first who against you who 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.020
 alarman 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.449
 and arben can be counter- punched worth 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.310
 rightly yorick I'm not me you're a 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:31.569
 character that can make you have 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.099
 a lot of stamina on the line above 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:35.439
 thanks to its harbinger of hunger and 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:37.509
 slayer and it also has a lot of damage 

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:40.270
 compared harvard galván usually stays 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:42.069
 very short in the fight against jolie not 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.719
 means then open the two with triple 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:45.370
 champion is that you're going to win the one 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:47.319
 you're going to lose 100% but you have the 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.229
 weakness and you have a greater difficulty 

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:51.400
 fight against this character we talk 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.439
 also wish that more or less the same 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.419
 always a lot of endurance is a character 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:58.150
 that has a lot of survival besides 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:59.620
 with his I put cure against the rivals is 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.599
 say that the one that hits with the brand is 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.819
 is generating and this makes you have 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:06.310
 enough complications to beat him 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:09.669
 Darius is a character as you know 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.349
 quite destructive very harmful and albany 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:14.349
 and it costs a lot to win the one against 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:16.839
 one up as you know already arman can 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:19.750
 beat him but darío is usually one of the 

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:21.490
 best counter peak against grass 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.570
 now let's say who is strong and 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.570
 armand is to say who can count 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.250
 perfectly sorry vladimir for the 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.260
 the issue of what you need is your own life 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.820
 to cast the spells besides that 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.980
 they already arm their character with their spear 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.990
 are wearing your enemies in cases 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.750
 you raise your flag you get hooked 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.950
 of run w do not let him escape to 2000 and 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.010
 if the pool of blood is made in a 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.620
 ends strips by the king in plan 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.750
 powerful highs on top and we finish it 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:51.310
 then we talk mashing theme 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.410
 wave you make a character it's true that 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.820
 does a lot of damage slows you down a lot 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.890
 the hammer and it hits you true damage 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.419
 but they already have a lot of stamina 

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:02.710
 a very powerful passive as to 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:05.200
 hold waves and kill yale is pretty 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:06.340
 controversial not the subject of that says a lot 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.169
 people who can against any 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.610
 But in the top but they are already in one of 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:12.400
 the country the case for the next 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.500
 reason already keeps a lot of reference 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.870
 the national flag supports a lot in the 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.010
 combat against the 6 has a stand that 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.690
 lifts it 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.669
 even in case of emergency there was 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.440
 I repeated you can throw the final and 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:25.750
 albany usually does much more damage 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.330
 james you want to find go remember that 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.880
 maintains a powerful passive that makes 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:34.150
 jay but easily removed again 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.770
 repeat that according to also the player and 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:38.229
 a control watching means that you go to 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.640
 earn 100 percent good friends of the 

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:40.960
 channel I hope you liked this

 conte chapter calls for champions 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.140
 Remember the law if you want to help 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.060
