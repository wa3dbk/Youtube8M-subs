actual new rules on most of the face
rather<00:00:22.439> than<00:00:22.590> markers<00:00:23.130> for<00:00:23.930> $38<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:24.960> have<00:00:25.199> to

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
rather than markers for $38 I have to

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.390 
rather than markers for $38 I have to
say<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.680> this<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:25.920> probably<00:00:26.160> one<00:00:26.279> of<00:00:26.310> the

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
say that this is probably one of the

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.189 
say that this is probably one of the
best<00:00:27.470> values<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.830> can<00:00:29.010> find<00:00:29.840> the<00:00:30.840> only<00:00:31.050> other

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
best values you can find the only other

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.850 
best values you can find the only other
value<00:00:31.529> would<00:00:31.650> be<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.980> casio<00:00:32.579> DW<00:00:33.030> 5600<00:00:33.899> for<00:00:34.079> 39

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
value would be the casio DW 5600 for 39
