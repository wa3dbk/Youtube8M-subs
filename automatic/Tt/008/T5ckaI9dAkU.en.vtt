00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.809
 hello I'm doing tests with my new 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.059
 camera and the images are not quite 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.130
 good but everything will come we go with this 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.350
 Chicken recipe with almond that I eat 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.940
 you will see is not the Chinese recipe although the 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.070
 I prepare in a wok the first thing we go to 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.720
 to do is peel garlic cloves and 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.430
 we put to fry in a good stream of 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.430
 olive oil next to the almonds 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.830
 while they are fried we are going to chop the 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.220
 chicken breast first we remove the 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.220
 sirloin 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.579
 we open it in half 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.620
 We cut into strips and finally the 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.969
 we pepper and when the almonds have 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.969
 we picked color we added 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.170
 we sautÃ© and we leave it frei and on the other 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.330
 side how are we going to accompany after 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.160
 white rice because we put water in a 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.830
 saucepan to boil we add the rice and 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.750
 we left there about 18 minutes or so to me 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.370
 I like that the vegetables are 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.910
 but this is also a question 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.910
 of tastes 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.180
 so when the chicken is at its point 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.950
 add the onion cut in julienne and 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.220
 the green pepper also cut in 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.220
 strips 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.210
 we pepper 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.650
 we sautÃ©ed them and as I told you if 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.240
 like al dente you get it right away and if 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.240
 do not leave it a little more 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.650
 the rice is ready we drain 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.420
 and how we want to present it by giving it 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.410
 way we make a small goal we use it 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.410
 of olive oil 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.420
 we add the rice and so when 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.420
 we pour becomes detached 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.840
 and 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.370
 and now it only remains to add the chicken with 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.440
 almonds and ready 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.760
 very simple and very rich but that I have 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.760
 liked a hug until then
