this weekend
last<00:00:20.090> week<00:00:20.419> I<00:00:20.599> decided<00:00:20.869> to<00:00:21.700> try<00:00:22.700> the<00:00:22.759> curly

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
last week I decided to try the curly

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.210 
last week I decided to try the curly
girl<00:00:23.300> method<00:00:23.360> see<00:00:23.990> if<00:00:24.050> it<00:00:24.200> works<00:00:24.470> to<00:00:24.710> define<00:00:25.039> my

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
girl method see if it works to define my

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.750 
girl method see if it works to define my
curls<00:00:25.520> my<00:00:26.119> curl<00:00:26.510> pattern<00:00:26.930> is<00:00:27.500> just<00:00:28.460> like

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
curls my curl pattern is just like

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.960 
curls my curl pattern is just like
non-existent<00:00:29.689> at<00:00:29.779> this<00:00:29.929> point<00:00:30.550> so<00:00:31.550> I<00:00:31.580> have<00:00:31.849> to

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
non-existent at this point so I have to

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.640 
non-existent at this point so I have to
continue<00:00:32.239> to<00:00:32.419> do<00:00:32.689> twist<00:00:32.989> outs<00:00:33.199> and<00:00:33.470> things

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
continue to do twist outs and things

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.110 
continue to do twist outs and things
like<00:00:33.769> that<00:00:33.830> I<00:00:33.980> think<00:00:34.129> because<00:00:34.640> I<00:00:34.670> did<00:00:34.879> a<00:00:34.910> lot<00:00:35.090> of

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
like that I think because I did a lot of

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.640 
like that I think because I did a lot of
bantu<00:00:35.660> knots<00:00:36.280> when<00:00:37.280> I<00:00:37.309> was<00:00:37.870> you<00:00:38.870> know<00:00:38.900> going

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:39.650 
bantu knots when I was you know going

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.310 
bantu knots when I was you know going
from<00:00:39.830> really<00:00:40.519> short<00:00:40.760> hair<00:00:41.000> to<00:00:41.570> what<00:00:42.110> I<00:00:42.140> have

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
from really short hair to what I have

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.340 
from really short hair to what I have
right<00:00:42.500> now<00:00:42.559> so<00:00:42.949> maybe<00:00:43.790> that<00:00:44.110> stretching<00:00:45.110> may

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
right now so maybe that stretching may

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.020 
right now so maybe that stretching may
have<00:00:45.530> like<00:00:45.739> messed<00:00:46.070> up<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:46.400> wave<00:00:46.580> and<00:00:46.940> all

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
have like messed up the wave and all

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.710 
have like messed up the wave and all
that<00:00:47.239> my<00:00:47.479> hair<00:00:47.659> is<00:00:47.750> pretty<00:00:47.930> much<00:00:48.140> wavy<00:00:48.979> and<00:00:49.720> all

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.720 
that my hair is pretty much wavy and all

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.869 
that my hair is pretty much wavy and all
of<00:00:50.900> that<00:00:51.049> is<00:00:51.199> just<00:00:51.229> gone<00:00:51.619> so<00:00:52.250> there's<00:00:52.460> a<00:00:52.580> few

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
of that is just gone so there's a few

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:54.759 
of that is just gone so there's a few
strands<00:00:53.299> that<00:00:53.570> are<00:00:53.629> wavy<00:00:53.900> here<00:00:54.170> and<00:00:54.290> there<00:00:54.409> but

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
strands that are wavy here and there but

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:57.100 
strands that are wavy here and there but
for<00:00:55.129> the<00:00:55.549> most<00:00:55.580> part<00:00:56.030> my<00:00:56.239> hair<00:00:56.449> is<00:00:56.629> pretty

for the most part my hair is pretty
straight<00:00:57.680> even<00:00:58.250> after<00:00:58.519> I<00:00:58.549> wash<00:00:58.820> it<00:00:58.900> so<00:00:59.900> I

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
straight even after I wash it so I

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.689 
straight even after I wash it so I
decided<00:01:00.680> to<00:01:00.799> go<00:01:00.920> with<00:01:01.159> the<00:01:01.250> curly<00:01:01.519> girl<00:01:01.670> method

decided to go with the curly girl method

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.939 
decided to go with the curly girl method
hopefully<00:01:02.299> it<00:01:02.390> can<00:01:02.479> help<00:01:02.689> define<00:01:02.960> my<00:01:03.290> curls<00:01:03.559> my

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
great expectations video and I think I

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.750 
great expectations video and I think I
left<00:04:29.180> it<00:04:29.330> on<00:04:29.450> for<00:04:29.510> maybe<00:04:29.930> like<00:04:32.020> I<00:04:33.020> think<00:04:33.470> like

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
left it on for maybe like I think like

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.330 
left it on for maybe like I think like
20-30<00:04:34.760> minutes<00:04:34.970> or<00:04:35.210> so

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
20-30 minutes or so

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.580 
20-30 minutes or so
and<00:04:36.580> it<00:04:36.760> after<00:04:37.180> I<00:04:37.210> rinsed<00:04:37.630> my<00:04:37.720> hair<00:04:38.020> out<00:04:38.050> with

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
and it after I rinsed my hair out with

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.570 
and it after I rinsed my hair out with
cool<00:04:38.889> water

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
cool water

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.760 
cool water
I<00:04:39.610> did<00:04:40.150> try<00:04:40.360> that<00:04:40.570> and<00:04:40.720> it<00:04:40.780> felt<00:04:41.050> amazing<00:04:41.139> so

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
I did try that and it felt amazing so

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.080 
I did try that and it felt amazing so
maybe<00:04:41.920> it's<00:04:42.040> like<00:04:42.100> the<00:04:42.250> silicones<00:04:42.730> in<00:04:42.910> this

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
maybe it's like the silicones in this

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.990 
maybe it's like the silicones in this
like<00:04:43.750> the<00:04:44.260> cool<00:04:44.500> water<00:04:44.740> does<00:04:45.010> not<00:04:45.190> like<00:04:45.460> that

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
like the cool water does not like that

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.540 
like the cool water does not like that
the<00:04:46.330> silicones<00:04:46.810> but<00:04:47.650> when<00:04:47.950> I<00:04:47.980> rest<00:04:48.220> my<00:04:48.340> hair<00:04:48.520> I

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
the silicones but when I rest my hair I

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.379 
the silicones but when I rest my hair I
with<00:04:48.760> this<00:04:48.940> with<00:04:49.240> cool<00:04:49.450> water<00:04:49.600> it<00:04:50.080> was<00:04:50.200> fine<00:04:50.440> so

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
with this with cool water it was fine so

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.730 
with this with cool water it was fine so
maybe<00:04:52.389> that's<00:04:52.570> what<00:04:52.810> the<00:04:53.080> issue<00:04:53.230> was<00:04:53.500> before

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:53.740 
maybe that's what the issue was before

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.460 
maybe that's what the issue was before
