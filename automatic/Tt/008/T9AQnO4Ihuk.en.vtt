different from when I was playing and
back<00:02:29.380> then<00:02:29.920> because<00:02:30.040> you<00:02:30.600> different<00:02:31.600> stadiums

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
back then because you different stadiums

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
pictures you plan on there's not really

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.250 
pictures you plan on there's not really
a<00:02:40.240> bad<00:02:40.390> pitch<00:02:40.570> to<00:02:40.720> go<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:40.900> play<00:02:40.959> on<00:02:41.050> there's

work<00:03:09.400> I<00:03:09.550> think<00:03:09.730> that<00:03:09.850> togetherness<00:03:10.269> is<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:10.540> team

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
work I think that togetherness is a team

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.420 
work I think that togetherness is a team
to<00:03:10.930> go<00:03:11.050> out<00:03:11.170> and<00:03:11.320> whether<00:03:11.890> it<00:03:12.010> were<00:03:12.130> a<00:03:12.160> home

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
to go out and whether it were a home

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.670 
to go out and whether it were a home
were<00:03:12.519> away<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:12.820> win<00:03:13.330> games<00:03:13.570> can<00:03:14.440> you<00:03:14.560> miss<00:03:14.650> a

slight<00:03:14.920> insight<00:03:15.190> into<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.580> philosophy<00:03:15.790> you

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
slight insight into the philosophy you

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.640

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.620 
Hughton left and of course Neil Adam
took<00:03:21.370> over<00:03:21.550> is<00:03:21.970> that<00:03:22.120> something<00:03:22.450> that<00:03:22.480> is

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
took over is that something that is

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.970 
took over is that something that is
likely<00:03:22.930> to<00:03:23.050> continue<00:03:23.350> can<00:03:23.620> you<00:03:23.680> give<00:03:23.800> us<00:03:23.890> an

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
likely to continue can you give us an

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.650 
likely to continue can you give us an
insight<00:03:24.190> into<00:03:24.220> just<00:03:24.550> how<00:03:24.760> you<00:03:25.330> think<00:03:25.600> this

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
insight into just how you think this

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.960
