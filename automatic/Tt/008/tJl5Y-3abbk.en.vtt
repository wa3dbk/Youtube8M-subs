00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.270 

CPU<00:01:12.710> installed<00:01:13.100> this<00:01:13.790> is<00:01:14.000> the<00:01:14.240> stock<00:01:15.280> cookware

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280

CPU installed this is the stock cookware
that<00:01:16.310> comes<00:01:16.610> with<00:01:16.820> it<00:01:18.190> I've<00:01:19.190> heard<00:01:19.430> it's<00:01:19.580> a

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
that comes with it I've heard it's a

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.900 
that comes with it I've heard it's a
real<00:01:20.140> fight<00:01:21.140> to<00:01:21.290> put<00:01:21.470> this<00:01:21.620> on<00:01:21.830> so<00:01:22.220> we'll<00:01:22.670> find

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
real fight to put this on so we'll find

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.350 
real fight to put this on so we'll find
out<00:01:23.120> so<00:01:23.990> you<00:01:24.050> snap<00:01:24.440> that<00:01:24.710> one<00:01:24.860> on<00:01:25.120> and<00:01:26.120> then<00:01:26.210> you

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
out so you snap that one on and then you

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.770 
out so you snap that one on and then you
just<00:01:26.540> push<00:01:26.810> this<00:01:27.020> one<00:01:27.170> down<00:01:27.410> on<00:01:28.450> and<00:01:29.450> then<00:01:29.630> you

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
just push this one down on and then you

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.270 
just push this one down on and then you
should<00:01:30.020> flick<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:30.470> lever<00:01:30.650> to<00:01:30.890> tighten<00:01:31.190> them

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
should flick the lever to tighten them

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.280 
should flick the lever to tighten them
all<00:01:31.400> down

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
all down

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:47.250 
all down
it<00:01:33.290> is<00:01:33.410> very<00:01:33.740> snug

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.080 

and<00:01:48.260> that's<00:01:48.500> it<00:01:48.799> that<00:01:49.460> was<00:01:49.490> easy

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090 
and that's it that was easy

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.090 
and that's it that was easy
after<00:01:50.479> you<00:01:50.600> get<00:01:51.200> that<00:01:51.380> on<00:01:51.560> there<00:01:51.799> plug<00:01:52.010> your

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
after you get that on there plug your

00:01:52.100 --> 00:02:00.609 
after you get that on there plug your
CPU<00:01:52.520> fan<00:01:52.760> in<00:01:57.310> Ione<00:01:58.310> body<00:01:58.550> but<00:01:58.940> gigabytes<00:01:59.619> to

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
CPU fan in Ione body but gigabytes to

CPU fan in Ione body but gigabytes to
four<00:02:00.830> gig<00:02:01.009> sticks<00:02:04.840> nice<00:02:05.840> one

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.810 

there's<00:02:14.700> two<00:02:15.650> this<00:02:16.650> is<00:02:16.710> my<00:02:16.950> fairly<00:02:17.370> nice<00:02:17.520> power

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
there's two this is my fairly nice power

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.110 
there's two this is my fairly nice power
supply<00:02:18.180> it's<00:02:18.690> not<00:02:18.990> modular<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.670> thought<00:02:20.910> it

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
supply it's not modular and I thought it

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.270 
supply it's not modular and I thought it
was<00:02:21.420> at<00:02:21.600> first<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.290> guess<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.650> forgot<00:02:22.800> when<00:02:23.250> I

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
was at first and I guess I forgot when I

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.960 
was at first and I guess I forgot when I
ordered<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:23.760> but<00:02:23.970> it's<00:02:24.570> still<00:02:24.690> really<00:02:25.020> nice

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
ordered it but it's still really nice

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.730 
ordered it but it's still really nice
plenty<00:02:26.970> of<00:02:27.060> cables<00:02:27.480> I<00:02:27.600> mean<00:02:27.720> goodness<00:02:27.960> I<00:02:28.410> can

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
plenty of cables I mean goodness I can

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.130 
plenty of cables I mean goodness I can
plug<00:02:28.950> everything<00:02:29.220> I<00:02:29.460> wanted<00:02:29.780> this<00:02:30.780> is<00:02:30.990> your

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
plug everything I wanted this is your

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.100 
plug everything I wanted this is your
power<00:02:31.350> this<00:02:32.130> is<00:02:32.310> 20<00:02:32.640> this<00:02:32.850> is<00:02:32.910> plus<00:02:33.300> 4<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:33.840> this

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
power this is 20 this is plus 4 and this

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.620 
power this is 20 this is plus 4 and this
board<00:02:34.380> is<00:02:35.120> 24<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:36.720> they<00:02:36.840> go<00:02:36.990> together<00:02:37.140> like<00:02:37.560> I

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
board is 24 so they go together like I

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.360 
board is 24 so they go together like I
also<00:02:39.630> heard<00:02:39.960> that<00:02:40.260> sometimes<00:02:40.710> this<00:02:41.130> is<00:02:41.340> a

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
also heard that sometimes this is a

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:49.880 
also heard that sometimes this is a
painting<00:02:42.030> about<00:02:48.200> that<00:02:49.200> was<00:02:49.350> nice

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
painting about that was nice

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.570 
painting about that was nice
is<00:02:50.430> it<00:02:50.580> a<00:02:50.670> 4<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.630> 4<00:02:51.930> pin<00:02:52.170> CPU<00:02:52.709> connector<00:02:53.310> for<00:02:53.490> this

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
is it a 4 a 4 pin CPU connector for this

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.260
