it's<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.440> bone<00:02:49.590> stock<00:02:54.230> batteries<00:02:55.230> in<00:02:55.380> good

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
it's a bone stock batteries in good

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.140 
it's a bone stock batteries in good
shape<00:02:55.710> I<00:02:55.950> believe<00:02:58.130> it's<00:02:59.130> got<00:02:59.280> all<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.520> plastic

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
shape I believe it's got all the plastic

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:07.010 
shape I believe it's got all the plastic
regular<00:03:00.690> air<00:03:00.840> filter<00:03:04.460> the<00:03:05.460> body<00:03:05.670> is<00:03:06.020> almost

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
regular air filter the body is almost

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.540 
regular air filter the body is almost
perfect<00:03:07.620> I<00:03:07.890> mean<00:03:08.760> for<00:03:08.970> 2004<00:03:09.680> with<00:03:10.680> this<00:03:10.860> I<00:03:11.160> mean

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
perfect I mean for 2004 with this I mean

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.500 
perfect I mean for 2004 with this I mean
it<00:03:11.640> has<00:03:11.820> hardly<00:03:12.540> any<00:03:12.660> rust<00:03:13.140> I<00:03:13.350> just<00:03:13.560> did<00:03:13.710> some

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
it has hardly any rust I just did some

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.390 
it has hardly any rust I just did some
sanding<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.630> painting<00:03:15.870> today<00:03:16.260> did<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.220> wheel

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
sanding and painting today did the wheel

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.100 
sanding and painting today did the wheel
wells<00:03:17.670> I<00:03:18.030> don't<00:03:18.240> know<00:03:18.330> if<00:03:18.420> you<00:03:18.480> can<00:03:18.630> see<00:03:18.840> very

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
wells I don't know if you can see very

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.430 
wells I don't know if you can see very
well<00:03:20.270> and<00:03:21.270> then<00:03:21.420> I<00:03:21.540> did<00:03:21.750> some<00:03:22.020> of<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.200> frame

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
well and then I did some of the frame

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.340 
well and then I did some of the frame
but<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.680> rockers<00:03:23.190> are<00:03:24.060> almost<00:03:24.450> spotless<00:03:24.900> I

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
but the rockers are almost spotless I

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.710 
but the rockers are almost spotless I
mean<00:03:25.530> it's<00:03:25.680> amazing<00:03:26.100> oh<00:03:26.610> good

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
mean it's amazing oh good

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.840 
mean it's amazing oh good
and<00:03:28.440> that's<00:03:28.590> because<00:03:28.950> of<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.160> mud<00:03:29.340> flaps<00:03:29.610> that

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
and that's because of the mud flaps that

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.960 
and that's because of the mud flaps that
came<00:03:30.090> with<00:03:30.240> it<00:03:30.270> from<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.630> factory<00:03:31.400> and<00:03:32.400> so<00:03:32.700> I

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
came with it from the factory and so I

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.040 
came with it from the factory and so I
mean<00:03:33.210> not<00:03:33.630> a<00:03:33.660> huge<00:03:34.050> fan<00:03:34.290> of<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.560> look<00:03:34.800> but<00:03:36.050> it

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
mean not a huge fan of the look but it

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.300 
mean not a huge fan of the look but it
preserves<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.650> truck<00:03:37.860> very<00:03:38.130> very<00:03:38.490> nicely<00:03:40.310> and

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
preserves the truck very very nicely and

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.780 
preserves the truck very very nicely and
just<00:03:41.610> some<00:03:42.030> rest<00:03:42.240> on<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.510> bumper<00:03:43.790> that's

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
just some rest on the bumper that's

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.930 
just some rest on the bumper that's
about<00:03:45.060> it<00:03:45.360> you<00:03:45.930> can<00:03:46.080> see<00:03:46.290> someone<00:03:46.700> backed<00:03:47.700> into

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
about it you can see someone backed into

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.900 
about it you can see someone backed into
something<00:03:48.950> previous<00:03:49.950> owner<00:03:50.280> eventually<00:03:50.790> I'll

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
something previous owner eventually I'll

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.610 
something previous owner eventually I'll
probably<00:03:51.150> replace<00:03:51.600> it<00:03:51.750> at<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:51.930> chrome<00:03:52.200> just

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
probably replace it at the chrome just

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.290 
probably replace it at the chrome just
because<00:03:52.860> I<00:03:52.950> liked<00:03:53.130> him<00:03:53.310> better<00:03:53.940> than<00:03:54.150> the

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
because I liked him better than the

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.540 
because I liked him better than the
black<00:03:54.540> I<00:03:54.900> guess<00:03:57.830> but<00:03:58.830> I<00:03:58.890> guess<00:03:59.310> it'd<00:03:59.430> been

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
black I guess but I guess it'd been

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:14.849 
black I guess but I guess it'd been
started<00:03:59.910> up

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:17.080 

give<00:04:15.859> you<00:04:15.980> a<00:04:16.009> little<00:04:16.190> bit<00:04:16.400> of<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:16.579> vowels<00:04:16.880> ones

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
give you a little bit of the vowels ones

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.550 
give you a little bit of the vowels ones
cold

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.010 

the<00:04:22.860> stock<00:04:23.190> exhaust

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
the stock exhaust

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.710 
the stock exhaust
sorry

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.290 

I<00:04:30.750> was<00:04:31.350> really<00:04:31.620> impressed<00:04:31.950> of<00:04:32.210> what<00:04:33.210> the

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
I was really impressed of what the

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.600 
I was really impressed of what the
exhaust<00:04:33.600> is<00:04:33.840> I<00:04:33.990> mean<00:04:34.170> it's<00:04:34.350> as<00:04:35.070> dual<00:04:35.400> in

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
exhaust is I mean it's as dual in

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.580 
exhaust is I mean it's as dual in
muffler<00:04:36.030> and<00:04:36.210> dual<00:04:36.390> out<00:04:36.600> so<00:04:37.020> it's<00:04:37.200> almost<00:04:37.380> a

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
muffler and dual out so it's almost a

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.650 
muffler and dual out so it's almost a
dual<00:04:37.770> exhaust<00:04:37.890> and<00:04:38.460> it's<00:04:39.030> big<00:04:39.210> I<00:04:39.330> think<00:04:39.390> it's

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
dual exhaust and it's big I think it's

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:51.230 
dual exhaust and it's big I think it's
at<00:04:39.780> least<00:04:39.900> three<00:04:40.350> inches

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.210 

a<00:04:51.270> dark

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:53.220 
a dark

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.850 
a dark
I<00:04:53.250> guess<00:04:54.000> I<00:04:54.150> could<00:04:54.270> show<00:04:54.420> you<00:04:54.480> this<00:04:54.860> wheels

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
I guess I could show you this wheels

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:10.910 
I guess I could show you this wheels
turning

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:10.920 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.550 

it<00:05:11.490> doesn't<00:05:11.760> look<00:05:11.820> like<00:05:12.000> much<00:05:12.290> it's<00:05:13.290> 12

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
it doesn't look like much it's 12

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.530 
it doesn't look like much it's 12
degrees<00:05:14.750> but<00:05:15.750> I<00:05:16.430> mean

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
degrees but I mean

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.720 
degrees but I mean
it<00:05:19.080> parks<00:05:19.440> like<00:05:19.590> a<00:05:19.620> car<00:05:19.920> parts<00:05:20.310> like<00:05:20.460> my<00:05:20.580> old

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:20.730 
it parks like a car parts like my old

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.870 
it parks like a car parts like my old
car<00:05:20.940> and<00:05:21.740> and<00:05:22.740> it's<00:05:22.920> it's<00:05:23.250> pretty<00:05:23.490> crazy<00:05:23.640> to

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
car and and it's it's pretty crazy to

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.260 
car and and it's it's pretty crazy to
feel<00:05:24.180> the<00:05:24.930> rear<00:05:25.110> end<00:05:25.290> kana<00:05:25.910> feels<00:05:26.910> like<00:05:27.060> it's

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
feel the rear end kana feels like it's

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:29.240 
feel the rear end kana feels like it's
gonna<00:05:27.870> lose<00:05:28.170> traction<00:05:28.500> or<00:05:28.800> whatever<00:05:29.070> I<00:05:29.190> mean

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
gonna lose traction or whatever I mean

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.680 
gonna lose traction or whatever I mean
it<00:05:29.490> you<00:05:29.610> know<00:05:29.730> you<00:05:29.820> just<00:05:29.880> feel<00:05:30.180> the<00:05:30.330> rear<00:05:30.540> end

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
it you know you just feel the rear end

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:36.910 
it you know you just feel the rear end
turn<00:05:31.230> around<00:05:32.270> but<00:05:33.270> it's<00:05:33.420> cool<00:05:35.330> yeah

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:36.920 
turn around but it's cool yeah

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.210 
turn around but it's cool yeah
eventually<00:05:37.920> they'll<00:05:38.400> be<00:05:38.490> doing<00:05:38.610> some

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
eventually they'll be doing some

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.800 
eventually they'll be doing some
performance<00:05:41.220> mata<00:05:41.460> capable<00:05:42.740> modifications

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
performance mata capable modifications

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:52.070 
performance mata capable modifications
I<00:05:47.450> guess<00:05:48.450> the<00:05:48.630> typical<00:05:50.600> exhaust<00:05:51.600> at<00:05:51.870> some

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
I guess the typical exhaust at some

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.400 
I guess the typical exhaust at some
point<00:05:52.380> and<00:05:52.680> then<00:05:52.830> maybe<00:05:53.460> an<00:05:53.580> air<00:05:53.700> filter<00:05:54.120> and

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410 
point and then maybe an air filter and

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.960 
point and then maybe an air filter and
then<00:05:55.410> eventually<00:05:55.770> I'd<00:05:56.040> like<00:05:56.220> to<00:05:56.340> put<00:05:56.520> a<00:05:56.550> cam<00:05:56.790> in

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
then eventually I'd like to put a cam in

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:02.420 
then eventually I'd like to put a cam in
it<00:05:57.710> have<00:05:58.710> it<00:05:58.860> you<00:05:59.100> know<00:05:59.220> sound<00:06:00.090> pretty<00:06:00.330> cool<00:06:01.430> so

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
it have it you know sound pretty cool so

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.450 
it have it you know sound pretty cool so
thanks<00:06:03.060> for<00:06:03.150> watching
