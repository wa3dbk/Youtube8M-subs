00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
it's basically level with that vent and

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.180 
it's basically level with that vent and
then<00:02:36.970> level<00:02:37.390> a<00:02:37.600> left<00:02:38.320> to<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.560> doorframe<00:02:38.740> and

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
then level a left to the doorframe and

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.580 
then level a left to the doorframe and
if<00:02:39.700> this<00:02:39.820> run<00:02:40.450> forward<00:02:40.870> you<00:02:40.959> can't<00:02:41.170> run<00:02:41.380> left

if this run forward you can't run left

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:42.949 
if this run forward you can't run left
or<00:02:41.740> right<00:02:41.860> it<00:02:41.920> has<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.070> be<00:02:42.160> straight<00:02:42.640> forward

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
or right it has to be straight forward

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.890 
or right it has to be straight forward
jump<00:02:43.959> in<00:02:44.110> through<00:02:45.120> if<00:02:46.120> you<00:02:46.270> run<00:02:46.420> left<00:02:46.660> or<00:02:46.780> right
