00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.040 
here all the way so we're going to do a
little<00:02:17.230> struggle<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:19.390> can<00:02:19.570> use<00:02:19.810> the

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
little struggle you can use the

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.080 
little struggle you can use the
artificial<00:02:20.530> like<00:02:20.830> roses<00:02:21.310> lime<00:02:21.520> juice<00:02:21.790> but

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
artificial like roses lime juice but

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.570 
artificial like roses lime juice but
it's<00:02:22.720> not<00:02:22.990> going<00:02:23.140> to<00:02:23.230> be<00:02:23.350> nearly<00:02:23.620> as<00:02:23.830> good<00:02:24.040> it's

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
it's not going to be nearly as good it's

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.370 
it's not going to be nearly as good it's
going<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:24.790> be<00:02:24.940> over<00:02:25.150> sweet<00:02:25.720> and<00:02:26.050> you're<00:02:26.260> going

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
going to be over sweet and you're going

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.750 
going to be over sweet and you're going
to<00:02:26.440> get<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:26.620> lot<00:02:26.680> of<00:02:26.800> high<00:02:26.980> fructose<00:02:27.190> corn<00:02:27.430> syrup

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
to get a lot of high fructose corn syrup

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.620 
to get a lot of high fructose corn syrup
which<00:02:28.150> is<00:02:28.270> not<00:02:28.450> really<00:02:28.690> healthy<00:02:28.990> for<00:02:29.020> you

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
which is not really healthy for you

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.590 
which is not really healthy for you
totally<00:02:31.630> worth<00:02:31.810> just<00:02:32.020> squeezing<00:02:32.440> line<00:02:33.600> plus

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
totally worth just squeezing line plus

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:50.940 
totally worth just squeezing line plus
it<00:02:34.780> tastes<00:02:34.960> a<00:02:35.020> little<00:02:35.110> more<00:02:35.320> natural<00:02:49.950> good

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
it tastes a little more natural good

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:59.370 
it tastes a little more natural good
there<00:02:52.350> my<00:02:53.350> top<00:02:53.620> go<00:02:53.940> way<00:02:54.940> over<00:02:55.180> here<00:02:55.360> I<00:02:58.380> think

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
there my top go way over here I think

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:07.110 
there my top go way over here I think
we're<00:02:59.500> good<00:02:59.650> to<00:02:59.740> go<00:02:59.770> mixer<00:03:00.520> up<00:03:05.790> now<00:03:06.790> because

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
we're good to go mixer up now because

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.120 
we're good to go mixer up now because
this<00:03:07.210> is<00:03:07.270> a<00:03:07.390> cocktail<00:03:07.660> glass<00:03:08.020> it's<00:03:08.440> not<00:03:08.620> really

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
this is a cocktail glass it's not really

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.540 
this is a cocktail glass it's not really
an<00:03:10.030> ice<00:03:10.390> bearing<00:03:11.050> style<00:03:11.650> glass<00:03:11.950> you<00:03:12.250> put<00:03:12.430> eyes

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550
