00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.230
 Welcome to a new tip 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:09.549
 the week video for you said in the 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.809
 We would like to have a video of the week 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:12.490
 a few things show you that 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.830
 talk and of course the everyday life 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.720
 and make fishing easier and today 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.090
 always want to build something yourself and that 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.620
 it's about the theme of staying like this 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.150
 Buy cover here are useless 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.650
 overpriced you do not know why 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.990
 and we just want that today 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.560
 itself easier and cheaper in front of everyone 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.990
 Build things 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.289
 What do you need for that are actually only 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.840
 Burge size is actually arbitrary 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:37.300
 we have to see what you have for yours 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.010
 if you want heavy stones have 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.090
 then just take bigger swirls and 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.610
 it's not easy with lighter ones 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.270
 smaller stones are not that 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.710
 leading 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.180
 These are our leaders 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.260
 if you wanted that exactly how 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.850
 hard the transmitters can easily 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.530
 Weigh with a kitchen scale or something 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.190
 they'll just be arbitrary 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.320
 rausgenommen 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.809
 Here you see such a few models always 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.399
 to choose you have to pay attention that 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.500
 they are cutting green but they are 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.300
 Also, you should not be too firm 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.950
 Let's try the model years 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.490
 that's what we've tried in earing 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.770
 is our book moravek flowered that 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.840
 There should not be anything more important 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.609
 is seconds glue you me high quality 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.409
 take seconds glue and calvi from 

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:15.880
 One euro we have now 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.560
 and that really does not work 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.859
 So really good of business or 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.029
 so that's how the whole thing then maybe on 

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:23.079
 maybe even finish up 

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:24.939
 bit nicer we still have 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:26.829
 pure birth and says swirls have 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.600
 down here for half clipped the 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:31.179
 Also important that you have this technical 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.529
 vertebrae have it without carbine and then 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:34.569
 we just did it 

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:35.560
 must be filled with adhesive seconds 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:37.179
 of course a bit longer than one 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.799
 seconds dry because that too 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:40.149
 integrate layer is and we catch 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.310
 now to manufacture that 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.779
 We do not know if the stone maybe 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.950
 to hard is why try it 

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:46.539
 It is very important that we also have one 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.929
 Stone Kuranyi does not participate in wood drill 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:54.490
 stopping after 30 turns is willing 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:56.709
 You can not enter Rheinboden in this way 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.849
 Of course, that can also be done in the 

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:59.529
 waters can adapt 

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:00.880
 depending on what's in the water and has 

00:01:59.529 --> 00:02:03.909
 if you watered lime- rich takes that 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:08.249
 white and if it's a darker one 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.249
 watered would be such a novel 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.650
 that is reasonably secure 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.650
 is likely to go 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.760
 so now we have ours still installed 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.769
 it's almost gotten a bit deep, though 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.870
 so we stick it all together now 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.390
 may have to wash out first 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.370
 because there are all this game yet 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.510
 in there from the stone and if we do that now 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.310
 they will comment 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.200
 then that binds naturally and in here 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.640
 does not really take that for granted 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.470
 but now a short water bottle and 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.709
 what are we doing now our pictures 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.390
 a yes in the vortex 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.489
 We let's see how much space again 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.900
 about that we have so much good here 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.769
 we want that out, that's what you want 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.110
 In this round body we carry on 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:13.160
 Most support surface it recently again 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:24.319
 with the pinching pliers a bit here 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:27.410
 out that does not look bad 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:36.109
 from maybe a little bit more 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:38.989
 dry off a little attitude that 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:40.430
 should be a bit straight then 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:49.220
 but are the glue read out 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:52.099
 we are not quite sure of the seconds glue 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.910
 make full because we do so too 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:54.910
 still our vortex pure 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:59.930
 sabina bathtub that will fill you up 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.579
 is fine then she runs over and 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.579
 we do not want that anymore 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:11.049
 set here are still coming 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.049
 a little bit of sealing to do that now 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.389
 such a thing is still very important 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.280
 you are not allowed to take hot glue because 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.650
 who keeps in the rocky and then just like 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.979
 so a drop-out again does it do 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.990
 Not 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.280
 yes that was our stone you stay 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.990
 you can see this here 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.560
 we have that here now 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.840
 meanwhile pretty solid too 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.590
 of course once we have to do so 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.180
 a little bit lighter 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.229
 You can do that in very different ways 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.389
 shape and design make that 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.830
 adapt and see it 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:41.360
 maybe a thousand times more realistic 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.160
 as unequal and it was still 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.870
 cheaper as well of course it has 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.789
 video like if you let us 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.289
 thumbs up but this one goes 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:49.940
 it our last tip of the week - and 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:52.930
 down here to the other main video 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.930
 but as it is not
