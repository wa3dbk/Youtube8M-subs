00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.690
 and wild Latin America 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.170
 a young harpy eagle walks by 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.170
 from the nest of his parents asking for food 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.170
 and in change the plumage but it is not yet a 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.170
 experienced hunter 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:32.090
 a lazy has chosen a place 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.090
 dangerous to take a nap 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.840
 an adult harpy would tear a 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.810
 lazy asleep from his branch in an open 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.210
 of an eye but even when 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.100
 food is at your reach this young 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.520
 eagle does not seem sure of where 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.520
 start 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.440
 the sloth is lucky to run away but the 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.440
 leak is not fast 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.020
 the lazy move slowly but 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.020
 there is nothing lazy in them 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.410
 his heavy movements are part of a 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.070
 unique way to adapt to life 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.070
 jungle 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.940
 the lazy spend their entire lives in 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.550
 just a handful of trees 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.470
 the claws cling to the branches and their 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.820
 grip is so powerful that rarely 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.409
 fall 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.409
 even if they fall asleep 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.130
 your modified muscles allow you to 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.630
 a lazy hang for hours on 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.850
 positions that other mammals 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.850
 they would find terribly uncomfortable 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.750
 the secret of the survival of 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.750
 lazy is slow digestion 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.770
 they spend so little energy they need 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.770
 eat very little 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.129
 chew less than 200 grams of leaves at 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.129
 day 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.310
 each meal takes 30 days to digest 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.080
 they go down to earth only once a week 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.090
 to answer the call of the 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.250
 nature 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.140
 the descent is worth the effort because 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.710
 his manure serves to fertilize his 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.710
 wooded area 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.160
 the lazy people completely mimic 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.380
 with its surroundings 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.780
 his marbled skin is highly camouflaged 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.190
 and it even turns green with the algae 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.870
 when this humidity 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.900
 they can not regulate their temperature 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.850
 body like other mammals and that's why 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.710
 they depend on the constant heat of the jungle 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.280
 tropical to maintain your metabolism 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.280
 stable 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:09.230
 they are part of the environment in such a way 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.440
 that have been colonized by others 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.440
 animals 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.240
 these tiny moths pass all their 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.210
 life in the tangled shelter of 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.370
 lazy 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:25.230
 100 moths or more can find 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.230
 refuge in the skin of a single host 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.430
 as caterpillars the moths feed 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:37.420
 exclusively from excreta 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.400
 lazy traveling on him 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.290
 the female moths make sure 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.510
 always be in the right place and in 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.430
 the right time to put your 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.430
 eggs next to their food supply 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.800
 depending on both a habitat and the 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.569
 food sources the animals are 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.569
 they become very vulnerable to change 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.890
 but these survival adaptations 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.480
 are one of the reasons that the 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.480
 amazonia be so diverse 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.850
 the Amazon hosts a third of all 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.850
 the species of the planet 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.060
 with a new species discovered each 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.060
 three days
