bag<00:05:15.540> and<00:05:15.840> I<00:05:15.900> love<00:05:16.320> that<00:05:16.560> and<00:05:16.830> the<00:05:17.010> fact<00:05:17.220> it's

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
bag and I love that and the fact it's

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.830 
bag and I love that and the fact it's
black<00:05:17.640> means<00:05:17.910> that<00:05:18.060> it<00:05:18.120> goes<00:05:18.210> with<00:05:18.360> everything
