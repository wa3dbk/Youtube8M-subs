00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
one is going to be a series but it's a

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.500 
one is going to be a series but it's a
spin-off<00:00:19.619> of<00:00:19.890> The<00:00:20.580> Vampire<00:00:20.760> Academy<00:00:21.060> series

spin-off of The Vampire Academy series

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.170 
spin-off of The Vampire Academy series
so<00:00:22.109> it's<00:00:22.260> in<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.619> same<00:00:22.830> world<00:00:23.070> but<00:00:23.400> it's

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
so it's in the same world but it's

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.140 
so it's in the same world but it's
following<00:00:24.830> Sydney<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.099> she's<00:00:26.340> The<00:00:26.580> Alchemist

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
following Sydney and she's The Alchemist

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.820 
following Sydney and she's The Alchemist
which<00:00:27.390> comes<00:00:27.689> on<00:00:27.840> later<00:00:28.080> on<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.619> series

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
which comes on later on in the series

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.060 
which comes on later on in the series
basically<00:00:29.699> an<00:00:29.910> alchemist<00:00:30.449> is<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:31.320> human<00:00:31.800> but

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
basically an alchemist is a human but

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.790 
basically an alchemist is a human but
they're<00:00:32.309> aware<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.660> vampire<00:00:34.110> world<00:00:34.380> they
