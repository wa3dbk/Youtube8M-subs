00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
have made in the past and it goes to the

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.230 
have made in the past and it goes to the
cost<00:01:46.750> of<00:01:46.960> the<00:01:47.020> unit<00:01:47.080> we're<00:01:47.860> using<00:01:48.189> a<00:01:48.729> wood

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240

frame<00:01:49.510> construction<00:01:49.540> on<00:01:50.260> the<00:01:50.380> Springdale

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
frame construction on the Springdale

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.679 
frame construction on the Springdale
which<00:01:51.130> is<00:01:51.369> the<00:01:51.850> way<00:01:52.000> they've<00:01:52.210> been<00:01:52.240> doing<00:01:52.479> it

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
which is the way they've been doing it

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:54.450 
which is the way they've been doing it
how<00:01:53.200> they<00:01:53.350> started<00:01:53.680> doing<00:01:53.830> it<00:01:54.010> originally

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
how they started doing it originally

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.740 
how they started doing it originally
before<00:01:54.729> we<00:01:54.820> went<00:01:54.939> to<00:01:55.060> all<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.330> aluminum

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
before we went to all the aluminum

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.990 
before we went to all the aluminum
builds<00:01:56.049> so<00:01:56.890> it's<00:01:57.250> a<00:01:57.280> little<00:01:57.490> less<00:01:57.729> expensive

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
builds so it's a little less expensive

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.370 
builds so it's a little less expensive
to<00:01:58.330> do<00:01:58.479> it<00:01:58.600> this<00:01:58.689> way<00:01:58.900> which<00:01:59.080> gives<00:01:59.290> a

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
to do it this way which gives a

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.960 
to do it this way which gives a
Springdale<00:01:59.770> a<00:01:59.830> great<00:02:00.100> price<00:02:00.340> point<00:02:00.369> later<00:02:00.850> to

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
Springdale a great price point later to

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.490 
Springdale a great price point later to
tack<00:02:01.180> but<00:02:01.360> we<00:02:01.509> don't<00:02:01.689> lose<00:02:01.900> anything<00:02:02.200> in<00:02:02.439> the
