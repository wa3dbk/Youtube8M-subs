00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 good reading some comments for 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.330
 here I came across the typical debate in the 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.420
 what naruto fanboys end up fighting 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.429
 with the tbz fanboys it's apparently 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.320
 something almost inevitable for those who hate 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.630
 and naruto or for those who defend him the 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.730
 end by comparing both series but 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.590
 some comments were so absurd 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.330
 and full of fanaticism that I felt in the 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.369
 obligation to create this topic for 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.260
 expose the why in my opinion of beteta 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.630
 It's better than in a car, I do not say it's 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.970
 bz bad but seems much higher 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.130
 the problem that I see when reading arguments 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.110
 that place one of these two series by 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.120
 on top of the other is that they look at 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.610
 both with the same rod something that I think 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.770
 that the difference does not correspond 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.870
 main that I see train uto and bz 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.670
 are the pretensions of both 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.530
 dragonball was a manga are in it 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.390
 it was about adventures and fights that his 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.820
 main character lived while 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.800
 it grew point then in bz they left a 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.629
 little side of the adventures and only 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.629
 was about the appearance of an enemy and 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.940
 the battle against it in dragon ball gt 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.590
 it was tried to return to the old format of 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.199
 adventures and fights 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.060
 in synthesis the dragon saga vall was 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.760
 of the simplest I did not have a great 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.860
 story it was just about fights nothing 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.830
 plus 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.090
 Now let's go with Naruto Naruto is a 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.100
 manga are in that it was 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.600
 mainly from the growth of its 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.000
 protagonist when going through several 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.620
 Assignments for such adventures and fights 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.810
 like dragon ball but with the difference 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.550
 that in each chapter I tried to delve 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.740
 more and more in the psyche of each new 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.780
 point point so it remained until 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.820
 it is to his that goes where basically the 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.650
 plot remains the same but the theme changes 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.140
 because Naruto's goal is focused on 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.180
 look for sasuke that naruto shippuden 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.610
 where it begins to change completely 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.440
 the plot of the story then from there in 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.720
 forward the series starts to handle 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.000
 new more complex concepts and more 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.670
 own of a being in which a are in as 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.280
 the war its causes and consequences the 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.460
 conspiracies good or evil and so on 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.200
 what is the big difference then 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.540
 dragon go is a son in which he departed as 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.340
 they are in and continued as they are in without giving 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.840
 great interest in history or pretend 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.350
 be more than a story 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.390
 simply based on fights in essence 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.429
 of bz never deviated from its main 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.410
 purpose that was to show good fights 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.239
 and for this he came to achieve 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.020
 perfection in this sense reaching 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.000
 show them 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.610
 the most epic ones that have appeared in a 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.650
 Naruto manga departed as they are in 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.660
 focusing on the story more than anything 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.180
 that although it was more complete than that of 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.160
 bz was still a simple story 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.020
 directed to minors point to 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.210
 prioritize the story you're 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.100
 it removed fluidity to the fights because it was due 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.900
 tell everyone's stories so that 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.880
 could fight point later on chipude 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.770
 in this fact it was much more obviated 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.780
 They began to discover the 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.130
 origins of the main story together 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.740
 with the personal history of each 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.300
 involved and at this point he started his 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.860
 pseudo transformation to seinen 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.690
 focusing fully on the 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.760
 conspiracies that caused the war 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.890
 I mean, Naruto is a son in which he pretends 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.570
 be a seinen but it does not work for you 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.150
 it will work because the main argument 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.060
 it is still the same point an argument 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.280
 aimed at children under the age of 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.560
 how is a manga centered on its history 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.720
 but without a great story to tell 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.000
 I consider Naruto a great manga to 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.010
 difference from de bz that focused on 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.860
 his fights but he did have good 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.230
 fights why I say that the claims 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.880
 of each sleeve is what sets them apart and 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.900
 by the pretensions of Naruto 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.360
 look like a manga 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.129
 adult of what it really is is explained 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.870
 all the stuffing and sentimentality 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:30.200
 cheap that most of us read 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.239
 naruto we feel that he subtracts points like that 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.980
 it's how I see it I tried to be the most 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.870
 goal that I could and left aside the 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.880
 argument of the pub now because both 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:42.530
 works sin of having so many 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.530
 why 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.770
 What is it 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.189
 i 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.189
 Y
