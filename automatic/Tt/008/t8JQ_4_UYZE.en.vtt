just<00:02:01.250> like<00:02:01.340> a<00:02:01.400> keyboard<00:02:01.640> should<00:02:02.060> we<00:02:02.210> have

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
just like a keyboard should we have

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.360 
just like a keyboard should we have
mastered<00:02:02.900> keyboard<00:02:03.320> technology<00:02:03.920> we<00:02:03.980> did<00:02:04.190> it

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
mastered keyboard technology we did it

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.570 
mastered keyboard technology we did it
humans<00:02:04.940> good<00:02:05.570> job<00:02:06.010> and<00:02:07.010> it's<00:02:07.130> nice<00:02:07.310> and<00:02:07.490> not

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
humans good job and it's nice and not

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:08.710 
humans good job and it's nice and not
jump<00:02:07.790> on<00:02:07.850> a<00:02:07.910> netbook<00:02:08.149> and<00:02:08.330> not<00:02:08.420> worry<00:02:08.629> about

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
jump on a netbook and not worry about

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.089 
jump on a netbook and not worry about
your<00:02:09.050> fat<00:02:09.200> fingers<00:02:09.379> that<00:02:09.739> the<00:02:09.860> keys<00:02:10.069> are

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
your fat fingers that the keys are

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.460 
your fat fingers that the keys are
nicely<00:02:11.030> spaced<00:02:11.269> yeah<00:02:11.510> there's<00:02:12.230> plenty<00:02:12.319> of

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
nicely spaced yeah there's plenty of

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.050 
nicely spaced yeah there's plenty of
room<00:02:12.560> for<00:02:12.620> that<00:02:12.800> what<00:02:12.980> about<00:02:13.069> the<00:02:13.220> touch<00:02:13.730> not

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
room for that what about the touch not

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.600 
room for that what about the touch not
as<00:02:14.330> responsive<00:02:14.989> cab<00:02:15.200> it's<00:02:16.069> a<00:02:16.159> little<00:02:16.370> more<00:02:16.519> of

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
as responsive cab it's a little more of

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.839 
as responsive cab it's a little more of
a<00:02:16.700> poke<00:02:17.000> and<00:02:17.209> tap<00:02:17.420> experience<00:02:18.370> you're<00:02:19.370> welcome

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
a poke and tap experience you're welcome

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.080 
a poke and tap experience you're welcome
yeah

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
yeah

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.059 
yeah
rather<00:02:21.420> than<00:02:21.569> a<00:02:21.630> fluid<00:02:21.990> motion<00:02:22.200> like<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.709> iPad

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
rather than a fluid motion like the iPad

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.010 
rather than a fluid motion like the iPad
and<00:02:23.280> this<00:02:23.640> means<00:02:23.850> that<00:02:23.970> you<00:02:24.480> might<00:02:24.660> have<00:02:24.870> to

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
and this means that you might have to

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.780 
and this means that you might have to
tap<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.440> bunch<00:02:25.800> to<00:02:26.040> get<00:02:26.190> something<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.640> work

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
tap a bunch to get something to work

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.580 
tap a bunch to get something to work
which<00:02:27.090> is<00:02:27.240> not<00:02:27.390> really<00:02:27.630> what<00:02:27.660> you<00:02:27.870> want<00:02:28.080> with<00:02:28.560> a

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
which is not really what you want with a

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.080 
which is not really what you want with a
touchscreen<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.459> virtual<00:02:29.730> keyboard<00:02:29.819> is<00:02:30.060> also

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
touchscreen the virtual keyboard is also

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.030 
touchscreen the virtual keyboard is also
very<00:02:30.450> awkward<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.140> it's<00:02:31.500> not<00:02:31.800> all<00:02:32.010> that

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
very awkward and it's not all that

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.740 
very awkward and it's not all that
useful<00:02:32.220> like<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:32.819> pops<00:02:33.060> up<00:02:33.300> and<00:02:33.480> then<00:02:33.569> you<00:02:33.630> got

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
useful like it pops up and then you got

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.180 
useful like it pops up and then you got
to<00:02:33.840> slide<00:02:34.050> it<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.290> side<00:02:34.380> then<00:02:34.830> you<00:02:34.920> close

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
to slide it to the side then you close

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.040 
to slide it to the side then you close
it<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:35.730> can<00:02:36.120> see<00:02:36.209> it<00:02:36.300> right<00:02:36.390> there<00:02:36.450> even

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
it and you can see it right there even

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.290 
it and you can see it right there even
though<00:02:37.140> this<00:02:37.410> is<00:02:37.590> capacitive<00:02:38.220> it's<00:02:39.030> just<00:02:39.180> not

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
though this is capacitive it's just not

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.670 
though this is capacitive it's just not
exactly<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.780> experience<00:02:39.959> that<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.319> want<00:02:40.500> I'm

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
exactly the experience that you want I'm

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.100 
exactly the experience that you want I'm
actually<00:02:41.250> weirdly<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:41.850> wanted<00:02:42.300> a<00:02:42.360> stylus<00:02:42.870> yeah

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
actually weirdly I wanted a stylus yeah

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.190 
actually weirdly I wanted a stylus yeah
I<00:02:43.520> hate<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:44.550> agree<00:02:45.060> on<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:45.330> one<00:02:45.540> but<00:02:45.750> once<00:02:46.050> I

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
I hate to agree on that one but once I

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.559 
I hate to agree on that one but once I
was<00:02:46.290> like<00:02:46.440> look<00:02:46.620> you<00:02:46.650> know<00:02:46.800> Windows<00:02:47.790> 7<00:02:48.180> just

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
was like look you know Windows 7 just

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.900 
was like look you know Windows 7 just
isn't<00:02:48.900> designed<00:02:49.200> for<00:02:49.410> certain<00:02:49.770> fat<00:02:50.520> finger

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
isn't designed for certain fat finger

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.850 
isn't designed for certain fat finger
gestures<00:02:51.420> and<00:02:51.600> touches<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.110> meetable<00:02:52.410> stylus

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
gestures and touches the meetable stylus

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.960 
gestures and touches the meetable stylus
this<00:02:52.980> is<00:02:53.100> sort<00:02:53.250> of<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.400> thing<00:02:53.550> I<00:02:53.580> mean<00:02:53.670> like<00:02:53.850> I<00:02:53.940> I

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
this is sort of a thing I mean like I I

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.759 
this is sort of a thing I mean like I I
don't<00:02:54.660> think<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:55.080> I<00:02:55.110> don't<00:02:55.290> think<00:02:55.470> what<00:02:55.709> we

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
don't think that I don't think what we

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:56.630 
don't think that I don't think what we
should<00:02:55.800> be<00:02:55.950> doing<00:02:56.010> with<00:02:56.310> touch<00:02:56.459> screen

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
should be doing with touch screen

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.449 
should be doing with touch screen
technology<00:02:56.820> is<00:02:57.420> just<00:02:57.660> making<00:02:57.989> old<00:02:58.470> platforms

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
technology is just making old platforms

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.430 
technology is just making old platforms
touchable<00:02:59.970> right<00:03:00.300> not<00:03:00.720> that<00:03:00.870> Windows<00:03:01.080> 7<00:03:01.350> is

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
touchable right not that Windows 7 is

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.720 
touchable right not that Windows 7 is
old<00:03:01.590> but<00:03:01.739> I<00:03:01.769> mean<00:03:01.950> like<00:03:02.070> it's<00:03:02.220> it's<00:03:02.370> kind<00:03:02.580> of<00:03:02.610> an

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
old but I mean like it's it's kind of an

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.130 
old but I mean like it's it's kind of an
old<00:03:02.940> paradigm<00:03:03.269> you<00:03:03.600> know<00:03:03.690> what<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:03.870> mean<00:03:03.989> like

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
old paradigm you know what I mean like

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.540 
old paradigm you know what I mean like
and<00:03:04.290> I<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:04.530> I<00:03:04.560> feel<00:03:04.709> like<00:03:04.890> what<00:03:05.040> we<00:03:05.160> should<00:03:05.370> do

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
and I and I feel like what we should do

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.340 
and I and I feel like what we should do
is<00:03:05.819> they<00:03:06.300> should<00:03:06.330> have<00:03:06.690> software<00:03:07.200> that

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
is they should have software that

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.110 
is they should have software that
integrates<00:03:07.590> with<00:03:08.069> the<00:03:08.250> idea<00:03:08.640> of<00:03:08.700> touch<00:03:08.910> screen

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
integrates with the idea of touch screen

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.940 
integrates with the idea of touch screen
technology<00:03:09.600> because<00:03:09.989> basically<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:10.860> know

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
technology because basically you know

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.530 
technology because basically you know
like<00:03:11.130> a<00:03:11.160> Windows<00:03:11.489> 7<00:03:11.730> desktop<00:03:11.760> there's<00:03:12.360> a<00:03:12.420> lot

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
like a Windows 7 desktop there's a lot

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.750 
like a Windows 7 desktop there's a lot
of<00:03:12.660> small<00:03:12.959> little<00:03:13.230> places<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.650> tiny<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.370> Lexus

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
of small little places to tiny the Lexus

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.729 
of small little places to tiny the Lexus
exactly<00:03:15.269> or<00:03:15.330> a<00:03:15.420> mouse<00:03:15.600> cursor<00:03:15.840> not<00:03:16.260> for<00:03:16.590> your

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
exactly or a mouse cursor not for your

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:17.870 
exactly or a mouse cursor not for your
finger<00:03:16.980> you<00:03:17.040> can't<00:03:17.280> just<00:03:17.489> make<00:03:17.610> something

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
finger you can't just make something

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.340 
finger you can't just make something
touchable<00:03:18.390> of<00:03:18.480> me<00:03:18.540> like<00:03:18.690> touch<00:03:18.900> screen<00:03:19.200> like

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
touchable of me like touch screen like

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.570 
touchable of me like touch screen like
it<00:03:19.500> really<00:03:19.650> does<00:03:19.830> integrate<00:03:20.130> better<00:03:20.250> with<00:03:20.370> the

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
it really does integrate better with the

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.460 
it really does integrate better with the
software<00:03:20.910> right<00:03:21.300> otherwise<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:21.959> or<00:03:22.230> the

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
software right otherwise and or the

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.630 
software right otherwise and or the
screen<00:03:22.709> needs<00:03:22.920> to<00:03:23.010> be<00:03:23.100> at<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.220> touch<00:03:23.430> screen

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
screen needs to be at the touch screen
