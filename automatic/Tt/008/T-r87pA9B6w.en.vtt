do<00:01:41.880> that<00:01:42.240> push<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.840> down<00:01:43.280> catch<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:45.030> second

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
do that push it down catch the second

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.120 
do that push it down catch the second
part<00:01:46.399> if<00:01:47.399> that'll<00:01:47.850> go<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.210> at<00:01:48.360> all<00:01:49.130> kazoom

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
part if that'll go in at all kazoom

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.120 
part if that'll go in at all kazoom
doubt<00:01:50.399> picture<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:51.090> always<00:01:51.960> say<00:01:52.200> whenever<00:01:52.890> I

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
doubt picture I always say whenever I

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.910 
doubt picture I always say whenever I
say<00:01:53.399> zoom<00:01:53.700> out<00:01:53.850> always<00:01:54.119> zooms<00:01:54.509> in<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.740> that's

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
say zoom out always zooms in so that's

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.069 
say zoom out always zooms in so that's
great

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079
