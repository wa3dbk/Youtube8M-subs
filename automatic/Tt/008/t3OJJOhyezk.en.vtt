twelve-step<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:33.960> also<00:00:34.260> connected<00:00:34.530> which<00:00:34.890> is

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
twelve-step is also connected which is

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.869 
twelve-step is also connected which is
actually<00:00:35.340> what's<00:00:35.640> controlling<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:37.309> the<00:00:38.309> iPad

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
actually what's controlling the the iPad

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.470 
actually what's controlling the the iPad
the<00:00:39.149> sounds<00:00:39.840> on<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.020> iPad<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:41.309> so<00:00:42.210> whatever

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
the sounds on the iPad so so whatever

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.880 
the sounds on the iPad so so whatever
done<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:42.780> then<00:00:43.020> well<00:00:43.230> I'm<00:00:43.379> primarily<00:00:43.590> a

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
done this then well I'm primarily a

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.670 
done this then well I'm primarily a
guitarist<00:00:44.309> but<00:00:45.270> I<00:00:45.329> do<00:00:45.539> want<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.870> work<00:00:46.079> with

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.470 

synth<00:00:49.680> loops<00:00:52.160> sequences<00:00:53.329> appreciators<00:00:54.329> and

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
synth loops sequences appreciators and

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.520 
synth loops sequences appreciators and
that<00:00:54.570> sort<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.870> thing<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.140> give<00:00:55.289> extra

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
that sort of thing to give extra

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.110 
that sort of thing to give extra
movement<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:58.039> more<00:00:59.039> ambience<00:00:59.699> or<00:00:59.820> acoustic

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
movement to a more ambience or acoustic

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.920 
movement to a more ambience or acoustic
style<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.690> guess<00:01:00.870> you'd<00:01:01.050> say<00:01:01.789> so<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.329> this

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
style I guess you'd say so and this

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.420 
style I guess you'd say so and this
going<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.439> how<00:01:05.250> we've<00:01:07.100> constructed<00:01:08.100> this

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
going to how we've constructed this

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.660 
going to how we've constructed this
basic<00:01:08.909> rig<00:01:09.119> here<00:01:09.299> in<00:01:09.619> in<00:01:10.619> main<00:01:10.890> stage<00:01:11.220> then<00:01:11.520> so

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
basic rig here in in main stage then so

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.539 
basic rig here in in main stage then so
this<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.970> main<00:01:12.180> stage<00:01:12.450> three<00:01:13.159> running<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:14.310> just

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
this is main stage three running on just

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.310 
this is main stage three running on just
a<00:01:14.640> basic<00:01:15.090> 2009<00:01:15.960> 2010<00:01:16.680> ein<00:01:17.270> MacBook<00:01:18.270> there's<00:01:19.200> no

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
a basic 2009 2010 ein MacBook there's no

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.590 
a basic 2009 2010 ein MacBook there's no
even<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.619> MacBook<00:01:19.979> Pro<00:01:20.390> which<00:01:21.390> probably

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
even the MacBook Pro which probably

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.440 
even the MacBook Pro which probably
explains<00:01:21.810> why<00:01:22.350> I'm<00:01:22.979> using<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.369> iPad<00:01:23.759> here<00:01:24.299> as

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
explains why I'm using the iPad here as

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.660 
explains why I'm using the iPad here as
well<00:01:24.689> because<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.860> don't<00:01:25.920> want<00:01:26.189> this<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.460> fall

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
well because I don't want this to fall

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.600 
well because I don't want this to fall
over<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.890> okay<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:28.950> what<00:01:29.159> I've<00:01:29.250> gotten<00:01:29.490> a

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
over so okay so what I've gotten a

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.600 
over so okay so what I've gotten a
screen<00:01:29.909> there<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.540> shutter<00:01:30.780> look<00:01:30.930> at<00:01:31.049> the

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
screen there so the shutter look at the

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.670 
screen there so the shutter look at the
the<00:01:32.610> channels<00:01:32.970> first<00:01:33.210> off<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:33.869> here's<00:01:34.140> here<00:01:34.590> we

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
the channels first off so here's here we

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:43.550 
the channels first off so here's here we
have<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.860> channels<00:01:35.540> so<00:01:40.340> but<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.369> have<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:42.560> number

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
have the channels so but I have a number

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.760 
have the channels so but I have a number
of<00:01:43.680> channels<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:45.210> first<00:01:45.509> one<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:46.470> connected

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
of channels the first one is connected

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.020 
of channels the first one is connected
to<00:01:47.689> the<00:01:48.689> iPad<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.619> is<00:01:50.040> bringing<00:01:50.399> an<00:01:50.549> audio

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
to the iPad and is bringing an audio

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.319 
to the iPad and is bringing an audio
into<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.079> iPad<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.649> also<00:01:52.829> has<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.490> chief

elsewhere on the on YouTube you'll be
able<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.369> find<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.640> video<00:02:02.759> on<00:02:02.939> how<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.990> can<00:02:04.320> use

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
able to find a video on how you can use

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.709 
able to find a video on how you can use
an<00:02:04.770> aggregate<00:02:05.189> device<00:02:05.520> with<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.180> Mac<00:02:06.360> in

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
an aggregate device with the Mac in

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.570 
an aggregate device with the Mac in
order<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:07.079> create<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.469> sound<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:08.039> will<00:02:08.160> create

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
order to create the sound it will create

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.290 
order to create the sound it will create
a<00:02:09.830> input/output

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
a input/output

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.780 
a input/output
which<00:02:11.630> works<00:02:11.930> well<00:02:12.170> with<00:02:12.440> both<00:02:12.710> logic<00:02:13.550> and

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
which works well with both logic and

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:20.160 
which works well with both logic and
main<00:02:14.600> stage<00:02:16.210> after<00:02:17.210> a<00:02:17.240> bit<00:02:17.510> of<00:02:17.630> messing<00:02:17.900> around

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.780 

you've<00:02:21.170> managed<00:02:21.500> to<00:02:21.560> discover<00:02:22.100> which<00:02:22.520> one's

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
you've managed to discover which one's

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.270 
you've managed to discover which one's
work<00:02:23.030> best<00:02:23.060> in<00:02:23.630> terms<00:02:23.810> of<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.830> inputs<00:02:25.190> and

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
work best in terms of the inputs and

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.470 
work best in terms of the inputs and
outputs<00:02:25.400> for<00:02:25.850> this<00:02:26.000> particular<00:02:27.460> setup<00:02:28.480> so

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
outputs for this particular setup so

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.310 
outputs for this particular setup so
that's<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:30.290> one<00:02:30.410> is<00:02:30.560> controlling<00:02:31.960> the<00:02:32.960> iPad

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
that's the one is controlling the iPad

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.520 
that's the one is controlling the iPad
so<00:02:33.710> never<00:02:34.610> come<00:02:34.790> back<00:02:34.910> to<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.150> 12<00:02:35.810> step<00:02:36.050> here

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
so never come back to the 12 step here

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.880 
so never come back to the 12 step here
forgive<00:02:37.400> my<00:02:37.520> fluffy<00:02:37.730> slippers<00:02:38.390> pressing<00:02:39.290> the

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.200 

that's<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.040> 12<00:02:43.280> step<00:02:43.520> any<00:02:43.670> Kermit<00:02:44.030> while

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
that's the 12 step any Kermit while

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.810 
that's the 12 step any Kermit while
strapping<00:02:44.600> you<00:02:44.690> can<00:02:44.810> actually<00:02:44.990> hear<00:02:45.700> now<00:02:46.700> I've

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
strapping you can actually hear now I've

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.970 
strapping you can actually hear now I've
got<00:02:47.000> an<00:02:47.060> instance<00:02:47.450> of<00:02:47.630> I<00:02:47.990> was<00:02:48.470> come<00:02:48.620> on<00:02:48.710> Larry

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
got an instance of I was come on Larry

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.960 
got an instance of I was come on Larry
serving<00:02:49.520> up

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.510 

just<00:02:54.540> tell<00:02:54.720> her<00:02:55.040> there's<00:02:56.040> an<00:02:56.130> instance<00:02:56.460> of

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
just tell her there's an instance of

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.240 
just tell her there's an instance of
alchemy<00:02:56.940> running<00:02:57.210> on<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.450> air<00:02:57.770> on<00:02:58.770> the<00:02:58.890> iPad

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
alchemy running on the air on the iPad

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.080 
alchemy running on the air on the iPad
there<00:02:59.690> okay<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:00.900> that's<00:03:01.620> what's<00:03:02.090> coming

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
there okay and that's what's coming

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.850 
there okay and that's what's coming
through<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.810> essentially<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.590> MIDI<00:03:04.770> is

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
through so the essentially the MIDI is

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.740 
through so the essentially the MIDI is
coming<00:03:05.100> through<00:03:05.250> from<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.700> twelve-step<00:03:06.300> into

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
coming through from the twelve-step into

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.610 
coming through from the twelve-step into
the<00:03:07.410> Mac<00:03:07.620> via<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.220> I<00:03:08.400> can<00:03:08.730> make<00:03:08.820> MIDI<00:03:09.030> -<00:03:09.620> into

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
the Mac via the I can make MIDI - into

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.920 
the Mac via the I can make MIDI - into
the<00:03:10.710> iPad<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.700> audio<00:03:12.000> is<00:03:12.150> then<00:03:12.270> fed<00:03:12.540> straight

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
the iPad the audio is then fed straight

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.170 
the iPad the audio is then fed straight
back<00:03:13.170> into<00:03:13.440> mainstage<00:03:14.400> here<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:14.850> that's<00:03:15.000> what

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
back into mainstage here and that's what

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.510 
back into mainstage here and that's what
that<00:03:15.330> one<00:03:15.510> for<00:03:15.720> that<00:03:15.810> first<00:03:16.080> Charles<00:03:16.530> doing<00:03:16.800> so

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
that one for that first Charles doing so

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.840 
that one for that first Charles doing so
looking<00:03:17.880> at<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.060> second<00:03:18.480> channel<00:03:18.720> then<00:03:19.850> okay

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
looking at the second channel then okay

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.840 
looking at the second channel then okay
the<00:03:21.000> second<00:03:21.390> channels<00:03:21.800> essentially<00:03:22.800> is<00:03:23.010> just

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
the second channels essentially is just

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.870 
the second channels essentially is just
a<00:03:24.000> MIDI<00:03:24.530> channel<00:03:25.530> that<00:03:25.680> I've<00:03:25.800> set<00:03:26.070> up<00:03:26.100> and<00:03:26.610> the

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
a MIDI channel that I've set up and the

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.470 
a MIDI channel that I've set up and the
idea<00:03:27.180> behind<00:03:27.240> this<00:03:27.570> is<00:03:27.630> this<00:03:28.620> is<00:03:28.770> taking<00:03:29.480> MIDI

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
idea behind this is this is taking MIDI

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.150 
idea behind this is this is taking MIDI
clock<00:03:30.720> information<00:03:31.440> and<00:03:31.590> that<00:03:31.770> is<00:03:31.950> being

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
clock information and that is being

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.430 
clock information and that is being
routed<00:03:32.340> out<00:03:32.670> again<00:03:33.090> through<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.540> by<00:03:34.170> connect

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
routed out again through the by connect

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.440 
routed out again through the by connect
MIDI<00:03:34.620> -<00:03:34.890> and<00:03:35.570> into<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.660> looper<00:03:37.050> so<00:03:38.210> as<00:03:39.210> you<00:03:39.360> can

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
MIDI - and into the looper so as you can

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.450 
MIDI - and into the looper so as you can
see<00:03:39.510> there<00:03:39.900> there's<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.830> boomerang<00:03:41.250> with

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 
see there there's the boomerang with

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.040 
see there there's the boomerang with
this<00:03:41.610> sidecar<00:03:42.030> attached<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:44.630> the<00:03:45.630> input<00:03:45.900> to

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
this sidecar attached the the input to

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.350 
this sidecar attached the the input to
there<00:03:46.230> is<00:03:47.160> running<00:03:47.430> into<00:03:47.640> the<00:03:47.730> end<00:03:47.880> of<00:03:48.090> the

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
there is running into the end of the

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.130 
there is running into the end of the
sidecar<00:03:48.980> sidecar<00:03:49.980> isn't<00:03:50.250> controlling<00:03:50.820> or

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
sidecar sidecar isn't controlling or

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.240 
sidecar sidecar isn't controlling or
feeding<00:03:52.140> information<00:03:52.290> backwards<00:03:52.920> or<00:03:53.040> force

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
feeding information backwards or force

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.990 
feeding information backwards or force
between<00:03:54.620> the<00:03:55.620> base<00:03:55.830> the<00:03:56.100> luma<00:03:56.400> in<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:56.730> looper

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
between the base the luma in the looper

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.479 
between the base the luma in the looper
itself<00:03:57.390> so<00:03:57.840> that's<00:03:58.470> all<00:03:58.680> going<00:03:58.950> on<00:03:59.130> that's<00:03:59.340> all

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
itself so that's all going on that's all

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.970 
itself so that's all going on that's all
good<00:03:59.760> and<00:04:00.050> you<00:04:01.050> might<00:04:01.290> be<00:04:01.410> able<00:04:01.470> to<00:04:01.590> notice

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
good and you might be able to notice

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.570 
good and you might be able to notice
there<00:04:03.950> possibly<00:04:04.950> you<00:04:05.700> can<00:04:05.820> see<00:04:06.260> that<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.590> the

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
there possibly you can see that the the

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.510 
there possibly you can see that the the
sync<00:04:08.880> light<00:04:09.360> is<00:04:09.630> flashing<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:10.520> that

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
sync light is flashing and that

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.760 
sync light is flashing and that
indicates<00:04:12.060> that<00:04:12.180> we've<00:04:12.450> got<00:04:12.600> clock<00:04:12.900> coming

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
indicates that we've got clock coming

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.580 
indicates that we've got clock coming
into<00:04:13.980> it<00:04:14.250> okay<00:04:15.260> so<00:04:17.000> lastly<00:04:18.000> we<00:04:18.270> just<00:04:18.480> have<00:04:18.720> an

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
into it okay so lastly we just have an

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.430 
into it okay so lastly we just have an
instance<00:04:20.040> of<00:04:20.160> machine<00:04:20.750> okay<00:04:21.750> I'll<00:04:21.930> just<00:04:22.140> click

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
instance of machine okay I'll just click

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.150 
instance of machine okay I'll just click
up<00:04:22.590> on<00:04:22.710> that

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
up on that

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.220 
up on that
well<00:04:24.060> this<00:04:24.210> instance<00:04:24.600> a<00:04:24.690> machine<00:04:25.020> up<00:04:25.200> there

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.230 
well this instance a machine up there

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.409 
well this instance a machine up there
and<00:04:25.590> up<00:04:25.770> and<00:04:25.950> running<00:04:26.250> and<00:04:26.520> if<00:04:26.880> I<00:04:26.970> tap<00:04:27.180> the<00:04:27.300> part

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
and up and running and if I tap the part

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:35.270 
and up and running and if I tap the part
you<00:04:30.419> can<00:04:30.600> see<00:04:32.540> it's<00:04:33.540> all<00:04:33.690> going<00:04:34.020> okay<00:04:34.919> so

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
you can see it's all going okay so

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.240 
you can see it's all going okay so
that's<00:04:35.460> all<00:04:35.640> coming<00:04:36.000> in<00:04:36.120> through<00:04:36.330> there<00:04:36.600> okay

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
that's all coming in through there okay

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:43.130 
that's all coming in through there okay
so<00:04:38.250> if<00:04:38.700> I<00:04:38.850> hit<00:04:39.260> I'll<00:04:40.260> just<00:04:40.440> get<00:04:40.590> rid<00:04:40.680> of<00:04:40.740> him<00:04:42.140> go

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
so if I hit I'll just get rid of him go

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.280 
so if I hit I'll just get rid of him go
back<00:04:43.350> to<00:04:43.470> my<00:04:43.560> perform<00:04:43.950> page<00:04:44.330> and<00:04:45.330> I'm<00:04:46.080> just

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
back to my perform page and I'm just

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.620 
back to my perform page and I'm just
basically<00:04:46.500> very<00:04:47.070> very<00:04:47.160> basically<00:04:48.030> set<00:04:48.330> up<00:04:48.360> a

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
basically very very basically set up a

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.920 
basically very very basically set up a
tap<00:04:49.290> tempo<00:04:50.210> so<00:04:51.210> I<00:04:51.240> can<00:04:51.450> just<00:04:51.600> instantly

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
tap tempo so I can just instantly

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.590 
tap tempo so I can just instantly
control<00:04:52.500> tap<00:04:52.820> tempo<00:04:53.820> there's<00:04:54.180> my<00:04:54.360> three

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
control tap tempo there's my three

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.960 
control tap tempo there's my three
levels<00:04:54.990> for<00:04:55.410> each<00:04:55.620> of<00:04:55.770> the<00:04:55.860> tracks<00:04:56.160> the

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
levels for each of the tracks the

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.320 
levels for each of the tracks the
mashina

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
mashina

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.320 
mashina
the<00:04:59.810> the<00:05:00.470> iPad<00:05:00.830> audio<00:05:01.190> coming<00:05:01.550> in<00:05:01.700> and<00:05:01.910> the

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
the the iPad audio coming in and the

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.040 
the the iPad audio coming in and the
main<00:05:02.510> volume<00:05:03.220> okay<00:05:04.390> that<00:05:05.390> little<00:05:05.690> like<00:05:05.810> there

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
main volume okay that little like there

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
that just stick the tuner back into step

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.950 
that just stick the tuner back into step
mode<00:05:31.490> you<00:05:31.700> can<00:05:31.850> see<00:05:31.970> that's<00:05:32.150> alright<00:05:32.570> running

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960

out<00:05:33.050> free<00:05:33.290> there<00:05:35.680> I'm<00:05:36.680> just<00:05:36.860> hitting<00:05:37.070> the

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
out free there I'm just hitting the

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.930 
out free there I'm just hitting the
spacebar<00:05:37.460> starts<00:05:38.330> and<00:05:38.480> stops<00:05:38.690> that<00:05:38.980> okay<00:05:39.980> if<00:05:40.850> I

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
spacebar starts and stops that okay if I

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.330 
spacebar starts and stops that okay if I
just<00:05:41.230> slow<00:05:42.230> that<00:05:42.380> down<00:05:42.590> a<00:05:42.650> bit<00:05:42.770> okay

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:54.070 

spacebar<00:05:46.340> again<00:05:52.420> okay<00:05:53.420> and<00:05:53.450> if<00:05:53.660> I<00:05:53.750> come<00:05:53.960> back

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
spacebar again okay and if I come back

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.800 
spacebar again okay and if I come back
down<00:05:54.290> to<00:05:54.410> the<00:05:54.500> looper<00:05:55.450> hopefully<00:05:56.450> you<00:05:56.630> might

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
down to the looper hopefully you might

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.150 
down to the looper hopefully you might
be<00:05:56.930> able<00:05:57.050> to<00:05:57.140> see<00:05:57.260> the<00:05:57.470> sync<00:05:57.770> button<00:05:57.830> is

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 
be able to see the sync button is

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.970 
be able to see the sync button is
working<00:05:58.610> simultaneously<00:05:59.240> with<00:06:02.020> so<00:06:03.020> in<00:06:03.650> actual

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:03.980 
working simultaneously with so in actual

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.010 
working simultaneously with so in actual
fact<00:06:04.100> then<00:06:04.340> what<00:06:04.490> I've<00:06:04.610> got<00:06:04.820> then<00:06:05.000> is<00:06:05.300> a<00:06:05.570> looper

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
fact then what I've got then is a looper

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.680 
fact then what I've got then is a looper
that's<00:06:06.200> MIDI<00:06:06.410> synced<00:06:06.920> to<00:06:07.250> my<00:06:07.970> computer<00:06:08.420> served

if I want them and also I have an iPad
running<00:06:15.050> obviously<00:06:15.740> alchemy<00:06:16.370> I've<00:06:16.520> got<00:06:16.670> an

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:16.790 
running obviously alchemy I've got an

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.150 
running obviously alchemy I've got an
amalgam<00:06:17.270> there<00:06:17.510> as<00:06:17.720> well<00:06:17.930> and<00:06:18.170> a<00:06:18.200> step

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
amalgam there as well and a step

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:28.000 
amalgam there as well and a step
sequencer<00:06:20.620> sorry<00:06:21.620> second<00:06:26.350> okay

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.010 
sequencer sorry second okay

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.310 
sequencer sorry second okay
so<00:06:29.000> what's<00:06:29.180> interesting<00:06:29.330> about<00:06:29.660> this<00:06:29.990> then<00:06:30.170> is

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.320 
so what's interesting about this then is

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.260 
so what's interesting about this then is
is<00:06:30.620> that<00:06:30.890> once<00:06:31.340> you<00:06:31.460> have<00:06:31.610> the<00:06:31.700> MIDI<00:06:31.850> sync

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.270 
is that once you have the MIDI sync

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.450 
is that once you have the MIDI sync
coming<00:06:32.690> from<00:06:32.930> the<00:06:33.110> iconic<00:06:33.500> MIDI<00:06:33.740> to<00:06:34.040> into<00:06:34.310> this

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
coming from the iconic MIDI to into this

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.860 
coming from the iconic MIDI to into this
into<00:06:35.300> the<00:06:35.390> iPad<00:06:36.250> you<00:06:37.250> can<00:06:37.400> have<00:06:37.640> time<00:06:38.450> synced

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:38.870 
into the iPad you can have time synced

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.500 
into the iPad you can have time synced
or<00:06:39.080> beat<00:06:39.350> synced<00:06:39.800> a<00:06:40.060> sequence<00:06:41.060> they're<00:06:41.240> coming

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:41.510 
or beat synced a sequence they're coming

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.290 
or beat synced a sequence they're coming
through<00:06:41.690> from<00:06:41.870> they're<00:06:42.760> all<00:06:43.760> linked<00:06:44.150> up<00:06:44.270> with

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300 
through from they're all linked up with

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.860 
through from they're all linked up with
the<00:06:44.590> machine<00:06:45.590> and<00:06:45.770> into<00:06:46.010> my<00:06:46.250> my<00:06:46.790> my<00:06:47.450> looper<00:06:47.780> as
