suggest<00:01:23.759> about<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.330> game<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.780> if<00:01:25.229> you

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
suggest about this game is that if you

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.870 
suggest about this game is that if you
were<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.710> play<00:01:26.130> with<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> couple<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.729> your

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
were to play with a couple of your

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.999 
were to play with a couple of your
friends<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.720> would<00:01:27.960> begin<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.290> lag<00:01:28.710> just

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
friends it would begin to lag just

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.700 
friends it would begin to lag just
because<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.460> game<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:30.270> very<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.990> wouldn't<00:01:31.650> say

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
because the game is very I wouldn't say

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.999 
because the game is very I wouldn't say
very<00:01:32.070> built<00:01:32.630> very<00:01:33.630> good<00:01:33.990> it's<00:01:34.650> just<00:01:34.829> mine

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
very built very good it's just mine

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.640 
very built very good it's just mine
craft<00:01:35.280> itself<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.689> know<00:01:36.780> quite<00:01:37.049> laggy<00:01:37.350> and

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
craft itself is you know quite laggy and

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.100 
craft itself is you know quite laggy and
the<00:01:38.280> mics<00:01:38.520> will<00:01:38.790> also<00:01:39.090> get<00:01:39.240> messed<00:01:39.479> up<00:01:39.600> as<00:01:39.810> well

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
the mics will also get messed up as well

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.450 
the mics will also get messed up as well
just<00:01:40.409> because<00:01:40.680> there's<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.890> lot<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.130> stuff<00:01:41.430> to

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
just because there's a lot of stuff to

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.639 
just because there's a lot of stuff to
render<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.090> there's<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.270> lot<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.600> walks<00:01:43.320> that

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
render and there's a lot of walks that

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.649 
render and there's a lot of walks that
are<00:01:43.799> actually<00:01:43.920> placed<00:01:44.399> on<00:01:44.549> this<00:01:44.759> map<00:01:44.970> so<00:01:45.630> that

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
are actually placed on this map so that

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.149 
are actually placed on this map so that
would<00:01:45.869> be<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.020> only<00:01:46.170> bad<00:01:46.560> thing<00:01:46.590> about<00:01:46.829> this

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
would be the only bad thing about this

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.179 
would be the only bad thing about this
map<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.640> have<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.060> say<00:01:48.240> it's<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.509> lot<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:48.840> a

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
map that I have to say it's a lot of a

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.950 
map that I have to say it's a lot of a
lot<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.340> blocks<00:01:50.610> definitely<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.509> put<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.750> lot

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
lot of blocks definitely and put a lot

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.359 
lot of blocks definitely and put a lot
