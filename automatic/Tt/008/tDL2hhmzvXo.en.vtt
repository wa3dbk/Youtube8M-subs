00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
with a little bit of a gap in between

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.640 
with a little bit of a gap in between
the<00:04:01.299> clusters<00:04:01.750> and<00:04:02.019> you<00:04:02.950> can<00:04:03.130> use<00:04:03.430> this<00:04:03.970> kind

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
you just literally take off one little

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.199 
you just literally take off one little
hair<00:04:07.750> and<00:04:08.079> you<00:04:08.920> place<00:04:09.160> it<00:04:09.190> in<00:04:09.489> between<00:04:09.670> where

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
hair and you place it in between where

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:11.670 
hair and you place it in between where
you<00:04:10.299> have<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:10.600> gap<00:04:10.810> and<00:04:11.079> it<00:04:11.200> kind<00:04:11.410> of<00:04:11.470> fills

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
you have the gap and it kind of fills

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.720 
you have the gap and it kind of fills
that<00:04:11.890> in<00:04:12.100> and<00:04:12.340> blends<00:04:12.549> it<00:04:12.730> in<00:04:14.190> so<00:04:15.190> I<00:04:15.220> picked<00:04:15.609> up

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
that in and blends it in so I picked up

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.539
