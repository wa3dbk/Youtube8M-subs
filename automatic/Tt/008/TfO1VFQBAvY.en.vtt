I<00:00:03.519> recently<00:00:04.519> picked<00:00:04.850> up<00:00:05.000> another

00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:05.359 
I recently picked up another

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:07.570 
I recently picked up another
colecovision<00:00:06.080> console<00:00:06.590> that<00:00:07.219> was<00:00:07.399> pretty

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:07.580 
colecovision console that was pretty

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.749 
colecovision console that was pretty
much<00:00:07.760> do<00:00:08.059> a<00:00:09.099> try<00:00:10.099> to<00:00:10.160> see<00:00:10.309> if<00:00:10.370> I<00:00:10.429> figure<00:00:10.730> out

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:10.759 
much do a try to see if I figure out

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:14.169 
much do a try to see if I figure out
what<00:00:11.330> is<00:00:11.539> the<00:00:11.719> problem<00:00:12.759> after<00:00:13.759> open<00:00:13.969> up<00:00:14.059> the

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:14.179 
what is the problem after open up the

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.990 
what is the problem after open up the
ColecoVision<00:00:14.509> I'm<00:00:15.019> going<00:00:15.349> to<00:00:15.440> test<00:00:15.679> the<00:00:16.000> three

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
ColecoVision I'm going to test the three

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.790 
ColecoVision I'm going to test the three
power<00:00:17.270> rails<00:00:18.490> black<00:00:19.490> is-<00:00:20.180> registry<00:00:21.110> 12<00:00:21.410> volts

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
power rails black is- registry 12 volts

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.060 
power rails black is- registry 12 volts
blue<00:00:22.490> should<00:00:22.850> be<00:00:23.000> minus<00:00:23.510> 5<00:00:23.720> volts<00:00:24.170> and<00:00:24.350> white

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
blue should be minus 5 volts and white

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.450 
blue should be minus 5 volts and white
should<00:00:25.370> be<00:00:25.490> positive<00:00:26.150> 5<00:00:26.390> volts<00:00:27.220> see<00:00:28.220> what<00:00:28.370> we

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
should be positive 5 volts see what we

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.830 
should be positive 5 volts see what we
got<00:00:28.670> here

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.810 

no<00:00:32.840> those<00:00:33.170> the<00:00:33.379> 12<00:00:33.710> on<00:00:33.950> the<00:00:34.010> red<00:00:34.160> wire<00:00:36.190> yeah<00:00:37.190> -

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
no those the 12 on the red wire yeah -

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.740 
no those the 12 on the red wire yeah -
how<00:00:38.060> much<00:00:38.180> -<00:00:38.390> 5<00:00:38.780> on<00:00:38.990> the<00:00:39.050> blue<00:00:39.230> wire

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.119 

we<00:00:44.750> have<00:00:44.899> 242<00:00:45.620> millivolts<00:00:46.040> in<00:00:46.129> the<00:00:46.190> light<00:00:46.340> wire

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
we have 242 millivolts in the light wire

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:50.920 
we have 242 millivolts in the light wire
so<00:00:49.129> I'm<00:00:49.220> missing<00:00:49.399> my<00:00:49.640> 5<00:00:49.940> volt<00:00:50.210> rail<00:00:50.449> this<00:00:50.809> is

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
so I'm missing my 5 volt rail this is

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.540 
so I'm missing my 5 volt rail this is
why<00:00:51.110> the<00:00:51.170> cleavage<00:00:51.800> is<00:00:51.860> I'm<00:00:52.129> going<00:00:52.280> to<00:00:52.340> power

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
why the cleavage is I'm going to power

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.830 
why the cleavage is I'm going to power
up<00:00:52.730> all<00:00:52.910> the<00:00:53.030> way<00:00:54.730> next<00:00:55.730> I'm<00:00:55.970> gonna<00:00:56.329> cut<00:00:56.540> apart

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
up all the way next I'm gonna cut apart

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.000 
up all the way next I'm gonna cut apart
the<00:00:57.730> power<00:00:58.730> supply<00:00:59.530> and<00:01:00.530> check<00:01:00.829> the

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
the power supply and check the

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.210 
the power supply and check the
components<00:01:01.460> inside<00:01:02.860> cut<00:01:03.860> over<00:01:04.100> the

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
components inside cut over the

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.800 
components inside cut over the
ColecoVision<00:01:04.460> power<00:01:04.940> supply<00:01:05.390> with<00:01:05.690> the

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
ColecoVision power supply with the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.120 
ColecoVision power supply with the
dremel<00:01:06.170> tool

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.850 

there's<00:01:10.700> the<00:01:10.820> three<00:01:11.030> power<00:01:11.299> regulators<00:01:11.990> on

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
there's the three power regulators on

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.539 
there's the three power regulators on
here<00:01:13.600> one<00:01:14.600> took<00:01:14.930> them<00:01:15.140> back<00:01:15.290> here<00:01:16.009> right<00:01:17.110> there

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
here one took them back here right there

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:23.649 
here one took them back here right there
and<00:01:19.549> then<00:01:19.759> one<00:01:19.970> right<00:01:21.009> yeah<00:01:22.149> so<00:01:23.149> we'll<00:01:23.270> flip<00:01:23.479> it

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
and then one right yeah so we'll flip it

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.700 
and then one right yeah so we'll flip it
over<00:01:23.780> and<00:01:23.930> check<00:01:24.440> them<00:01:25.930> all<00:01:26.930> right<00:01:27.170> it's<00:01:27.500> types

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
over and check them all right it's types

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.550 
over and check them all right it's types
of<00:01:27.830> different<00:01:28.130> converters<00:01:28.520> here<00:01:29.350> effect<00:01:30.350> the

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
of different converters here effect the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.399 
of different converters here effect the
horrible<00:01:31.159> converter

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.639 

that's<00:01:38.009> what<00:01:38.250> once<00:01:38.430> there<00:01:39.110> get<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.259> negative

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
that's what once there get the negative

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:46.510 
that's what once there get the negative
five<00:01:40.860> volts

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.940 

yeah

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
yeah

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.420 
yeah
right<00:01:48.340> there<00:01:48.550> let's<00:01:48.909> check<00:01:49.120> the<00:01:49.270> Bible<00:01:50.130> why

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.260 

Oh

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.380 

there's<00:01:57.140> my<00:01:57.290> problem<00:01:57.500> right<00:01:57.740> there<00:01:58.090> only<00:01:59.090> have

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
there's my problem right there only have

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.960 
there's my problem right there only have
1<00:01:59.600> volt<00:01:59.810> come<00:02:00.020> out<00:02:00.140> of<00:02:00.200> that<00:02:00.259> regulator<00:02:00.880> see<00:02:01.880> if

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
1 volt come out of that regulator see if

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.880 
1 volt come out of that regulator see if
they<00:02:02.060> got<00:02:02.180> a<00:02:02.240> bad<00:02:02.450> regulator<00:02:02.990> or<00:02:03.530> I've<00:02:03.710> got<00:02:03.740> a

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
they got a bad regulator or I've got a

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.300 
they got a bad regulator or I've got a
bad<00:02:04.100> connection<00:02:04.430> I<00:02:05.830> push<00:02:06.830> on<00:02:07.009> it

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
bad connection I push on it

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.080 
bad connection I push on it
Oh<00:02:07.340> make<00:02:07.939> an<00:02:08.090> exit<00:02:08.390> 5<00:02:08.599> volts<00:02:09.050> and<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:10.759> system

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
Oh make an exit 5 volts and the system

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:18.010 
Oh make an exit 5 volts and the system
is<00:02:11.209> trying<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.540> power<00:02:11.810> up<00:02:12.020> now<00:02:12.640> it<00:02:13.640> did

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.460 

there<00:02:18.590> we<00:02:18.710> go<00:02:19.130> all<00:02:19.970> right<00:02:20.150> I'll<00:02:20.930> just<00:02:21.110> have<00:02:21.290> to

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
there we go all right I'll just have to

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.110 
there we go all right I'll just have to
resolder<00:02:21.980> that<00:02:22.220> connection<00:02:22.430> and<00:02:22.790> I'll<00:02:22.880> have<00:02:23.090> a

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
resolder that connection and I'll have a

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.930 
resolder that connection and I'll have a
working<00:02:23.480> power<00:02:23.660> supply<00:02:23.990> again<00:02:24.700> now<00:02:25.700> they<00:02:25.820> got

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
working power supply again now they got

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.730 
working power supply again now they got
the<00:02:26.060> loose<00:02:26.210> connections<00:02:26.750> fixed<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.470> see<00:02:27.650> if

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
the loose connections fixed and see if

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.420 
the loose connections fixed and see if
it<00:02:27.830> powers<00:02:28.160> up

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.430 

excellent
