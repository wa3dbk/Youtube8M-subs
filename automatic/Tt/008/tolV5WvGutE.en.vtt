style and sound in which you don't give

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:37.430

life the bag is actually nice in that
it's<00:03:08.490> got<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.670> nice<00:03:08.940> easy<00:03:09.510> drawstring<00:03:10.290> right

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
it's got a nice easy drawstring right

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.440 
it's got a nice easy drawstring right
here<00:03:10.740> that<00:03:10.920> allows<00:03:11.130> you<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.520> close<00:03:12.090> it<00:03:12.240> around

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
here that allows you to close it around

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.270 
here that allows you to close it around
the<00:03:12.570> headphones<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.050> cable<00:03:13.440> and<00:03:13.620> there's<00:03:14.220> a

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
the headphones and cable and there's a

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.150 
the headphones and cable and there's a
carabiner<00:03:14.820> here<00:03:15.660> so<00:03:16.020> you<00:03:16.080> can<00:03:16.290> actually<00:03:16.320> hook

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
carabiner here so you can actually hook

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.370 
carabiner here so you can actually hook
it<00:03:17.190> to<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:18.030> outside<00:03:18.180> of<00:03:18.390> your<00:03:18.510> bag<00:03:18.780> where<00:03:19.350> I

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
it to the outside of your bag where I

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.990 
it to the outside of your bag where I
guess<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.160> headphones<00:03:20.490> can<00:03:20.610> get<00:03:20.730> stolen

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
guess the headphones can get stolen

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.460 
guess the headphones can get stolen
easily<00:03:21.450> if<00:03:21.540> you're<00:03:21.630> not<00:03:21.750> paying<00:03:21.930> attention<00:03:21.990> so

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
easily if you're not paying attention so

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.830 
easily if you're not paying attention so
there's<00:03:23.250> a<00:03:23.340> carabiner<00:03:23.760> here<00:03:24.000> so<00:03:24.240> let's

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
there's a carabiner here so let's

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:25.880 
there's a carabiner here so let's
actually<00:03:25.050> talk<00:03:25.350> about<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.710> headphones

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
actually talk about the headphones

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.790 
actually talk about the headphones
themselves<00:03:26.250> I<00:03:26.790> like<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:27.990> way<00:03:28.110> these<00:03:28.290> look<00:03:28.560> and

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
themselves I like the way these look and

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.330 
themselves I like the way these look and
like<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.640> small<00:03:30.030> style<00:03:30.540> of<00:03:30.870> them<00:03:31.260> when<00:03:32.160> they

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
like the small style of them when they

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.660 
like the small style of them when they
fold<00:03:32.970> open<00:03:33.860> you<00:03:34.860> can<00:03:35.010> see<00:03:35.250> that<00:03:35.460> they're

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
fold open you can see that they're

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.850 
fold open you can see that they're
really<00:03:36.000> very<00:03:36.150> striking<00:03:36.750> in<00:03:36.840> appearance<00:03:37.230> they

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
really very striking in appearance they

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.470 
really very striking in appearance they
have<00:03:38.070> a<00:03:38.100> shape<00:03:38.430> that's<00:03:38.670> neither<00:03:38.850> round<00:03:39.240> nor

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
have a shape that's neither round nor

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.420 
have a shape that's neither round nor
oval<00:03:40.080> the<00:03:40.260> company<00:03:40.590> talks<00:03:40.800> about<00:03:41.040> that<00:03:41.160> quite

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
oval the company talks about that quite

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.810 
oval the company talks about that quite
a<00:03:41.490> bit

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
a bit

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.480 
a bit
they're<00:03:42.270> triangular<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.310> something<00:03:44.310> much

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
they're triangular and something much

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.960 
they're triangular and something much
bigger

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
bigger

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.030 
bigger
I<00:03:45.170> think<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.260> triangle<00:03:46.590> looks<00:03:46.800> really

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
I think the triangle looks really

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.940 
I think the triangle looks really
smaller<00:03:47.580> it<00:03:48.150> would<00:03:48.270> look<00:03:48.390> kind<00:03:48.570> of<00:03:48.690> why<00:03:49.560> do<00:03:49.620> it

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
smaller it would look kind of why do it

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.950 
smaller it would look kind of why do it
this<00:03:50.400> is<00:03:50.460> actually<00:03:50.730> nice<00:03:51.060> size<00:03:51.360> where<00:03:51.720> it

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:51.960 
this is actually nice size where it

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.420 
this is actually nice size where it
really<00:03:52.170> does<00:03:52.350> give<00:03:52.530> a<00:03:52.560> nice<00:03:52.770> style<00:03:53.100> to<00:03:53.310> the

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
really does give a nice style to the

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.490 
really does give a nice style to the
headphones<00:03:53.790> I<00:03:54.090> should<00:03:54.780> note<00:03:54.990> that<00:03:55.020> these<00:03:55.290> are

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
headphones I should note that these are

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.780 
headphones I should note that these are
the<00:03:55.590> white<00:03:55.770> tuxedo<00:03:56.220> version<00:03:56.610> of<00:03:56.700> the

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
the white tuxedo version of the

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.940 
the white tuxedo version of the
headphones<00:03:57.180> they<00:03:57.780> actually<00:03:58.320> come<00:03:58.560> with<00:03:58.590> lots

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950

and lots of different finishes you can
get<00:04:00.420> them<00:04:00.540> all<00:04:00.750> black<00:04:01.080> so<00:04:01.500> it'd<00:04:01.590> be<00:04:01.710> very

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
get them all black so it'd be very

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.320 
get them all black so it'd be very
understated<00:04:02.370> you<00:04:02.850> can<00:04:02.970> get<00:04:03.060> them<00:04:03.180> with<00:04:03.300> a

lots of options these are style focused
headphones<00:04:09.860> that<00:04:10.860> sound<00:04:11.190> good<00:04:11.400> but<00:04:11.850> their

so well that they're noise-isolating I

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.749 
so well that they're noise-isolating I
actually<00:04:32.050> have<00:04:32.560> having<00:04:32.830> a<00:04:32.919> hard<00:04:33.130> time<00:04:33.370> hearing

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 
actually have having a hard time hearing

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:35.730 
actually have having a hard time hearing
myself<00:04:34.030> whether<00:04:34.900> he's<00:04:35.020> run<00:04:35.229> even<00:04:35.650> though

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
myself whether he's run even though

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.260 
myself whether he's run even though
there's<00:04:35.919> no<00:04:36.069> active<00:04:36.490> noise<00:04:36.639> cancellation

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
there's no active noise cancellation

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.290 
there's no active noise cancellation
that's<00:04:38.110> a<00:04:38.289> really<00:04:38.710> nice<00:04:38.919> benefit<00:04:39.610> with<00:04:40.030> a<00:04:40.060> head

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
that's a really nice benefit with a head

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.180 
that's a really nice benefit with a head
front<00:04:40.539> like<00:04:40.720> this<00:04:40.960> you<00:04:41.380> don't<00:04:41.500> have<00:04:41.800> to<00:04:42.009> have

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
front like this you don't have to have

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.490 
front like this you don't have to have
the<00:04:42.340> noise<00:04:42.490> cancellation<00:04:43.180> you<00:04:43.599> want<00:04:44.229> that<00:04:44.380> on

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
the noise cancellation you want that on

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.900 
the noise cancellation you want that on
a<00:04:44.530> plane<00:04:44.800> but<00:04:44.979> you<00:04:45.039> don't<00:04:45.220> need<00:04:45.400> that<00:04:45.550> most<00:04:45.759> of

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
a plane but you don't need that most of

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.969 
a plane but you don't need that most of
the<00:04:46.000> time<00:04:46.210> these<00:04:46.690> actually<00:04:47.110> do<00:04:47.199> a<00:04:47.229> good<00:04:47.500> job<00:04:47.740> of

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
the time these actually do a good job of

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.270 
the time these actually do a good job of
blocking<00:04:48.610> out<00:04:49.000> the<00:04:49.240> outside<00:04:49.690> sound<00:04:50.199> and<00:04:51.009> also

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
blocking out the outside sound and also

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.890 
blocking out the outside sound and also
allow<00:04:51.789> you<00:04:51.849> to<00:04:52.030> hear<00:04:52.419> what<00:04:52.599> you're<00:04:52.750> listening

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
allow you to hear what you're listening

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.210 
allow you to hear what you're listening
to<00:04:53.110> without<00:04:53.440> having<00:04:53.470> to<00:04:53.770> raise<00:04:53.889> the<00:04:54.099> volume

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
to without having to raise the volume

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.850 
to without having to raise the volume
too<00:04:54.699> much<00:04:55.080> especially<00:04:56.080> since<00:04:56.349> hearing<00:04:56.590> loss

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
too much especially since hearing loss

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.490 
too much especially since hearing loss
is<00:04:57.130> something<00:04:57.699> that<00:04:58.120> we<00:04:58.660> should<00:04:58.930> be<00:04:58.960> concerned

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
is something that we should be concerned

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.649 
is something that we should be concerned
about<00:04:59.759> especially<00:05:00.759> when<00:05:00.940> so<00:05:01.150> many<00:05:01.330> of<00:05:01.449> us<00:05:01.539> are

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:01.659 
about especially when so many of us are

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:04.620 
about especially when so many of us are
using<00:05:02.020> earbuds<00:05:02.500> and<00:05:02.740> headphones<00:05:03.639> and<00:05:03.940> at

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
using earbuds and headphones and at

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.219 
using earbuds and headphones and at
times<00:05:04.840> listen<00:05:05.169> to<00:05:05.259> music<00:05:05.349> way<00:05:05.650> too<00:05:05.710> loud<00:05:07.229> there

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
times listen to music way too loud there

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.140 
times listen to music way too loud there
are<00:05:08.259> obviously<00:05:08.860> no<00:05:08.949> controls<00:05:09.520> on<00:05:09.970> the

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
are obviously no controls on the

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.790 
are obviously no controls on the
headphones<00:05:10.569> they<00:05:10.900> don't<00:05:11.050> need<00:05:11.259> them<00:05:11.470> because

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
headphones they don't need them because

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.070 
headphones they don't need them because
these<00:05:11.979> are<00:05:12.159> wired<00:05:12.400> headphones<00:05:12.729> you<00:05:13.509> do<00:05:13.750> have

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
these are wired headphones you do have

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
two inputs 3.5 millimeter on either here

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.330 
two inputs 3.5 millimeter on either here
that's<00:05:20.259> a<00:05:20.440> really<00:05:20.650> nice<00:05:20.800> feature<00:05:21.069> because

that's a really nice feature because
first<00:05:21.789> and<00:05:21.940> foremost<00:05:22.060> it<00:05:23.020> means<00:05:23.289> you<00:05:23.530> can<00:05:23.710> plug

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:23.949
