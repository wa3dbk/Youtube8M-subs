00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
hey this is chase from shot science calm

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.900 
hey this is chase from shot science calm
and<00:00:39.230> welcome<00:00:39.590> to<00:00:39.680> part<00:00:39.950> 4<00:00:40.220> the<00:00:40.370> vertical<00:00:40.760> leap

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
and welcome to part 4 the vertical leap

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.130 
and welcome to part 4 the vertical leap
series<00:00:41.300> where<00:00:41.480> we're<00:00:41.600> gonna<00:00:41.660> be<00:00:41.840> talking

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
series where we're gonna be talking

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.350 
series where we're gonna be talking
about<00:00:42.230> power<00:00:42.620> and<00:00:43.010> how<00:00:43.489> to<00:00:43.550> translate<00:00:44.090> the

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
about power and how to translate the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.600 
about power and how to translate the
first<00:00:44.660> three<00:00:44.900> segments<00:00:45.379> into<00:00:45.920> game<00:00:46.190> speed

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
first three segments into game speed

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:58.720 
first three segments into game speed
specific<00:00:47.239> training<00:00:57.400> now<00:00:58.400> when<00:00:58.519> we're<00:00:58.610> talking

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
specific training now when we're talking

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.490 
specific training now when we're talking
about<00:00:59.000> power<00:00:59.269> training<00:00:59.839> we're<00:00:59.960> talking<00:01:00.260> more

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
about power training we're talking more

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.340 
about power training we're talking more
about<00:01:00.680> game<00:01:01.580> speed<00:01:02.089> training<00:01:02.570> so<00:01:03.230> we're

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
about game speed training so we're

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.860 
about game speed training so we're
trying<00:01:03.589> to<00:01:03.710> improve<00:01:03.800> our<00:01:04.400> force<00:01:05.330> production

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
trying to improve our force production

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.960 
trying to improve our force production
over<00:01:06.080> a<00:01:06.140> shorter<00:01:06.590> period<00:01:06.950> of<00:01:06.980> time<00:01:07.070> which<00:01:07.820> will

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
over a shorter period of time which will

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.340 
over a shorter period of time which will
translate<00:01:08.300> to<00:01:08.480> the<00:01:08.570> game<00:01:08.750> itself

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
translate to the game itself

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.440 
translate to the game itself
now<00:01:09.770> power<00:01:10.040> training<00:01:10.460> is<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:10.729> basis<00:01:11.060> for<00:01:11.210> most

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
now power training is the basis for most

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.360 
now power training is the basis for most
jump<00:01:11.930> programs<00:01:12.409> that<00:01:12.590> are<00:01:12.710> out<00:01:12.830> there<00:01:12.860> and

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
jump programs that are out there and

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.520 
jump programs that are out there and
what<00:01:13.700> they<00:01:13.850> fail<00:01:14.180> to<00:01:14.450> address<00:01:14.720> is<00:01:15.140> a<00:01:15.200> three

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
what they fail to address is a three

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.899 
what they fail to address is a three
previous<00:01:16.040> segments<00:01:16.460> that<00:01:16.520> we've<00:01:16.670> talked

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
previous segments that we've talked

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:18.490 
previous segments that we've talked
about<00:01:17.000> in<00:01:17.300> this<00:01:17.420> introduction<00:01:17.840> vertical<00:01:18.350> leap

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
about in this introduction vertical leap

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.560 
about in this introduction vertical leap
series<00:01:18.890> so<00:01:19.430> we<00:01:19.520> talked<00:01:19.700> about<00:01:19.790> mobility<00:01:20.420> and

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
series so we talked about mobility and

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.390 
series so we talked about mobility and
stability<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:21.350> strength<00:01:21.650> development<00:01:21.740> and

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
stability and strength development and

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.100 
stability and strength development and
that<00:01:22.880> really<00:01:23.090> helps<00:01:23.390> us<00:01:23.509> build<00:01:23.750> a<00:01:23.930> good

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
that really helps us build a good

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.410 
that really helps us build a good
foundation<00:01:24.350> to<00:01:24.890> improve<00:01:25.340> our<00:01:25.520> power<00:01:25.759> through

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
foundation to improve our power through

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.440 
foundation to improve our power through
these<00:01:26.570> power<00:01:26.810> training<00:01:27.259> exercises<00:01:28.450> now

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
these power training exercises now

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.969 
these power training exercises now
jumping<00:01:29.780> straight<00:01:29.930> into<00:01:30.020> a<00:01:30.259> power<00:01:30.560> training

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
jumping straight into a power training

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.709 
jumping straight into a power training
program<00:01:31.460> without<00:01:31.610> first<00:01:32.000> addressing<00:01:32.210> those

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
program without first addressing those

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:34.209 
program without first addressing those
three<00:01:33.020> pillars<00:01:33.259> that<00:01:33.500> we<00:01:33.710> talked<00:01:33.920> about<00:01:33.979> in

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:34.219 
three pillars that we talked about in

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:36.100 
three pillars that we talked about in
the<00:01:34.280> previous<00:01:34.490> videos<00:01:35.000> that<00:01:35.630> really<00:01:35.869> build

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
the previous videos that really build

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.749 
the previous videos that really build
our<00:01:36.320> foundation<00:01:36.500> for<00:01:37.130> a<00:01:37.159> vertical<00:01:37.399> jump

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
our foundation for a vertical jump

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.850 
our foundation for a vertical jump
program<00:01:37.880> will<00:01:38.780> likely<00:01:39.020> lead<00:01:39.350> to<00:01:39.380> limited

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
program will likely lead to limited

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.830 
program will likely lead to limited
results<00:01:40.189> and<00:01:40.670> can<00:01:41.090> potentially<00:01:41.479> lead<00:01:41.810> to

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
results and can potentially lead to

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.200 
results and can potentially lead to
injuries<00:01:42.610> now<00:01:43.610> there's<00:01:43.789> thousands<00:01:44.119> of

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
injuries now there's thousands of

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.510 
injuries now there's thousands of
exercises<00:01:44.840> out<00:01:44.960> there<00:01:45.020> that<00:01:45.380> focus<00:01:45.740> on<00:01:46.100> power

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
exercises out there that focus on power

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.609 
exercises out there that focus on power
development<00:01:47.149> however<00:01:47.840> we<00:01:47.990> think<00:01:48.200> it's<00:01:48.320> much

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
development however we think it's much

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.020 
development however we think it's much
more<00:01:48.680> important<00:01:49.399> to<00:01:49.430> develop<00:01:49.850> that

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
more important to develop that

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.090 
more important to develop that
foundation<00:01:50.960> of<00:01:51.079> vertical<00:01:51.469> leap<00:01:51.619> training

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
foundation of vertical leap training

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.550 
foundation of vertical leap training
with<00:01:52.579> our<00:01:52.789> mobility<00:01:53.119> stability<00:01:53.960> and<00:01:54.200> strength

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
with our mobility stability and strength

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.469 
with our mobility stability and strength
so<00:01:54.859> once<00:01:55.789> you've<00:01:55.939> established<00:01:56.060> that

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
so once you've established that

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.300 
so once you've established that
foundation<00:01:57.079> you've<00:01:57.259> gone<00:01:57.469> through<00:01:57.829> two<00:01:58.189> to

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
foundation you've gone through two to

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.740 
foundation you've gone through two to
three<00:01:58.460> months<00:01:58.700> of<00:01:58.820> training<00:01:59.060> on<00:01:59.329> that<00:01:59.509> check

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750
