00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
stuff like that it does that way to does

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.160 
stuff like that it does that way to does
generate<00:04:37.670> your<00:04:37.940> flight<00:04:38.330> time<00:04:38.570> quite<00:04:38.900> a<00:04:38.930> bit

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
generate your flight time quite a bit

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.110 
generate your flight time quite a bit
when<00:04:39.950> I<00:04:39.980> have<00:04:40.190> that<00:04:40.370> gimbal<00:04:40.700> on<00:04:40.790> there

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
when I have that gimbal on there

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.390 
when I have that gimbal on there
originally<00:04:41.690> I<00:04:42.080> had

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
originally I had

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.790 
originally I had
prop<00:04:43.940> guards<00:04:44.270> on<00:04:44.450> it<00:04:44.570> also<00:04:44.750> I<00:04:45.260> was<00:04:45.530> fine<00:04:45.770> with

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
prop guards on it also I was fine with

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.719 
prop guards on it also I was fine with
full<00:04:46.190> batteries

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:50.269 

employing

00:04:50.269 --> 00:04:50.279 
employing

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:53.599 
employing
so<00:04:51.049> that<00:04:52.049> wasn't<00:04:52.469> what<00:04:52.799> I<00:04:52.829> really<00:04:52.919> expected

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:53.609 
so that wasn't what I really expected

00:04:53.609 --> 00:04:55.459 
so that wasn't what I really expected
out<00:04:53.789> of<00:04:53.939> it<00:04:54.059> so<00:04:54.239> I<00:04:54.329> don't<00:04:54.539> know

00:04:55.459 --> 00:04:55.469 
out of it so I don't know

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:57.979 
out of it so I don't know
something<00:04:56.279> going<00:04:56.489> on<00:04:56.610> but<00:04:56.849> I<00:04:56.879> took<00:04:56.939> the<00:04:57.269> prop

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:57.989 
something going on but I took the prop

00:04:57.989 --> 00:05:00.409 
something going on but I took the prop
guards<00:04:58.319> off<00:04:58.499> I<00:04:58.879> went<00:04:59.879> back<00:05:00.059> to<00:05:00.089> the<00:05:00.330> original

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
guards off I went back to the original

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:05.300 
guards off I went back to the original

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
there where to go from has a compass on

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.290 
there where to go from has a compass on
it<00:05:32.320> which<00:05:33.320> I<00:05:33.710> heard<00:05:34.100> that<00:05:34.340> every<00:05:34.550> 20<00:05:35.060> flights

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
it which I heard that every 20 flights

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.820 
it which I heard that every 20 flights
or<00:05:35.600> so<00:05:35.750> you<00:05:35.960> need<00:05:36.140> to<00:05:36.230> recalibrate<00:05:36.590> your

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.290 
or so you need to recalibrate your
compass<00:05:37.340> just<00:05:37.520> to<00:05:37.670> make<00:05:37.790> sure<00:05:37.940> it's<00:05:38.090> a<00:05:38.150> good

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
compass just to make sure it's a good

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.350 
compass just to make sure it's a good
flying<00:05:38.570> condition<00:05:39.050> I'd<00:05:39.230> do<00:05:39.440> that<00:05:40.120> if<00:05:41.120> I<00:05:41.300> was

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
flying condition I'd do that if I was

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.800 
flying condition I'd do that if I was
