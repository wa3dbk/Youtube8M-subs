have the most movement you know I mean
like<00:03:37.549> around<00:03:37.880> the<00:03:38.000> eyes<00:03:38.120> and<00:03:38.150> around<00:03:38.540> the

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
like around the eyes and around the

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.650 
like around the eyes and around the
mouth<00:03:39.340> not<00:03:40.340> as<00:03:40.489> much<00:03:40.730> up<00:03:41.090> here<00:03:41.329> because<00:03:41.480> there

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
mouth not as much up here because there

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.940 
mouth not as much up here because there
isn't<00:03:41.900> as<00:03:41.959> much<00:03:41.989> movement<00:03:42.320> because<00:03:42.739> of<00:03:42.769> the

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
isn't as much movement because of the

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.539 
isn't as much movement because of the
Botox<00:03:43.130> and<00:03:43.579> things<00:03:43.790> like<00:03:43.970> that<00:03:44.030> but<00:03:45.400> it<00:03:46.400> is

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
Botox and things like that but it is

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.170 
Botox and things like that but it is
also<00:03:46.880> hard<00:03:47.209> to<00:03:47.299> find<00:03:47.810> the<00:03:48.200> time<00:03:48.560> to<00:03:49.519> fit<00:03:49.790> appeal

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
also hard to find the time to fit appeal

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.670 
also hard to find the time to fit appeal
in<00:03:50.359> because<00:03:50.690> going<00:03:50.989> to<00:03:51.140> get<00:03:51.260> the<00:03:51.380> peel<00:03:51.530> is

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
in because going to get the peel is

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.710 
in because going to get the peel is
nothing<00:03:52.040> it<00:03:52.190> takes<00:03:52.400> probably<00:03:52.670> 30<00:03:53.209> minutes<00:03:53.600> I

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
nothing it takes probably 30 minutes I

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.979 
nothing it takes probably 30 minutes I
would<00:03:53.870> guess<00:03:54.130> but<00:03:55.180> it<00:03:56.180> is<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:56.750> time

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
would guess but it is the time

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.590 
would guess but it is the time
afterwards<00:03:57.650> the<00:03:57.890> first<00:03:57.920> day<00:03:58.310> afterwards<00:03:58.819> like

not more so than the peels if I could

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.090 
not more so than the peels if I could
only<00:05:30.580> keep<00:05:30.850> one<00:05:30.910> I<00:05:31.600> would<00:05:32.020> keep<00:05:32.170> my<00:05:32.320> daily<00:05:32.560> skin

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.380 
care over the peels the peels are just
kind<00:05:35.260> of<00:05:35.380> an<00:05:35.470> added<00:05:35.800> bonus<00:05:35.950> as<00:05:36.370> I<00:05:36.670> get<00:05:36.820> older<00:05:37.120> we

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
kind of an added bonus as I get older we

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.660 
kind of an added bonus as I get older we
lose<00:05:37.420> elasticity<00:05:38.110> in<00:05:38.440> our<00:05:38.530> skin<00:05:38.590> and<00:05:38.980> also

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:39.670

over<00:06:36.610> it<00:06:36.700> because<00:06:36.820> it<00:06:36.970> just<00:06:37.210> makes<00:06:37.390> it<00:06:37.510> look

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:37.660 
over it because it just makes it look

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:38.679
