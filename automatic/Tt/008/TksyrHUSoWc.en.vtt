 sea 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:19.339
 after the first years this new 21st century 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.779
 the sociopolitical changes that have been located in the West and in the world 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:24.609
 whole 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.560
 brand new ideological and cultural philosophical esparta 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.090
 obviously it has been compressed 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.240
 growing globalization and communication networks have strengthened ties 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.280
 with the rest of the civilizations of the planet 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.440
 and the exchanges are perceived day by day as an inescapable phenomenon 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.160
 I the same global phenomenon has not limited exchange exchange actions 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.920
 commercial 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.530
 the plurality of approaches regarding diverse topics such as 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.460
 is that entity 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.620
 and carradine racial issues these days 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.480
 brings with it a tiara the philosophical synthesis program 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.950
 that will lead to the plane of politics has been drawn as a new attitude of the 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.420
 of inquisitive seclusion 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.720
 it is more powerful and strong as a livelihood 10 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.110
 asked to join him 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.860
 it seems almost impossible 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.860
 running the risk of falling into the accusation of heresy 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.670
 in this documentary 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.970
 let's analyze the new religion of the 21st century 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.970
 human rights 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.560
 aa 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:19.559
 the students the countries 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.349
 we can perceive that the media and political push 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.139
 identity criminality 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:28.899
 college 

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:31.339
 it seems that everything in the lives of men 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:34.579
 in short, a plural vision 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.689
 the truths past the salvation of reality 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.849
 It looks like a piglet 100 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.849
 2 in the name of plurality 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:45.839
 paradoxically 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:50.829
 this diversity of ideas Tony gebara by unanimity of criteria 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.829
 when the great god came to light this plural search 

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:57.759
 human rights 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:00.759
 today flag bearers elevated to the category of moral value 

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:04.319
 if on the contrary and of course 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.329
 the hegemony and monopoly of a single attitude towards life 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:10.569
 - in that dialectical trap 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:11.719
 that under the pretext 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:14.529
 defend diversity have a mind 

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:16.199
 he has published and shoots only 

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:17.409
 you had to give lights 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:20.409
 it is a mortal danger 

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:28.479
 Today the vast majority of people do not dare to declare 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:31.479
 publicly I miss the moral of the rights of man 

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:34.819
 and the philosophy that your country finds 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.819
 the city of the French Revolution of 1789 

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:42.089
 let's see an example 

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:46.819
 this statement is easily ascertainable just by observing the false 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.580
 debate that has characterized 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.639
 The phenomenon of life 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:55.469
 if people were asked as caches what do they think of the intervention of the 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:57.879
 armies that Europeans in defeat 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.389
 it is likely that the vast majority replied that he does not agree with 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:02.849
 that 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.729
 but when asked if, by law, he should have to establish as 

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:10.099
 was human rights in that country 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.049
 that the best thing was to overthrow the tyrant only accuses inc 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.049
 justifying a war of invasion and extermination 

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:18.570
 in that way 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.600
 the propaganda of human rights overlap everything negative to a 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.600
 unjust and bloody war like the Iraqi people lived 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:30.340
 and that he realized democracy and rights under the banner of equality 

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:33.719
 of man is automatically justified 

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:37.240
 In short, the debate is essentially aimed at demonstrating 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:41.879
 thus the best way to bring to the Muslim world the universal values ​​of the 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:43.169
 human rights 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.030
 is through utopia as a political and peaceful progressive vekaric 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.289
 a through the pragmatic sancy precipitated the other many 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.580
 two perspectives as it looks 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.580
 so far and yet so close 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.910
 neither of them in any case 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.210
 distanced himself from the same core values ​​and from the same ideology 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.930
 implicit 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.670
 human rights are always the background assumed as a value 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:15.189
 supreme 

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:18.229
 understand the essence in this way to a religion 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:23.339
 discover their origins and if your savings or not seems therefore essential 

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:27.979
 for whoever wants this despot to stand in opposition to the system 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:28.960
 hegemonic 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.979
 and not to be fighting a fire hello I'm nothing 

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:48.479
 the rights of man only his first appearance in account said 

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:50.050
 that is to say 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.970
 what is a historical tendency that is not wanted and that is theoretically in 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.779
 its different modalities 

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:58.610
 like liberal democracy and Marxism 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.770
 ending with the demo-progressive symbiosis that reigns today
