you get momentum and you're running the
ball<00:01:58.580> well<00:01:58.610> that<00:01:59.060> kind<00:01:59.570> of<00:01:59.630> feeds<00:01:59.929> itself<00:02:00.259> and

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
ball well that kind of feeds itself and

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.919 
ball well that kind of feeds itself and
the<00:02:00.890> quarterback<00:02:01.190> got<00:02:01.490> confident<00:02:02.060> running<00:02:02.810> it

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
the quarterback got confident running it

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:04.900 
the quarterback got confident running it
the<00:02:03.440> running<00:02:03.590> backs<00:02:03.830> got<00:02:04.070> confidence<00:02:04.580> running

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
the running backs got confidence running

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.719 
the running backs got confidence running
it<00:02:05.030> and<00:02:05.270> in<00:02:06.140> turn<00:02:06.410> you<00:02:06.830> know<00:02:06.950> we<00:02:07.280> started<00:02:07.610> to

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
it and in turn you know we started to

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.009 
it and in turn you know we started to
lose<00:02:07.880> that<00:02:08.149> confidence<00:02:08.390> that<00:02:08.720> we<00:02:08.869> were<00:02:08.929> going

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
lose that confidence that we were going

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.110 
lose that confidence that we were going
to<00:02:09.080> make<00:02:09.229> those<00:02:09.440> plays<00:02:09.679> and<00:02:09.979> inevitably<00:02:10.489> you

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
to make those plays and inevitably you

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.110 
to make those plays and inevitably you
know<00:02:11.180> they<00:02:11.300> wore<00:02:11.750> south

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.850 

I<00:02:16.209> feel<00:02:16.959> like<00:02:17.110> you<00:02:17.230> guys<00:02:17.349> came<00:02:17.739> out<00:02:18.720> oh<00:02:19.860> I

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
I feel like you guys came out oh I

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.619 
I feel like you guys came out oh I
thought<00:02:21.370> we<00:02:21.549> played<00:02:21.670> probably<00:02:22.150> our<00:02:22.390> best

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
thought we played probably our best

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.680 
thought we played probably our best
football<00:02:22.840> early<00:02:23.260> in<00:02:23.319> the<00:02:23.409> game<00:02:24.209> our<00:02:25.209> execution

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
football early in the game our execution

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:31.140 
football early in the game our execution
was<00:02:25.930> good<00:02:26.790> for<00:02:27.790> whatever<00:02:28.000> reason<00:02:29.280> we<00:02:30.280> lost<00:02:30.879> it

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
was good for whatever reason we lost it

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.940 
was good for whatever reason we lost it
and<00:02:31.659> that's<00:02:31.870> the<00:02:32.110> part<00:02:32.290> I<00:02:32.409> have<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.560> figure<00:02:32.829> out

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
and that's the part I have to figure out

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.850 
and that's the part I have to figure out
they<00:02:33.250> hit<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.489> one<00:02:33.640> long<00:02:33.879> run<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.860> things

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
they hit the one long run and things

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.330 
they hit the one long run and things
started<00:02:36.250> to<00:02:36.340> go<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:36.700> other<00:02:36.819> direction<00:02:36.940> on<00:02:37.540> us

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
started to go the other direction on us

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.339 
started to go the other direction on us
so<00:02:39.420> we've<00:02:40.420> got<00:02:40.569> to<00:02:40.690> figure<00:02:40.780> that<00:02:40.989> out<00:02:41.049> because

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
so we've got to figure that out because

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:42.390 
so we've got to figure that out because
it<00:02:41.590> really<00:02:41.769> felt<00:02:41.950> like<00:02:42.010> we<00:02:42.220> were<00:02:42.280> playing

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
it really felt like we were playing

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.369 
it really felt like we were playing
probably<00:02:42.819> our<00:02:43.060> best<00:02:43.239> early<00:02:43.629> in<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:43.930> game<00:02:44.110> you

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:44.379 
probably our best early in the game you

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.630 
probably our best early in the game you
know<00:02:44.530> Gary<00:02:44.799> so<00:02:45.099> I<00:02:45.670> don't<00:02:46.390> think<00:02:46.659> it<00:02:46.780> was<00:02:46.900> for

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
know Gary so I don't think it was for

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.400 
know Gary so I don't think it was for
lack<00:02:48.640> of<00:02:48.849> motivation<00:02:49.269> again<00:02:49.959> I<00:02:49.989> thought<00:02:50.230> we

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
lack of motivation again I thought we

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.699 
lack of motivation again I thought we
had<00:02:50.500> a<00:02:50.560> really<00:02:50.739> good<00:02:50.920> week<00:02:51.099> of<00:02:51.190> practice<00:02:51.420> I

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
had a really good week of practice I

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.819 
had a really good week of practice I
thought<00:02:53.709> our<00:02:53.799> guys<00:02:53.920> were<00:02:54.129> ready<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.400> go<00:02:54.629> just

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
thought our guys were ready to go just

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.380 
thought our guys were ready to go just
for<00:02:56.829> whatever<00:02:57.040> reason<00:02:57.489> our<00:02:57.640> execution<00:02:58.269> was

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
for whatever reason our execution was

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.430 
for whatever reason our execution was
not<00:02:58.599> as<00:02:58.780> good<00:02:58.959> as<00:02:59.170> it<00:02:59.349> is<00:02:59.579> capable<00:03:00.579> of<00:03:01.440> and

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
not as good as it is capable of and

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.559 
not as good as it is capable of and
simple<00:03:03.099> stuff<00:03:03.340> simple<00:03:03.819> things<00:03:04.060> that<00:03:04.209> we've

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
simple stuff simple things that we've

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.229 
simple stuff simple things that we've
been<00:03:04.690> doing<00:03:04.870> since<00:03:05.500> day<00:03:05.709> one<00:03:06.040> so<00:03:06.250> we<00:03:07.000> need<00:03:07.150> to

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
been doing since day one so we need to

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:07.800 
been doing since day one so we need to
figure<00:03:07.420> that<00:03:07.599> out

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
figure that out

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.240 
figure that out
why<00:03:07.959> do<00:03:08.019> you<00:03:08.170> think<00:03:09.599> well<00:03:10.599> they<00:03:10.780> did<00:03:11.099> they<00:03:12.099> did

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
why do you think well they did they did

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.860 
why do you think well they did they did
a<00:03:12.310> good<00:03:12.430> job<00:03:12.489> coaching<00:03:13.060> first<00:03:13.420> of<00:03:13.540> all<00:03:13.659> I<00:03:13.690> want

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
a good job coaching first of all I want

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.119 
a good job coaching first of all I want
to<00:03:13.900> give<00:03:13.959> them<00:03:14.260> a<00:03:14.290> lot<00:03:14.470> of<00:03:14.530> credit<00:03:14.859> they<00:03:14.950> did<00:03:15.040> a

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
to give them a lot of credit they did a

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:17.399 
to give them a lot of credit they did a
good<00:03:15.250> job<00:03:15.310> coaching<00:03:15.909> I<00:03:16.230> thought<00:03:17.230> they<00:03:17.349> were

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409 
good job coaching I thought they were

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:22.470 
good job coaching I thought they were
defeating<00:03:18.069> us<00:03:18.220> in<00:03:18.940> one-on-one<00:03:19.319> scenarios<00:03:21.480> and

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
defeating us in one-on-one scenarios and

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.680 
defeating us in one-on-one scenarios and
then<00:03:23.079> we<00:03:24.040> we<00:03:24.400> didn't<00:03:24.669> block<00:03:24.880> some<00:03:25.120> things<00:03:25.389> that

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
then we we didn't block some things that

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.539 
then we we didn't block some things that
I<00:03:25.870> know<00:03:25.989> were<00:03:26.319> capable<00:03:26.590> of<00:03:26.919> blocking<00:03:27.130> some

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
I know were capable of blocking some

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.430 
I know were capable of blocking some
plays<00:03:27.760> that<00:03:27.790> again<00:03:28.389> we<00:03:28.569> put<00:03:28.750> in<00:03:28.870> in<00:03:29.049> day<00:03:29.200> one

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
plays that again we put in in day one

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.129 
plays that again we put in in day one
and<00:03:29.680> we<00:03:30.669> didn't<00:03:30.940> get<00:03:31.030> it<00:03:31.120> done<00:03:31.239> and<00:03:31.599> so<00:03:31.660> we<00:03:32.019> got

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
and we didn't get it done and so we got

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:34.740 
and we didn't get it done and so we got
to<00:03:32.230> figure<00:03:32.379> out<00:03:32.790> from<00:03:33.790> a<00:03:33.849> practice<00:03:34.299> standpoint

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
to figure out from a practice standpoint

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.780 
to figure out from a practice standpoint
to<00:03:34.930> making<00:03:35.260> sure<00:03:35.470> that<00:03:35.680> we're<00:03:36.129> doing<00:03:36.370> and

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
to making sure that we're doing and

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.430 
to making sure that we're doing and
giving<00:03:37.060> our<00:03:37.239> guys<00:03:37.389> enough<00:03:37.690> opportunities<00:03:38.319> to

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
giving our guys enough opportunities to

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.589 
giving our guys enough opportunities to
rep<00:03:38.680> our<00:03:38.889> place<00:03:39.190> so<00:03:39.579> that<00:03:39.730> they<00:03:39.910> are<00:03:39.970> confident

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
rep our place so that they are confident

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.960 
rep our place so that they are confident
in<00:03:41.319> the<00:03:41.530> calls<00:03:41.769> and<00:03:42.129> in<00:03:42.190> the<00:03:42.310> schemes<00:03:42.579> to<00:03:42.849> go

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
in the calls and in the schemes to go

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.839 
in the calls and in the schemes to go
out<00:03:43.030> and<00:03:43.180> execute<00:03:43.599> and<00:03:44.230> then<00:03:44.379> ultimately

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
out and execute and then ultimately

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.580 
out and execute and then ultimately
confident<00:03:45.849> enough<00:03:46.000> to<00:03:46.060> defeat<00:03:46.480> a<00:03:46.540> man<00:03:46.870> one<00:03:47.470> on

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
confident enough to defeat a man one on

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.039 
confident enough to defeat a man one on
one<00:03:47.769> who's<00:03:48.129> lining<00:03:48.430> up<00:03:48.549> across<00:03:48.669> region<00:03:49.209> but<00:03:49.419> we

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
one who's lining up across region but we

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.619 
one who's lining up across region but we
got<00:03:50.230> defeated<00:03:50.650> tonight<00:03:51.280> in<00:03:51.549> the<00:03:52.180> majority<00:03:52.599> of

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:52.629 
got defeated tonight in the majority of

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.280 
got defeated tonight in the majority of
the<00:03:52.780> one-on-one<00:03:53.260> settings

over two hundred yards in those first

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.160 
over two hundred yards in those first
two<00:04:10.790> games<00:04:11.030> and<00:04:11.359> they're<00:04:11.659> starting<00:04:11.870> to<00:04:12.019> figure

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.170 
two games and they're starting to figure

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.479 
two games and they're starting to figure
out<00:04:12.290> what<00:04:12.500> they<00:04:12.620> have<00:04:12.769> you<00:04:12.980> know<00:04:13.069> he's<00:04:13.189> new<00:04:13.370> to

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
out what they have you know he's new to

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:14.890 
out what they have you know he's new to
their<00:04:13.640> system<00:04:14.090> into<00:04:14.269> their<00:04:14.359> scheme<00:04:14.689> and

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
their system into their scheme and

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.289 
their system into their scheme and
they've<00:04:15.470> gradually<00:04:16.100> shifted<00:04:16.639> gears<00:04:16.669> from

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
they've gradually shifted gears from

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.960 
they've gradually shifted gears from
what<00:04:17.810> they<00:04:17.959> were<00:04:18.019> a<00:04:18.169> year<00:04:18.530> ago<00:04:18.650> into<00:04:19.639> the<00:04:19.729> first

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
what they were a year ago into the first

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.310 
what they were a year ago into the first
couple<00:04:20.329> games<00:04:20.359> of<00:04:20.690> the<00:04:20.750> season<00:04:20.959> and<00:04:21.229> then

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
couple games of the season and then

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.010 
couple games of the season and then
tonight<00:04:21.680> we<00:04:21.949> got<00:04:22.310> really<00:04:23.300> a<00:04:23.330> completely

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
tonight we got really a completely

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.629 
tonight we got really a completely
different<00:04:24.169> offense<00:04:24.620> that<00:04:24.800> way<00:04:24.979> you<00:04:25.280> know<00:04:25.400> and

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
different offense that way you know and

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:28.570 
different offense that way you know and
so<00:04:25.840> but<00:04:26.840> we<00:04:26.960> were<00:04:27.050> anticipating<00:04:27.350> it<00:04:27.830> they<00:04:28.400> just

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
so but we were anticipating it they just

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.700 
so but we were anticipating it they just
did<00:04:28.970> a<00:04:29.030> good<00:04:29.120> job<00:04:29.180> and<00:04:29.570> they<00:04:29.870> broke<00:04:30.110> tackles<00:04:30.560> at

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
did a good job and they broke tackles at

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:36.310 
did a good job and they broke tackles at
critical<00:04:31.039> moments<00:04:34.630> we<00:04:35.630> didn't<00:04:35.840> line<00:04:35.960> up<00:04:35.990> right

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
critical moments we didn't line up right

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.779 
critical moments we didn't line up right
a<00:04:36.349> couple<00:04:36.710> times<00:04:36.919> and<00:04:37.099> that<00:04:37.220> that<00:04:37.490> doesn't

00:04:37.779 --> 00:04:37.789 
a couple times and that that doesn't

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:39.550 
a couple times and that that doesn't
help<00:04:37.880> when<00:04:38.120> the<00:04:38.300> ball<00:04:38.449> just<00:04:38.690> bounces<00:04:38.990> and<00:04:39.440> gets

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
help when the ball just bounces and gets

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.240 
help when the ball just bounces and gets
to<00:04:39.740> the<00:04:39.800> perimeter<00:04:41.020> and<00:04:42.020> then<00:04:42.320> you<00:04:42.889> know<00:04:43.009> when

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
to the perimeter and then you know when

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.589 
to the perimeter and then you know when
we<00:04:43.729> were<00:04:44.410> supposed<00:04:45.410> to<00:04:45.470> have<00:04:45.590> the<00:04:45.740> quarterback

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599 
we were supposed to have the quarterback

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:49.240 
we were supposed to have the quarterback
won<00:04:47.599> we<00:04:47.870> either<00:04:48.020> weren't<00:04:48.440> able<00:04:48.530> to<00:04:48.770> tackle<00:04:49.009> him

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
won we either weren't able to tackle him

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.460 
won we either weren't able to tackle him
when<00:04:49.610> he<00:04:49.759> came<00:04:50.090> to<00:04:50.330> the<00:04:50.449> edge<00:04:50.539> or<00:04:51.110> to<00:04:51.289> who

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
when he came to the edge or to who

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.589 
when he came to the edge or to who
weren't<00:04:51.590> there<00:04:51.860> so<00:04:52.220> we<00:04:52.789> have<00:04:52.910> to<00:04:53.090> we<00:04:53.360> have<00:04:53.389> to

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:53.599 
weren't there so we have to we have to

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:55.450 
weren't there so we have to we have to
look<00:04:53.780> at<00:04:53.960> who<00:04:54.530> we're<00:04:54.710> assigning<00:04:55.070> the

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
look at who we're assigning the

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.300 
look at who we're assigning the
quarterback<00:04:55.940> to<00:04:55.970> on<00:04:56.449> the<00:04:56.870> QB<00:04:57.169> runs<00:04:57.440> and<00:04:58.099> then

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
quarterback to on the QB runs and then

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.580 
quarterback to on the QB runs and then
the<00:04:58.460> scheme's<00:04:58.759> and<00:04:59.090> which<00:04:59.210> we're<00:04:59.419> using<00:04:59.449> to<00:05:00.080> to

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
the scheme's and which we're using to to

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.480 
the scheme's and which we're using to to
keep<00:05:00.800> him<00:05:01.009> in<00:05:01.310> you<00:05:01.669> know<00:05:01.729> contained<00:05:02.570> because

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
keep him in you know contained because

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.070 
keep him in you know contained because
too<00:05:04.490> often<00:05:04.729> tonight<00:05:05.150> the<00:05:05.300> ball<00:05:05.449> bounce<00:05:05.750> the

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
too often tonight the ball bounce the

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.050 
too often tonight the ball bounce the
ball<00:05:06.199> gots<00:05:06.470> the<00:05:06.620> perimeter<00:05:07.039> and<00:05:07.820> they<00:05:08.000> were

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
ball gots the perimeter and they were

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.899 
ball gots the perimeter and they were
able<00:05:08.210> to<00:05:08.360> create<00:05:08.539> you<00:05:08.960> know<00:05:08.990> chunks<00:05:09.409> of<00:05:09.500> yours

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:09.909 
able to create you know chunks of yours

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:12.550 
able to create you know chunks of yours

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
certainly you said they kind of figure

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.990 
certainly you said they kind of figure
out<00:05:12.590> what<00:05:12.889> they<00:05:13.039> had<00:05:13.250> tonight<00:05:13.610> do<00:05:13.760> you<00:05:13.789> think

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:17.449 
you figured out what you have well no we

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:20.560 
you figured out what you have well no we
didn't<00:05:17.630> play<00:05:17.750> great<00:05:17.960> you<00:05:18.260> know<00:05:18.409> I<00:05:19.120> think<00:05:20.120> we're

I<00:05:20.810> still<00:05:21.169> think<00:05:21.380> we're<00:05:21.500> a<00:05:21.530> very<00:05:21.710> good<00:05:21.830> football

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
I still think we're a very good football

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.629 
I still think we're a very good football
team<00:05:23.530> when<00:05:24.530> we<00:05:24.560> play<00:05:24.919> the<00:05:25.159> way<00:05:25.250> were<00:05:25.400> capable

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:25.639 
team when we play the way were capable

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:28.600 
team when we play the way were capable
plane<00:05:26.030> and<00:05:26.440> like<00:05:27.440> I<00:05:27.560> said<00:05:27.770> we<00:05:27.919> didn't<00:05:28.370> do<00:05:28.430> that

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
plane and like I said we didn't do that

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.480 
plane and like I said we didn't do that
tonight<00:05:29.320> but<00:05:30.320> that<00:05:30.500> doesn't<00:05:30.830> have<00:05:31.099> to<00:05:31.250> be<00:05:31.280> the

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
schematic things that we look at because

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:07.010 
schematic things that we look at because
this<00:06:05.789> isn't<00:06:05.970> going<00:06:06.120> to<00:06:06.240> be<00:06:06.330> the<00:06:06.449> only<00:06:06.599> mobile

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020

quarterback<00:06:07.440> we<00:06:07.620> faced<00:06:07.830> this<00:06:08.009> year<00:06:08.220> so

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
quarterback we faced this year so

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.339 
quarterback we faced this year so
schematically<00:06:09.720> we're<00:06:09.900> gonna<00:06:09.990> have<00:06:10.139> to<00:06:10.229> look

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:10.349 
schematically we're gonna have to look

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:12.200 
schematically we're gonna have to look
at<00:06:10.500> some<00:06:10.650> things<00:06:10.830> but<00:06:11.039> also<00:06:11.310> we<00:06:12.000> need<00:06:12.150> to

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
at some things but also we need to

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.640 
at some things but also we need to
continue<00:06:12.690> to<00:06:12.810> develop<00:06:12.900> our<00:06:13.289> young<00:06:13.319> players

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
continue to develop our young players

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.830 
continue to develop our young players

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
and that's always a great time to do in

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.349 
and that's always a great time to do in
the<00:06:15.900> bye<00:06:16.050> as<00:06:16.110> well
