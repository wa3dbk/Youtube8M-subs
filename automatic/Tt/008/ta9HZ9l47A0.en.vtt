00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.650
 thunder in Norse mythology and 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.420
 Germanic that their role is all 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.490
 they say it's complex since I have 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.369
 influence in very different areas like 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.680
 the climate the crops the protection the 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.650
 consecration justice life 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.020
 trips and battles during a 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.530
 during and once the process of 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:08.580
 crystallization was completed figure 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.750
 of the bull was demonized by the growing 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.680
 influence of Christian missionaries 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.110
 after Christianity 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.150
 will cement remains of his faith were preserved 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.330
 clandestinely, mainly in 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.940
 rural areas surviving like this until 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.370
 modern times in German folklore 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.970
 and more recent rebuilt under 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:33.569
 various forms of neo paganism 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:37.859
 germanic for basically this sector 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:42.209
 and well this is specifically the one of 

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:44.849
 modern history lives in asgard and 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:48.269
 good for something comes to earth and brings 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:52.590
 the hammer is your tool 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:56.299
 work is that that this is your your 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:59.810
 tool to fight the bad 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:03.180
 because as I said it has two movies 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.989

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.989

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.980
 for his 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:22.180
 question of how friendly than that 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:27.250
 sometimes it turns out that they do not eat avengers 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.930
 that he could not lift the hammer from there 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.020

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:38.590

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.070
