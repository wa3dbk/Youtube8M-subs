00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
I believe it's five foot power supply

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:43.179 
I believe it's five foot power supply
this<00:01:34.530> way<00:01:40.159> walk<00:01:41.159> sit<00:01:41.399> there<00:01:41.549> for<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.789> second

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
this way walk sit there for a second

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.609 
this way walk sit there for a second
look<00:01:44.189> at<00:01:44.970> sub<00:01:45.899> woofer

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.830 

alright<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:49.799> assembly<00:01:50.280> for<00:01:50.490> these<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.909> really

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
alright so assembly for these is really

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.590 
alright so assembly for these is really
easy<00:01:52.049> compared<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.979> lot<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.220> setups<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:54.360> just

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
easy compared to a lot of setups so just

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.960 
easy compared to a lot of setups so just
spin<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:54.929> around<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.229> back<00:01:55.409> here<00:01:55.729> right<00:01:56.729> here

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
spin it around the back here right here

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.960 
spin it around the back here right here
you<00:01:57.119> have<00:01:57.270> your<00:01:57.420> base<00:01:57.630> control<00:01:58.520> this<00:01:59.520> speaker

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
you have your base control this speaker

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.789 
you have your base control this speaker
or<00:02:00.209> this<00:02:00.360> wire<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.840> going<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.350> your<00:02:01.530> power

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
or this wire is going to your power

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.590 
or this wire is going to your power
supply<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.429> this<00:02:03.000> is<00:02:03.119> going<00:02:03.330> to<00:02:03.479> your

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
supply and this is going to your

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.029 
supply and this is going to your
external<00:02:03.990> Jack<00:02:04.319> which<00:02:04.530> I'll<00:02:04.649> go<00:02:04.799> over<00:02:04.830> in<00:02:04.979> a

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
external Jack which I'll go over in a

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.359 
external Jack which I'll go over in a
second<00:02:05.369> all<00:02:06.330> you<00:02:06.539> do<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:06.929> take<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.679> wire<00:02:07.950> one

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
wire going from both the speakers we'll

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.789 
wire going from both the speakers we'll
get<00:02:11.009> right<00:02:11.160> into<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.549> back<00:02:11.760> here<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.989> you're
