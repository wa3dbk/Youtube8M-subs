they're<00:00:48.329> not<00:00:48.480> exactly<00:00:48.660> spearmen<00:00:49.500> because

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
they're not exactly spearmen because

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.979 
they're not exactly spearmen because
well<00:00:50.039> two<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.309> them<00:00:50.610> one<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.059> them<00:00:51.210> have<00:00:51.449> axes

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989

now<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.930> just<00:00:55.079> have<00:00:55.230> sharp<00:00:55.500> pointy

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
now that you just have sharp pointy

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.060

things<00:00:56.010> attached<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.520> sticks<00:00:57.379> so<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.620> wouldn't

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070

call<00:00:59.340> them<00:00:59.489> spearmen<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.239> guess<00:01:00.390> I'd<00:01:00.539> call<00:01:00.719> them

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870
