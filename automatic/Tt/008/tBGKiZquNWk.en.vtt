if you've ever owned an old boat you
have<00:00:11.550> probably<00:00:12.150> noticed<00:00:12.450> over<00:00:13.049> time<00:00:13.290> that

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
have probably noticed over time that

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.250 
have probably noticed over time that
there<00:00:13.740> are<00:00:13.799> certain<00:00:14.250> areas<00:00:14.490> on<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.660> deck<00:00:15.929> when

there are certain areas on the deck when
you're<00:00:16.410> walking<00:00:16.650> around<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:17.520> Creek<00:00:17.850> for<00:00:18.270> no

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
you're walking around that Creek for no

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
this is what the plywood looked like you

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.399 
this is what the plywood looked like you
can<00:01:02.430> see<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.730> plies<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.329> can<00:01:03.480> see<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:04.229> it's

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
can see the plies you can see that it's

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.380 
can see the plies you can see that it's
a<00:01:04.530> very<00:01:05.070> strong<00:01:05.400> that<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.700> would<00:01:05.790> support<00:01:05.970> the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
a very strong that it would support the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:14.600 
a very strong that it would support the
weight<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.689> your<00:01:06.930> crew<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:08.280> deck<00:01:13.340> 15<00:01:14.340> 20

years<00:01:14.820> later<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:15.960> what<00:01:16.140> that<00:01:16.409> same<00:01:16.650> wood

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
years later this is what that same wood

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.580 
years later this is what that same wood
will<00:01:17.130> look<00:01:17.340> like<00:01:17.549> now<00:01:18.150> this<00:01:18.330> this<00:01:18.930> wood<00:01:19.290> has

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
will look like now this this wood has

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.219 
will look like now this this wood has
been<00:01:19.830> attacked<00:01:20.159> by<00:01:20.520> termites<00:01:21.240> if<00:01:21.570> this<00:01:21.840> had

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
been attacked by termites if this had

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.910 
been attacked by termites if this had
been<00:01:23.060> destroyed<00:01:24.060> by<00:01:24.119> moisture<00:01:24.869> or<00:01:25.049> rot<00:01:25.290> then

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
been destroyed by moisture or rot then

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.340 
been destroyed by moisture or rot then
you<00:01:26.220> would<00:01:26.310> see<00:01:26.520> black<00:01:26.850> flaky<00:01:27.570> cloud<00:01:27.840> powder

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
you would see black flaky cloud powder

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.999 
you would see black flaky cloud powder
all<00:01:28.680> through<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.490> area<00:01:29.820> here<00:01:30.560> this<00:01:31.560> again<00:01:31.860> is

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
all through this area here this again is

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.560 
all through this area here this again is
the<00:01:32.159> gap<00:01:32.610> between<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.540> the

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
the gap between it and this is the

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.940 
the gap between it and this is the
headliner<00:01:34.140> above<00:01:34.470> your<00:01:34.590> head<00:01:34.710> if<00:01:34.829> you're

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
headliner above your head if you're

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.890 
headliner above your head if you're
inside<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.610> boat<00:01:35.790> now<00:01:36.299> what<00:01:36.479> we're<00:01:36.630> going<00:01:36.780> to

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
inside the boat now what we're going to

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.200 
inside the boat now what we're going to
do<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.290> we're<00:01:37.470> going<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.680> repair<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.460> by

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
do is we're going to repair this by

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.270 
do is we're going to repair this by
injecting<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.020> with<00:01:40.049> epoxy<00:01:40.770> with<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.070> air

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
injecting it with epoxy with the air

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.730 
injecting it with epoxy with the air
marine<00:01:41.579> 321<00:01:42.450> it's<00:01:42.930> perfect<00:01:43.409> for<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.590> because

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
marine 321 it's perfect for that because

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.460 
marine 321 it's perfect for that because
of<00:01:44.220> its<00:01:44.340> low<00:01:44.579> viscosity<00:01:44.970> we're<00:01:45.869> going<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.229> fill

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
of its low viscosity we're going to fill

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.840 
of its low viscosity we're going to fill
this<00:01:46.770> gap<00:01:46.909> here<00:01:47.909> with<00:01:48.689> era<00:01:49.049> marine<00:01:49.439> 8<00:01:50.369> pound

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
this gap here with era marine 8 pound

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.020 
this gap here with era marine 8 pound
density<00:01:51.689> pouring<00:01:52.110> clay<00:01:52.320> structural<00:01:52.979> foam<00:01:53.310> the

density pouring clay structural foam the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.120 
density pouring clay structural foam the
reason<00:01:54.390> for<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.409> we<00:01:55.860> want<00:01:56.070> to

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
reason for that is that we want to

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.789 
reason for that is that we want to
ensure<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.670> we<00:01:56.939> do<00:01:57.149> not<00:01:57.270> overshoot<00:01:58.170> this

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
ensure that we do not overshoot this

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.429 
ensure that we do not overshoot this
area<00:01:59.369> when<00:01:59.670> we're<00:01:59.850> injecting<00:02:00.329> with<00:02:00.630> epoxy<00:02:01.049> and

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
area when we're injecting with epoxy and

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.160 
area when we're injecting with epoxy and
fill<00:02:02.070> up<00:02:02.280> this<00:02:02.430> area<00:02:02.880> with<00:02:03.149> epoxy<00:02:03.659> what<00:02:04.049> will

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
fill up this area with epoxy what will

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.440 
fill up this area with epoxy what will
happen<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.710> this<00:02:04.829> epoxy<00:02:05.159> will<00:02:05.460> run<00:02:05.700> down<00:02:05.880> the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
happen is this epoxy will run down the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.270 
happen is this epoxy will run down the
sides<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.079> boat<00:02:07.290> run<00:02:07.619> down<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.890> sides<00:02:08.099> of
