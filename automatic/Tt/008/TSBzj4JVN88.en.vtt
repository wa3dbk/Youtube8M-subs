00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
look I let off the gas pop it out cuz

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.559 
look I let off the gas pop it out cuz
the<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.660> pressure<00:02:32.350> on<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.760> flywheel<00:02:34.300> and

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
the the pressure on the flywheel and

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.020 
the the pressure on the flywheel and
clutch<00:02:36.120> it's<00:02:37.120> not<00:02:37.300> as<00:02:37.420> much<00:02:37.630> with<00:02:37.870> the

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
clutch it's not as much with the

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.809 
clutch it's not as much with the
accelerator<00:02:40.030> off<00:02:40.240> so<00:02:41.200> to<00:02:41.260> pop<00:02:41.500> out<00:02:41.740> and<00:02:42.190> then

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
accelerator off so to pop out and then

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.600 
accelerator off so to pop out and then
as<00:02:43.330> everything's<00:02:43.780> turning<00:02:44.110> you<00:02:44.950> actually<00:02:45.280> are

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
as everything's turning you actually are

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.910 
as everything's turning you actually are
matching<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.569> rotation<00:02:47.140> in<00:02:47.350> epoxy<00:02:49.590> so<00:02:50.590> little

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
matching the rotation in epoxy so little

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.890 
matching the rotation in epoxy so little
back<00:02:51.010> in<00:02:51.069> the<00:02:51.340> fourth

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.150 

around<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:55.959> corner<00:02:56.200> here

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.550 

and<00:03:00.580> what<00:03:00.700> I<00:03:00.760> did<00:03:00.970> there<00:03:01.270> is<00:03:01.720> that<00:03:01.900> I<00:03:02.110> just<00:03:02.230> gave

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
and what I did there is that I just gave

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.560 
and what I did there is that I just gave
it<00:03:02.680> a<00:03:02.710> little<00:03:02.890> gas<00:03:03.040> if<00:03:03.700> you<00:03:03.820> can<00:03:03.970> see<00:03:04.120> this<00:03:04.300> leg

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
it a little gas if you can see this leg

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.070 
it a little gas if you can see this leg
move<00:03:04.890> you<00:03:05.890> have<00:03:05.980> a<00:03:06.070> little<00:03:06.190> gas<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:07.390> RPMs<00:03:07.810> went

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
move you have a little gas the RPMs went

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.120 
move you have a little gas the RPMs went
up<00:03:08.550> and<00:03:09.550> I<00:03:09.700> just<00:03:09.850> I<00:03:10.480> felt<00:03:10.840> it<00:03:11.080> and<00:03:11.710> I<00:03:11.800> popped<00:03:12.010> in
