00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.300
 This is the first video that 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.680
 generate for the subject expression 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.529
 graphic and edification of the university 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.110
 of the Balearic Islands these videos are 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.480
 support videos never replacing 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.129
 the figure of your teacher or professor 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.710
 through these videos what we are looking for 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.870
 is to give you tools that make you 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.510
 allow to remember what you have seen 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.010
 in class do not forget that according to the plans 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.170
 of study subject to the education plan 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.480
 European top bologna plans 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.460
 you have to go to 80 percent of the 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.140
 face-to-face classes and so many tutorials 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.239
 as you mark the program of your subject 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.400
 do not forget either that in the case of 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.830
 Geographical subject in building in 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.989
 the university of the Balearic Islands 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.970
 you will have to complete in order to pass the 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.710
 subject properly or what is it 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.530
 same learning what in it 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.420
 indicates will have to overcome what are two 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.720
 notebooks work a notebook 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.909
 Work thought developed and raised 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.220
 for the 60 hours of face-to-face work 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.010
 of work in the classroom in the you are going to 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.110
 give guidelines and paths for each of 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.270
 the exercises the statements of this 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.850
 exercise you're going to have a web these 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.830
 statements will appear every week 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:34.640
 that we are making progress in the program that 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:38.960
 web is http two points drawing point i 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.030
 bet.es as support for your external work 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.939
 the subject those 90 hours that marks the 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.369
 Bologna plan as necessary too 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.080
 we have a new notebook this other 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.690
 notebook a 90-hour notebook 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.000
 practices you also have to 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.000
 develop is important and very important 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.860
 necessary to have reviewed the exercises 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.320
 from both the 60- hour notebook and the 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.060
 of 90 hours having been reviewed the 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.979
 different tutorials that you will have with your 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.649
 teacher to be able to approve the 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.019
 subject remember what is important is not 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.819
 approve by approving the important thing is that 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.860
 with the end of the subject beech 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.019
 learned and have covered the objectives 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.510
 both marked in it and in yourself 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.340
 when you decided to enroll in this 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.410
 subject we are going to use a series of 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.840
 tools some of them depend 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.540
 totally from you your eye of your vision of 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.549
 your observation of your hand the way 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.319
 that we are going to educate her and the position 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:33.790
 body that you will take at the time of 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.790
 make your own drawings 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.890
 another one of the tools from your own 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.470
 body that you will need is your own 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.700
 body posture while drawing for 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.650
 we are going to give you a series of guidelines 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.340
 some of them you see in this video 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.519
 we will also see them in class 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.200
 as non-bodily tools we counted 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.239
 with those external elements that we 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.400
 help to make our drawing better 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.709
 hand raised the first of them is going to be 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.690
 a pencil we already know that there are people who 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.519
 also use mechanical pencils let's not forget 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.379
 that a pencil and a mechanical pencil is no more 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.599
 than a support for a graphite rod 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.160
 in this subject here in the 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.049
 University of the Balearic Islands 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.660
 we are going to be left with a type of pencil and a 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:10.200
 type of concrete mine and we refer to 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.750
 the mine h v2 the goal of using 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.670
 only one type of mine is for 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.320
 move forward to moments in which you 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.570
 You will find the need to 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.370
 make your freehand drawing inside 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.720
 of the graphic expression line and not 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.910
 you have another tool at hand that 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.370
 the one that gives you the moment we're going to 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.320
 start with this pencil this pencil has 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.729
 a mine that allows depending on the 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.950
 pressure of your hand on paper 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:33.950
 get different line values 

00:06:23.249 --> 00:06:27.449
 Of course we will also need a 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:29.759
 pencil sharpener and rubber by the way is 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:31.799
 totally prohibited during this course 

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:34.619
 the tool is also important 

00:06:31.799 --> 00:06:37.319
 paper the paper that we will work with 

00:06:34.619 --> 00:06:40.079
 in this subject you find it in the 

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:41.789
 notebooks of 60 and 90 hours if you 're not 

00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:43.379
 doing the here at the university in 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:46.049
 any other site we advise you a 

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:46.529
 matte paper with a thickness of about 110 

00:06:46.049 --> 00:06:48.539
 grams 

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:51.089
 the measuring elements are also 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:53.759
 important we are going to have elements 

00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:55.649
 of digital and non-digital measurement without 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:57.929
 But let's start with a very 

00:06:55.649 --> 00:06:59.129
 basic that you have also in your own 

00:06:57.929 --> 00:07:00.779
 body and in the first of the 

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:02.939
 tools that we have mentioned 

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:04.739
 pencil through your extended arm and 

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:07.379
 your pencil we can take a series of 

00:07:04.739 --> 00:07:09.659
 measures that allow us to locate how 

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:11.309
 is the volume compare and develop 

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:13.049
 much better your work the scaler 

00:07:11.309 --> 00:07:14.939
 It will also be important in this 

00:07:13.049 --> 00:07:17.399
 subject is the tool that we are going to 

00:07:14.939 --> 00:07:21.229
 use to pass all the data that 

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:21.229
 you have previously lived at scale 

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:31.000
 and here what is the first video 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.280
 of the subject remember all 

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.250
 the course we have small short videos 

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.470
 with support elements and I never remember 

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:42.509
 never ever replacing the figure 

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.509
 from your teacher we see each other in class
