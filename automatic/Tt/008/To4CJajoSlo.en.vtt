00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
standardized kinds of ways and what we

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.630 
standardized kinds of ways and what we

represented<00:00:56.420> which<00:00:56.600> is<00:00:56.780> also<00:00:56.960> unique<00:00:57.379> so<00:00:58.250> we

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
represented which is also unique so we

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.910 
represented which is also unique so we
have<00:00:58.699> the<00:00:59.330> clinics<00:00:59.870> where<00:01:00.140> the<00:01:00.350> patient's
