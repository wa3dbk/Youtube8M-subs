know<00:01:05.700> good<00:01:06.060> two<00:01:07.049> inches<00:01:07.200> away<00:01:07.469> from<00:01:07.590> my<00:01:07.859> eyes

know good two inches away from my eyes

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.609 
know good two inches away from my eyes
it<00:01:09.119> was<00:01:09.240> hard<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.539> get<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.840> angle<00:01:10.020> right<00:01:10.229> and

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
it was hard to get the angle right and

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.379 
it was hard to get the angle right and
for<00:01:11.490> long<00:01:11.880> distances<00:01:12.539> I<00:01:12.719> had<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.020> sort<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.709> look

00:01:14.379 --> 00:01:14.389 
for long distances I had to sort of look

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:16.639 
for long distances I had to sort of look
straight<00:01:15.389> ahead<00:01:15.539> like<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.990> was<00:01:16.020> looking<00:01:16.439> normal

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
straight ahead like I was looking normal

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.449 
straight ahead like I was looking normal
but<00:01:17.279> then<00:01:17.520> for<00:01:18.590> close-up<00:01:19.590> shots<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.130> stuff<00:01:20.310> I

00:01:20.449 --> 00:01:20.459 
but then for close-up shots and stuff I

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:24.679 
but then for close-up shots and stuff I
had<00:01:20.609> to<00:01:20.639> angle<00:01:21.060> my<00:01:21.149> head<00:01:22.249> down<00:01:23.249> a<00:01:23.279> lot<00:01:23.639> to<00:01:24.509> get

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689

program<00:02:29.520> i<00:02:29.610> used<00:02:29.819> and<00:02:30.080> footbed<00:02:31.080> 90<00:02:31.890> degrees

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
program i used and footbed 90 degrees

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.220 
program i used and footbed 90 degrees
then<00:02:33.959> on<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.380> strap<00:02:35.060> actually<00:02:36.060> then<00:02:37.019> there's

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.759 
then on the strap actually then there's
a<00:02:37.290> wire<00:02:37.560> running<00:02:38.489> up<00:02:38.790> here<00:02:39.780> and<00:02:39.989> it<00:02:40.319> goes<00:02:40.350> into

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
a wire running up here and it goes into

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.930 
a wire running up here and it goes into
these<00:02:41.420> three<00:02:42.920> connectors<00:02:43.920> right<00:02:44.130> here<00:02:44.370> which

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
these three connectors right here which

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.540 
these three connectors right here which
you<00:02:45.120> have<00:02:45.269> an<00:02:45.450> audio<00:02:46.040> individual<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.280> then

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
you have an audio individual and then

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.809 
you have an audio individual and then
the<00:02:47.670> red<00:02:47.850> one<00:02:48.060> is<00:02:48.360> um<00:02:49.280> if<00:02:50.280> your<00:02:50.430> audio<00:02:50.670> and

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
the red one is um if your audio and

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.160 
the red one is um if your audio and
visual<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.630> red<00:02:51.750> one<00:02:51.900> is<00:02:52.019> power<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:54.170> the

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
visual and the red one is power and the

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.090 
visual and the red one is power and the
power<00:02:55.410> actually<00:02:55.830> connects<00:02:56.459> to<00:02:56.760> this<00:02:57.569> wire

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
power actually connects to this wire

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.970 
power actually connects to this wire
which<00:02:59.100> I<00:02:59.340> ran<00:02:59.880> into<00:03:00.180> this<00:03:00.989> little<00:03:01.260> box<00:03:01.620> it<00:03:01.920> was

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
which I ran into this little box it was

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.699 
which I ran into this little box it was
like<00:03:02.130> a<00:03:02.160> little<00:03:02.340> tin<00:03:02.640> chocolate<00:03:03.120> box<00:03:03.330> and<00:03:03.630> I

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
like a little tin chocolate box and I

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.800 
like a little tin chocolate box and I
just<00:03:04.709> sprayed<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.160> black<00:03:05.370> put<00:03:06.030> some<00:03:06.180> tape<00:03:06.390> over

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
just sprayed it black put some tape over

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.030 
just sprayed it black put some tape over
and<00:03:06.870> I<00:03:07.620> actually<00:03:08.370> have<00:03:08.790> it<00:03:09.170> velcroed<00:03:10.170> so<00:03:10.920> it

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
and I actually have it velcroed so it

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.430 
and I actually have it velcroed so it
can<00:03:12.440> easily<00:03:13.440> be<00:03:13.860> velcroed<00:03:14.430> on<00:03:14.579> to<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:15.060> band<00:03:16.049> on

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
can easily be velcroed on to the band on

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.400 
can easily be velcroed on to the band on
the<00:03:16.590> mask<00:03:17.220> or<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:17.670> goggles<00:03:18.299> so<00:03:19.140> you<00:03:19.230> can<00:03:19.350> just

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
the mask or the goggles so you can just

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.560 
the mask or the goggles so you can just
attach<00:03:19.620> it<00:03:19.950> there<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:20.340> then<00:03:20.400> pop<00:03:20.910> it<00:03:20.940> open<00:03:21.180> and

stuff<00:03:26.880> and<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:28.079> wires<00:03:28.290> run<00:03:28.590> out<00:03:28.709> from<00:03:29.160> a<00:03:29.310> hole

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
stuff and the wires run out from a hole

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.170 
stuff and the wires run out from a hole
in<00:03:29.549> the<00:03:29.730> back<00:03:30.140> um<00:03:31.140> there's<00:03:31.620> a<00:03:31.910> this<00:03:32.910> is<00:03:33.060> the

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
same battery box that I used for my

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.580 
same battery box that I used for my
helmet<00:03:36.180> but<00:03:36.450> basically<00:03:36.930> it's<00:03:37.140> just<00:03:37.200> on<00:03:37.440> the

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
the battery and then you get run a wire

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.840 
the battery and then you get run a wire
you're<00:03:49.829> going<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.010> plug<00:03:50.190> in<00:03:50.310> your<00:03:50.400> audio<00:03:50.700> and

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
visual audio and video wires and run

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.849 
visual audio and video wires and run
that<00:03:55.920> cord<00:03:56.280> down<00:03:57.140> to<00:03:58.140> wherever<00:03:58.500> you're

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
that cord down to wherever you're

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:03.500 
that cord down to wherever you're
keeping<00:03:59.280> your<00:03:59.430> actual<00:04:00.530> camcorder<00:04:01.530> and<00:04:02.510> the

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
keeping your actual camcorder and the

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.780 
keeping your actual camcorder and the
camcorders<00:04:04.049> where<00:04:04.230> it<00:04:04.380> actually<00:04:04.640> records<00:04:05.640> the

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
camcorders where it actually records the

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.890 
camcorders where it actually records the
video<00:04:06.000> and<00:04:06.150> stuff<00:04:06.329> this<00:04:06.510> is<00:04:06.690> just<00:04:06.930> basically

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
video and stuff this is just basically

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.319 
video and stuff this is just basically
a<00:04:09.019> different<00:04:09.769> angle<00:04:10.519> I<00:04:10.700> guess<00:04:12.159> and<00:04:13.239> you<00:04:14.239> know

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
a different angle I guess and you know

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:15.970 
a different angle I guess and you know
that's<00:04:14.540> how<00:04:14.659> you<00:04:14.780> can<00:04:15.049> easily<00:04:15.290> take<00:04:15.739> some

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
that's how you can easily take some

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.860 
that's how you can easily take some
in-game<00:04:16.130> footage<00:04:16.489> I'll<00:04:17.449> go<00:04:17.600> through<00:04:17.780> the

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
in-game footage I'll go through the

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.879 
in-game footage I'll go through the
parts<00:04:18.169> or<00:04:19.130> the<00:04:20.030> mask<00:04:20.720> what<00:04:21.199> it<00:04:21.410> doesn't<00:04:21.769> really

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
parts or the mask what it doesn't really

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:23.560 
parts or the mask what it doesn't really
matter<00:04:22.070> what<00:04:22.280> mask<00:04:22.520> use<00:04:22.850> I<00:04:22.970> guess<00:04:23.000> as<00:04:23.330> long<00:04:23.360> as

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570
