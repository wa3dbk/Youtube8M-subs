00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.480 

welcome<00:00:00.450> to<00:00:00.630> my<00:00:00.750> video<00:00:01.079> about<00:00:01.439> assembling<00:00:02.280> a

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
welcome to my video about assembling a

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.329 
welcome to my video about assembling a
six-gallon<00:00:03.120> copperpot<00:00:04.049> still<00:00:04.080> without<00:00:04.740> a<00:00:04.890> as

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
six-gallon copperpot still without a as

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.509 
six-gallon copperpot still without a as
you<00:00:05.490> can<00:00:05.520> see<00:00:05.970> I've<00:00:06.839> got<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.799> first<00:00:08.069> strip

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
you can see I've got the first strip

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.610 
you can see I've got the first strip
from<00:00:08.639> the<00:00:08.730> second<00:00:09.240> strip<00:00:09.510> somewhat<00:00:10.290> fitted

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
from the second strip somewhat fitted

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.740 
from the second strip somewhat fitted
together<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:11.219> usually<00:00:12.030> start<00:00:12.300> at<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.599> middle

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
together I usually start at the middle

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.810 
together I usually start at the middle
and<00:00:12.990> try<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.259> line<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.099> middle<00:00:14.340> marks<00:00:14.610> up

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
and try to line the middle marks up

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.760 
and try to line the middle marks up
because<00:00:15.599> you<00:00:15.750> as<00:00:15.839> you<00:00:15.960> go<00:00:16.109> towards<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.590> edge

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
because you as you go towards the edge

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.890 
because you as you go towards the edge
sometimes<00:00:17.400> they<00:00:17.820> don't<00:00:17.940> fit<00:00:18.240> up<00:00:18.359> just<00:00:18.570> exactly

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
sometimes they don't fit up just exactly

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.740 
sometimes they don't fit up just exactly
right<00:00:19.289> so<00:00:19.529> what<00:00:20.369> I<00:00:20.400> have<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.730> do<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.029> just<00:00:21.330> align

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
right so what I have to do is just align

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.960 
right so what I have to do is just align
the<00:00:21.990> sheets<00:00:22.320> so<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:23.070> they<00:00:23.220> fit<00:00:23.460> as<00:00:23.730> straight

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
the sheets so that they fit as straight

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.570 
the sheets so that they fit as straight
as<00:00:24.150> they<00:00:24.300> can<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:25.320> then<00:00:25.949> once<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.250> get<00:00:26.310> the

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
as they can and then once I get the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.120 
as they can and then once I get the
sheets<00:00:26.849> pretty<00:00:27.210> much<00:00:27.390> lined<00:00:27.630> up<00:00:27.930> then<00:00:28.890> just

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
sheets pretty much lined up then just

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.339 
sheets pretty much lined up then just
tape<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.519> sheets<00:00:29.760> together<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.660> what<00:00:31.260> you

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
tape the sheets together and what you

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.190 
tape the sheets together and what you
want<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.560> make<00:00:31.740> sure<00:00:31.769> is<00:00:32.360> tape<00:00:33.360> on<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.960> lines

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
want to make sure is tape on the lines

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.170 
want to make sure is tape on the lines
that<00:00:34.590> make<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.040> pattern<00:00:35.460> because<00:00:35.820> what<00:00:36.030> we're

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
that make the pattern because what we're

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.240 
that make the pattern because what we're
going<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.390> do<00:00:36.600> after<00:00:37.410> we<00:00:37.440> get<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:37.920> piece

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
going to do after we get this piece

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.069 
going to do after we get this piece
assembled<00:00:38.820> because<00:00:39.450> we're<00:00:39.629> going<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.840> cut

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
assembled because we're going to cut

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.459 
assembled because we're going to cut
around<00:00:40.200> each<00:00:40.739> piece<00:00:41.570> each<00:00:42.570> piece<00:00:42.989> was<00:00:43.230> gonna

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
around each piece each piece was gonna

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.150 
around each piece each piece was gonna
be<00:00:43.710> used<00:00:44.040> as<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.399> template<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.420> lay<00:00:45.629> on<00:00:46.160> the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
be used as a template to lay on the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.279 
be used as a template to lay on the
metal<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:47.850> we<00:00:48.090> can<00:00:48.239> cut<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.600> off<00:00:48.780> and

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
metal so that we can cut it off and

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.110 
metal so that we can cut it off and
again<00:00:49.680> like<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:50.039> said<00:00:50.100> if<00:00:50.460> it's<00:00:50.640> off<00:00:50.820> by<00:00:51.090> a

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
again like I said if it's off by a

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.900 
again like I said if it's off by a
couple<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.809> like<00:00:52.469> this<00:00:52.680> section<00:00:53.190> right<00:00:53.489> here<00:00:53.550> if

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
couple I like this section right here if

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.049 
couple I like this section right here if
it's<00:00:54.090> off<00:00:54.270> by<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.539> couple<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:55.610> pixels<00:00:56.610> or<00:00:56.820> so

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
it's off by a couple of pixels or so

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.729 
it's off by a couple of pixels or so
that's<00:00:57.719> not<00:00:57.899> gonna<00:00:58.109> make<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.559> much

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
that's not gonna make that much

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.920 
that's not gonna make that much
difference<00:00:58.770> because<00:00:59.280> cutting<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.600> on<00:01:00.809> the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
difference because cutting this on the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.869 
difference because cutting this on the
metal<00:01:01.260> we're<00:01:01.949> gonna<00:01:02.100> only<00:01:02.280> gonna<00:01:02.460> be<00:01:02.609> able<00:01:02.699> to

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
metal we're gonna only gonna be able to

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.119 
metal we're gonna only gonna be able to
cut<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.270> as<00:01:03.449> close<00:01:03.480> as<00:01:04.019> our<00:01:04.350> tool<00:01:04.710> will<00:01:04.890> cut

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
cut it as close as our tool will cut

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.480 
cut it as close as our tool will cut
anyways<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:06.540> those<00:01:07.350> little<00:01:07.530> inconsistencies

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
anyways so those little inconsistencies

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.620 
anyways so those little inconsistencies
aren't<00:01:08.909> going<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.119> make<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.450> much

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
aren't going to make that much

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.060 
aren't going to make that much
difference<00:01:09.659> if<00:01:10.200> you're<00:01:10.350> off<00:01:10.500> just<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:11.040> little

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
difference if you're off just a little

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.120 
difference if you're off just a little
bit<00:01:11.430> now<00:01:11.610> if<00:01:11.670> you're<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:11.909> off<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:13.130> five

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
bit now if you're in off of five

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.190 
bit now if you're in off of five
millimetres<00:01:14.760> quarter<00:01:15.150> inch<00:01:15.330> something<00:01:16.020> like

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
millimetres quarter inch something like

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.109 
millimetres quarter inch something like
that<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.189> might<00:01:17.369> make<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.580> little<00:01:17.850> bit<00:01:17.939> of

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
that and that might make a little bit of

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.020 
that and that might make a little bit of
difference<00:01:18.479> but<00:01:18.979> generally<00:01:19.979> being<00:01:20.220> off<00:01:20.490> you

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
difference but generally being off you

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.480 
difference but generally being off you
know<00:01:21.150> just<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.600> small<00:01:21.960> amount<00:01:22.259> isn't<00:01:23.100> gonna

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
know just a small amount isn't gonna

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.180 
know just a small amount isn't gonna
make<00:01:23.610> much<00:01:23.820> difference<00:01:23.850> at<00:01:24.360> all

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.830 

okay<00:01:31.190> here<00:01:31.460> you<00:01:31.580> can<00:01:31.730> see<00:01:32.000> I'm<00:01:32.150> at<00:01:32.330> the<00:01:32.480> end<00:01:32.690> of

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
okay here you can see I'm at the end of

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.140 
okay here you can see I'm at the end of
the<00:01:32.900> pattern<00:01:33.320> now<00:01:33.500> I'm<00:01:33.860> finishing<00:01:34.280> taping<00:01:34.970> up

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
the pattern now I'm finishing taping up

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.130 
the pattern now I'm finishing taping up
the<00:01:35.600> last<00:01:36.200> stages<00:01:37.150> everything<00:01:38.150> fitted<00:01:38.600> quite

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
the last stages everything fitted quite

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.650 
the last stages everything fitted quite
well<00:01:39.380> got<00:01:39.710> quite<00:01:40.520> a<00:01:40.550> large<00:01:40.850> sheet<00:01:41.240> here<00:01:41.510> it's

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
well got quite a large sheet here it's

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.510 
well got quite a large sheet here it's
three<00:01:41.930> foot<00:01:42.200> by<00:01:42.230> four<00:01:42.650> foot<00:01:42.680> you've<00:01:43.220> exceeded

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
three foot by four foot you've exceeded

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.510 
three foot by four foot you've exceeded
the<00:01:43.880> size<00:01:44.090> of<00:01:44.330> my<00:01:44.450> tables<00:01:44.870> somewhat<00:01:45.430> but<00:01:46.430> the

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
the size of my tables somewhat but the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.400 
the size of my tables somewhat but the
next<00:01:46.790> thing<00:01:46.940> I<00:01:47.060> want<00:01:47.270> to<00:01:47.330> do<00:01:47.600> is<00:01:47.960> turn<00:01:48.170> this

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
next thing I want to do is turn this

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.320 
next thing I want to do is turn this
over<00:01:49.180> and<00:01:50.180> see<00:01:51.020> if<00:01:51.140> I<00:01:51.290> can<00:01:51.530> see<00:01:52.060> the<00:01:53.060> lines

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
over and see if I can see the lines

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.390 
over and see if I can see the lines
where<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:53.870> pattern<00:01:54.290> come<00:01:54.560> you<00:01:54.860> may<00:01:55.040> not<00:01:55.220> be

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
where the pattern come you may not be

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.560 
where the pattern come you may not be
able<00:01:55.550> to<00:01:55.640> see<00:01:55.910> them<00:01:56.800> but<00:01:57.910> I'll<00:01:58.910> be<00:01:59.090> able<00:01:59.270> to<00:01:59.360> see

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
able to see them but I'll be able to see

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.140 
able to see them but I'll be able to see
them<00:01:59.690> fairly<00:01:59.960> well<00:02:00.320> on<00:02:00.350> all<00:02:00.680> I<00:02:00.710> want<00:02:01.010> to<00:02:01.100> do<00:02:01.250> is

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
them fairly well on all I want to do is

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.390 
them fairly well on all I want to do is
just<00:02:02.540> make<00:02:02.750> sure<00:02:02.990> I<00:02:03.020> take<00:02:03.410> down<00:02:03.740> all<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:04.250> back

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
just make sure I take down all the back

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.070 
just make sure I take down all the back
edges<00:02:07.090> because<00:02:08.090> when<00:02:08.270> I<00:02:08.300> start<00:02:08.630> cutting<00:02:08.810> the

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
edges because when I start cutting the

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.600 
edges because when I start cutting the
pattern<00:02:09.470> out<00:02:09.590> I<00:02:09.649> don't<00:02:09.950> want<00:02:10.160> really<00:02:10.340> any

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
pattern out I don't want really any

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.330 
pattern out I don't want really any
loose<00:02:10.910> edges<00:02:11.239> hanging<00:02:11.840> around<00:02:12.140> this<00:02:12.920> gives<00:02:13.160> it

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
loose edges hanging around this gives it

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.890 
loose edges hanging around this gives it
a<00:02:13.400> little<00:02:13.640> bit<00:02:13.760> of<00:02:13.850> reinforcement<00:02:14.630> so<00:02:14.780> our

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
a little bit of reinforcement so our

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.540 
a little bit of reinforcement so our
pattern<00:02:15.260> doesn't<00:02:15.620> come<00:02:15.800> apart<00:02:15.950> while<00:02:16.370> we're

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
pattern doesn't come apart while we're

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:29.330 
pattern doesn't come apart while we're
cutting<00:02:16.760> it

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.580 

okay<00:02:30.060> I've<00:02:30.270> got<00:02:30.450> all<00:02:30.569> my<00:02:30.599> reinforcements

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
okay I've got all my reinforcements

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.640 
okay I've got all my reinforcements
taped<00:02:32.010> up<00:02:32.280> now<00:02:32.599> so<00:02:33.599> the<00:02:33.750> next<00:02:33.930> thing<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:34.319> want<00:02:34.590> to

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
taped up now so the next thing I want to

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.030 
taped up now so the next thing I want to
do<00:02:38.300> and<00:02:39.300> actually<00:02:39.840> start<00:02:40.140> cutting<00:02:40.410> out<00:02:40.770> the

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
do and actually start cutting out the

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.270 
do and actually start cutting out the
pieces<00:02:41.959> now<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.020> reason<00:02:43.410> why<00:02:43.560> I<00:02:43.590> want<00:02:43.920> to<00:02:43.980> cut

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
pieces now the reason why I want to cut

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.410 
pieces now the reason why I want to cut
the<00:02:44.430> pieces<00:02:44.670> out<00:02:45.290> is<00:02:46.290> so<00:02:46.620> that<00:02:46.860> I<00:02:47.069> can<00:02:47.940> tape

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
the pieces out is so that I can tape

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.860 
the pieces out is so that I can tape
them<00:02:48.540> unto<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.080> middle<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:50.150> cut<00:02:51.150> along<00:02:51.420> the

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
them unto the middle and cut along the

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.740 
them unto the middle and cut along the
edges<00:02:52.819> because<00:02:53.819> I<00:02:53.849> don't<00:02:54.150> want<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:54.420> have<00:02:54.599> to

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
edges because I don't want to have to

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.479 
edges because I don't want to have to
have<00:02:54.870> all<00:02:55.050> this<00:02:55.230> waste<00:02:55.530> paper<00:02:55.860> in<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.250> way<00:02:56.430> so

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
have all this waste paper in the way so

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.610 
have all this waste paper in the way so
I<00:02:56.700> can't<00:02:56.970> see<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.330> middle<00:02:57.630> plus<00:02:58.140> it'll<00:02:58.410> give

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
I can't see the middle plus it'll give

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.140 
I can't see the middle plus it'll give
me<00:02:58.739> a<00:02:58.769> way<00:02:59.040> what<00:02:59.430> we're<00:02:59.580> doing<00:02:59.790> is<00:02:59.910> we're<00:03:00.060> going

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
me a way what we're doing is we're going

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.210 
me a way what we're doing is we're going
to<00:03:00.209> use<00:03:00.420> this<00:03:00.660> similar<00:03:01.319> to<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.530> dressmakers

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
to use this similar to a dressmakers

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.430 
to use this similar to a dressmakers
pattern<00:03:02.610> so<00:03:03.269> we're<00:03:03.390> just<00:03:03.420> going<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.780> be<00:03:03.930> using

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
pattern so we're just going to be using

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.620 
pattern so we're just going to be using
the<00:03:04.560> pieces<00:03:04.769> of<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.100> pattern<00:03:05.370> that<00:03:05.790> are

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
the pieces of the pattern that are

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.320 
the pieces of the pattern that are
inside<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.500> pieces<00:03:08.040> that<00:03:08.250> we<00:03:08.430> intend<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.060> cut

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
inside the pieces that we intend to cut

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.990 
inside the pieces that we intend to cut
out<00:03:09.510> I<00:03:09.860> believe<00:03:10.860> that<00:03:11.069> in<00:03:11.220> this<00:03:11.370> pattern<00:03:11.670> you

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
out I believe that in this pattern you

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.839 
out I believe that in this pattern you
can<00:03:12.150> see<00:03:12.230> the<00:03:13.230> frustum<00:03:13.709> that<00:03:14.250> makes<00:03:14.489> up<00:03:14.700> the

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
can see the frustum that makes up the

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.900 
can see the frustum that makes up the
line<00:03:15.060> arm<00:03:15.299> I'm<00:03:16.170> going<00:03:16.410> to<00:03:16.470> take<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.190> pair<00:03:17.790> of

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
line arm I'm going to take the pair of

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.850 
line arm I'm going to take the pair of
scissors<00:03:18.299> and<00:03:18.540> I'm<00:03:18.780> just<00:03:18.959> going<00:03:19.230> to<00:03:19.290> manually

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
scissors and I'm just going to manually

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.030 
scissors and I'm just going to manually
cut<00:03:20.130> this<00:03:20.810> piece<00:03:21.810> out<00:03:22.080> of<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.319> pattern<00:03:22.590> stand

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
cut this piece out of the pattern stand

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.280 
cut this piece out of the pattern stand
as<00:03:23.160> close<00:03:23.340> to<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:23.760> edges<00:03:23.880> as<00:03:24.209> I<00:03:24.360> can<00:03:27.080> this<00:03:28.080> is

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
as close to the edges as I can this is

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.780 
as close to the edges as I can this is
actually<00:03:28.650> going<00:03:28.830> to<00:03:28.950> be<00:03:29.099> the<00:03:29.310> piece<00:03:29.519> that<00:03:29.730> I

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
actually going to be the piece that I

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.240 
actually going to be the piece that I
taped<00:03:30.180> onto<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.959> metal<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.769> cut<00:03:31.980> around

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.440 

you'll<00:03:35.250> have<00:03:35.340> to<00:03:35.579> watch<00:03:35.790> for<00:03:36.000> some<00:03:36.209> of<00:03:36.359> the

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
you'll have to watch for some of the

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.699 
you'll have to watch for some of the
intersections<00:03:37.140> because<00:03:37.230> they<00:03:37.470> can<00:03:37.590> be<00:03:37.680> a

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
intersections because they can be a

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.490 
intersections because they can be a
little<00:03:37.890> bit<00:03:38.100> tough<00:03:38.750> but<00:03:39.750> as<00:03:39.870> you<00:03:40.019> can<00:03:40.140> see<00:03:40.320> my

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
little bit tough but as you can see my

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.470 
little bit tough but as you can see my
little<00:03:40.769> bit<00:03:40.890> of<00:03:40.980> misalignment<00:03:41.519> isn't<00:03:42.299> really

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
little bit of misalignment isn't really

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.880 
little bit of misalignment isn't really
going<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.720> make<00:03:42.900> that<00:03:43.079> much<00:03:43.290> difference<00:03:43.320> when

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
going to make that much difference when

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.500 
going to make that much difference when
I<00:03:43.920> start<00:03:44.220> cutting<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.700> pattern<00:03:45.060> out<00:03:45.150> because

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
I start cutting the pattern out because

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.720 
I start cutting the pattern out because
I<00:03:45.690> can<00:03:45.870> make<00:03:46.019> any<00:03:46.590> Corrections<00:03:47.190> I<00:03:47.310> need<00:03:47.519> with

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
I can make any Corrections I need with

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.780 
I can make any Corrections I need with
the<00:03:47.880> scissors<00:03:48.739> you<00:03:49.739> want<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.040> be<00:03:50.100> careful<00:03:50.430> that

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
the scissors you want to be careful that

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.479 
the scissors you want to be careful that
we<00:03:50.910> don't<00:03:51.350> cut<00:03:52.350> up<00:03:52.470> any<00:03:52.650> of<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:52.920> pieces<00:03:53.130> of<00:03:53.310> the

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
we don't cut up any of the pieces of the

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.789 
we don't cut up any of the pieces of the
pattern<00:03:53.880> that<00:03:53.910> we're<00:03:54.239> going<00:03:54.420> to<00:03:54.480> keep<00:03:54.690> such<00:03:55.620> as

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
pattern that we're going to keep such as

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:14.570 
pattern that we're going to keep such as
that<00:03:56.040> round<00:03:56.880> pin<00:03:57.299> that<00:03:57.569> I<00:03:57.660> just<00:03:57.870> ran<00:03:58.049> into

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.110 

now<00:04:15.580> cutting<00:04:16.060> against<00:04:16.479> the<00:04:16.600> bars<00:04:17.169> in<00:04:17.530> the

now cutting against the bars in the
paper<00:04:19.120> sometimes<00:04:19.690> I<00:04:20.019> have<00:04:20.199> to<00:04:20.350> lift<00:04:20.560> it<00:04:20.769> up<00:04:20.889> so

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
paper sometimes I have to lift it up so

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.469 
paper sometimes I have to lift it up so
that<00:04:21.190> I<00:04:21.280> can<00:04:21.459> get<00:04:21.609> the<00:04:21.760> edge<00:04:21.850> of<00:04:22.030> the<00:04:22.120> scissors

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
that I can get the edge of the scissors

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:32.510 
that I can get the edge of the scissors
underneath<00:04:22.720> the<00:04:23.260> edges<00:04:23.740> where<00:04:23.949> I<00:04:24.010> didn't<00:04:24.340> take

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.700 

since<00:04:33.240> this<00:04:33.360> piece<00:04:33.660> is<00:04:33.870> loose<00:04:34.110> I'm<00:04:34.319> just<00:04:34.530> gonna

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
since this piece is loose I'm just gonna

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.650 
since this piece is loose I'm just gonna
pull<00:04:35.340> it<00:04:35.490> up<00:04:35.610> where<00:04:35.880> I<00:04:35.940> can<00:04:36.150> get<00:04:36.300> to<00:04:36.509> it<00:04:36.599> a

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
pull it up where I can get to it a

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.520 
pull it up where I can get to it a
little<00:04:36.840> easier<00:04:38.060> this<00:04:39.060> is<00:04:39.120> a<00:04:39.270> very<00:04:39.630> smooth

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
little easier this is a very smooth

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.240 
little easier this is a very smooth
curve<00:04:41.840> once<00:04:42.840> this<00:04:43.020> is<00:04:43.229> rolled<00:04:43.470> up<00:04:43.710> this<00:04:43.949> makes

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
curve once this is rolled up this makes

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.580 
curve once this is rolled up this makes
the<00:04:44.610> half-inch<00:04:45.360> diameter<00:04:45.630> piece<00:04:46.169> of<00:04:46.349> pipe

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
the half-inch diameter piece of pipe

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.159 
the half-inch diameter piece of pipe
that<00:04:47.490> makes<00:04:47.729> the<00:04:47.910> end<00:04:48.090> of<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.330> line<00:04:48.539> arm<00:04:48.780> that

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
that makes the end of the line arm that

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:56.779 
that makes the end of the line arm that
connects<00:04:49.530> to<00:04:49.710> the<00:04:49.830> condenser<00:04:55.099> this<00:04:56.099> around<00:04:56.430> so

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:56.789 
connects to the condenser this around so

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:06.260 
connects to the condenser this around so
I<00:04:56.880> can<00:04:56.940> see<00:04:57.330> this

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.749 

now<00:05:07.270> if<00:05:07.360> I<00:05:07.479> leave<00:05:07.659> any<00:05:07.900> little<00:05:08.319> extra<00:05:09.129> danglies

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 
now if I leave any little extra danglies

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:11.610 
now if I leave any little extra danglies
hanging<00:05:10.150> around<00:05:10.389> I<00:05:10.539> can<00:05:10.689> always<00:05:10.990> go<00:05:11.259> back<00:05:11.289> and

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
hanging around I can always go back and

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.159 
hanging around I can always go back and
clean<00:05:11.830> them<00:05:12.009> up<00:05:12.159> a<00:05:12.490> lot<00:05:13.360> of<00:05:13.479> times<00:05:13.689> what<00:05:14.050> I'll

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
clean them up a lot of times what I'll

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:19.529 
clean them up a lot of times what I'll
do<00:05:14.379> is<00:05:15.009> off<00:05:15.250> cut<00:05:15.580> a<00:05:15.879> half<00:05:16.719> inch<00:05:17.759> or<00:05:18.759> so<00:05:19.120> around

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
do is off cut a half inch or so around

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:21.839 
do is off cut a half inch or so around
the<00:05:20.020> pattern<00:05:20.259> and<00:05:20.560> then<00:05:20.860> go<00:05:21.039> back<00:05:21.219> and<00:05:21.250> cut<00:05:21.639> the

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:21.849 
the pattern and then go back and cut the

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.749 
the pattern and then go back and cut the
pattern<00:05:22.210> now<00:05:22.360> I<00:05:22.830> just<00:05:23.830> wanted<00:05:24.310> to<00:05:24.490> show<00:05:24.699> you

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:24.759 
pattern now I just wanted to show you

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:27.029 
pattern now I just wanted to show you
one<00:05:25.060> example<00:05:25.449> of<00:05:25.719> cutting<00:05:26.199> out<00:05:26.379> a<00:05:26.409> piece<00:05:26.710> of<00:05:26.740> a

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 
one example of cutting out a piece of a

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:31.860 
one example of cutting out a piece of a
pattern<00:05:29.460> so<00:05:30.460> if<00:05:30.550> I've<00:05:30.699> left<00:05:30.909> any<00:05:31.150> edges<00:05:31.569> I<00:05:31.719> can

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
pattern so if I've left any edges I can

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.480 
pattern so if I've left any edges I can
always<00:05:32.020> go<00:05:32.289> back<00:05:32.319> and<00:05:32.650> clean<00:05:32.830> those<00:05:33.039> up<00:05:33.069> later

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.999 

I've<00:05:36.490> got<00:05:36.699> this<00:05:36.909> one<00:05:37.810> little<00:05:37.990> edge<00:05:38.409> here<00:05:38.860> that

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:39.009 
I've got this one little edge here that

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:41.969 
I've got this one little edge here that
I<00:05:39.250> didn't<00:05:39.610> get<00:05:39.789> real<00:05:40.029> close<00:05:40.300> to<00:05:40.800> but<00:05:41.800> with<00:05:41.949> a

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
I didn't get real close to but with a

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:43.740 
I didn't get real close to but with a
little<00:05:42.279> bit<00:05:42.400> of<00:05:42.430> careful<00:05:42.939> trimming<00:05:43.449> I<00:05:43.569> can

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
little bit of careful trimming I can

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.499 
little bit of careful trimming I can
actually<00:05:43.930> go<00:05:44.259> through<00:05:44.289> and<00:05:44.800> clean<00:05:45.759> that<00:05:46.060> up<00:05:46.090> to

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:46.509 
actually go through and clean that up to

00:05:46.509 --> 00:05:49.469 
actually go through and clean that up to
where<00:05:46.659> it's<00:05:47.490> gonna<00:05:48.490> be<00:05:48.699> as<00:05:48.819> about<00:05:49.000> as<00:05:49.150> close<00:05:49.419> as

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
where it's gonna be as about as close as

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:54.749 
where it's gonna be as about as close as
I<00:05:49.779> can<00:05:49.840> get<00:05:50.169> with<00:05:50.439> paper<00:05:50.740> pattern<00:05:52.500> and<00:05:53.759> that's

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:54.759 
I can get with paper pattern and that's

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:56.659 
I can get with paper pattern and that's
an<00:05:54.909> example<00:05:55.180> of<00:05:55.419> cutting<00:05:55.779> out<00:05:55.960> one<00:05:56.139> piece

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 
an example of cutting out one piece

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:58.830 
an example of cutting out one piece
occasionally<00:05:57.669> you'll<00:05:57.879> run<00:05:58.060> into<00:05:58.210> a<00:05:58.419> section

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 
occasionally you'll run into a section

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.809 
occasionally you'll run into a section
like<00:05:59.080> this<00:05:59.379> as<00:05:59.650> I<00:05:59.949> was<00:06:00.069> cutting<00:06:00.340> this<00:06:00.550> out<00:06:00.759> I

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:00.819 
like this as I was cutting this out I

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:03.450 
like this as I was cutting this out I
found<00:06:01.180> that<00:06:01.569> this<00:06:02.080> one<00:06:02.319> was<00:06:02.529> disassembled

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
found that this one was disassembled

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.570 
found that this one was disassembled
across<00:06:04.120> this<00:06:04.389> one<00:06:04.659> edge<00:06:05.039> so<00:06:06.039> what<00:06:06.219> I<00:06:06.250> want<00:06:06.490> to

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
across this one edge so what I want to

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.930 
across this one edge so what I want to
do<00:06:06.729> is<00:06:06.939> I<00:06:07.060> want<00:06:07.240> to<00:06:07.300> make<00:06:07.449> sure<00:06:08.639> that<00:06:09.639> every

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
do is I want to make sure that every

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.760 
do is I want to make sure that every
place<00:06:10.150> that<00:06:10.389> the<00:06:10.479> paper<00:06:10.719> comes<00:06:11.080> together<00:06:11.349> on

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:11.770 
place that the paper comes together on

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.469 
place that the paper comes together on
part<00:06:12.099> of<00:06:12.219> the<00:06:12.310> template<00:06:12.819> I<00:06:12.969> want<00:06:13.150> to<00:06:13.270> go<00:06:13.389> ahead

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:13.479 
part of the template I want to go ahead

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:15.839 
part of the template I want to go ahead
and<00:06:13.719> tape<00:06:13.960> up<00:06:14.199> to<00:06:14.440> make<00:06:15.069> sure<00:06:15.279> that<00:06:15.430> as<00:06:15.580> strong

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:15.849 
and tape up to make sure that as strong

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:18.329 
and tape up to make sure that as strong
as<00:06:16.029> I<00:06:16.120> can<00:06:16.300> get<00:06:16.509> it<00:06:16.659> and<00:06:16.990> then<00:06:17.979> that<00:06:18.159> will<00:06:18.310> allow

00:06:18.329 --> 00:06:18.339 
as I can get it and then that will allow

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:21.510 
as I can get it and then that will allow
me<00:06:18.789> to<00:06:18.909> go<00:06:19.029> ahead<00:06:19.270> and<00:06:19.419> cut<00:06:19.719> it<00:06:19.750> so<00:06:20.520> that

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 
me to go ahead and cut it so that

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.869 
me to go ahead and cut it so that
there's<00:06:21.969> no<00:06:22.210> loose<00:06:22.750> edges<00:06:23.020> hanging<00:06:23.560> out<00:06:23.879> that

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:24.879 
there's no loose edges hanging out that

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:26.369 
there's no loose edges hanging out that
would<00:06:25.089> come<00:06:25.330> apart<00:06:25.690> while<00:06:25.900> I'm<00:06:26.050> trying<00:06:26.319> to

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:26.379 
would come apart while I'm trying to

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:28.529 
would come apart while I'm trying to
tape<00:06:26.589> it<00:06:26.770> down<00:06:26.889> to<00:06:27.069> my<00:06:27.219> template<00:06:27.669> as<00:06:27.969> you<00:06:28.180> can

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:28.539 
tape it down to my template as you can

00:06:28.539 --> 00:06:32.450 
tape it down to my template as you can
see<00:06:29.039> I'm<00:06:30.039> working<00:06:31.029> on<00:06:31.120> the<00:06:31.300> last<00:06:31.479> piece<00:06:31.810> here

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:38.199 
things next thing I have to do is just

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:41.279 
things next thing I have to do is just
clean<00:06:39.099> up<00:06:39.129> my<00:06:39.430> mess<00:06:39.610> a<00:06:39.639> little<00:06:39.909> bit<00:06:40.180> the<00:06:41.020> next

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:41.289 
clean up my mess a little bit the next

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:43.170 
clean up my mess a little bit the next
thing<00:06:41.469> we'll<00:06:41.620> be<00:06:41.800> moving<00:06:42.129> on<00:06:42.279> to<00:06:42.430> is<00:06:42.759> putting

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.180 
thing we'll be moving on to is putting

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:49.659 
thing we'll be moving on to is putting
the<00:06:43.360> pattern<00:06:43.689> on<00:06:43.810> the<00:06:43.839> metal<00:06:44.199> and

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:49.669 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:52.760 

that<00:06:50.669> completes<00:06:51.090> the<00:06:51.300> pattern<00:06:51.630> I'll<00:06:52.380> lay<00:06:52.590> this

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:52.770 
that completes the pattern I'll lay this

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.010 
that completes the pattern I'll lay this
out<00:06:53.010> if<00:06:53.190> you<00:06:53.220> can<00:06:53.520> get<00:06:53.639> a<00:06:53.700> kind<00:06:54.300> of<00:06:54.419> a<00:06:54.570> look<00:06:54.810> at

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.020 
out if you can get a kind of a look at

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.680 
out if you can get a kind of a look at
how<00:06:55.889> well<00:06:56.190> the<00:06:56.430> pattern<00:06:56.610> comes<00:06:57.000> together<00:06:57.270> once

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:57.690 
how well the pattern comes together once

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.340 
how well the pattern comes together once
it's<00:06:57.900> cut<00:06:58.110> up<00:06:58.280> and<00:06:59.540> here's<00:07:00.540> an<00:07:00.690> example<00:07:00.750> of<00:07:01.200> a

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:01.350 
it's cut up and here's an example of a

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:04.070 
it's cut up and here's an example of a
round<00:07:01.650> piece<00:07:01.950> that<00:07:02.250> was<00:07:02.430> cut<00:07:02.669> so<00:07:03.540> you<00:07:03.600> see<00:07:03.900> they

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 
round piece that was cut so you see they

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.710 
round piece that was cut so you see they
actually<00:07:04.530> make<00:07:04.710> fairly<00:07:05.010> nice<00:07:05.340> patterns<00:07:05.790> the

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 
actually make fairly nice patterns the

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.510 
actually make fairly nice patterns the
round<00:07:06.930> pieces<00:07:07.230> all<00:07:07.590> be<00:07:07.740> in<00:07:07.830> the<00:07:07.919> same<00:07:07.950> size

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 
round pieces all be in the same size

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.240 
round pieces all be in the same size
they're<00:07:08.940> fairly<00:07:09.660> easy<00:07:09.900> to<00:07:10.050> keep<00:07:10.530> track<00:07:10.800> of<00:07:10.830> or

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.250 
they're fairly easy to keep track of or

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.000 
they're fairly easy to keep track of or
which<00:07:11.460> goes<00:07:11.700> where<00:07:12.000> I<00:07:12.330> laid<00:07:12.930> this<00:07:13.169> sheet<00:07:13.440> out<00:07:13.470> I

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.010 
which goes where I laid this sheet out I

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.640 
which goes where I laid this sheet out I
laid<00:07:14.669> it<00:07:14.790> out<00:07:14.970> so<00:07:15.240> that<00:07:15.270> it<00:07:15.540> would<00:07:15.690> fit<00:07:15.930> a<00:07:15.960> three

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:16.650 
laid it out so that it would fit a three

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:19.610 
laid it out so that it would fit a three
foot<00:07:16.889> by<00:07:17.130> four<00:07:17.400> foot<00:07:17.430> sheet<00:07:18.110> so<00:07:19.110> whenever<00:07:19.350> I

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:19.620 
foot by four foot sheet so whenever I

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.500 
foot by four foot sheet so whenever I
start<00:07:20.250> putting<00:07:20.430> these<00:07:20.700> patterns<00:07:21.180> on<00:07:21.389> the

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:21.510 
start putting these patterns on the

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:24.050 
start putting these patterns on the
copper<00:07:21.900> what<00:07:22.290> I'll<00:07:22.410> end<00:07:22.650> up<00:07:22.800> doing<00:07:23.010> is<00:07:23.760> I'll

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.060 
copper what I'll end up doing is I'll

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.330 
copper what I'll end up doing is I'll
end<00:07:24.300> up<00:07:24.419> laying<00:07:24.720> the<00:07:25.020> pieces<00:07:25.470> out<00:07:25.650> in<00:07:26.010> almost

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:26.340 
end up laying the pieces out in almost

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.340 
end up laying the pieces out in almost
the<00:07:26.490> same<00:07:26.580> pattern<00:07:27.270> as<00:07:27.479> I<00:07:27.690> have<00:07:27.900> in<00:07:28.200> this

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:28.350 
the same pattern as I have in this

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:31.580 
the same pattern as I have in this
drawing<00:07:28.620> here<00:07:29.389> the<00:07:30.389> CAD<00:07:30.630> program<00:07:30.660> was<00:07:31.440> very

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:31.590 
drawing here the CAD program was very

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:33.469 
drawing here the CAD program was very
nice<00:07:32.040> that<00:07:32.280> it<00:07:32.400> would<00:07:32.550> allow<00:07:32.639> me<00:07:32.790> to<00:07:33.000> define

00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:33.479 
nice that it would allow me to define

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:35.540 
nice that it would allow me to define
these<00:07:33.810> all<00:07:34.080> his<00:07:34.260> individual<00:07:34.860> objects<00:07:35.250> then<00:07:35.460> I

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:35.550 
these all his individual objects then I

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:37.250 
these all his individual objects then I
could<00:07:35.729> move<00:07:35.940> them<00:07:36.150> around<00:07:36.270> rotate<00:07:36.960> them<00:07:37.139> and

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:37.260 
could move them around rotate them and

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.350 
could move them around rotate them and
then<00:07:37.740> just<00:07:37.919> basically<00:07:38.100> figure<00:07:38.880> out<00:07:39.090> what

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 
then just basically figure out what

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.330 
then just basically figure out what
pattern<00:07:39.780> I<00:07:39.930> could<00:07:40.110> most<00:07:40.350> efficiently<00:07:40.979> put<00:07:41.160> on

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:41.340 
pattern I could most efficiently put on

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.490 
pattern I could most efficiently put on
the<00:07:41.460> sheet<00:07:41.700> even<00:07:42.630> though<00:07:42.780> there<00:07:42.960> seems<00:07:43.200> like

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:43.500 
the sheet even though there seems like

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.350 
the sheet even though there seems like
there's<00:07:43.710> a<00:07:43.770> lot<00:07:43.950> of<00:07:44.130> wasted<00:07:44.580> copper<00:07:45.000> going<00:07:45.300> to

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 
there's a lot of wasted copper going to

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.050 
there's a lot of wasted copper going to
be<00:07:45.510> in<00:07:45.660> here<00:07:45.990> it<00:07:46.860> really<00:07:46.889> won't<00:07:47.340> be<00:07:47.490> wasted<00:07:47.940> in

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:48.060 
be in here it really won't be wasted in

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.850 
be in here it really won't be wasted in
the<00:07:48.180> long<00:07:48.360> run<00:07:48.600> we'll<00:07:48.930> figure<00:07:49.139> out<00:07:49.320> something

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:49.860 
the long run we'll figure out something

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.310 
the long run we'll figure out something
else<00:07:49.979> to<00:07:50.130> do
