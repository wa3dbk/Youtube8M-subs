00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.259
 Today I'm going to teach you how to make these nails 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:08.080
 What did I do? 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:10.990
 Mexicans for September 15th what 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:14.760
 what we're going to do first is put 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:18.090
 and a French in red 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:22.500
 then we are going to put a layer of 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:26.030
 shines a little passed up 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.030
 digits with silver 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:39.579
 and then we are going to use what is 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.579
 in green acrylic paint 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:47.390
 and what we are going to do is draw a 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.390
 line like this 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.920
 in the form of a spiral down 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.270
 A) Yes 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.680
 and this if we have very 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.090
 and soft green color we have to 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.859
 happen again 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.859
 what we do is this 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.930
 but after 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.930
 make two other lines 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.750
 one that goes up 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.110
 well and one that goes down 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.930
 and in this way 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.320
 there you see 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.540
 then we will occupy the color painting 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.390
 white acrylic 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.140
 and what we are going to do 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.140
 is to pass 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.990
 and the painting as contouring in the 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.990
 green 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.720
 in different parts 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.770
 and so in this way 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.780
 l 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.780
 and with a silver color 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:37.600
 What we are going to do is to pass the same 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.080
 where is the 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:45.450
 as the spiral green milestone but the other 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.450
 side not for white but on the other side 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.820
 yes 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.800
 and finally we are going to put some small 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.800
 little dots of him 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.299
 of white acrylic 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.320
 little dots 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.180
 you can use a punch the tip of a 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.480
 as they see fit and be them 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.480
 easier 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.870
 well in this way and we have our list 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.579
 shore we only apply varnish 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.189
 transparent once it is dry 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:48.099
 our clinician so that we do not run 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:52.340
 and that's it, I hope you liked it 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:56.420
 remember this is the model 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:59.810
 and I hope you have liked to subscribe
