00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
think this will fit a lot of sizes I

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.539 
think this will fit a lot of sizes I
think<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:19.900> was<00:02:19.989> one<00:02:20.290> size<00:02:20.650> fits<00:02:20.980> all<00:02:21.160> I<00:02:21.280> might

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
think it was one size fits all I might

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:23.610 
think it was one size fits all I might
have<00:02:21.670> not<00:02:21.790> been<00:02:21.849> but<00:02:22.510> if<00:02:22.629> it<00:02:22.780> was<00:02:22.959> like<00:02:23.200> this<00:02:23.440> is

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
have not been but if it was like this is

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.530 
have not been but if it was like this is
really<00:02:23.799> really<00:02:23.920> stretchy<00:02:24.489> so<00:02:25.180> I<00:02:25.209> think<00:02:25.269> this

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
really really stretchy so I think this

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.059 
really really stretchy so I think this
will<00:02:25.660> fit<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:25.870> lot<00:02:26.200> of<00:02:26.230> people<00:02:26.379> it<00:02:26.950> could

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
will fit a lot of people it could

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:28.979 
will fit a lot of people it could
probably<00:02:27.310> fit<00:02:27.549> up<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.849> large<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.720> next

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
probably fit up to a large the next

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.509 
probably fit up to a large the next
piece<00:02:29.140> is<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.319> dress<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:29.799> fits<00:02:30.010> me<00:02:30.250> but<00:02:30.489> I

piece is a dress it fits me but I

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:31.680

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.349 
probably should have got a small I
thought<00:02:32.290> a<00:02:32.319> medium<00:02:32.799> would<00:02:33.010> fit<00:02:33.280> me<00:02:33.430> but<00:02:33.640> yeah

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.059 
just a little bit not that much cuz this
up<00:03:01.269> here<00:03:01.630> is<00:03:01.780> pretty<00:03:02.470> high<00:03:02.769> up

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
up here is pretty high up

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.190 
up here is pretty high up
it's<00:03:03.489> literally<00:03:03.819> pretty<00:03:04.269> high<00:03:04.450> up<00:03:04.480> so<00:03:05.049> it's

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
it's literally pretty high up so it's

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.159 
it's literally pretty high up so it's
like<00:03:05.319> barely<00:03:05.650> a<00:03:05.829> drop<00:03:06.040> in<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.370> back<00:03:06.599> so<00:03:07.599> yeah<00:03:07.750> I

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:08.169 
like barely a drop in the back so yeah I

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:10.710 
like barely a drop in the back so yeah I
thought<00:03:08.709> was<00:03:08.829> really<00:03:08.950> pretty<00:03:09.220> and<00:03:09.669> it's<00:03:10.480> in

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
thought was really pretty and it's in

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.330 
thought was really pretty and it's in
the<00:03:10.870> color<00:03:11.049> wine<00:03:11.349> red<00:03:11.620> they<00:03:11.889> also<00:03:12.040> have<00:03:12.250> a

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
the color wine red they also have a

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.620 
the color wine red they also have a
black<00:03:12.519> one<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:12.880> I<00:03:12.940> was<00:03:13.060> gonna<00:03:13.209> get<00:03:13.419> the<00:03:13.480> black

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
black one and I was gonna get the black

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.900 
black one and I was gonna get the black
one<00:03:13.930> but<00:03:14.290> I<00:03:14.829> just<00:03:15.220> thought<00:03:15.430> this<00:03:15.579> one<00:03:15.730> would<00:03:15.849> be

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
one but I just thought this one would be

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.430 
one but I just thought this one would be
more<00:03:16.209> unique<00:03:16.480> I<00:03:16.810> thought<00:03:17.230> it<00:03:17.319> would<00:03:17.410> look

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
more unique I thought it would look

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.670 
more unique I thought it would look
prettier<00:03:18.780> yes

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
prettier yes

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.280 
prettier yes
here's<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:21.280> dress<00:03:21.700> if<00:03:22.209> it's<00:03:22.480> a<00:03:22.599> little<00:03:22.870> loose

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
here's the dress if it's a little loose

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.380 
here's the dress if it's a little loose
on<00:03:23.500> me<00:03:23.769> so<00:03:24.250> I<00:03:24.310> said<00:03:24.579> I<00:03:24.609> probably<00:03:24.939> should<00:03:25.269> have

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
on me so I said I probably should have

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.750 
on me so I said I probably should have
got<00:03:25.540> a<00:03:25.719> small<00:03:26.260> but<00:03:26.620> I<00:03:26.650> got<00:03:26.829> a<00:03:26.859> medium<00:03:27.250> model<00:03:27.430> I

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
got a small but I got a medium model I

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.539 
got a small but I got a medium model I
just<00:03:28.090> felt<00:03:28.269> like<00:03:28.359> um<00:03:29.349> because<00:03:30.099> most<00:03:30.370> stuff

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
just felt like um because most stuff

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.240 
just felt like um because most stuff
tends<00:03:30.909> to<00:03:31.090> be<00:03:31.209> pretty<00:03:31.989> small<00:03:32.379> on<00:03:32.709> their

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
tends to be pretty small on their

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.309 
tends to be pretty small on their
website<00:03:33.760> because<00:03:34.420> I<00:03:34.510> have<00:03:34.750> I<00:03:34.959> think<00:03:35.019> I've

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
website because I have I think I've

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:36.839 
website because I have I think I've
actually<00:03:35.650> ordered<00:03:36.129> something<00:03:36.340> from<00:03:36.670> them

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
actually ordered something from them

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.420 
actually ordered something from them
before<00:03:36.969> in<00:03:37.269> the<00:03:37.389> past<00:03:37.799> and<00:03:38.799> it<00:03:38.950> was<00:03:39.069> kind<00:03:39.340> of

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
before in the past and it was kind of

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.429 
before in the past and it was kind of
small<00:03:39.760> so<00:03:40.150> yeah<00:03:40.450> that's<00:03:40.659> why<00:03:40.750> I<00:03:40.780> got<00:03:40.989> a<00:03:41.019> medium

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:41.439 
small so yeah that's why I got a medium

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:43.920 
small so yeah that's why I got a medium
this<00:03:41.680> and<00:03:42.159> the<00:03:42.280> final<00:03:42.489> item<00:03:42.819> I<00:03:43.120> got<00:03:43.150> is<00:03:43.540> a<00:03:43.569> purse

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
put them in these dust bags and then

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:49.410 
put them in these dust bags and then
there<00:03:48.159> was<00:03:48.250> another<00:03:48.280> bag<00:03:48.849> around<00:03:49.090> it<00:03:49.299> to
