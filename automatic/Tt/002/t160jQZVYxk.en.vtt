00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.749 
I'll wear a blowout by the time I made
the<00:01:35.280> video<00:01:36.290> the<00:01:37.290> ends<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.680> my<00:01:37.770> hair<00:01:37.860> was<00:01:38.400> kind

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
the video the ends of my hair was kind

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.539 
the video the ends of my hair was kind
of<00:01:38.909> curling<00:01:39.780> up<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.259> little<00:01:40.799> bit<00:01:40.979> more<00:01:41.310> already

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
of curling up a little bit more already

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.719 
of curling up a little bit more already
and<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.450> think<00:01:42.750> it<00:01:42.869> was<00:01:42.990> just<00:01:43.170> because<00:01:43.729> my

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
and I think it was just because my

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.340 
and I think it was just because my
nephew<00:01:45.030> said<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.600> didn't<00:01:45.840> leave<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.079> on<00:01:46.140> there

nephew said you didn't leave it on there

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.550 
nephew said you didn't leave it on there
long<00:01:46.530> enough<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.689> hold<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.079> go<00:01:49.110> slow

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
long enough you just hold it and go slow

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.200 
long enough you just hold it and go slow
but<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:49.979> didn't<00:01:50.340> want<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.670> hold<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.180> there

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
but I didn't want to hold it on there

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.330 
but I didn't want to hold it on there
and<00:01:51.540> go<00:01:51.720> slow<00:01:51.990> because<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.680> fact<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.070> I

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
and go slow because of the fact that I

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.219 
and go slow because of the fact that I
was<00:01:53.579> trying<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.909> protect<00:01:54.210> my<00:01:54.360> ends<00:01:54.689> from<00:01:54.899> being

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
was trying to protect my ends from being

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.569 
was trying to protect my ends from being
brittle<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:56.329> because<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.479> know<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.840> fragile

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
brittle and because you know the fragile

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.800 
brittle and because you know the fragile
so<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.610> didn't<00:01:59.909> want<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.149> leave<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.420> on<00:02:00.540> there

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
so I didn't want to leave it on there

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.649 
so I didn't want to leave it on there
and<00:02:01.020> buy<00:02:01.530> me<00:02:01.710> not<00:02:01.890> leaving<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.280> on<00:02:02.369> there<00:02:02.700> they

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
and buy me not leaving it on there they

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.149 
and buy me not leaving it on there they
kind<00:02:03.930> of<00:02:03.990> crawl<00:02:04.200> back<00:02:04.380> up<00:02:04.560> by<00:02:04.710> time<00:02:04.920> i<00:02:04.950> was

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
kind of crawl back up by time i was

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.810 
kind of crawl back up by time i was
making<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.610> video<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:06.329> little<00:02:07.110> bit<00:02:07.290> in

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
making the video a little bit in

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.300 
making the video a little bit in
we<00:02:09.820> did<00:02:09.970> doing<00:02:10.270> doing<00:02:11.020> that<00:02:11.260> I<00:02:11.500> tried<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.070> go

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
we did doing doing that I tried to go

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.370 
we did doing doing that I tried to go
pick<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:12.760> out<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.240> comb<00:02:13.480> it<00:02:13.510> and<00:02:13.870> I<00:02:14.020> just<00:02:14.200> feel

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
pick it out and comb it and I just feel

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:21.510 
pick it out and comb it and I just feel
like<00:02:14.530> I<00:02:15.360> I'm<00:02:16.360> not<00:02:16.600> supposed<00:02:17.020> to<00:02:17.230> comb<00:02:17.560> my<00:02:20.520> even

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
like I I'm not supposed to comb my even

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.830 
like I I'm not supposed to comb my even
though<00:02:21.640> it<00:02:21.700> was<00:02:21.820> good<00:02:22.000> out<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.360> ends<00:02:22.720> were

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
though it was good out the ends were

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.330 
though it was good out the ends were
still<00:02:23.080> curled<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:23.560> I<00:02:23.650> don't<00:02:23.860> want<00:02:24.040> to<00:02:24.130> comb<00:02:24.310> it

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
still curled and I don't want to comb it

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.270 
still curled and I don't want to comb it
in<00:02:24.580> that<00:02:24.760> state<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:26.230> that'll<00:02:26.710> be<00:02:26.830> the<00:02:26.950> reason

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
in that state so that'll be the reason

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.400 
in that state so that'll be the reason
why<00:02:27.430> I'll<00:02:27.700> twist<00:02:28.000> it<00:02:28.270> up<00:02:28.390> one<00:02:28.660> at<00:02:28.780> a<00:02:28.900> time<00:02:29.140> and

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
why I'll twist it up one at a time and

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.960 
why I'll twist it up one at a time and
it'll<00:02:29.620> be<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:29.980> reason<00:02:30.280> why<00:02:30.400> I<00:02:30.430> probably<00:02:30.790> won't

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
it'll be the reason why I probably won't

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.290 
it'll be the reason why I probably won't
wear<00:02:31.210> a<00:02:31.240> blowout<00:02:31.660> i<00:02:32.640> get<00:02:33.640> if<00:02:33.790> i<00:02:33.910> get<00:02:34.090> more

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
wear a blowout i get if i get more

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.510 
wear a blowout i get if i get more
experience<00:02:34.660> than<00:02:35.050> more<00:02:35.200> comfortable<00:02:35.830> with

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
experience than more comfortable with

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.980 
experience than more comfortable with
the<00:02:36.670> heat<00:02:36.850> setting<00:02:37.210> and<00:02:37.360> i<00:02:37.390> think<00:02:37.630> my<00:02:37.750> hair<00:02:37.960> is

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
the heat setting and i think my hair is

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.560 
the heat setting and i think my hair is
fine<00:02:38.320> with<00:02:38.560> it<00:02:38.620> maybe<00:02:38.860> i<00:02:39.010> will<00:02:39.300> try<00:02:40.300> to<00:02:40.360> get

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
fine with it maybe i will try to get

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.150 
fine with it maybe i will try to get
them<00:02:40.660> more<00:02:40.810> straighter<00:02:41.140> so<00:02:41.380> i<00:02:41.470> am<00:02:41.620> able<00:02:41.890> to

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
them more straighter so i am able to

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.250 
them more straighter so i am able to
wear<00:02:42.310> a<00:02:42.340> blowout<00:02:42.610> but<00:02:43.060> for<00:02:43.330> right<00:02:43.510> now<00:02:43.540> let<00:02:44.200> me

just start now and just learning i feel
more<00:02:46.150> comfortable<00:02:46.450> and<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:48.010> makes<00:02:48.190> more<00:02:48.340> sense

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
more comfortable and it makes more sense

butter<00:02:57.460> on<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:57.820> end<00:02:58.000> because<00:02:58.210> it<00:02:58.330> helps<00:02:58.540> to

section<00:04:08.239> you<00:04:09.170> know<00:04:09.260> I<00:04:09.319> saturated<00:04:09.980> it<00:04:10.040> with

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
section you know I saturated it with

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.610 
section you know I saturated it with
grape<00:04:10.400> seed<00:04:10.640> oil<00:04:10.790> and<00:04:11.269> then<00:04:12.049> I<00:04:12.080> went<00:04:12.379> through

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
grape seed oil and then I went through

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.440 
grape seed oil and then I went through
it<00:04:12.680> about<00:04:12.950> three<00:04:13.250> times<00:04:13.280> with<00:04:13.670> the<00:04:13.790> comb<00:04:14.030> and

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
it about three times with the comb and

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.259 
it about three times with the comb and
then<00:04:15.140> after<00:04:15.560> that<00:04:15.590> I<00:04:16.100> grab<00:04:16.459> some<00:04:16.489> shea<00:04:17.000> butter

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
then after that I grab some shea butter

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.289 
then after that I grab some shea butter
and<00:04:17.449> add<00:04:17.660> it<00:04:17.840> on<00:04:17.989> the<00:04:18.169> ends<00:04:18.850> you<00:04:19.850> could<00:04:20.000> go<00:04:20.150> back

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
and add it on the ends you could go back

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:21.879 
and add it on the ends you could go back
over<00:04:20.600> the<00:04:20.690> ends<00:04:21.019> again<00:04:21.290> because<00:04:21.470> I<00:04:21.560> wanted<00:04:21.769> to

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:21.889 
over the ends again because I wanted to

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:24.159 
over the ends again because I wanted to
have<00:04:22.070> an<00:04:22.220> extra<00:04:22.430> coated<00:04:22.940> I<00:04:23.210> wonder<00:04:23.960> if<00:04:24.050> I

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
have an extra coated I wonder if I

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:25.650 
have an extra coated I wonder if I
should<00:04:24.229> separate<00:04:24.860> them<00:04:25.040> or<00:04:25.130> take<00:04:25.340> them<00:04:25.370> apart

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
should separate them or take them apart

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.900 
should separate them or take them apart
pick<00:04:26.660> them<00:04:26.780> apart<00:04:26.840> I<00:04:27.470> think<00:04:28.040> I<00:04:28.160> will<00:04:28.340> let's<00:04:28.639> try

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
pick them apart I think I will let's try

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.820 
pick them apart I think I will let's try
some<00:04:29.240> I'll<00:04:29.630> just<00:04:29.840> pull<00:04:30.050> it<00:04:30.139> apart<00:04:30.260> from<00:04:30.530> the

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
some I'll just pull it apart from the

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.730 
some I'll just pull it apart from the
root<00:04:31.040> and<00:04:31.070> then<00:04:31.690> it<00:04:32.690> comes<00:04:32.930> apart<00:04:33.139> easy<00:04:33.560> i'll

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
root and then it comes apart easy i'll

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.350 
root and then it comes apart easy i'll
let<00:04:33.919> it<00:04:34.010> come<00:04:34.190> apart<00:04:34.280> and<00:04:34.550> if<00:04:34.639> it<00:04:34.790> doesn't<00:04:35.180> I'm

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
let it come apart and if it doesn't I'm

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.790 
let it come apart and if it doesn't I'm
going<00:04:35.600> to<00:04:35.660> keep<00:04:35.750> it<00:04:35.930> together<00:04:36.110> and<00:04:36.650> they're

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
going to keep it together and they're

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.159 
going to keep it together and they're
really<00:04:37.070> not<00:04:37.250> when<00:04:37.490> they<00:04:37.610> come<00:04:37.790> apart<00:04:38.150> it<00:04:38.930> feels

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
really not when they come apart it feels

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:51.439 
really not when they come apart it feels
pretty<00:04:39.290> good<00:04:39.560> doesn't<00:04:40.160> feel<00:04:40.520> dry
