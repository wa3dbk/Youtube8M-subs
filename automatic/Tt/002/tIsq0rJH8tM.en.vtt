 vehicle driver a loaded truck 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.320

 firefighters of asturias according to 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.289
 Data health care service 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.240
 The injured person was urgently transferred to 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.160
 jarrio hospital at the expense of more 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.980
 tests and even new medical assessment 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.260
 with a serious prognosis in the accident 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.150
 a woman was also slightly injured 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.160
 resident in the house that was 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.320
 transferred by her family also to 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.120
 hospital from jarrio to the place 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.489
 displaced firefighters from 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.660
 asturias local police civil police and 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.660
 naval civil protection 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.700
 here I have a daughter who knows and is the 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.309
 second time a truck pulls part of 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.079
 the house what happened this morning 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.520
 Well, this morning is a truck that 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.890
 It came loaded with wood and I do not know what 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.230
 He happened without him speeding 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.399
 maybe it was that he took the corner of the 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.170
 house ahead and thank goodness that is of 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.270
 stone if out of brick would come out 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.680
 The other side of the truck, the truth is that 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.210
 look like your console was 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.890
 cooking when the action occurred cree 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.290
 is mind making concrete 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.810
 and I was in a corner and falling into the 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.110
 kitchen cupboard made as a ceiling and there 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.120
 it was her salvation but if there is a 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.690
 meter over to the other side 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.890
 do not tell her if she taught us 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.860
 a small wound on the head a 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.110
 small bruise but little by little 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.580
 luckily I guess with the scare in 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.960
 the body says it's not the first time 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.940
 that this accident happens that kind of 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.800
 accident here already on another occasion took 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.770
 part of the store also another truck 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.780
 that overturned would be the one loaded with doors and 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.120
 windows like that but this time it was more 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.850
 fat because this is foot of thread 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.040
 another side was already brick this time it was 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.330
 very fat very fat 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.400
 the accident they told us towards the 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.130
 noon by 12 o'clock or so or more 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.290
 less about 12 12 years and good and now 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.600
 What are the steps to take for the 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.790
 experience that you have now the 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.290
 sure if we go the bad thing is that it remains 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.540
 all this open because now the house 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.950
 you have to take out everything you have 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.470
 value and someone will have to be 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.440
 watching here because if not today what 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.750
 that is falling they will carry until we go 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.190
 even the kitchen scourer I do not know 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.990
 What's left for them to do for a while? Yes, yes. 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.340
 of course they have here some 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.170
 nearby housing where you can 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.770
 stay meanwhile good if there 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.020
 family members that we will have yes yes yes yes 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.470
 thank you very much 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:29.450
 I felt the noise and was giving a curve 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:32.640
 was there and when I saw immediately 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.500
 the second two three seconds one thing 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.230
 well and yes he has actively collaborated 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.330
 in taking out the lady who was 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.350
 inside the house there was a lady in the 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:46.410
 kitchen we called her through the door we saw 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.860
 that was acceptably well had its 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.480
 fruit and then breaking the door the 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.730
 we took out where they could not get out 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.290
 because seeing is the wall the 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.650
 we take out the kitchen door 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.750
 breaking the kitchen door 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.120
 we broke are some glasses that has the 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.480
 door of the kitchen and we took it out by the 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.750
 kitchen door well came out she almost 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.110
 by his foot that there was no need to do any 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.050
 effort of any kind 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.430
 it was she who did all the work 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.110
 good and from the point of view 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.940
 eduardo professional what is it that we 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.500
 we found here good so here we 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.110
 we find with the action of a change 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.790
 embedded in a house now good then 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.070
 let's try to shore up what is 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.010
 can housing the first floor to 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:33.110
 good when we remove the good vehicle 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.780
 so try that there are no risks of 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.300
 collapse of the house not all we put 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.430
 control also the fuel leak 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.190
 the truck and the driver's extraction 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.680
 of the vehicle for how long you have 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.050
 of work how much it calculates and we are 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.360
 waiting for the crane to reach a crane 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.300
 heavy to remove the truck and 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.390
 Well then, nothing will be waiting for 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.820
 remove it and good to try to leave the area 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.680
 as safely as possible to the owner 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.660
 of the house we know that he rescued her 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.790
 let's say a citizen the driver of 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.140
 truck and the driver change good what 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.080
 was taken by firefighters from the park 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.420
 luarca good was transferred to the hospital 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.070
 they left ambulance and the grouping of 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.250
 Naval civil protection is the second 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:18.290
 of sluis that they have to intervene in this 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.660
 building at least for those causes 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.260
 if it's the second time the other one was 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.600
 years ago out let's say something less than 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:29.240
 striking that this and apart from that 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.040
 also in several traffic accidents 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.800
 by god here also in front of house to 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.660
 oscar if they have an idea because there may be 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.500
 Today's accident was good when 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:42.650
 we take the driver out because when we 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.360
 I was wondering what happened 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.280
 of respect nothing so much can I say if 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.520
 any possibility can be lowered 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.340
 since he has taken dizziness until 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.410
 I do not know the circumstances I guess 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.460
 they will lengthen a little later yes that has 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.110
 been watching the building with the 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.010
 municipal architect is very damaged the 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:02.900
 structure of the house well yes 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:06.420
 It is effectively one of the things that 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.100
 we did once the driver was rescued 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.410
 and observed the whole theme of the house 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.180
 we always see ourselves act that way and 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.950
 first call the technical office for 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.320
 that the architect approaches in the 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.360
 again we had done it like this and 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.480
 good to give us your technical opinion 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:23.700
 and its assessment the structure well is 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.940
 pretty damaged as you can see and 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:29.550
 over the problem that part of the 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.160
 facade is still fastened so 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:34.650
 is the truck cab that when 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:36.120
 retire is expected to be good that I can 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.700
 have some more detachment 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.100
 let's hope that the second floor will 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.780
 keep like this is very difficult to prop up 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:47.340
 they are propping up there are some parts 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:49.830
 but that has not only painted what 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.200
 is the part of the kitchen is very very 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:55.170
 complicated then good you can not 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:56.700
 do not risk too much staff and 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:59.190
 you have to wait for effectively to 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.260
 come the insurance move and come one 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:04.020
 heavy crane for once removed all 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:06.000
 the load of the power truck by say 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.280
 pull for him to back and see 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.900
 what what happens in any case 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.020
 looking for the good side of the matter has not 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:15.919
 been serious injury 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:20.000
 well that's important if the driver 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:21.990
 in principle good because it was 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.680
 polytrauma I was wearing but I was going 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:27.780
 conscious and spoke normally the 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.759
 lady at the same time of the house that 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.039
 I also found in the kitchen doing 

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:35.490
 his tasks, he was very lucky 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:36.810
 thank god and got to stay in gui 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.919
 qing 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.919
 and nothing happened to him
