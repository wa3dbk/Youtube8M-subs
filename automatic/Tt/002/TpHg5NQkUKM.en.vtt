00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.510 
we're fighting near the back of the
field<00:01:49.350> which<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.649> not<00:01:49.799> what<00:01:49.920> we<00:01:50.009> wanted<00:01:50.340> all

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
field which is not what we wanted all

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.069

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.030 
Otzi's crashed into us this time
obviously<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.720> bit<00:01:54.930> rusty<00:01:55.380> after<00:01:55.500> not<00:01:55.799> playing

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.350 
obviously a bit rusty after not playing
this<00:01:56.100> game<00:01:56.310> for<00:01:56.369> about<00:01:56.610> three<00:01:57.119> months

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
this game for about three months

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.480 
this game for about three months
actually<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:58.380> last<00:01:58.619> time<00:01:58.829> I<00:01:58.920> recorded<00:01:59.369> I

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
actually the last time I recorded I

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.880 
actually the last time I recorded I
recorded<00:01:59.880> like<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.119> think<00:02:00.500> eight<00:02:01.500> or<00:02:01.530> so

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
recorded like I think eight or so

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.310 
recorded like I think eight or so
episodes<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.490> row<00:02:02.520> just<00:02:02.939> at<00:02:03.090> one<00:02:03.240> time<00:02:03.570> so

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
episodes in a row just at one time so

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.219 
episodes in a row just at one time so
that<00:02:04.500> meant<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:05.009> know

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
that meant that you know

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.109 
that meant that you know

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
then obviously the one month when I

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.559 
then obviously the one month when I
wasn't<00:02:08.979> recording<00:02:09.489> so<00:02:09.670> about<00:02:09.879> you<00:02:10.000> know<00:02:10.179> three

second pitched thought when it could

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.880 
second pitched thought when it could
have<00:02:44.260> easily<00:02:44.470> been<00:02:44.739> an<00:02:45.160> 8<00:02:45.519> point<00:02:45.940> something<00:02:46.239> so

have easily been an 8 point something so

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.890 
have easily been an 8 point something so
no<00:02:47.890> good<00:02:48.069> so<00:02:48.340> but<00:02:49.269> the<00:02:49.390> grand<00:02:49.630> scheme<00:02:49.870> of

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
no good so but the grand scheme of

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.479 
no good so but the grand scheme of
things<00:02:50.079> were<00:02:50.410> fighting<00:02:50.799> in<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:50.980> back<00:02:51.160> anyway

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
things were fighting in the back anyway

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.759 
things were fighting in the back anyway
were<00:02:51.760> only<00:02:51.940> ahead<00:02:52.180> of<00:02:52.390> one<00:02:52.599> car<00:02:52.900> which<00:02:53.140> went<00:02:53.680> up

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
were only ahead of one car which went up

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.620 
were only ahead of one car which went up
in<00:02:53.890> flames<00:02:54.190> not<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.549> true<00:02:54.760> that<00:02:55.060> was<00:02:55.299> but

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
in flames not to true that was but

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.360 
in flames not to true that was but
that's<00:02:56.170> obviously<00:02:56.560> not<00:02:56.739> too<00:02:56.890> good<00:02:57.130> but<00:02:57.220> we're

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
that's obviously not too good but we're

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.160 
that's obviously not too good but we're
heading<00:02:57.640> out<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.760> turn<00:02:58.000> one<00:02:58.269> here<00:02:58.510> being<00:02:58.989> late

oh it's just about getting through there
and<00:03:03.910> I<00:03:04.000> started<00:03:04.360> to<00:03:04.450> pause<00:03:04.660> it<00:03:04.870> I'm<00:03:04.959> not<00:03:05.079> too

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
and I started to pause it I'm not too

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.539 
and I started to pause it I'm not too
sure<00:03:05.349> I<00:03:05.380> think<00:03:05.530> I<00:03:05.709> was<00:03:05.890> checking<00:03:06.069> something<00:03:06.430> on

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
sure I think I was checking something on

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.789 
sure I think I was checking something on
my<00:03:06.700> computer<00:03:06.730> very<00:03:07.510> quickly<00:03:07.780> there<00:03:08.140> as<00:03:08.500> I<00:03:08.680> was

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
my computer very quickly there as I was

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:11.250 
my computer very quickly there as I was
only<00:03:08.920> pause<00:03:09.160> for<00:03:09.430> about<00:03:09.819> a<00:03:09.850> second<00:03:10.389> but<00:03:10.630> yeah

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
only pause for about a second but yeah

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.629 
only pause for about a second but yeah
quickly<00:03:11.590> paused<00:03:11.799> it<00:03:11.950> there<00:03:12.100> for<00:03:12.280> no<00:03:12.400> obvious

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:12.639 
quickly paused it there for no obvious

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.720 
quickly paused it there for no obvious
reason<00:03:13.359> but<00:03:13.989> now<00:03:14.190> building<00:03:15.190> up<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.489> speed

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
reason but now building up the speed

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.750 
reason but now building up the speed
once<00:03:16.000> again<00:03:16.359> can<00:03:16.810> we<00:03:16.989> even<00:03:17.319> just<00:03:18.160> not<00:03:18.459> finish

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
once again can we even just not finish

once again can we even just not finish
last<00:03:19.000> that's<00:03:19.120> the<00:03:19.389> aim<00:03:19.510> really<00:03:19.750> here<00:03:20.079> today<00:03:20.350> is

last that's the aim really here today is

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.170 
last that's the aim really here today is
just<00:03:20.650> not<00:03:20.709> to<00:03:20.950> be<00:03:21.069> embarrassed<00:03:21.190> now<00:03:21.760> you're

stuck on the grass it no no no it's not

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.550 
stuck on the grass it no no no it's not
good<00:03:25.090> that's<00:03:25.299> really<00:03:25.569> not<00:03:25.810> good<00:03:26.049> on<00:03:26.380> the

championship edition but sometimes when
you<00:03:39.760> get<00:03:40.060> onto<00:03:40.209> the<00:03:40.420> grass<00:03:40.690> and<00:03:41.109> you're<00:03:41.440> on<00:03:41.650> a

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
you get onto the grass and you're on a

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.259 
you get onto the grass and you're on a
curb<00:03:42.040> whatever<00:03:42.459> it's<00:03:42.670> sort<00:03:42.790> of<00:03:42.819> hard<00:03:42.970> to<00:03:43.120> get

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
circuit you'll see in a second there

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:59.309 
circuit you'll see in a second there
that's<00:03:57.849> that<00:03:58.060> bridge<00:03:58.329> thought<00:03:58.840> people<00:03:59.019> wonder

made a mistake why are we doing this is

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.400 
made a mistake why are we doing this is
absolutely<00:04:05.849> terribly

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
absolutely terribly

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.440 
absolutely terribly
right<00:04:08.310> but<00:04:08.580> wouldn't<00:04:08.760> be<00:04:08.910> surprised<00:04:09.270> that

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
right but wouldn't be surprised that

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.240 
right but wouldn't be surprised that
redbull<00:04:09.870> actually<00:04:10.410> sacked<00:04:10.680> me<00:04:10.860> after<00:04:11.130> this

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
redbull actually sacked me after this

race<00:04:11.460> has<00:04:11.640> been<00:04:11.670> a<00:04:11.790> bad<00:04:12.030> bad<00:04:12.300> race<00:04:12.630> but<00:04:12.930> I

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:12.960 
race has been a bad bad race but I

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.840 
race has been a bad bad race but I
suppose<00:04:13.200> you<00:04:13.380> can't<00:04:13.620> win<00:04:13.800> them<00:04:13.950> all<00:04:14.100> well<00:04:14.670> we

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
suppose you can't win them all well we

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.340 
suppose you can't win them all well we
haven't<00:04:14.970> won<00:04:15.120> any<00:04:15.270> but<00:04:15.570> you<00:04:15.660> know<00:04:15.750> can't<00:04:16.170> do

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
haven't won any but you know can't do

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.540 
haven't won any but you know can't do
have<00:04:16.470> a<00:04:16.530> good<00:04:16.680> result<00:04:16.890> in<00:04:17.070> all<00:04:17.160> of<00:04:17.280> them<00:04:17.400> a

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:17.550 
have a good result in all of them a

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.699 
have a good result in all of them a
seven<00:04:18.120> second<00:04:18.540> penalty<00:04:18.720> for<00:04:19.080> that<00:04:19.230> like<00:04:19.440> what

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
seven second penalty for that like what

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.730 
seven second penalty for that like what
surely<00:04:20.670> I<00:04:20.700> had<00:04:21.060> enough<00:04:21.300> pain<00:04:21.600> from<00:04:22.080> going

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
surely I had enough pain from going

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.110 
surely I had enough pain from going
through<00:04:22.800> the<00:04:23.010> gravel<00:04:23.430> twice<00:04:23.670> this<00:04:23.910> lap

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
through the gravel twice this lap

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.230 
through the gravel twice this lap
already<00:04:24.710> to<00:04:25.710> have<00:04:25.920> what<00:04:26.130> 13<00:04:26.580> seconds<00:04:27.120> worth

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
already to have what 13 seconds worth

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.350 
already to have what 13 seconds worth
the<00:04:27.390> penalties<00:04:28.070> but<00:04:29.070> oh<00:04:29.250> well<00:04:29.550> I<00:04:29.610> suppose<00:04:29.940> it's

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
the penalties but oh well I suppose it's

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.750 
the penalties but oh well I suppose it's
the<00:04:30.540> game<00:04:30.780> and<00:04:31.170> that's<00:04:31.500> how<00:04:31.980> it's<00:04:32.190> programmed

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
the game and that's how it's programmed

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.460 
the game and that's how it's programmed
and<00:04:33.150> all<00:04:33.210> that<00:04:33.330> sort<00:04:33.510> of<00:04:33.540> stuff<00:04:33.600> and<00:04:34.050> we<00:04:34.230> can't

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
and all that sort of stuff and we can't

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.050 
and all that sort of stuff and we can't
really<00:04:34.650> change<00:04:34.860> as<00:04:35.130> it's<00:04:35.310> nearly<00:04:35.460> attentional

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
really change as it's nearly attentional

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.890 
really change as it's nearly attentional
game<00:04:36.330> now<00:04:36.630> so<00:04:36.930> yeah<00:04:37.530> not<00:04:37.890> really

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
game now so yeah not really

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.810 
game now so yeah not really
yeah<00:04:39.900> anyway<00:04:40.500> definitely<00:04:41.430> not<00:04:41.490> setting<00:04:41.760> the

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
yeah anyway definitely not setting the

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.370 
yeah anyway definitely not setting the
world<00:04:41.910> light<00:04:42.120> as<00:04:42.270> the<00:04:42.420> engineer<00:04:42.750> says<00:04:42.990> and

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
going across the start/finish line here

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.150 
going across the start/finish line here
you<00:04:45.480> can<00:04:45.630> see<00:04:45.780> on<00:04:45.870> the<00:04:45.960> mini-map<00:04:46.230> the<00:04:46.740> cars<00:04:46.980> in

you can see on the mini-map the cars in

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.040 
you can see on the mini-map the cars in
front<00:04:47.220> of<00:04:47.430> us<00:04:47.610> which<00:04:47.850> have<00:04:48.030> stops<00:04:48.360> that<00:04:48.690> yellow
