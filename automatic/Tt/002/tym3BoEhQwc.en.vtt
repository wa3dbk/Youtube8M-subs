that comes with it now this only works
for<00:02:03.820> android<00:02:04.329> so<00:02:04.570> I'm<00:02:04.659> expect<00:02:05.020> to<00:02:05.109> be<00:02:05.200> able<00:02:05.259> to

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
for android so I'm expect to be able to

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.440 
for android so I'm expect to be able to
use<00:02:05.499> it<00:02:05.619> with<00:02:05.710> apple<00:02:06.100> but<00:02:06.670> it's<00:02:06.820> a<00:02:06.909> number<00:02:07.270> pad

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
use it with apple but it's a number pad

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.540 
use it with apple but it's a number pad
but<00:02:07.719> it's<00:02:07.840> also<00:02:08.050> a<00:02:08.259> touch<00:02:08.560> pad<00:02:08.830> so<00:02:09.519> it

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
but it's also a touch pad so it

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.550 
but it's also a touch pad so it
functions<00:02:09.879> the<00:02:10.300> same<00:02:10.479> as<00:02:10.690> any<00:02:10.869> touchpad<00:02:11.319> would

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
functions the same as any touchpad would

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.510 
functions the same as any touchpad would
on<00:02:11.709> a<00:02:11.739> laptop<00:02:12.040> which<00:02:12.430> is<00:02:12.580> really<00:02:12.819> nice

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
on a laptop which is really nice

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.700 
on a laptop which is really nice

something<00:04:30.979> i<00:04:31.039> think<00:04:31.250> is<00:04:31.340> really<00:04:31.520> important

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
something i think is really important

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.760 
something i think is really important
because<00:04:32.060> it<00:04:32.360> can<00:04:32.569> be<00:04:32.599> annoying<00:04:32.960> to<00:04:33.740> be

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
because it can be annoying to be

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.050 
because it can be annoying to be
charging<00:04:34.280> that<00:04:34.400> every<00:04:34.639> night<00:04:34.819> and<00:04:34.969> that's

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
charging that every night and that's

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.149 
charging that every night and that's
just<00:04:35.240> not<00:04:35.419> acceptable<00:04:35.740> for<00:04:36.740> me<00:04:36.889> when<00:04:37.069> I'm

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:37.159 
just not acceptable for me when I'm

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:38.649 
just not acceptable for me when I'm
buying<00:04:37.340> an<00:04:37.460> accessory<00:04:37.969> so<00:04:38.150> I'm<00:04:38.270> really<00:04:38.419> happy

one<00:04:45.949> of<00:04:46.069> the<00:04:46.129> keys<00:04:46.340> actually<00:04:46.759> did<00:04:46.909> pop<00:04:47.120> off<00:04:47.360> I

00:04:47.619 --> 00:04:47.629 
one of the keys actually did pop off I

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:50.350 
one of the keys actually did pop off I
wish<00:04:48.349> that<00:04:48.650> this<00:04:48.800> keyboard<00:04:49.610> did<00:04:49.909> come<00:04:50.150> with<00:04:50.330> a

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
wish that this keyboard did come with a

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.629 
wish that this keyboard did come with a
case<00:04:50.800> because<00:04:51.800> I've<00:04:51.919> just<00:04:51.949> been<00:04:52.219> throwing<00:04:52.550> my

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
case because I've just been throwing my

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:54.490 
case because I've just been throwing my
backpack<00:04:53.240> so<00:04:53.509> I<00:04:53.539> really<00:04:53.960> can<00:04:54.110> only<00:04:54.199> blame

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
backpack so I really can only blame

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.529 
backpack so I really can only blame
myself<00:04:54.560> that<00:04:55.280> this<00:04:55.400> home<00:04:55.639> he<00:04:55.909> came<00:04:56.120> off<00:04:56.300> it

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:56.539 
myself that this home he came off it

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:58.869 
myself that this home he came off it
still<00:04:56.840> works<00:04:57.349> fine<00:04:57.590> I<00:04:57.889> can<00:04:58.129> tap<00:04:58.310> on<00:04:58.460> it<00:04:58.520> takes

00:04:58.869 --> 00:04:58.879 
still works fine I can tap on it takes

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:00.850 
still works fine I can tap on it takes
me<00:04:59.030> home<00:04:59.180> but<00:04:59.810> it<00:04:59.900> is<00:05:00.020> missing<00:05:00.289> that<00:05:00.439> button

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
me home but it is missing that button

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.679 
me home but it is missing that button
that<00:05:00.949> has<00:05:00.979> the<00:05:01.189> HOME<00:05:01.340> key<00:05:01.370> I<00:05:01.759> haven't<00:05:02.509> had<00:05:02.659> that

00:05:02.679 --> 00:05:02.689 
that has the HOME key I haven't had that

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:04.600 
that has the HOME key I haven't had that
issue<00:05:02.990> with<00:05:03.289> any<00:05:03.560> of<00:05:03.710> the<00:05:03.800> other<00:05:03.919> keys<00:05:04.189> on<00:05:04.370> here

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
issue with any of the other keys on here

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.510 
issue with any of the other keys on here
so<00:05:05.509> it<00:05:05.689> does<00:05:05.960> seem<00:05:06.289> to<00:05:06.319> be<00:05:06.529> a<00:05:06.680> unique<00:05:07.279> case

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
so it does seem to be a unique case

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.670 
so it does seem to be a unique case
other<00:05:08.240> than<00:05:08.419> that<00:05:08.659> I<00:05:08.689> highly<00:05:09.199> recommend<00:05:09.319> this

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
other than that I highly recommend this

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.559 
other than that I highly recommend this
keyboard<00:05:10.099> i<00:05:10.310> think<00:05:10.639> on<00:05:10.789> amazon<00:05:11.330> right<00:05:11.509> now

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:11.569
