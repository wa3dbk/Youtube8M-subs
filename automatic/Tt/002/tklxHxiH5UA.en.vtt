00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.320
 the 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.809
 guys from fermacell will be on 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.520
 all seams with a special 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.070
 cartouches glue connected 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.660
 The glue is applied before the assembly 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:25.000
 edges on a single edge 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:26.739
 then the plates can be applied 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.750
 directly on the metal struts of the 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:31.239
 pre-wall installation be bolted 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.220
 best for this work the to 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.720
 system belonging to fast build screws 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.750
 with drill head use 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.880
 one uses screws without having to head 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.789
 with a 3 millimeter metal bora in front 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.039
 to be drilled there the metal stand 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:53.469
 is quite massive takes the before and 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:54.909
 screwing process relatively long for the 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:56.739
 cladding the rear space 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.230
 disguise I have an evening 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.760
 However, the plates need to be 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.609
 be tailored beforehand 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.920
 best so that the bumps as possible 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:08.280
 to be centered on the medium-sized companies 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.750
 come 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.180
 After that, the excess glue is added 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.450
 a spatula repelled at the joints 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.370
 all joints are completely filled right 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.330
 still the failed glue to the 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.330
 to see joints 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.520
 breakthroughs we have here in the toilet 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.490
 element cut out accordingly 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.220
 Become a hole saw and possibly 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.840
 A jigsaw use all insert 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.760
 tools are after this work 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.590
 but dull and need as 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.260
 wear part are considered 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.420
 this also applies to the big cuts 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.340
 the circular saw 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.110
 the total effort for this work 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.110
 was around three days
