for the last two and a half years to saw

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.759 
for the last two and a half years to saw
that<00:01:00.910> you<00:01:01.600> know<00:01:01.660> what<00:01:02.109> we're<00:01:02.320> about<00:01:02.440> and

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
that you know what we're about and

that you know what we're about and
thankfully<00:01:03.640> hopefully<00:01:04.390> we've<00:01:04.780> regained<00:01:05.199> it's

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010

been<00:01:06.190> difficult<00:01:06.450> with<00:01:07.450> injuries<00:01:07.900> I<00:01:08.050> keep

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.230 
been difficult with injuries I keep

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.890 
been difficult with injuries I keep
saying<00:01:08.440> that<00:01:08.620> and<00:01:08.770> also<00:01:09.370> with<00:01:10.210> late<00:01:10.420> goals<00:01:10.659> I

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
saying that and also with late goals I

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.710 
saying that and also with late goals I
think<00:01:11.350> that's<00:01:11.530> six<00:01:11.800> times<00:01:12.100> which<00:01:13.000> you<00:01:13.420> know<00:01:13.540> if

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
think that's six times which you know if

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.350 
think that's six times which you know if
you<00:01:14.050> had<00:01:14.170> a<00:01:14.200> held<00:01:14.440> on<00:01:14.650> I<00:01:15.030> don't<00:01:16.030> think<00:01:16.090> would've

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
you had a held on I don't think would've

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.760 
you had a held on I don't think would've
been<00:01:16.450> anywhere<00:01:16.780> near<00:01:16.840> bottom<00:01:17.200> trouble<00:01:17.620> but
