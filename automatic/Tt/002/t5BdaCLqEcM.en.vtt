some<00:00:08.210> really<00:00:08.480> interesting<00:00:08.660> modeling

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:09.260 
some really interesting modeling

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.709 
some really interesting modeling
subjects<00:00:09.679> here<00:00:09.889> of<00:00:10.099> course<00:00:10.719> radio-controlled

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:11.719 
subjects here of course radio-controlled

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.320 
subjects here of course radio-controlled
tanks<00:00:12.290> and<00:00:12.950> a<00:00:13.040> few<00:00:13.280> here<00:00:13.580> and<00:00:13.730> out<00:00:14.000> through<00:00:14.299> the

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
tanks and a few here and out through the

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.030 
tanks and a few here and out through the
hobby<00:00:14.809> but<00:00:15.379> it<00:00:15.469> looks<00:00:15.620> like<00:00:15.710> they're<00:00:15.860> starting

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:16.040 
hobby but it looks like they're starting

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.150 
hobby but it looks like they're starting
to<00:00:16.190> come<00:00:16.400> back<00:00:16.580> into<00:00:17.260> popularity<00:00:18.260> again<00:00:18.350> some

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
to come back into popularity again some

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.680 
to come back into popularity again some
big<00:00:19.340> tanks<00:00:19.610> and<00:00:19.850> some<00:00:20.030> small<00:00:20.330> tanks<00:00:20.630> don't

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:20.690 
big tanks and some small tanks don't

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.200 
big tanks and some small tanks don't
walk<00:00:21.050> us<00:00:21.230> through<00:00:21.260> these<00:00:21.620> so<00:00:22.220> down<00:00:22.850> here<00:00:23.060> we've

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
walk us through these so down here we've

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.750 
walk us through these so down here we've
got<00:00:23.330> our<00:00:23.390> 170<00:00:23.990> second<00:00:24.380> scale<00:00:24.560> battle<00:00:25.430> tanks

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
got our 170 second scale battle tanks

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.160 
got our 170 second scale battle tanks
what's<00:00:26.300> cool<00:00:26.450> about<00:00:26.480> these<00:00:26.720> is<00:00:26.930> they<00:00:27.020> actually

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
what's cool about these is they actually

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.780 
what's cool about these is they actually
have<00:00:27.350> a<00:00:27.500> full<00:00:27.740> battle<00:00:28.040> system<00:00:28.370> in<00:00:28.460> them<00:00:28.580> even

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:28.790 
have a full battle system in them even

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.820 
have a full battle system in them even
though<00:00:28.880> they're<00:00:29.210> small<00:00:29.350> so<00:00:30.350> you<00:00:30.470> can<00:00:30.620> see

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
though they're small so you can see

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:31.930 
though they're small so you can see
they've<00:00:30.950> got<00:00:31.010> the<00:00:31.220> little<00:00:31.340> receiver<00:00:31.700> right

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
they've got the little receiver right

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.730 
they've got the little receiver right
here<00:00:32.149> and<00:00:32.270> they<00:00:32.360> fire<00:00:32.750> an<00:00:32.900> infrared<00:00:33.140> beam<00:00:33.470> and

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:33.740 
here and they fire an infrared beam and

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.130 
here and they fire an infrared beam and
it's<00:00:34.520> basically<00:00:34.820> like<00:00:35.030> laser<00:00:35.300> tag<00:00:35.450> with<00:00:35.630> tanks

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
it's basically like laser tag with tanks

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.020 
it's basically like laser tag with tanks
right<00:00:36.380> after<00:00:36.920> five<00:00:37.130> hits<00:00:37.400> you<00:00:37.580> disable<00:00:37.970> the

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
right after five hits you disable the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.180 
right after five hits you disable the
other<00:00:38.120> tank<00:00:38.420> and<00:00:38.960> so<00:00:39.290> to<00:00:39.350> get<00:00:39.830> it<00:00:39.950> back<00:00:40.040> going

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
other tank and so to get it back going

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.590 
other tank and so to get it back going
again<00:00:40.340> you<00:00:40.460> just<00:00:40.640> cycle<00:00:41.000> that<00:00:41.090> power<00:00:41.300> switch

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
again you just cycle that power switch

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.880 
again you just cycle that power switch
set<00:00:42.050> it<00:00:42.140> down<00:00:42.260> and<00:00:42.410> you're<00:00:42.500> ready<00:00:42.530> to<00:00:42.680> fight

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
set it down and you're ready to fight

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.310 
set it down and you're ready to fight
again<00:00:43.060> just<00:00:44.060> these<00:00:44.600> ones<00:00:44.870> are<00:00:44.990> great<00:00:45.170> because

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 
again just these ones are great because

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.810 
again just these ones are great because
I<00:00:45.620> mean<00:00:45.740> you<00:00:45.829> can<00:00:45.980> just<00:00:46.010> put<00:00:46.460> out<00:00:46.550> a<00:00:46.579> little

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
I mean you can just put out a little

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.310 
I mean you can just put out a little
diagram<00:00:46.970> around<00:00:47.420> on<00:00:47.480> your<00:00:47.600> kitchen<00:00:47.750> table<00:00:48.020> and

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
diagram around on your kitchen table and

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.080 
diagram around on your kitchen table and
turn<00:00:48.710> that<00:00:48.860> into<00:00:49.040> it<00:00:49.280> its<00:00:49.790> own<00:00:49.970> little

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
turn that into it its own little

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.600 
turn that into it its own little
battleground<00:00:50.630> and<00:00:51.020> 172nd<00:00:51.980> scale<00:00:52.220> of<00:00:52.430> course

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
battleground and 172nd scale of course

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.810 
battleground and 172nd scale of course
being<00:00:52.970> a<00:00:53.239> common<00:00:53.960> scale<00:00:54.230> in<00:00:54.680> plastic<00:00:55.310> modeling

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
being a common scale in plastic modeling

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.180 
being a common scale in plastic modeling
so<00:00:56.150> it<00:00:56.450> looks<00:00:56.630> like<00:00:56.780> you<00:00:57.050> got<00:00:57.170> a<00:00:57.230> sandbag

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
so it looks like you got a sandbag

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.069 
so it looks like you got a sandbag
bunkers<00:00:58.670> order<00:00:59.060> here<00:00:59.270> and<00:00:59.300> actually<00:00:59.899> some<00:01:00.050> of

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
bunkers order here and actually some of

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.770 
bunkers order here and actually some of
them<00:01:00.260> crashed<00:01:01.220> p-51<00:01:01.970> over<00:01:02.270> here<00:01:02.480> to<00:01:02.630> add<00:01:02.750> a

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
them crashed p-51 over here to add a

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.110 
them crashed p-51 over here to add a
little<00:01:03.020> realism<00:01:03.590> to<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:03.770> battlefield<00:01:04.370> you

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.120 
little realism to the battlefield you

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.830 
little realism to the battlefield you
can<00:01:05.300> get<00:01:05.390> these<00:01:06.100> sure<00:01:07.100> through<00:01:07.540> Great<00:01:08.540> Plains

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
can get these sure through Great Plains

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.320 
can get these sure through Great Plains
some<00:01:09.500> plastic<00:01:09.860> models<00:01:10.250> of<00:01:10.370> 172nd<00:01:11.150> scale

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
some plastic models of 172nd scale

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.030 
some plastic models of 172nd scale
detail<00:01:12.110> them<00:01:12.290> up<00:01:12.380> build<00:01:12.650> your<00:01:12.800> own<00:01:12.830> little
