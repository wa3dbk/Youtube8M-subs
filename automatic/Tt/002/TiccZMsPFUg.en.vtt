00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.599
 all right 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.190
 the windows have common elements 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.469
 with the aim that 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:18.170
 regardless of the application or 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:21.260
 program in which we are working is 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.900
 can get references of which 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.810
 program we are using which file 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.699
 we are working and in addition to options 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.699
 to manipulate the window 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.380
 let's see the case of this window 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.900
 this top bar is called the bar 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.480
 of title in this title bar we're going 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.309
 to always find the name of the 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.940
 document with which we are working 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.710
 or file and we also find the 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.830
 name of the application that we are 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.910
 also using the title bar 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:04.600
 we can find the minimize button 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.600
 maximize button and close button 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.110
 the windows of windows always have 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.680
 a superior menu 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.140
 this less allow us to enter the 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.230
 options that the program has or 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.900
 application that we have open if we give 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:25.260
 Click on some of your options 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.180
 will show us a submenu that we 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.600
 allows to work with actions 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.979
 specific this is an example of a 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:38.580
 vertical menu but also some 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.750
 windows offer horizontal menus like 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.750
 this is the case 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.320
 Now let's talk about the bars 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.479
 displacement when we work in 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.759
 any windows window many 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.009
 Sometimes we will observe these bars 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.799
 they are called the bars of 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.259
 displacement allow us to move 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.569
 about the document or work in which 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.539
 we are developing in order to 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:07.289
 can see all its content with this 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:09.539
 bar we could go up and down and with this 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.819
 which is on the lower edge we can 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.849
 move to the right and to the 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.849
 left 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.049
 let's see now the case of the edges of the 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.500
 window all the edges of the windows 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:27.470
 can be manipulated if we bring the 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:31.189
 cursor we can see that it becomes 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:35.269
 double arrow we press keep 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:36.880
 oppressed and we move that we 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.150
 will allow 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:42.900
 give the window the size that we 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.900
 interest 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.310
 likewise in the upper part 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.320
 at the bottom 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.390
 south left 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.920
 another of the elements or parts of the 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:10.969
 windows windows is the area of 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.459
 work in that area is where they take 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:16.969
 out all the activities that we are going to 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.639
 develop each work area is 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:22.180
 adjusts depending on the application that 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:22.180
 we are using
