the house expand this house will try to
go<00:01:22.119> left<00:01:22.720> and<00:01:23.050> right<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:25.030> we<00:01:25.240> have<00:01:25.479> cows<00:01:26.170> over

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
go left and right so we have cows over

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.120 
go left and right so we have cows over
lapping<00:01:27.580> this<00:01:28.240> overlap<00:01:28.810> here<00:01:29.080> this<00:01:29.590> overlap

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
lapping this overlap here this overlap

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.249 
lapping this overlap here this overlap
here<00:01:30.460> so<00:01:31.390> something<00:01:31.780> this<00:01:32.789> then<00:01:33.789> is<00:01:34.030> a<00:01:34.270> span<00:01:34.630> if

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
here so something this then is a span if

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.600 
here so something this then is a span if
you<00:01:35.470> here<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:37.420> house<00:01:37.690> will<00:01:38.320> go<00:01:38.590> a<00:01:38.860> little<00:01:39.310> bit

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
you here the house will go a little bit

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.880 
you here the house will go a little bit
up<00:01:40.830> so<00:01:41.830> when<00:01:42.250> this<00:01:42.430> house<00:01:43.240> expand<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:44.410> go<00:01:44.860> a

up so when this house expand and go a
little<00:01:45.100> bit<00:01:45.340> up<00:01:45.520> and<00:01:46.050> someone<00:01:47.399> accidentally

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
little bit up and someone accidentally

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.200 
little bit up and someone accidentally
set<00:01:48.789> on<00:01:48.970> the<00:01:49.660> kabbala<00:01:50.229> this<00:01:50.770> portion<00:01:51.340> will<00:01:52.150> be

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
set on the kabbala this portion will be

00:01:52.210 --> 00:02:04.010 
set on the kabbala this portion will be
break<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:54.070> core<00:01:54.900> institution

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.339 

I<00:02:05.020> will<00:02:05.590> share<00:02:06.369> view<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.909> correct<00:02:07.360> way<00:02:07.780> to

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349 
I will share view the correct way to

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.940 
I will share view the correct way to
install<00:02:08.739> a<00:02:08.800> house<00:02:09.220> with<00:02:09.759> a<00:02:09.880> stuffy<00:02:10.239> Junction

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
install a house with a stuffy Junction

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.160 
install a house with a stuffy Junction
the<00:02:11.950> sufficient<00:02:12.550> Qian<00:02:12.819> for<00:02:13.690> the<00:02:15.030> 2000<00:02:16.170> profile

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
the sufficient Qian for the 2000 profile

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.990 
the sufficient Qian for the 2000 profile
is<00:02:17.520> 0.7<00:02:18.520> to<00:02:18.819> one<00:02:19.180> point<00:02:19.420> two<00:02:19.980> millimeters

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
is 0.7 to one point two millimeters

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.570 
is 0.7 to one point two millimeters
so<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.870> correct<00:02:23.230> way<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.800> install<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.340> house

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
so the correct way to install the house

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.300 
so the correct way to install the house
is<00:02:25.570> a<00:02:25.630> little<00:02:26.230> bit<00:02:26.410> of<00:02:26.620> we<00:02:26.920> go

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
is a little bit of we go

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.120 
is a little bit of we go
when<00:02:27.580> using<00:02:27.850> stop<00:02:28.350> stop<00:02:29.350> we<00:02:30.250> go<00:02:31.740> so<00:02:32.740> if<00:02:32.950> we

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
when using stop stop we go so if we

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
when using stop stop we go so if we
install<00:02:33.370> this<00:02:33.760> way<00:02:34.260> this<00:02:35.260> way<00:02:35.550> will<00:02:36.550> be<00:02:36.730> very

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
install this way this way will be very

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.770 
install this way this way will be very
tight<00:02:37.780> so<00:02:38.410> install<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.250> little<00:02:39.700> bit<00:02:39.820> Vigo<00:02:40.210> and

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
tight so install a little bit Vigo and

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:56.940 
tight so install a little bit Vigo and
continue<00:02:43.740> we<00:02:44.740> go<00:02:46.230> same<00:02:51.300> stuff<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:55.900> have<00:02:56.170> to<00:02:56.200> we

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
continue we go same stuff you have to we

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.980 
continue we go same stuff you have to we
go<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.459> house<00:02:57.790> a<00:02:58.320> little<00:02:59.320> bit<00:03:00.630> so<00:03:01.630> that<00:03:01.660> you

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
go the house a little bit so that you

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.970 
go the house a little bit so that you
have<00:03:02.260> this<00:03:02.500> shunt<00:03:03.250> how<00:03:03.970> much<00:03:04.240> do<00:03:04.870> we<00:03:04.900> go<00:03:05.260> test

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
have this shunt how much do we go test

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.270 
have this shunt how much do we go test
it<00:03:06.100> out<00:03:06.160> with<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:07.090> feeler<00:03:07.720> gauge<00:03:08.040> so<00:03:09.040> that's

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
it out with the feeler gauge so that's

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.110 
it out with the feeler gauge so that's
why<00:03:09.570> laying<00:03:10.570> of<00:03:10.780> Taos<00:03:11.050> require<00:03:12.120> experience

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
why laying of Taos require experience

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:25.020 
why laying of Taos require experience
and<00:03:13.330> skill<00:03:21.390> how<00:03:22.390> to<00:03:23.020> walk<00:03:23.260> and<00:03:23.680> step<00:03:24.430> on<00:03:24.820> the

when<00:03:26.440> on<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.860> roof<00:03:27.310> we<00:03:27.670> always<00:03:27.940> step<00:03:28.660> on<00:03:29.070> the

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
when on the roof we always step on the
