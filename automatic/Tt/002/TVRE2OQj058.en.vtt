00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
stop that I made for making the cuts and

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.639 
stop that I made for making the cuts and
you<00:00:47.730> just<00:00:48.030> put<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.360> up<00:00:48.480> there<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.989> make<00:00:49.500> your

you just put it up there and make your

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.040 
you just put it up there and make your
cuts<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.030> micro<00:00:51.420> adjust<00:00:51.870> you

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
cuts and this is the micro adjust you

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.290 
cuts and this is the micro adjust you
can<00:00:52.199> move<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.949> in<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.309> out<00:00:53.399> it's<00:00:53.760> got<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:53.969> single

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
can move it in and out it's got a single

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.630 
can move it in and out it's got a single
pivot<00:00:54.780> point<00:00:55.020> here<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.980> can<00:00:56.070> go<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.520> out

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
pivot point here you can go in and out

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.200 
pivot point here you can go in and out
very<00:00:57.140> minutely<00:00:58.190> so<00:00:59.190> I'll<00:00:59.640> show<00:00:59.879> you<00:00:59.940> how<00:01:00.180> I

very minutely so I'll show you how I
made<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:01.309> pins<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.660> have<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.809> make<00:01:03.989> about<00:01:04.170> 40<00:01:04.830> of

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
made the pins I have to make about 40 of

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.880 
made the pins I have to make about 40 of
40<00:01:05.549> doors<00:01:05.850> so<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.720> came<00:01:06.780> up<00:01:07.020> with<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.350> simple

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
40 doors so I came up with this simple

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.789 
40 doors so I came up with this simple
little<00:01:08.220> jig<00:01:08.520> that's<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:09.540> scrap<00:01:10.080> piece<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.409> my

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
little jig that's a scrap piece of my

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.280 
little jig that's a scrap piece of my
door<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:12.150> made<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.290> jig<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.460> can<00:01:15.290> line

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
door and made this jig so I can line

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.499 
door and made this jig so I can line
these<00:01:16.530> up<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:17.549> then<00:01:18.470> set<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.619> jig<00:01:19.860> like<00:01:19.890> this

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
these up and then set the jig like this

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.600 
these up and then set the jig like this
pull<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.659> tight<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.229> then<00:01:22.770> all<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:22.979> do<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.340> mark

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
pull it tight and then all I do is mark

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.370 
pull it tight and then all I do is mark
mark<00:01:24.470> 1<00:01:25.470> 1<00:01:25.979> or<00:01:26.369> 2<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.880> whichever<00:01:27.810> corner<00:01:28.140> you're

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
mark 1 1 or 2 to whichever corner you're

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.149 
mark 1 1 or 2 to whichever corner you're
doing<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.329> then<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.540> can<00:01:30.890> cut<00:01:31.890> them<00:01:32.009> with<00:01:32.100> the

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
doing and then I can cut them with the

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.280 
doing and then I can cut them with the
Domino<00:01:33.590> this<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.920> jig<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.400> made<00:01:35.729> to

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
Domino this is the jig that I made to

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.510 
Domino this is the jig that I made to
cut<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.439> Domino's<00:01:38.390> if<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.570> have<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.950> MFT<00:01:40.950> you

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
cut the Domino's if you have a MFT you

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.670 
cut the Domino's if you have a MFT you
could<00:01:41.729> use<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.720> clamps<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.259> everything<00:01:43.560> but

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
could use the clamps and everything but

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.429 
could use the clamps and everything but
I<00:01:43.740> don't<00:01:43.860> have<00:01:44.130> one<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:44.509> what<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.540> did<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.140> put

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
I don't have one so what I did is I put

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.910 
I don't have one so what I did is I put
this<00:01:46.649> it's<00:01:47.369> about<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.850> same<00:01:48.030> size<00:01:48.710> width<00:01:49.710> as

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
this it's about the same size width as

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.510 
this it's about the same size width as
my<00:01:49.979> door<00:01:50.640> stop<00:01:50.939> stop<00:01:51.799> so<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.860> can<00:01:53.070> have<00:01:53.310> that

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
my door stop stop so I can have that

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.010 
my door stop stop so I can have that
down<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.270> tight<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:55.259> then<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.130> can<00:01:56.340> cut<00:01:56.610> all<00:01:56.939> my

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
down and tight and then I can cut all my

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.990 
down and tight and then I can cut all my
Domino's<00:01:59.329> and<00:02:01.070> in<00:02:02.070> my<00:02:02.250> vacuum<00:02:02.460> there's<00:02:02.939> no

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
Domino's and in my vacuum there's no

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.800 
Domino's and in my vacuum there's no
dust

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
dust

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:13.229 
dust
I<00:02:04.939> can<00:02:05.939> put<00:02:06.149> my<00:02:06.180> Domino's<00:02:06.780> in

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.470 

and<00:02:14.239> it's<00:02:14.480> a<00:02:14.689> tight<00:02:15.680> joint<00:02:16.129> and<00:02:16.519> with<00:02:17.269> some

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
and it's a tight joint and with some

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.610 
and it's a tight joint and with some
glue<00:02:17.750> I've<00:02:18.290> done<00:02:19.120> probably<00:02:20.120> 25<00:02:20.959> them<00:02:21.109> so<00:02:21.319> far

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
glue I've done probably 25 them so far

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.530 
glue I've done probably 25 them so far
and<00:02:22.030> it's<00:02:23.140> perfect

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
and it's perfect

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.000 
and it's perfect
