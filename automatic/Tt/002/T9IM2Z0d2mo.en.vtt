00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.910
 I would not say long chat 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.850
 Let's start with the culprits took her 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.400
 on the left diego benaglio and 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.470
 you will surely wonder now 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.260
 why here on the right kevin 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.170
 Trapp is yes there are people of the 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.290
 meditec season 14 15 unfortunately no other 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.200
 card in the box except kevin trapp me 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.540
 know only after paris changed but me 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.149
 unfortunately can not pack any other cards 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.489
 I'm already waiting here, yes 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.989
 on the new match attax season i 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.020
 Of course I will have two soon 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.239
 buy displays on box course for 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.100
 you as a video and I hope that I 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.809
 then all cards because quickly full 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.329
 I get that oracle here 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.850
 with new people text cards 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.489
 can perform on entfahren bei diego 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.619
 Benaglio with a defense value of 76 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.010
 and kevin trapp has a defense value 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.130
 of 218 that means trapp can be 0 here 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.750
 1 achieve 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.890
 ricardo rodriguez wants the backlog 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.960
 Of course not long to sit on it 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.020
 let him come here right now my game 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.979
 world has a hardware value of 380 and 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.630
 on the right side we have 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.659
 precisely fitting oczipka 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.180
 he has a starting value of 65 and that 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.360
 is balancing strike strike through 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.680
 Ricardo Rodriguez continues with the 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.540
 We defend the first ends 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.170
 the left side here and on the left 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.259
 right side bamba anderson yes he has 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.350
 a defense value of 68 9 of which 77 the 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.869
 The leadership could be the harmony 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.520
 do not hold it long so he is her 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.720
 Two to one for Wolfsburg it works 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.869
 continue with the second defender 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.110
 like robin knoche once with one 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:04.680
 worth of 78 and once carlos zambrano 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:08.069
 he has a value of 72 that means yes 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.640
 the vfl continues to expand its leadership 3 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:13.500
 1 the last four arrive at the 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.070
 right side we have constant 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.320
 and on the left side we have 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:22.740
 sebastian young defensive point of the 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.290
 more than that means four to one new 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.850
 I would say we go 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.380
 continue here for the first 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:33.150
 nani midfielder on the left 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.890
 page maxi arnold 48 m 46 defense 74 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.860
 attack on the right side stefan 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.530
 aigner and aigner have both values 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.310
 less than Arnold and that means yes 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.040
 five to one the next straight at vfl 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.200
 wolfsburg is actually quasi 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.980
 unbeatable luiz gustavo star player 82 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.630
 defense 56 attack the right side 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.470
 we have marco russ and i say yes 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:02.930
 virtually unbeatable new sober 614 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:06.510
 vfl wolfsburg yes it continues with the 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.640
 next midfielder namibia the 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.830
 portuguese on the side of vfl 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:16.170
 wolfsburg on the right side to beer 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:20.000
 makoto hasebe yes just turn the times 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:23.280
 values ​​around 64 because he 46 there and that means yes 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.140
 balanced both parties have so 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.370
 said three points better and that is 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.930
 plus minus zero and I would say 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.600
 We are counting a draw 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:39.299
 Just both of us just go both 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:41.070
 more and that means 72 can be the 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.540
 simply those from frankfurt no more 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.459
 win but let's see if they still 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.489
 make up for a few treats 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.100
 left side kgb give de bruyne on the 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:53.459
 right side energy and yes clear case 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.950
 here 82 and we'll go over there 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:59.989
 this is the first attacking ladies we 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:03.570
 on the left side bastos with yes 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:05.790
 really few attack points 59 me 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.590
 would have thought that he has at least 70 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.390
 But the garden is already a few 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.579
 year old or one year 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.950
 old and that's why we can do it 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:16.820
 the values ​​are not up to date so yes too 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.530
 but either here or 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.599
 attack value of 71 that is the 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:25.380
 entry suggests harmony nevertheless beats 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:27.570
 look at eight to three and let's see 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.880
 what the last card still do 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.630
 can left side new transfer from the 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.490
 max extra series andré schüle attack 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.700
 worth 81 and on the right 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:42.630
 we vaclav kadlec and what he has for the 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:45.420
 Attack worth my friends right 67 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:51.600
 that means the top bundesliga oracle 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:54.810
 ends thus 93 I share the result 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:58.560
 course again through 29 to 3 through 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:00.480
 two gives four five to fifteen and me 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.470
 I'll always make the comma five aprons 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:07.050
 that is, the result is the final result 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:10.920
 is thus 4 to 1 wolfsburg wins 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:13.560
 here in wolfsburg 4 to 1 on sunday times 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.780
 to see if it really works that way 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.090
 I think it will change that way 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.440
 will be a close match two to one 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.060
 write me your tips in the 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.780
