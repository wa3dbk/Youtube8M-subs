00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.270
 although maybe 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.509
 I am a welcome to learn with a 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.060
 try shooter episode number 5 this time 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.420
 as you can see we are in black ops 2 and everything 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.370
 You ask me a lot for private 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.370
 it's our sorry 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.430
 so simply, as you see 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.960
 we have here a weapon in the ground is worth 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.030
 let's do the tri which is that 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.490
 ere so what we want is to do the 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.520
 cause with one of these two to two fly 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.920
 from painter hello the ballista is worth as you see 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.460
 I have done a very strange effect and what 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.460
 does this one 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.860
 fixed the change he makes with the dawn what 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.400
 he pretends that the soul is proof 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.400
 something you see 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.989
 right now I'm asking how he has 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:02.480
 secret fact is I explain it is something 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:05.320
 very simple if we do not have them there what 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.320
 what we want to do is this 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.350
 for the fixed that what it does is that the 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:11.780
 weapon comes out as if it were new york to 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.340
 same again I do the same and he at 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.679
 command changes me does not change me how it has 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.819
 changed when it has simply jumped 

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:18.109
 what you have to do is approach the 

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:20.539
 weapon that you have here is worth simply 

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:22.159
 when it appears to pick up 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:24.319
 example we can do from far away or 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.609
 from very close as you want that really 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:28.280
 it does not matter it simply has to appear 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:30.920
 on the screen they demand x for guarantors 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.599
 bullets well given the paddler or anyone 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.099
 it's worth it because it's really worth it with any 

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:36.770
 simply arm what you have to do 

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:39.530
 is at the same time that you keep the X of 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.939
 pick up the double pulsar weapon and in case 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.520
 of playstation that is like what they 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.469
 also square is worth now you have the 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.810
 square press the double twice 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:49.399
 Xbox triangle it once 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.860
 you keep the X double and little by little 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.829
 will be inspired by opening up, let's worry 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.229
 where it was expected because it really is not 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.860
 very difficult but little by little it is coming out 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.690
 OK 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.210
 this I repeat what you can do with 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.450
 any weapon so he hears no os 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.789
 worry that I'm in a matter of 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.760
 practice brushes is how you see at the same time 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.580
 I'm going to keep the X, I'm going to press 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.560
 double and it's worth simply has informed 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.810
 as I said it is quite complicated to 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.300
 occasionally but simply good 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.400
 that urges your app we do the lock is 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:28.050
 the new one that knows and outside I hope that 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.690
 get bottom 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.780
 and I do not expect anything that will serve us very much 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.720
 because I already had enough 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.360
 let's see if we get 250 to the 250 likes 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.580
 I had said role to the 150 likes I hope 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.760
 that a greeting has been spoken and even the 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.760
 next 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.640
 although activity less
