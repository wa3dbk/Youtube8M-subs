 rightly 7 with this game play gameplay 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.890
 new from a review of one 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:29.759
 and you will say because this session and straight 27 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.759
 I'm not like that, I'm like that 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.970
 and then this is going to be the way 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:41.160
 metamorphosis motorbike 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:44.900
 to the best and the minister 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.900
 or point 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.320
 and then I also have a package of 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.789
 textures in which I'll talk later and already 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:58.620
 we can verify what it is about 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:01.679
 this mode is not about having the the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:07.130
 power but the opportunity to become 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:11.100
 in other modes maps mobile maps pops and 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.010
 monsters for example let's see here to 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.530
 by zombie furrow 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:18.670
 and here they depreciated walking and 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.670
 arriving 97 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:26.010
 and what happened to us 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:30.000
 this remove it then you become 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:33.420
 a 17 not in a zombie pig 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.290
 ah yes yes yes and before continuing 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.860
 greetings to a max a watt that says a 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.570
 monthly fee of 20 a video yes and now and 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.490
 Now, yes, more greetings, your health is 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.490
 and then they will have the possibility of 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:52.110
 become a monkey 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:56.130
 you already have the hand of a zombie pig 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.880
 I think this beta investment so not 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.060
 It can be used with 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.750
 with 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.540
 that is, I can not convert in or it is not going 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.869
 to appear the hand of all for example 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.060
 if it comes out 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.870
 you become the under man universe 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.870
 97 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.370
 in this slide 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.239
 you become a slide 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.239
 and then back 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.160
 and of course from there he has no hands 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.280
 so it's not going to look like anything 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.810
 but if you can get there 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.810
 another six thousand 897 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.750
 as you can see here you can erase 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:47.690
 here for example erase silk slate 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.090
 the properties 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.170
 low 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.700
 good gives you the properties of fire 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.700
 so that is 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:03.380
 and for example it's supposed to burn 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:06.629
 let's see if I burn wait first 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.370
 first first 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:12.160
 first first some golden apples 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.450
 golden apples 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.450
 if I'm not going to burn 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.900
 game 1 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.280
 gay mobile 0 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:34.930
 I'm not supposed to be invincible on fire 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:37.590
 yes yes yes yes I am immortal 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.590
 importer 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.840
 and well, you can practically 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.840
 Do what you want for example 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:54.930
 I am very young the blazer 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:59.130
 well let's kill him 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.590
 one or two levels do not fly novels do not 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.650
 Do not fly clouds 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:08.280
 or not now that we are 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.890
 a cute lovelace and you're not going to throw 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.490
 fireballs with this mode tells me that 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:16.540
 You can fly 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:18.700
 it is resistant to fire to water not and 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.930
 now let's see let's remove what 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.930
 we play to create 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:30.540
 equalization and we are not in creative 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:34.660
 so so 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:36.689
 good and you kill it I removed the mode of 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:41.430
 game 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:47.090
 if you eat and we can game on 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:50.340
 we change so 7 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.850
 you are going to fly and kaisen 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.850
 do not 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:59.190
 although the field properties by 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:01.710
 example that more than other 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:05.120
 the zombie that you can with that good 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.120
 It's not going to burn us but we do not have fire 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.000
 yes 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.530
 and months and why because then the 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.530
 zombies 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.950
 then stop following 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:25.120
 because they converted me later because what 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.740
 they keep on Saturdays 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.979
 down here I 'm going to leave the link of 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.979
 mod 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:36.070
 I'll leave the link to move if the 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:38.490
 ding ding girlfriends let's become 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.490
 grease 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.650
 m 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:09.540
 these things give me things like billiards 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:12.650
 and we became a cast 

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:19.000
 and here is going to serve that is 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:22.930
 and so on up to 100 m 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.930
 to see if he has a little hand 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:28.850
 it also gives you the property to fly 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.940
 because he is a ghost and you can not do 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.940
 nothing 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.910
 wait first 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.620

 very to die I will die 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:08.060
