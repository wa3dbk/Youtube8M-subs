00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:29.119
 in the case of the director and the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.119
 supercopa de parís 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.850
 closing the fourth consecutive game 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.590
 Christian Ronaldo makes a bowl in this 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.840
 calm calm court 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.840
 basically for my part I will be 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.780
 and the control of Pedro 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:56.920
 allows you to solve everything 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.920
 it serves me 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.590
 Syria is good for the other center 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.590
 sociosanitary 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.350
 what 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.119
 I still do not know has chosen one of Mary 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.119
 and Maria 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.480
 is 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:27.600
 I believe that there is an 80% of Vctor Valdés 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:31.310
 gentlemen in terms of barcelona 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.310
 with stories of the mystery of the barça 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.450
 if not 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.900
 welcome for everyone as I am the 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.370
 hug for all friends and then 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.870
 in Latin America we are still taking 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.729
 conclusions of something that is fresh 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.080
 is palpable is in the air and has 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.110
 to do with a second time of those 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.360
 that one can hardly forget is true 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.850
 in the supercopa of spain is true 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.440
 still do not have the shooting of the 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.000
 competition both barcelona and real 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.950
 madrid but they delivered a second time 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.679
 extraordinary really extraordinary 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.560
 that ends up winning barcelona trizados 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.270
 he was about to be 41 and in a 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.260
 counterattack armed by iker boxes 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.850
 after covering this an incredible hand 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.770
 arms the contra and di maría thanks to the 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.360
 pressure and a valdés error ends 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.220
 by marking the discount from 3 to 2 and leaving 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.480
 open to the asiri for what will come for 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.370
 when next Wednesday we will be 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.470
 obviously in santiago bernabéu with 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.610
 a stick barça and with the canal with everything 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.800
 that has to do with that game alex 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.120
 Welcome barn and we have an hour 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.350
 to talk about everything that has happened in 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.880
 this game that we do a lot in the 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.290
 second time we go to the second time 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.989
 yes I think the first one to forget a 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.670
 little us not because a monologue there 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.780
 from Barcelona and a real Maria worked 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.280
 when counterattack had a couple of 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.230
 flight opportunities like you said to 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.989
 second time I think we 're going for the 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.659
 first but for another 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:55.010
 there were 5 goals is talking mourinho 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:56.510
 started the conference we would have 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.010
 permanently and turned the word 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.390
 del madrid coach just won 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.390
 matrix to 2 here we have it 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.250
 I do not want to be critical when 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.250
 critical decisions 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.040
 in a match I do not want to when trying 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.950
 not doing it during all seasons 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.950
 much less a second party 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.330
 you know of knocked out in the eaves 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.820
 yesterday I asked you why did you tell me that 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.560
 justify the bench the other day 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.690
 but the box has not traveled that has 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.380
 changed from yesterday to today has not changed 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.380
 nothing has changed 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.420
 we have called for this game 18 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.760
 more players 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.960
 morata and nacho for protection could 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.600
 pass some things in 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:02.280
 in warming and that here has not entered 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:06.510
 in my plans for 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:09.840
 for today also that without needing of 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.760
 make offensive changes had to higuaín 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.460
 already 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.300
 and I said Maria 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:20.859
 I knew he had cattle and Lassana in the 

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:23.379
 bench for 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:27.389
 compact in procampo and change some 

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:33.780
 thing is necessary and two defenders 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:33.780
 marcelo and they will take kaka not among thousands 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.640
 interpreted from his first response that 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.110
 he treated us interpreted from his first 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.780
 answer that you do not agree with 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.370
 some arbitration decision and who does not want 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.560
 talk about it then I will ask 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.020
 for its approach if the party has 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:56.400
 come out as you had planned 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.580
 or no no no not the first time but I do not 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.580
 liked it 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.540
 sometimes you 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:08.990
 you make a game that you do not want to do 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:11.000
 move forward sometimes has got in on 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.970
 change 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.500
 the game plan that you have barcelona 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:21.400
 in the first time it has had that merit of 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:24.169
 play very well from tightening a lot 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:27.800
 He has not left us 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:30.100
 go out many times with danger and that 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.729
 first time then 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:35.159
 we limit ourselves to 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:37.080
 to control the defensive space to play 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:40.409
 defensively fine but without any type 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:44.189
 first time out barcelona 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:45.900
 superior and it might look like it 's in 

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:49.559
 our plan to come and make a 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:51.629
 defensive match was not and then 

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:53.669
 we can prove it in the second time 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:56.129
 than when from the first minute of 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:59.370
 second time we have managed to make a 

00:05:56.129 --> 00:06:01.030
 play completely completely 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.890
 different 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.110
 the nights by ignacio garcía the sun of 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.210
 gold mark by I wanted to know what has 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.980
 taken to put alley out there Maria 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:11.890
 it's a bit of the surprise of the lineup 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:16.270
 that I had in mind practically as 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:19.510
 I wanted to surprise with something very well the 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:23.020
 first time as I said has a 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:25.680
 first responders first time since 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.680
 has not had 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:29.800
 no important influence on the 

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:34.120
 offensive game of the team because the 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:36.580
 team by merit of the adversary has 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.139
 made one more match within its center 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.960
 field but they knew country exactly 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:44.650
 what we wanted and prepared 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:47.169
 party for di maría- to be able to enter with 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:50.039
 a match with different characteristics 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:54.400
 it was important for me to see the alley 

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:58.960
 as a starter in a match like this one 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:01.240
 I want I think it's a substitute 

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:05.050
 very dear to me that I think that still 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:07.509
 a player who can also compete 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:12.900
 with the others for playing as a starter and 

00:07:07.509 --> 00:07:12.900
 I liked your work a lot
