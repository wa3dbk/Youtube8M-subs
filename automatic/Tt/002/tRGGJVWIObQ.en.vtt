 that they differ from each other 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:25.619
 leaf shape tall and much more 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.400
 if you are not yet able to distinguish oak 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:33.320
 from maple and magnolia from acacia today 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:37.950
 so not about learn to go 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:41.430
 This linden for sure you more than once saw in 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.430
 the park and the leaves are shaped like 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.070
 heart and under her chrome and you can 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.539

 by you honey a and whether it is easy 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.240
 remember by the large leaves unusual 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.659
 spring forms when they are very small 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.570
 it looks like this under warm 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.590
 the sun they open up and become 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.950
 But such at the coffin leaves 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.970
 small if the count grows in the forest he 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.909
 grows tall slender tree and in 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.850
 parks and on the streets they are usually cut 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:37.110
 to get a pretty lively 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.020
 hedge chestnut you can remember by 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.509
 large round crown 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:47.009
 his leaves are also large and in shape 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:49.970
 a bit like ve mahi chestnut blooms 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:54.149
 beautiful white or pink flowers 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:57.990
 candles and what do you think of these 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:01.760
 the colors are obtained then of course you already 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:06.110
 guessed it was a chestnut you 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:09.550
 Arnica like to collect in the fall is 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.550
 slender tree called birch and 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:16.130
 easy to distinguish from other trees 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:19.010
 Muney appeared dark and black and white 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:23.260
 she grows thin branches 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:26.600
 small pieces of the place where the birch grows 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:29.410
 called birch grove there always 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:34.210
 light and sunny 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:38.110
 it's barely more often it grows near water 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:42.230
 bending her thin long branches toward her 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:45.410
 willows are often called weeping because 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:50.080
 from her leaves occasionally protrude 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:53.810
 water droplets that don't need wood 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:57.020
 Oak is a big, very strong tree with 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:03:00.140
 sprawling crown in autumn on oak 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:04.280
 a lot of acorns ripen 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:09.040
 they fall to the ground and spring germinate 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.570
 to become young trees and this 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.630
 repin 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:17.150
 each piece consists of small 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:20.390
 oblong leaves and still on it 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.890
 clusters of berries grow at first they are quite 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.239
 small green and in the fall are 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:30.190
 bright red 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:32.090
 rowan berries birds love to eat at 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.560
 handsome poplar 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:40.220
 there are small smooth shiny 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:43.310
 Poplars are famous for their tall stature and in 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:47.450
 often parked in league video parks and along 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:50.870
 then hands and even early summer they let out 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:54.280
 a lot of white fluff that flies in 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:58.459
 air and falls on the grass and the road 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:01.590
 this fluff flies for a reason 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:05.910
 poplars from which grow new 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.530
 trees and this tree you know the first 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.860
 turn by its fruits 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.700
 of course you already guessed that we are talking about 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.280
 an Apple 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.070
 and the tree on which the apples grow 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.320
 called apple tree 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:22.620
 in spring, an apple tree blossoms in beautiful white 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.560
 flowers and then flowers become 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:29.630
 apples 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:32.760
 this walnut is a tree loves warmth 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:36.660
 leaves and flowers earrings appear on it 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:39.540
 later than on other trees later 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:43.110
 earrings become small nuts 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.660
 over the summer they mature and become here 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.479
 such 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:52.680
 the fruits of this tree you for sure too 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:56.400
 love this sweet cherry spring on it 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:59.610
 lots of white flowers appear through 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.340
 a few days the petals fall off and instead 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:05.460
 colors you can see little green 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:11.700
 a little kie cherry 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:17.010
 and they will be like that and thatâ€™s you 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:21.419
 you know it to her instead of leaves or green 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:23.220
 needles and she does not dump them for the winter in 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:26.310
 difference from other trees 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.880
 that's why we cut it into 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:32.220
 New Year's holidays 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.710
 young spruce needles are not at all 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:38.520
 prickly 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:41.970
 there are such trees you can hear 4 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:46.660
 called the blue -colored needles on on 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:51.960
 in fact , the name of these trees is gray 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:56.340
 and this conifer also looks like a Christmas tree 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:06:00.750
 it seems yes it is not quite larch 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:04.510
 nazim she drops her needles leaves 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:09.760
 the seeds of all wars their trees are kept in 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:12.310
 cones for example in such a bump still 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:16.840
 single pine pine tree 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:21.640
 pine has long soft needles which 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:24.070
 she does not dump for the winter from these 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:28.630
 trees there is another coniferous 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:33.310
 her relative leaves are soft 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:36.520
 scales and small brown bumps then 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:41.370
 often planted for decoration in flower beds and 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:44.560
 parks and this tree with large beautiful 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:48.520
 flowers called magnolia 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:51.460
 this is a very ancient plant such trees 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.360
 could meet several millions 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:56.710
 years ago 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:58.930
 imagine magnolia loves warm and not 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:03.840
 loves a harsh winter 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:03.840
 so our she meets infrequently 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:10.380
 Acacia also loves heat and is different 

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:14.410
 ability to grow very fast 

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:18.370
 scientists call these robinho trees 

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:21.400
 they have small light green leaves and 

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:25.120
 brushes of fragrant flowers 

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:30.250
 which appear in late spring seeds 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:32.050
 Acacia trees were kept in the pods and this tree 

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:35.770
 with small leaves 

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:38.710
 called hawthorn pink flowers 

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:41.680
 hawthorn appear at the very beginning 

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:45.450
 summer and autumn it matures 

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:47.560
 many small red fruits 

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:51.220
 high tree skrost 

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:54.250
 in and crown this boogie bug can be safely 

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:58.770
 call a long-liver it can grow 

00:07:54.250 --> 00:08:02.110
 for four hundred years now you are for sure 

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:05.680
 recognize any tree you see on 

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:09.270
 the street just had to go to the park or 

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:09.270
 forest and check
