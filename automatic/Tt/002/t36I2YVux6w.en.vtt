pretty small balls really and then

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.959 
pretty small balls really and then
depending<00:00:58.620> how<00:00:58.920> wet<00:00:59.129> your<00:00:59.309> mixture<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.730> you

might need to leave it in the fridge
just<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.530> set<00:01:01.710> up<00:01:01.739> for<00:01:01.920> half<00:01:02.309> an<00:01:02.460> hour

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
just to set up for half an hour

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.979 
just to set up for half an hour
or<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:02.969> might<00:01:03.120> find<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:03.510> one's<00:01:03.660> quite<00:01:03.809> good

or you might find this one's quite good
it's<00:01:04.379> holding<00:01:04.799> together<00:01:05.030> there<00:01:06.030> we<00:01:06.090> go

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
it's holding together there we go

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.149 
it's holding together there we go
that'll<00:01:06.630> be<00:01:06.750> enough<00:01:07.140> for<00:01:07.350> now<00:01:07.409> all<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.920> rest

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
that'll be enough for now all the rest

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.160 
that'll be enough for now all the rest
of<00:01:08.340> this<00:01:08.490> we<00:01:08.939> can<00:01:09.119> stay<00:01:09.330> for<00:01:09.479> another<00:01:09.540> time<00:01:09.900> but

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
of this we can stay for another time but

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.630 
of this we can stay for another time but
of<00:01:10.290> course<00:01:10.590> normally<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.010> just<00:01:11.040> carry<00:01:11.549> on

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
of course normally you just carry on

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.210 
of course normally you just carry on
rolling<00:01:12.150> does<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.630> freeze<00:01:12.900> not<00:01:13.530> particularly

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
rolling does it freeze not particularly

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.560 
rolling does it freeze not particularly
well<00:01:14.460> because<00:01:14.640> actually<00:01:15.090> you'll<00:01:15.240> cool<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
well because actually you'll cool the

just<00:01:44.579> roasted<00:01:45.060> slowly<00:01:45.720> in<00:01:46.079> oil<00:01:46.320> wee<00:01:46.439> bit<00:01:46.590> of

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
just roasted slowly in oil wee bit of

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.649 
just roasted slowly in oil wee bit of
time<00:01:46.920> as<00:01:47.220> well<00:01:47.430> for<00:01:48.030> probably<00:01:48.270> about<00:01:48.360> an<00:01:48.479> hour

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
time as well for probably about an hour

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.740 
time as well for probably about an hour
at<00:01:49.579> 140<00:01:50.579> degree<00:01:50.729> Celsius<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.240> they<00:01:51.390> are<00:01:51.479> really

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
at 140 degree Celsius so they are really

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.210 
at 140 degree Celsius so they are really
soft<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.470> can<00:01:52.590> put<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> lot<00:01:52.890> more<00:01:52.920> in

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
soft and you can put a lot more in

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.010 
soft and you can put a lot more in
because<00:01:53.700> you're<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.850> lot<00:01:54.000> less<00:01:54.210> potent<00:01:54.750> and

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
because you're a lot less potent and

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.069 
because you're a lot less potent and
then<00:01:55.560> more<00:01:55.920> lemon<00:01:56.159> juice<00:01:56.600> generous<00:01:57.600> pinch<00:01:57.960> of

then more lemon juice generous pinch of
salt<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:59.310> then<00:01:59.759> because<00:02:00.000> we<00:02:00.119> want<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.390> really

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
salt and then because we want a really

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.660 
salt and then because we want a really
loose<00:02:01.320> mixture<00:02:01.920> for<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.189> thermos
