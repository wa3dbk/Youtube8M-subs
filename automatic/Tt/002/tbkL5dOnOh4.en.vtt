2013 this is a hot weather jacket it's

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.360 
2013 this is a hot weather jacket it's
made<00:00:12.330> from<00:00:12.599> their<00:00:12.990> fighter<00:00:13.320> mesh<00:00:13.679> system<00:00:14.160> so

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
made from their fighter mesh system so

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:15.890 
made from their fighter mesh system so
it's<00:00:14.519> going<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.700> be<00:00:14.790> an<00:00:14.910> abrasion<00:00:15.389> resistant

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
it's going to be an abrasion resistant

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.840 
it's going to be an abrasion resistant
mesh<00:00:16.139> now<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.770> can<00:00:17.070> be<00:00:17.220> worn<00:00:17.369> in<00:00:17.550> different

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
mesh now it can be worn in different

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:18.980 
mesh now it can be worn in different
temperatures<00:00:18.210> because<00:00:18.420> there's<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.690> zip<00:00:18.869> and

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
temperatures because there's a zip and

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.420 
temperatures because there's a zip and
liner<00:00:19.260> will<00:00:19.500> see<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.890> little<00:00:20.130> bit<00:00:20.189> later

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
liner will see that a little bit later

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.450 
liner will see that a little bit later
as<00:00:20.779> for<00:00:21.779> this<00:00:21.869> jacket<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.560> mesh<00:00:22.800> system<00:00:23.279> on

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
as for this jacket the mesh system on

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.009 
as for this jacket the mesh system on
the<00:00:23.609> main<00:00:23.820> chassis<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.449> fighter<00:00:24.660> mesh<00:00:24.900> you

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
the main chassis is the fighter mesh you

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.210 
the main chassis is the fighter mesh you
can<00:00:25.170> see<00:00:25.320> it's<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.529> little<00:00:25.769> bit<00:00:25.859> different

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
can see it's a little bit different

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.950 
can see it's a little bit different
material<00:00:26.580> here<00:00:26.820> in<00:00:26.970> this<00:00:27.060> gray<00:00:27.330> section<00:00:27.779> also

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
material here in this gray section also

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.529 
material here in this gray section also
on<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.680> back<00:00:28.859> panel<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.060> more<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.300> a

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
on the back panel this is it more of a

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.049 
on the back panel this is it more of a
larger<00:00:30.929> diameter<00:00:31.830> hole<00:00:32.040> for<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.399> mesh<00:00:32.669> it's

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
larger diameter hole for the mesh it's

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.580 
larger diameter hole for the mesh it's
going<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.300> really<00:00:33.510> promote<00:00:33.809> airflow<00:00:34.350> through

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
going to really promote airflow through

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.650 
going to really promote airflow through
this<00:00:34.920> part<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.370> chassis<00:00:35.610> also<00:00:36.420> in<00:00:36.570> this

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
this part of the chassis also in this

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.720 
this part of the chassis also in this
low<00:00:37.020> where<00:00:37.260> area<00:00:37.620> here<00:00:37.829> under<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.129> arms<00:00:38.399> this

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
low where area here under the arms this

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.459 
low where area here under the arms this
is<00:00:38.850> more<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.180> comfort<00:00:39.570> nylon<00:00:39.870> material<00:00:40.020> so

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
is more of a comfort nylon material so

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.200 
is more of a comfort nylon material so
it's<00:00:40.590> going<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.770> be<00:00:40.829> easier<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.190> wear<00:00:41.460> this

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
it's going to be easier to wear this

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.910 
it's going to be easier to wear this
does<00:00:42.510> have<00:00:42.690> some<00:00:42.870> armor<00:00:43.200> sewn<00:00:43.410> into<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.739> you've

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
and on the elbow regions those are

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.940 
and on the elbow regions those are
removable<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.079> can<00:00:49.230> wash<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.590> jacket

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
and reinforced so that this high impact

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.160 
and reinforced so that this high impact
area<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.760> going<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.210> have<00:00:57.300> more<00:00:57.510> protection<00:00:58.050> to

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
area is going to have more protection to
