00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
them actually go down a pro probably

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
them actually go down a pro probably
should<00:01:01.739> have<00:01:01.800> killed<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.100> planetary

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
should have killed the planetary

good army kill killed a lot of SUVs in a
turret<00:01:06.960> right<00:01:07.080> here<00:01:07.350> got<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.740> bunker<00:01:08.070> line

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
turret right here got that bunker line

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.710 
turret right here got that bunker line
dropped<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.610> little<00:01:08.790> bit<00:01:08.970> but<00:01:09.150> now<00:01:09.299> he's<00:01:09.450> left

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
dropped a little bit but now he's left

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
with nearly no army these meat is flying

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.539 
with nearly no army these meat is flying
by<00:01:12.500> aimlessly<00:01:13.500> get<00:01:13.890> picked<00:01:14.130> off<00:01:14.280> by<00:01:14.490> the

by aimlessly get picked off by the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.740 
by aimlessly get picked off by the
Marines<00:01:14.909> I'm<00:01:15.330> sure<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.540> be<00:01:15.600> actually

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
Marines I'm sure to be actually

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.510 
Marines I'm sure to be actually
attacking<00:01:16.140> on<00:01:16.320> two<00:01:16.500> fronts<00:01:16.680> now<00:01:16.979> over<00:01:17.369> there

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
attacking on two fronts now over there

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.130 
attacking on two fronts now over there
at<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.700> third<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.270> at<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.509> high<00:01:18.659> yield<00:01:18.930> some

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
at the third and at the high yield some

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.080 
at the third and at the high yield some
vein<00:01:19.380> legs<00:01:19.590> morphing<00:01:19.890> here<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.310> think<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.909> pro

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
vein legs morphing here I think a pro

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.450 
vein legs morphing here I think a pro
will<00:01:21.240> be<00:01:21.330> able<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.509> hold<00:01:21.689> off<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.020> Thor<00:01:22.460> and
