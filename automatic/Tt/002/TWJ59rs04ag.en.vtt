blood beats down a lot faster sar Fang
right<00:02:38.770> now<00:02:38.980> is<00:02:39.130> getting<00:02:39.340> pretty<00:02:39.760> low<00:02:39.970> I

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
right now is getting pretty low I

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.640 
right now is getting pretty low I
believe<00:02:40.840> that<00:02:41.050> 30%<00:02:41.470> I'm<00:02:42.010> not<00:02:42.160> sure<00:02:42.370> he<00:02:42.550> gets<00:02:42.760> a

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
believe that 30% I'm not sure he gets a

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.920 
believe that 30% I'm not sure he gets a
buff<00:02:44.650> that<00:02:44.680> makes<00:02:45.130> him<00:02:45.280> attack<00:02:45.610> a<00:02:45.940> lot<00:02:46.450> faster

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
buff that makes him attack a lot faster

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.710 
buff that makes him attack a lot faster
so<00:02:47.230> it's<00:02:47.920> really<00:02:48.520> critical<00:02:48.760> that<00:02:49.150> you<00:02:49.420> do<00:02:49.600> not

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
so it's really critical that you do not

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.530 
so it's really critical that you do not
let<00:02:49.870> any<00:02:50.080> marks<00:02:50.440> get<00:02:51.400> out<00:02:51.550> and<00:02:51.820> stay<00:02:52.270> away<00:02:52.480> from
