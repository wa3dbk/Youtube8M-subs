00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.700 
I'd like that the authentic ones and I
guess<00:00:17.449> I<00:00:17.570> decided<00:00:17.900> to<00:00:18.080> see<00:00:18.260> what<00:00:18.289> kind<00:00:18.590> of

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
guess I decided to see what kind of

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:25.420 
guess I decided to see what kind of
oddly<00:00:19.510> they<00:00:20.510> were<00:00:22.090> reps<00:00:23.260> so<00:00:24.260> let's<00:00:25.250> take<00:00:25.369> a

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
oddly they were reps so let's take a

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.800 
oddly they were reps so let's take a
look<00:00:25.640> at<00:00:25.699> the<00:00:25.910> box<00:00:26.119> is<00:00:26.590> horrendous<00:00:28.060> but<00:00:29.060> I<00:00:29.330> like

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
look at the box is horrendous but I like

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.919 
look at the box is horrendous but I like
the<00:00:30.160> detail<00:00:31.160> they<00:00:31.760> put<00:00:31.789> into<00:00:32.059> the<00:00:32.479> box<00:00:32.629> itself

00:00:32.919 --> 00:00:32.929 
the detail they put into the box itself

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:37.360 
the detail they put into the box itself
because<00:00:33.829> it<00:00:34.069> even<00:00:34.460> has<00:00:34.870> theam<00:00:35.870> the<00:00:36.859> dead<00:00:37.100> stock

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
because it even has theam the dead stock

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.729

seagull<00:00:37.789> if<00:00:37.909> you<00:00:37.940> can<00:00:38.149> see<00:00:38.929> the<00:00:39.079> preparations

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
seagull if you can see the preparations

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.289 
seagull if you can see the preparations
here<00:00:40.010> and<00:00:40.399> actually<00:00:41.949> here<00:00:42.949> stupid<00:00:43.940> that<00:00:44.059> suck

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:44.299 
here and actually here stupid that suck

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:49.719 
here and actually here stupid that suck
still<00:00:44.839> here<00:00:46.569> so<00:00:47.569> much<00:00:48.260> waka<00:00:48.889> waka<00:00:49.129> show<00:00:49.429> and

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:49.729 
still here so much waka waka show and

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:53.109 
still here so much waka waka show and
actually<00:00:49.850> has<00:00:50.209> the<00:00:50.239> bedside<00:00:50.870> seal<00:00:51.170> on<00:00:52.010> it<00:00:52.069> so<00:00:52.850> I

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:53.119 
actually has the bedside seal on it so I

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:56.709 
actually has the bedside seal on it so I
guess<00:00:53.449> from<00:00:53.690> these<00:00:53.869> boxes<00:00:54.319> work<00:00:55.479> source<00:00:56.479> seen

guess from these boxes work source seen

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.859 
guess from these boxes work source seen

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
I rock as soon as I can fix carbon fiber

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:17.000 
I rock as soon as I can fix carbon fiber
have<00:03:14.849> a<00:03:14.939> look<00:03:15.090> more<00:03:15.269> effective<00:03:15.689> because<00:03:16.170> these

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
have a look more effective because these

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.309 
have a look more effective because these
are<00:03:17.219> head<00:03:17.340> turners<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:18.000> these<00:03:18.900> got<00:03:19.079> to<00:03:19.170> be<00:03:19.230> on

people of a nasty bug I'm gonna do a

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.759 
people of a nasty bug I'm gonna do a
video<00:03:30.239> or<00:03:30.599> the<00:03:30.989> carbon<00:03:31.349> fiber<00:03:31.560> fix<00:03:31.829> as<00:03:32.010> well<00:03:32.220> I

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
video or the carbon fiber fix as well I

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.770 
video or the carbon fiber fix as well I
have<00:03:34.769> a<00:03:34.799> theory<00:03:35.639> on<00:03:35.909> what<00:03:36.239> I'm<00:03:36.329> going<00:03:36.569> to<00:03:36.629> do

have a theory on what I'm going to do
and<00:03:37.680> I'll<00:03:37.919> test<00:03:38.579> it<00:03:38.730> out<00:03:38.849> just<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.150> see<00:03:39.329> if<00:03:39.450> it

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
and I'll test it out just to see if it

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.599 
and I'll test it out just to see if it
works<00:03:39.810> in<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.079> know<00:03:40.200> if<00:03:40.709> it<00:03:40.919> works<00:03:41.159> out<00:03:41.340> well

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
works in the know if it works out well

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.399 
works in the know if it works out well
