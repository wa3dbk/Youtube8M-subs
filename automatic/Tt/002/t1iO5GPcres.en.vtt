00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.800
 Then 

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:12.420
 First of all , please stretch your back and keep your stomach in it 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:18.140
 In that state, I 'm going to raise one leg too 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:21.500
 Visibility is as far as it is the floor and horizontal increase in 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:27.110
 Who will continue to raise It is surgery 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:32.669
 It seems that there is no such thing that the body tilts like this when raised 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:36.960
 Please take a balanced focus on firm abs ass 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:42.720
 Note that you body is not warped behind 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.800
 I put a hand when you are raising this also 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.550
 in this way 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.030
 Alternately 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.780
 I will raise my body and feet 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:59.400
 In this way to keep the pet Wako together 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:02.030
 There is a way like this, but in this case the hands and feet are 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.030
 in this way 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.420
 listen 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:13.010
 left foot 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:14.850
 I heard the opposite hand Fu that the left foot is the Fu that the right foot with the left 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.070
 in this way 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.920
 peach 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:24.610
 We will continue to be going exercise that raised 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:26.940
 Gradually increase your hand swing 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:32.030
 Increase the swing of 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:33.570
 The elbow should be around 90 degrees with the tongue as much as possible 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.430
 in this way 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:40.440
 I will repeat the operation 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.140
 Please note that the body does not shave 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.320
 This is a continuous day 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.350
 I am doing 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:51.040
 It took place in a continuous 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.260
 This will do 20 times first 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:58.670
 10 times 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:02:00.100
 Even if gradually ask them to speed up the tempo is fine is fine ask them to this way early 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.970
 If you get used 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.970
 Ritz early 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.069
 I repeat this 20 times 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:15.079
 In operating Kedomo I say again and again 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.980
 In this way, the body does not go along with the body during movement 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:19.579
 To 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.830
 Firmly keep your buttock muscles strong 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:26.480
 Tokki- but the power reason 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:31.690
 Until then it is as fast as possible 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:33.540
 Because it does not become training with this if it seems that the operation is broken early 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.740
 in this way 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:41.420
 Straight 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:42.680
 Make sure your body is straight 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.319
 In order 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.319
 Good Let's do toward the front straight separate surnames
