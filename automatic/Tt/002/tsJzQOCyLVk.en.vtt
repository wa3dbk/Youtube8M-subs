and it's working with both of those

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.260 
and it's working with both of those
engines<00:00:42.480> really<00:00:42.600> well<00:00:42.870> oh<00:00:43.160> snap<00:00:44.190> we've<00:00:45.149> been

developers finding working with the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.270 
developers finding working with the
oculus<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:51.329> far<00:00:51.570> they<00:00:51.719> like<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.050> good<00:00:52.320> good

oculus so far they like it good good
and<00:00:53.430> it's<00:00:53.730> got<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.090> be<00:00:54.180> great<00:00:54.300> having<00:00:55.140> unity

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
and it's got to be great having unity

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.080 
and it's got to be great having unity
hooked<00:00:55.800> up<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.039> this<00:00:56.129> thing<00:00:56.370> now<00:00:56.520> because<00:00:56.760> so

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
hooked up to this thing now because so

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.000 
hooked up to this thing now because so
many<00:00:57.270> well<00:00:57.750> unity<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.260> really<00:00:58.500> great<00:00:58.710> engine

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
many well unity is a really great engine

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.529 
many well unity is a really great engine
especially<00:00:59.160> for<00:00:59.489> Indies<00:00:59.760> it's<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.180> really<00:01:00.510> easy

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
especially for Indies it's a really easy

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.270 
especially for Indies it's a really easy
creation<00:01:01.230> tool<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.680> it's<00:01:01.770> accessible<00:01:02.039> to

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
creation tool and it's accessible to

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.889 
creation tool and it's accessible to
pretty<00:01:02.460> much<00:01:02.579> everyone<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.480> what<00:01:03.600> else<00:01:03.719> has

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
pretty much everyone so what else has

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.660 
pretty much everyone so what else has
changed<00:01:03.930> like<00:01:04.290> I'm<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> consumer<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.010> as<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.430> guy

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
changed like I'm a consumer and as a guy

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.490 
changed like I'm a consumer and as a guy
who's<00:01:05.939> gonna<00:01:06.060> put<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.420> thing<00:01:06.630> on<00:01:06.810> what's

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
who's gonna put this thing on what's

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.310 
who's gonna put this thing on what's
changed<00:01:08.130> from<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:09.659> one<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:09.990> played<00:01:10.200> at

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
changed from the one that I played at

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.510 
changed from the one that I played at
PAX<00:01:10.500> other<00:01:10.770> than<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.010> fact<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.400> one

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
PAX other than the fact that the one

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.800 
PAX other than the fact that the one
that<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.670> played<00:01:11.880> at<00:01:12.000> PAX<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.390> think<00:01:12.600> was<00:01:12.780> like

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
that I played at PAX I think was like

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.789 
that I played at PAX I think was like
wrapped<00:01:13.560> in<00:01:13.799> tape<00:01:14.750> so<00:01:15.750> what's<00:01:15.869> changed<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
wrapped in tape so what's changed the

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.170 
wrapped in tape so what's changed the
biggest<00:01:17.130> change<00:01:17.369> that<00:01:17.460> we've<00:01:17.640> made<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:17.970> we've

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
biggest change that we've made is we've

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.580 
biggest change that we've made is we've
developed<00:01:18.570> our<00:01:18.659> own<00:01:18.720> sense<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.350> our<00:01:19.560> own

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
developed our own sense of our own

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.980 
developed our own sense of our own
motion<00:01:20.070> tracks<00:01:20.280> our<00:01:20.520> own<00:01:20.610> sensor<00:01:21.060> center

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
motion tracks our own sensor center

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.460 
motion tracks our own sensor center
chips

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
chips

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.120 
chips
oh<00:01:22.500> no<00:01:24.020> the<00:01:25.020> original<00:01:25.110> one<00:01:25.560> was<00:01:25.590> running<00:01:26.070> at

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
oh no the original one was running at

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.640 
oh no the original one was running at
250<00:01:26.850> Hertz<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.360> our<00:01:27.750> newest<00:01:28.049> ones<00:01:28.229> runs<00:01:28.470> at<00:01:28.619> a

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
250 Hertz and our newest ones runs at a

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.289 
250 Hertz and our newest ones runs at a
thousand<00:01:29.100> Hertz<00:01:29.310> so<00:01:29.490> we<00:01:29.640> can<00:01:29.790> deliver<00:01:30.000> lower

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
thousand Hertz so we can deliver lower

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.819 
thousand Hertz so we can deliver lower
latency<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:30.900> improved<00:01:31.200> head-tracking

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
latency and improved head-tracking

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.219 
latency and improved head-tracking
so<00:01:32.009> what<00:01:32.159> happens<00:01:32.520> when<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.420> get<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.840> you

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
so what happens when you get that you

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.980 
so what happens when you get that you
get<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.500> higher<00:01:35.329> cycle<00:01:36.329> range<00:01:36.570> gives<00:01:36.869> us

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
get that higher cycle range gives us

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.539 
get that higher cycle range gives us
better<00:01:37.140> quality<00:01:37.680> data<00:01:37.890> gives<00:01:38.250> us<00:01:38.310> more

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
better quality data gives us more

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.740 
better quality data gives us more
samples<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.150> work<00:01:39.270> with<00:01:39.420> when<00:01:39.540> we're<00:01:39.659> doing

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
samples to work with when we're doing

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.120 
samples to work with when we're doing
our<00:01:39.960> sensor<00:01:40.200> fusion<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.829> we<00:01:40.890> can<00:01:41.009> get

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
our sensor fusion so that we can get

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.289 
our sensor fusion so that we can get
better<00:01:41.280> tracking<00:01:41.579> overall<00:01:41.939> but<00:01:42.119> most

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
better tracking overall but most

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.819 
better tracking overall but most
importantly<00:01:42.810> because<00:01:43.409> it's<00:01:43.530> running<00:01:43.710> at<00:01:43.799> a

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
importantly because it's running at a

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.649 
importantly because it's running at a
thousand<00:01:44.250> Hertz<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.520> said<00:01:44.670> 254<00:01:45.299> it's<00:01:45.390> four

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
thousand Hertz it said 254 it's four

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.510 
thousand Hertz it said 254 it's four
times<00:01:45.930> faster<00:01:46.140> we<00:01:46.740> can<00:01:46.860> actually<00:01:47.009> have<00:01:47.220> less

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
times faster we can actually have less

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.789 
times faster we can actually have less
latency<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.360> less<00:01:48.810> time<00:01:49.110> between<00:01:49.320> when<00:01:49.680> you

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
latency so less time between when you

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.260 
latency so less time between when you
make<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> motion<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.430> when<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.759> shows<00:01:50.939> up<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.210> the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
make a motion to when it shows up on the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.310 
make a motion to when it shows up on the
screen<00:01:51.450> yeah<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.750> don't<00:01:51.840> notice<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.170> because

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
screen yeah I don't notice that because

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.420 
screen yeah I don't notice that because
I<00:01:52.350> was<00:01:52.470> playing<00:01:52.649> some<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.950> new<00:01:53.040> demos<00:01:53.310> and

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
I was playing some of the new demos and

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.710 
I was playing some of the new demos and
the<00:01:53.490> first<00:01:53.670> thing<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.000> do<00:01:54.180> when<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.450> put<00:01:54.509> this

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
the first thing you do when you put this

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.270 
the first thing you do when you put this
thing<00:01:54.899> on<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.320> always<00:01:55.530> try<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.799> trick<00:01:56.130> it

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
thing on is you always try to trick it

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.190 
thing on is you always try to trick it
right<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:57.000> always<00:01:57.119> try<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.390> like<00:01:57.600> do<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:57.930> and

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
right you always try to like do this and

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.740 
right you always try to like do this and
try<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:58.920> make<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.159> try<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.700> make<00:01:59.790> it<00:02:00.060> fail<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.600> I

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
try to make it try to make it fail and I

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.990 
try to make it try to make it fail and I
noticed<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.500> was<00:02:01.530> just<00:02:02.040> keeping<00:02:02.729> up<00:02:02.850> with

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
noticed that it was just keeping up with

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.100 
noticed that it was just keeping up with
me<00:02:03.180> and<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.420> was<00:02:03.450> keeping<00:02:03.659> up<00:02:03.840> with<00:02:03.930> me<00:02:04.049> and

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
me and it was keeping up with me and

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.899 
me and it was keeping up with me and
really<00:02:04.229> rock-solid<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.189> low<00:02:05.340> latency<00:02:05.880> and

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
really rock-solid and low latency and

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.370 
really rock-solid and low latency and
we're<00:02:06.149> working<00:02:06.479> on<00:02:06.689> even<00:02:06.869> a

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
we're working on even a

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.139 
we're working on even a
even<00:02:07.680> more<00:02:07.860> before<00:02:08.039> release<00:02:08.429> that's<00:02:08.789> cool<00:02:08.940> and

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
even more before release that's cool and

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.479 
even more before release that's cool and
so<00:02:09.569> as<00:02:09.840> far<00:02:10.140> as<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.530> internal<00:02:11.280> the

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
so as far as the the internal the

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.680 
so as far as the the internal the
display<00:02:11.849> and<00:02:11.940> everything<00:02:12.270> like<00:02:12.390> that<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.599> know

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
display and everything like that I know

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.350 
display and everything like that I know
you<00:02:12.780> guys<00:02:12.900> are<00:02:13.170> constantly<00:02:13.620> updating<00:02:14.160> that

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
you guys are constantly updating that

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.490 
you guys are constantly updating that
what<00:02:15.360> are<00:02:15.450> gonna<00:02:15.630> be<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.810> specs<00:02:16.080> of<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.349> of

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
what are gonna be the specs of the of

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.530 
what are gonna be the specs of the of
the<00:02:16.650> display<00:02:17.010> as<00:02:17.310> far<00:02:17.610> as<00:02:17.730> resolution<00:02:18.330> do<00:02:18.450> we

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
the display as far as resolution do we

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.600 
the display as far as resolution do we
know<00:02:18.630> but<00:02:18.870> yes<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.470> display<00:02:19.830> is<00:02:19.980> 1280<00:02:20.340> by<00:02:20.430> 800

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
know but yes the display is 1280 by 800

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.520 
know but yes the display is 1280 by 800
split<00:02:21.209> in<00:02:21.300> half<00:02:21.450> so<00:02:21.630> you're<00:02:21.750> getting<00:02:21.900> 640<00:02:22.440> by

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
split in half so you're getting 640 by

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.920 
split in half so you're getting 640 by
800<00:02:23.010> 4i<00:02:23.250> we've<00:02:23.970> actually<00:02:24.120> upgraded<00:02:24.630> to<00:02:24.720> a<00:02:24.750> new

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
800 4i we've actually upgraded to a new

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.780 
800 4i we've actually upgraded to a new
display<00:02:25.200> since<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.920> prototype<00:02:26.580> so<00:02:26.670> we've

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
display since the prototype so we've

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.130 
display since the prototype so we've
been<00:02:26.880> showing<00:02:27.030> off<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.360> packs<00:02:27.630> it<00:02:27.840> has<00:02:27.930> better

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
been showing off the packs it has better

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.500 
been showing off the packs it has better
contrast<00:02:28.319> better<00:02:28.860> brightness<00:02:29.330> but<00:02:30.330> most

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
contrast better brightness but most

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.030 
contrast better brightness but most
importantly<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:30.989> better<00:02:31.110> switching<00:02:31.590> time<00:02:31.800> so

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
importantly a better switching time so

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.070 
importantly a better switching time so
you<00:02:32.130> get<00:02:32.250> less<00:02:32.400> motion<00:02:32.700> blur<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.180> again<00:02:33.599> lower

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
you get less motion blur and again lower

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.740 
you get less motion blur and again lower
latency<00:02:34.709> so<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:35.010> really<00:02:35.280> that's<00:02:36.150> really<00:02:36.540> rocks

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
latency so it really that's really rocks

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.300 
latency so it really that's really rocks
all<00:02:36.989> and<00:02:37.230> seems<00:02:37.500> like<00:02:37.650> it's<00:02:37.800> keeping<00:02:38.099> up<00:02:38.190> with

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
all and seems like it's keeping up with

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.870 
all and seems like it's keeping up with
your<00:02:38.430> head<00:02:38.580> it's<00:02:39.030> so<00:02:39.540> cool<00:02:40.099> so<00:02:41.099> I<00:02:41.130> mean<00:02:41.340> how<00:02:41.519> far

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
your head it's so cool so I mean how far

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.240 
your head it's so cool so I mean how far
out<00:02:42.120> are<00:02:42.450> we<00:02:42.780> like<00:02:42.989> how<00:02:43.170> long<00:02:43.620> are<00:02:43.769> you<00:02:43.860> on<00:02:44.130> is

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
out are we like how long are you on is

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.890 
out are we like how long are you on is
it<00:02:44.310> gonna<00:02:44.400> be<00:02:44.580> till<00:02:44.790> we<00:02:44.880> have<00:02:45.030> consumer<00:02:45.540> units

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
it gonna be till we have consumer units

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.120 
it gonna be till we have consumer units
in<00:02:46.140> homes

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
in homes

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.190 
in homes
well<00:02:47.760> we're<00:02:48.000> shipping<00:02:48.180> our<00:02:48.450> developer<00:02:48.959> kits

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
well we're shipping our developer kits

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.229 
well we're shipping our developer kits
in<00:02:49.470> mid-march<00:02:50.010> so<00:02:50.340> we're<00:02:50.519> almost<00:02:50.670> there<00:02:50.970> less

some<00:02:56.849> people<00:02:57.150> do<00:02:57.599> publishers<00:02:58.110> have<00:02:58.590> this

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
some people do publishers have this

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.620 
some people do publishers have this
