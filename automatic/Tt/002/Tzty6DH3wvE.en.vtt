00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
this is more just like me doing my

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.690 
this is more just like me doing my
makeup<00:01:48.840> because<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.649> am<00:01:49.799> gonna<00:01:50.009> go<00:01:50.189> out<00:01:50.369> after

makeup because I am gonna go out after

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.789 
makeup because I am gonna go out after
this<00:01:50.850> i<00:01:51.689> just<00:01:52.200> thought<00:01:52.380> i<00:01:52.409> would<00:01:52.500> do<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.770> like

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
this i just thought i would do it like

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.950 
this i just thought i would do it like
this<00:01:53.100> i<00:01:53.369> hope<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.970> know<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.420> i'm<00:01:54.780> not

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
this i hope that you know that i'm not

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.050 
this i hope that you know that i'm not
doing<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.590> piss<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.920> off<00:01:55.950> I'm<00:01:56.399> doing<00:01:56.939> it

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
doing it to piss you off I'm doing it

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.670 
doing it to piss you off I'm doing it
because<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.329> think<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.780> it's<00:01:58.229> better<00:01:58.469> the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
because I think it it's better the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.380 
because I think it it's better the
quality<00:01:58.799> is<00:01:59.189> better<00:01:59.369> so<00:01:59.909> if<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.030> get<00:02:00.149> close<00:02:00.299> to

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
quality is better so if you get close to

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.940 
quality is better so if you get close to
the<00:02:00.600> details<00:02:00.960> better<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.409> can<00:02:01.500> see<00:02:01.799> better

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
the details better so you can see better

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.670 
the details better so you can see better
and<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.909> voice<00:02:03.060> over<00:02:03.299> thing<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.840> don't<00:02:04.409> talk

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
and the voice over thing I don't talk

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.440 
and the voice over thing I don't talk
when<00:02:04.979> I'm<00:02:05.100> doing<00:02:05.250> my<00:02:05.340> makeup<00:02:05.670> anyway<00:02:06.119> like

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
when I'm doing my makeup anyway like

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.180 
when I'm doing my makeup anyway like
even<00:02:06.630> in<00:02:06.810> my<00:02:06.899> other<00:02:07.110> videos<00:02:07.500> as<00:02:07.860> I'm<00:02:08.009> actually

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
even in my other videos as I'm actually

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.369 
even in my other videos as I'm actually
applying<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.970> don't<00:02:09.360> talk<00:02:09.599> because<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.170> have<00:02:10.349> to

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
applying I don't talk because I have to

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.680 
applying I don't talk because I have to
concentrate<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:11.129> can't<00:02:11.459> like<00:02:11.640> talk<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:11.970> do<00:02:12.569> at

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
concentrate I can't like talk and do at

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.260 
concentrate I can't like talk and do at
the<00:02:12.810> same<00:02:12.930> time

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
the same time

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.490 
the same time
so<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.630> voiceovers<00:02:14.050> really<00:02:14.290> aren't<00:02:14.470> that

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
so the voiceovers really aren't that

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.320 
so the voiceovers really aren't that
different<00:02:14.800> I'm<00:02:15.340> just<00:02:15.790> actually<00:02:15.970> talking

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
different I'm just actually talking

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.090 
different I'm just actually talking
while<00:02:16.630> doing<00:02:16.810> makeup<00:02:17.170> which<00:02:17.320> is<00:02:17.530> a<00:02:17.560> difference

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
while doing makeup which is a difference

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.980 
while doing makeup which is a difference
so<00:02:18.790> I'm<00:02:19.000> sorry<00:02:19.150> if<00:02:19.240> you<00:02:19.360> don't<00:02:19.420> like<00:02:19.540> that<00:02:19.660> but

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
so I'm sorry if you don't like that but

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.870 
so I'm sorry if you don't like that but
it's<00:02:20.350> easier<00:02:20.710> for<00:02:20.740> me<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.010> do<00:02:21.340> it<00:02:21.490> and<00:02:21.520> then

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
it's easier for me to do it and then

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.390 
it's easier for me to do it and then
talk<00:02:22.240> about<00:02:22.270> what<00:02:22.600> I'm<00:02:22.720> doing<00:02:23.220> afterwards<00:02:24.220> so

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
talk about what I'm doing afterwards so

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.490 
talk about what I'm doing afterwards so
I<00:02:24.460> can<00:02:24.670> think<00:02:24.880> clearly<00:02:25.330> about<00:02:25.720> one<00:02:26.290> thing

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
I can think clearly about one thing

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.870 
I can think clearly about one thing
instead<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:27.010> trying<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.310> do<00:02:27.490> different<00:02:27.850> things

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
instead of trying to do different things

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.490 
instead of trying to do different things
and<00:02:28.330> I'm<00:02:28.450> talking<00:02:28.810> about<00:02:28.990> with<00:02:29.140> my<00:02:29.230> hands<00:02:29.410> and

not trying to do repetitive video I'm
just<00:03:08.050> kind<00:03:08.620> of<00:03:08.650> doing<00:03:08.830> this<00:03:09.040> as<00:03:09.280> I<00:03:09.430> go<00:03:09.610> the<00:03:10.600> mix

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
just kind of doing this as I go the mix

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:20.809 
just kind of doing this as I go the mix
is<00:03:11.080> going<00:03:11.350> to<00:03:11.500> go

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.030 

so<00:03:21.450> that's<00:03:21.629> going<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.840> be<00:03:22.019> kind<00:03:22.349> of<00:03:22.499> light<00:03:22.769> and

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
so that's going to be kind of light and

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.670 
so that's going to be kind of light and
now<00:03:23.189> I'm<00:03:23.249> going<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.459> go<00:03:23.549> in<00:03:23.700> with<00:03:23.730> dash<00:03:24.680> urban

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
decay and then just to find that more

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:37.309 
decay and then just to find that more
that<00:03:33.359> lunge<00:03:33.680> lift<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.769> little<00:03:34.920> bit<00:03:35.129> more<00:03:36.319> sunken

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
that lunge lift a little bit more sunken

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.420
