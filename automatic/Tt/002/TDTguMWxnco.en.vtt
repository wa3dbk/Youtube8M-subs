00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:17.550
 in this appointment with chip leader 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.270
 the strategies of the pros to win the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.890
 poker tournaments 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.890
 we will analyze one the starting hands more 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.899
 feared by infantryman players or more 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.669
 simply pair of jack hands 

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:29.279
 apparently very strong but who can in 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:30.719
 reality hides several pitfalls 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.489
 the problems increase when we explain the 

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:33.780
 hooks from utg to better face 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.180
 this game situation we have 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.870
 asked Julie for 90th century advice 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.870
 giuliano bendinelli 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.720
 a hand that could be presented 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.580
 problem to play could be 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.590
 have a pair of jacks in your hand from 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.360
 position of under vegan and therefore a tg 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.760
 the first to talk when the blinds are 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.940
 still in the early stage phase then ad 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.770
 example 20 40 and we have a stack of 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.949
 about 4 thousand chips so a hundred buy a 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.320
 our provision is definitely line 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.230
 standard and I would say inevitable is to opt 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.770
 for a raise the question could be 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:16.020
 how much can you give a canon then two 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.530
 to buy high one for two and a half or a per 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.690
 three 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.760
 I usually do it when I'm not 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:25.659
 the doors open still come into play 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:28.299
 standard for two and a half because I think 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.090
 that an opening too a side too 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:33.520
 small type for two you create too often 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.070
 multi way pots not too much 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.159
 positive then opt for one by one 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.200
 to raise to 100 what to do if 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.479
 paid by a player more or less 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.530
 equal stack then with an actual plus o 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.430
 less similar to ours 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.190
 certainly we would not like to bet for four 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.229
 then maybe be invented having to 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.479
 found our hand also because 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.220
 we would risk making all that fold 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.530
 that we beat and make us invent 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.300
 only from what we are beaten by 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.700
 so my advice is if 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.909
 we were paid to a size that 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.970
 it could vary between 250 and 300 of 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.769
 flatting the three bet not playing 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.239
 only in set mining as it could be 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.560
 do with a pair of six or seven 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.830
 because jack and jacket another type of 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.930
 value but to re-evaluate the spot then 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.120
 post flop in case you arrive 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.890
 in heads up 15 tribe taxes a player 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.630
 from middle position we decided to 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.090
 fall we will find ourselves playing the spot 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.519
 out of position but with a good hand 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.600
 value as jack jack and we will play no 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:36.400
 against a range of four bet to bet fi 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.959
 of the opponent but simply against 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.760
 a range of trivento that we are 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.170
 we could partly grow 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.390
 this causes if for example him 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.799
 had limited copies of 10 or 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.269
 ace ten sweet and it is found for 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.670
 example covered click and on the board 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.170
 we could take many roads of value 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.630
 and instead if we had four bettos 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:58.750
 preflop we will have induced to our funds 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.760
 opponents ultimately on this spot 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.970
 I always recommend playing the various ones 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.890
 street on the board trying not to have to 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.350
 pray and under player and our hand 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.750
 that is, to understand the exact value it has 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.590
 during the various roads try to 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.690
 take as much value as possible 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.100
 it will hardly be three roads 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.959
 most of the time it will be two 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.700
 roads if you think we have the 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.500
 better hand and instead try to 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.209
 lose as little money as possible if 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.920
 also on our low board 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.340
 opponent shoots three bullets 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.069
 always remember 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.230
 that at low buy a three bet plus one 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:34.410
 bet pet pet is very often a synonym 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.150
 especially in the monster point it 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.470
 therefore we must also be willing up 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.120
 board 225 78 to fold to the arriver 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.510
 very often to the third bullet of the 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.510
 our opponent
