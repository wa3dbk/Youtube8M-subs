with them I think some of them might be

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.880 
with them I think some of them might be
a<00:02:06.630> little<00:02:06.750> bit<00:02:06.930> hard<00:02:07.140> for<00:02:07.170> them<00:02:07.409> to

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
a little bit hard for them to

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.740 
a little bit hard for them to
but<00:02:08.520> it's<00:02:08.640> great<00:02:08.819> fun<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.149> do<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.600> together

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
but it's great fun to do it together

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.690 
but it's great fun to do it together
with<00:02:10.140> them<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:11.039> gives<00:02:11.280> them<00:02:11.430> something

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
with them and it gives them something

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.400 
with them and it gives them something
that<00:02:11.910> they<00:02:12.180> can<00:02:12.390> do<00:02:12.540> whenever<00:02:12.810> they're<00:02:13.080> bored
