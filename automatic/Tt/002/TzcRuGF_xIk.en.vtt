00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.040
 my history of authorities that we call 

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:07.900
 thinking 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.570
 I look away from the office paper 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.940
 my look is lost outside for a moment 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.980
 eyes lament this tiny cubicle 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.279
 where I marvel at the pressure of two 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.390
 birds in the sky returned reflection and I 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.670

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.770
 chains that do not let me fly this yes I 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:27.320

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.210
 that does not have life I want to be happy 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.870
 to think 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.870
 to share 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.280
 after giving my life to a needy 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:01:00.440
 silver but it's not my fault just 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.440
 write they said touch it 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.120
 I 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.950
 what 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.210
 and they got their reality they and the 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.920
 I bought the same as most now I know that 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.899
 for them it is only the role of 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:31.060
 consumer because this one is full of 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:32.159
 so much beauty to deliver 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.689
 our life to the market 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.270
 now I know that that system the teachings 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:38.630

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:44.020
 of alcohol 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:46.210
 then one was 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.500
 lets you think a lot of sense 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.660
 critical 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.660
 and more especially because I need 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.840
 that to rediscover the presence 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.680
 to present them to you 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.120

 with nature are the essence of 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.320
 life and finally more valuable presences 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.270
 is that it has 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.270
 that freedom be of the press 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:14.430
 and ready to talk 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.430
 then he mentioned 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:25.650
 and remember yourselves to be 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.650

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:21.870
 to fly trees to climb seas and 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.660
 rivers to navigate birds to dream fish 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.140
 and flowers to color then let's save 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.140
 in the middle 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.280
 but this revolution enough 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.870
 the most primitive animals possess all 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.940
 the same capacity to feel pain that 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.770
 humans and consequently 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.050
 they resist so much pain when their body is 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.600
 hurt but in his case the cruelty 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.190
 Racking is much higher because not 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.470
 they have a mind that explains their 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.960
 suffering and neither hope for 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.300
 how much will he want to endure the last 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.600
