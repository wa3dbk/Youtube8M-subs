so<00:00:22.080> I<00:00:22.109> guess<00:00:22.670> problem<00:00:23.670> number<00:00:23.789> one<00:00:24.119> would<00:00:24.449> have

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
so I guess problem number one would have

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.200 
so I guess problem number one would have
to<00:00:24.900> be<00:00:24.990> getting<00:00:25.260> up<00:00:25.439> on<00:00:25.619> counters<00:00:26.160> in<00:00:26.609> order<00:00:26.970> to

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
to be getting up on counters in order to

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
get yourself some food crap so I guess

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.069

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
the second problem would be making an

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.030 
the second problem would be making an
endless<00:00:40.440> effort<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.219> be<00:00:41.309> taller<00:00:41.719> to<00:00:42.719> no<00:00:42.840> avail
