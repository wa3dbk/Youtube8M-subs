 engine air pump harness fins 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.220
 visor and rubber suit to be able to have 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.240
 a productive workday but 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.240
 also safe

 strongly with the intense blue of the sea 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.939
 rich in animal species that sustain 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.679
 to hundreds of families who live on 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.679
 work in the ocean 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.630
 the abalone banks are in 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.570
 certain areas that meet the 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.119
 temperature characteristics 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.219
 currents and salinity of water but 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:11.890
 above all food abundance 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:11.890
 favorite of the algae abalone 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.550
 once located on the bank of 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.130
 abalone is necessary to start the 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.330
 air pump driven by a small 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.040
 gasoline engine that will allow the diver 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:30.130
 breathe underwater for several hours 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:34.650
 to perform the strenuous labor of 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.650
 the capture of the sea treasure the abalone 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.239
 and the work of identifying and capturing 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.689
 this delicacy of the oceans requires a 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.849
 awesome physical condition in addition to 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:55.849
 nerves of steel and the experience of 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:58.250
 be able to distinguish these creatures that 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:01.220
 they merge in the background in a way 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.319
 extraordinary due to the growth of 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.650
 various plant and animal species 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:10.359
 in their shells and make them get confused 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.359
 with the rest of the seabed 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.060
 the water temperature is freezing and the 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.270
 currents present in the abalone field 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.210
 ero raise sand from the bottom reducing 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.730
 The visibility 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.910
 the work of the diver is so strenuous 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.940
 that in a single day of work you can 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:35.500
 burn thousands of calories that you will have to 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.500
 replenish upon returning home 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.379
 so that this treasure can follow 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.870
 feeding future generations are 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:47.659
 the cooperative museums who more 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.730
 they take care of this resource before 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:52.280
 place it in a bag 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:55.010
 each abalone is measured after being captured 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.799
 and once out of the water each specimen 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.290
 will be reviewed again to make sure 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.959
 that have the right size in case 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.950
 otherwise it will be deposited again in the 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.800
 sea bottom 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:11.430
 it's thanks to the ceilings or limits of 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:14.040
 captures the appropriate size selection and 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.380
 respect for closed seasons as 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:20.530
 this natural resource is conserved 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.320
 once the day is over it's time 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.570
 to take the road back to 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.650
 be downloaded and delivered for your 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.650
 subsequent processing 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:35.770
 the abalone is a treasure of the oceans 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:37.840
 that requires dedication and effort 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.560
 experience of the abalone divers heros 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.719
 who make it possible for this delicacy 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:47.879
 reach the most demanding palates of the 

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:47.879
 world to be enjoyed
