the first thing that you'll notice in

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.150 
the first thing that you'll notice in
the<00:00:08.780> differences<00:00:09.200> of<00:00:09.260> instruments<00:00:09.800> is<00:00:09.980> the

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.160 
the differences of instruments is the

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.220 
the differences of instruments is the
color<00:00:10.430> the<00:00:10.880> actual<00:00:11.240> color<00:00:11.480> of<00:00:11.660> the<00:00:11.809> instrument

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
color the actual color of the instrument

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.960 
color the actual color of the instrument
and<00:00:12.350> that<00:00:12.380> is<00:00:12.650> largely<00:00:13.070> produced<00:00:13.520> by<00:00:13.910> the

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:13.970 
and that is largely produced by the

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.290 
and that is largely produced by the
varnish<00:00:14.389> that's<00:00:14.870> applied<00:00:15.230> to<00:00:15.260> it<00:00:16.150> there<00:00:17.150> will

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
varnish that's applied to it there will

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.210 
varnish that's applied to it there will
be<00:00:17.330> some<00:00:17.660> differences<00:00:18.200> on<00:00:18.439> the<00:00:18.590> undercoat

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
be some differences on the undercoat

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.310 
be some differences on the undercoat
before<00:00:19.759> the<00:00:19.849> varnish<00:00:20.119> has<00:00:20.270> even<00:00:20.540> applied<00:00:20.810> some

before the varnish has even applied some
some<00:00:21.740> woods<00:00:22.009> will<00:00:22.279> have<00:00:22.460> a<00:00:22.489> darker<00:00:22.939> hue<00:00:23.180> than

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
some woods will have a darker hue than

than others but but once they all age

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:28.960 
than others but but once they all age
they<00:00:27.619> darken<00:00:28.040> underneath<00:00:28.489> but<00:00:28.759> this

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
they darken underneath but this

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.770 
they darken underneath but this
instrument<00:00:29.480> is<00:00:30.050> more<00:00:30.290> of<00:00:30.410> a<00:00:30.500> brownish

you'll<00:00:45.620> see<00:00:45.859> that<00:00:46.070> from<00:00:46.280> instrument<00:00:46.640> to

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
you'll see that from instrument to

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.340 
you'll see that from instrument to
instrument<00:00:47.089> as<00:00:47.660> you<00:00:47.780> walk<00:00:47.989> through<00:00:48.230> the

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
instrument as you walk through the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.040 
instrument as you walk through the
exhibit<00:00:48.440> you<00:00:49.010> think<00:00:49.670> that<00:00:49.879> that<00:00:50.480> causes<00:00:50.690> the

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
exhibit you think that that causes the

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.020 
exhibit you think that that causes the
difference<00:00:51.410> are<00:00:51.859> the<00:00:52.160> pigments<00:00:52.699> that<00:00:52.760> are

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
difference are the pigments that are

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.939 
difference are the pigments that are
used<00:00:53.269> in<00:00:53.539> the<00:00:53.629> manufacture<00:00:54.289> of<00:00:54.350> the<00:00:54.620> varnish

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
used in the manufacture of the varnish

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.759 
used in the manufacture of the varnish
when<00:00:55.789> I<00:00:55.820> make<00:00:56.179> you<00:00:56.359> when<00:00:56.539> I<00:00:56.570> make<00:00:56.809> my<00:00:57.050> varnish<00:00:57.469> I

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
when I make you when I make my varnish I

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:00.880 
when I make you when I make my varnish I
have<00:00:58.129> various<00:00:58.640> resins<00:00:59.390> and<00:00:59.690> and<00:01:00.140> gums<00:01:00.469> and

have various resins and and gums and
oils<00:01:01.550> that<00:01:01.850> I<00:01:01.879> in<00:01:02.870> and<00:01:03.140> they<00:01:03.230> will<00:01:03.350> all<00:01:03.559> have<00:01:03.800> an

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
oils that I in and they will all have an

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.820 
oils that I in and they will all have an
inherent<00:01:04.400> color<00:01:04.699> in<00:01:05.000> them<00:01:05.380> the<00:01:06.380> longer<00:01:06.710> you

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
inherent color in them the longer you

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.060 
inherent color in them the longer you
cook<00:01:07.130> your<00:01:07.820> your<00:01:08.210> varnish<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:09.560> deeper<00:01:09.920> the

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
cook your your varnish the deeper the

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.499 
cook your your varnish the deeper the
color<00:01:10.250> will<00:01:10.490> become<00:01:10.880> but<00:01:11.060> then<00:01:11.240> you<00:01:11.329> add

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
color will become but then you add

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:14.319 
color will become but then you add
pigments<00:01:12.229> back<00:01:13.220> in<00:01:13.430> the<00:01:13.549> day<00:01:13.670> of<00:01:13.790> strata<00:01:14.090> berry

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:14.329 
pigments back in the day of strata berry

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:16.749 
pigments back in the day of strata berry
and<00:01:14.479> Guarneri<00:01:14.990> they<00:01:15.439> they<00:01:16.250> went<00:01:16.579> to<00:01:16.670> an

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
and Guarneri they they went to an

and Guarneri they they went to an
apothecary<00:01:17.360> and<00:01:17.630> bought<00:01:17.990> their<00:01:18.229> varnishes

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
apothecary and bought their varnishes

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.999 
apothecary and bought their varnishes
and<00:01:19.280> they<00:01:19.460> bought<00:01:19.640> ground<00:01:20.409> ground<00:01:21.409> pigments

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
and they bought ground ground pigments

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.539 
and they bought ground ground pigments
made<00:01:22.219> from<00:01:22.460> madder<00:01:22.700> root<00:01:22.969> which<00:01:24.460> depending<00:01:25.460> on

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
made from madder root which depending on

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.999 
made from madder root which depending on
on<00:01:25.969> what<00:01:26.270> what<00:01:26.899> you<00:01:27.049> cook<00:01:27.350> the<00:01:27.560> matter<00:01:27.770> route

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
on what what you cook the matter route

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.160 
on what what you cook the matter route
with<00:01:28.219> it<00:01:28.430> will<00:01:28.610> give<00:01:28.790> it<00:01:28.909> a<00:01:29.000> different<00:01:29.299> hue<00:01:29.509> if

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
with it will give it a different hue if

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.940 
with it will give it a different hue if
you<00:01:30.409> if<00:01:30.680> you<00:01:30.799> mix<00:01:31.369> it<00:01:31.549> in<00:01:31.670> with<00:01:31.880> with<00:01:32.810> iron<00:01:33.110> you

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
you if you mix it in with with iron you

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.920 
you if you mix it in with with iron you
will<00:01:34.009> get<00:01:34.189> a<00:01:34.219> retina<00:01:34.610> more<00:01:34.880> red<00:01:35.210> color<00:01:35.570> you

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
will get a retina more red color you

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.690 
will get a retina more red color you
know<00:01:36.200> so<00:01:36.500> if<00:01:36.619> you<00:01:36.740> want<00:01:36.950> a<00:01:37.039> deeper<00:01:37.340> red<00:01:37.549> you

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
know so if you want a deeper red you

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.969 
know so if you want a deeper red you
will<00:01:37.820> you<00:01:38.329> will<00:01:38.450> precipitate<00:01:38.960> the<00:01:39.409> color<00:01:39.649> of

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
will you will precipitate the color of

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.590 
will you will precipitate the color of
the<00:01:40.700> matter<00:01:40.909> root<00:01:41.180> with<00:01:41.570> with<00:01:42.500> a<00:01:42.649> with<00:01:43.009> an<00:01:43.280> iron

and<00:01:46.620> you<00:01:47.620> know<00:01:47.740> 10<00:01:48.040> will<00:01:48.400> give<00:01:48.640> a<00:01:48.670> different

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
and you know 10 will give a different

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.490 
and you know 10 will give a different
color<00:01:49.150> all<00:01:49.420> kinds<00:01:49.780> of<00:01:49.840> different<00:01:50.140> colors<00:01:50.470> in

color all kinds of different colors in
there<00:01:50.920> and<00:01:51.220> then<00:01:51.520> you<00:01:51.940> you<00:01:52.330> mix<00:01:52.570> the<00:01:52.810> you<00:01:53.680> mix

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
there and then you you mix the you mix

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.240 
there and then you you mix the you mix
the<00:01:55.150> pigments<00:01:55.630> into<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:56.080> varnish<00:01:56.470> themselves

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
the pigments into the varnish themselves

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.910 
the pigments into the varnish themselves
and<00:01:57.670> they<00:01:57.970> suspend<00:01:58.630> in<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:59.080> varnish<00:01:59.440> so<00:01:59.710> as

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
and they suspend in the varnish so as

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.010 
and they suspend in the varnish so as
you<00:02:00.070> apply<00:02:00.370> it<00:02:00.460> and<00:02:00.820> it<00:02:01.150> becomes<00:02:01.390> darker<00:02:01.840> and

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
you apply it and it becomes darker and

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.560 
you apply it and it becomes darker and
darker<00:02:02.170> if<00:02:02.680> you<00:02:03.010> want<00:02:03.250> to<00:02:03.460> have<00:02:03.670> a<00:02:03.700> have<00:02:04.330> more
