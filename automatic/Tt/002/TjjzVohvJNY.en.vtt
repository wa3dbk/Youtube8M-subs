00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:08.290
 I made majorque that I had 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:10.870
 the opportunity to interview for bridge 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.090
 eco a woman who had built her 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.420
 yurt holding it herself from another 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.700
 women 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.579
 and that was the click even so low I 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.289
 can do that and it was wonderful 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:22.179
 what 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.589
 here I am I go to the act 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:25.859
 sequence of jerseys I made 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:25.859
 shirt 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.040
 well 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.340
 this need for autonomy of realization of 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.710
 capacity 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.190
 and then to be in being in this 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.500
 movement to be very concretely in 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.570
 this movement of transformation of the world 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.280
 that was the effort that I was 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.730
 did and jallet and I lived this 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.140
 source 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.140
 several times a small piece 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.220
 it's easy 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.899
 simple actions in cutting wood on 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.800
 the loses his assembly makes knots 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.559
 with strings 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.480
 it's simple it's simple that's what 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.080
 is nice when I do it myself 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.810
 so just the materials roughly speaking I 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.300
 think I was less than 1000 euros 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.860
 with recycling with recycling 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.650
 example and the roof poles are 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.030
 bamboo recover 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.590
 that's what was recovered on 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.630
 rest was bought the canvases do not come 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.190
 on 6 the wall insulators and the 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.190
 blanket cover at emmaÃ¼s 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.360
 have to think about st storage when we 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.930
 do not use it has to be 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.220
 really safe from moisture and that 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.000
 it's difficult the star when they 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.710
 are folded away from the moisture of 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.700
 mouse the mice just made their 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.530
 nest so we'll see that me and then he 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.840
 must also plan to have to redo 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.090
 the canvas of you for example every 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.170
 five years the people who sold me 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.770
 the star told me that we need them 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.960
 treat 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.840
 we defend just show the roof and we 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.090
 pass a product every three years 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.009
 prolongs the life time here is there is a 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.880
 post- cantat management is not 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.299
 mounted and even when she climbed 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.299
 anyway 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.920
 she has lyon you are considered a 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.310
 so we do not have the right to live 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.560
 a tent in the year so here is 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.940
 people can not even live 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:19.360
 this is own yurt on his land 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.700
 so there is case law that has 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.910
 helped trial sentenced him to 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.910
 jurisprudences that do that ben times 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.720
 it's more or less tolerated accepted there and 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.040
 then sailing to invisibility finally we 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.910
 do you manage to stop using 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.910
 bits of string for now 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.099
 it's something that's reassuring 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.260
 for me it's easy to do it's a 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.209
 interior realization also mom get 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.680
 build by building his entry on 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.760
 is coming to meet lots of 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.709
 people because we do not do it alone 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.849
 of course people who know the 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.750
 plans there is someone who will lend a 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.370
 sewing machine 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.950
 we will go pick up bamboo 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.810
 together we can we can do together 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.700
 things to do pieces we go 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.069
 make the crown together and this thing a 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.769
 little technical but that we learn in 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.019
 like that by sharing me I find that 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.400
 This is a beautiful habitat does 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.590
 I did not say it's just inside 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.910
 it is a very very particular energy 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.459
 is the energy of the circle is 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.410
 the energy of the nose in 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.560
 I also like being linked to this 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:24.870
 nomadism of mongolia is something 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.870
 something that makes sense to me too
