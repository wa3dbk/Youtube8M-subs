00:00:00.451 --> 00:00:05.001
 (Soft music) 

00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:06.170
 Hi friends, I'm Ebril. 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.650
 Thanks for following up today. 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.910
 We will prepare the Green Radiant Samothi 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.150
 Which you will find described in the book "Beauty Detox Solochon." 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.850
 I have advised my friend Crystal to use it. 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.170
 She had great skin, so she had to discover her secret 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.790
 Are in fact at the stage of the day so and 80 writers 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.951
 And the use of irradiated green sapiens 

00:00:24.951 --> 00:00:26.330
 Her skin is wonderful 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.411
 Looks like radiant shine from the inside I want 

00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:30.210
 To become like her, I want to be like that. 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.950
 So I started this and it is my second day. 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.210
 I hope you will try it and continue this experience with me. 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.530
 The reason for the use of irradiated green sapiens is 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.151
 It is very useful to you because it is nutritious. 

00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:43.571
 Contains all these vegetables. 

00:00:43.571 --> 00:00:45.250
 Vegetables and fruits. 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.130
 It saves the body from toxins because it 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.931
 Rich in fiber. 

00:00:50.931 --> 00:00:53.731
 You will end up with your skin becoming radiant, 

00:00:53.731 --> 00:00:56.191
 Your nails will become stronger, and your hair will be brighter 

00:00:56.191 --> 00:00:58.890
 You will have more energy and you will lose weight as well 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.151
 Because the radioactive sapathy is very rich in fiber. 

00:01:02.151 --> 00:01:04.571
 Please take it as a daily breakfast with me. 

00:01:04.571 --> 00:01:07.320
 Let us start by setting up the bright green samurai together 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.711
 First you have to cut half the fruit of a lemon 

00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:12.911
 Put it aside and cut it into small slices 

00:01:12.911 --> 00:01:14.250
 For lemon juice. 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.811
 Then cut some apples. 

00:01:16.811 --> 00:01:18.890
 It does not matter what kind of apples as long as it's organic 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.251
 Free from chemicals 

00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:21.931
 One apple is enough. 

00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:26.521
 Then cut the pear fruit, and make sure it is washed and also organic. 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.761
 "Voice chopping" 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.711
 Then they cut back the French celery or celery 

00:01:32.711 --> 00:01:35.791
 "Voice chopping" 

00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:38.370
 They put apples, pears and celery in a bowl 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.270
 We will use them later. 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.570
 We start with a cup and a half of water 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.750
 And the head of organic lettuce 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.440
 You can use a bunch of lettuce 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.970
 Then add some organic spinach leaves 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.060
 Usually add two handfuls. 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.401
 Once you add the spinach, run the mixer at low speed. 

00:02:03.371 --> 00:02:05.351
 And mix. 

00:02:05.351 --> 00:02:08.151
 (Mixer sound) 

00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:10.940
 Then add the celery 

00:02:11.111 --> 00:02:14.240
 Pear and apple 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.050
 And mix 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.230
 (Mixer sound) 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.340
 Then add the banana fruit 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.851
 And mix 

00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:33.450
 (Mixer sound) 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.800
 And some of the Macedonians 

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:41.581
 Then add some graft 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.050
 Then stir the lemon 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.441
 Semi-lemon juice in Samothi. 

00:02:50.271 --> 00:02:51.830
 Then re-mix. 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.150
 (Mixer sound) 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.371
 If you are just starting this detox program 

00:02:58.371 --> 00:03:01.091
 The first time you try the Green Radiant Samothy 

00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:04.341
 Start with about a pint. 

00:03:04.482 --> 00:03:08.312
 (Music blaring) 

00:03:08.802 --> 00:03:11.002
 I love the weight of things 

00:03:11.002 --> 00:03:15.372
 (Music blaring) 

00:03:16.421 --> 00:03:19.152
 So start with a quantity like this 

00:03:20.522 --> 00:03:23.542
 Which fills Cuba almost like this. 

00:03:23.542 --> 00:03:26.221
 Because you have more, you can save the remaining amount 

00:03:26.221 --> 00:03:30.222
 In an airtight container in order to get 

00:03:30.222 --> 00:03:32.492
 On your breakfast the next day. 

00:03:35.361 --> 00:03:37.841
 You can put it in a cup with a blower if you are on the road 

00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:41.481
 And drink from it on your way to work 

00:03:41.481 --> 00:03:43.081
 This will help a lot. 

00:03:43.081 --> 00:03:44.782
 Thanks for watching 

00:03:44.782 --> 00:03:45.862
 Happy day. 

00:03:45.862 --> 00:03:48.512
 Bye. 

00:03:53.282 --> 00:03:58.282
