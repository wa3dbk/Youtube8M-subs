00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
quite cool trick it's got quite a cool

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.089 
quite cool trick it's got quite a cool
effect<00:03:00.569> to<00:03:00.989> it<00:03:01.019> because<00:03:01.290> their<00:03:01.439> cards<00:03:01.769> seem<00:03:01.950> to

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
effect to it because their cards seem to

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.330 
effect to it because their cards seem to
just<00:03:02.250> spin<00:03:03.000> out<00:03:03.120> from<00:03:03.389> nowhere<00:03:03.859> in<00:03:04.859> that<00:03:04.920> you

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
just spin out from nowhere in that you

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.979 
just spin out from nowhere in that you
seem<00:03:05.519> to<00:03:05.639> have<00:03:05.670> got<00:03:05.849> there<00:03:06.030> on<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.480> wrong<00:03:06.689> card

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
seem to have got there on the wrong card

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.129 
seem to have got there on the wrong card
and<00:03:07.260> and<00:03:07.609> then<00:03:08.609> it<00:03:08.700> always<00:03:08.970> works<00:03:09.209> out<00:03:09.420> fine<00:03:09.689> so

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
and and then it always works out fine so

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:12.110
