00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
is gonna be easy to only put on new hard

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.440 
is gonna be easy to only put on new hard
drive<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.740> then<00:02:52.820> work<00:02:53.820> on<00:02:54.030> that

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
drive and then work on that

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.310 
drive and then work on that
but<00:02:54.810> first<00:02:55.710> the<00:02:55.980> hard<00:02:56.190> drive<00:02:56.400> is<00:02:56.580> a<00:02:57.170> little<00:02:58.170> bit

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
but first the hard drive is a little bit

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.580 
but first the hard drive is a little bit
expensive<00:02:58.700> and<00:02:59.700> there<00:03:00.630> is<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.780> connector

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
expensive and there is a connector

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.500 
expensive and there is a connector
everything<00:03:02.010> is<00:03:02.130> different<00:03:02.340> from<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.970> regular

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
everything is different from the regular

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.580 
everything is different from the regular
