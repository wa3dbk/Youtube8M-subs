 it is the first time we came with tonino they took pictures of us 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:51.310
 I have dilapidated houses where pieces of history were hiding 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.870
 by history I mean jacket old photographs on the ground 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.620

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:10.080

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.670
 which is exactly on a street 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.149

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.930
 in short, we have the civilization of gaudo paestum artea 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:40.070
 funky district 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.350
 so this year of isthmica started as paestum 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:52.180
 and greetings by going through a link to furnish the mountain above, not on 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.850
 whose summit there was 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.329

 enrico whose texts here are in the bristol uk museum 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:16.179
 so he went on 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:19.659
 was the point of union between% 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:21.469
 my name is ionio 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:23.059
 ok the tirreno 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:25.559
 so point where Greeks 

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:29.069
 passerby again of cult trade 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.819
 fuckin huge importance from this point of view 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.439
 because then avis torino our first Arabs that in short 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:42.080

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:45.699
 precisely from Greece or Apennine peoples 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.629
 so come back here 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.639
 review these cafe's art cafe de paris au gonow structure 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.359
 at the beginning of the last century 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:58.749
 so you have a group of kendal houses 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:02.159
 noooo from the mountain and precisely soprano 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.799
 i pass on the grass ridge it hurts me from important thing is that this again 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:11.079
 after so many years of oblivion, a toxic substance was re-evaluated 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.859
 and nothing we came quark ciscam 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.280
 na ten years ago 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.140
 that face but these photographs we propose them to the park echo in their and i 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.809
 yes director 

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:24.809
 please nicoletta 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.959
 which in short he liked also this I can do - he could 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.689
 be a place for quintile craft artists 

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:36.829
 today 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.430
 I repeat it is a wonder to see it restored because they are scandicci 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:42.889
 12 drawers 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.289
 and nothing aye siii 

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:46.079
 I 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.749
 oo that stops by bomb squad 

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:51.749
 of all this that looked like a pill 

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:57.859
 because today a project has been offered to the park 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.799
 b art and science environment on the territory 

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:08.029
 I do not know if we say this will be taken into consideration I hope so 

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:13.210
 key as then it was my love that this dream continues past 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.969
 to be able to re-evaluate the whole territory 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:19.209
 I know that for this territory 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.979
 let's say this term art and science may seem a paradox I can 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:25.099
 buy a thing 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:26.379
 and the other world 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:30.050
 but I must say that the arts and sciences 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.559
 does not seem to you in unison 

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:36.699
 if he speaks of the Greeks and this is a Greek territory of makeup 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.719
 we talk about Leonardo 

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:43.309
 sipa we want to help our days let's say scrolling we talk about 

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:46.459
 Impressionism when Impressionism anticipated 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.270
 the licks scientific discoveries 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.110
 lately we are talking about the fountain of the black holes of fountain that they have 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.809
 anticipated black holes 

00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:58.870
 free universe 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.750
 so I mean art and science have always got along samantha tese 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.610
 walk spaak art as a moment's feeling the giving science 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.650
 answers 3 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.270
 so this ooohhh let's say mikx 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.949
 and let's say another 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:20.909
 there is something always called forward and pussies have always gone 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:23.620
 very valid 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.009
 so I have this is my project 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:31.710
 who sells I hope it can be carried on that would be one thing 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.369
 beautiful in plaster also because the problem of these places of art such as 

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:37.350
 are these 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.500
 hemingway of a house that is scattered throughout the Cilento area 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.190
 problem is to make them usable the old example stone for many years 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.290
 subjected to a renovation still is not 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:54.910
 fully usable here has passed less time split intervened more quickly 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.570
 and who knows that maybe with just as much speed you can't make it usable 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:59.650
 this heritage 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:05.550
 I hope so now I wish it many times we find the catch a belle and it is 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:11.900
 the politics around I hope that this can be overcome by entering 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.789
 all my good will because I really wish 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:18.240
 a development of mine for this territory. 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.869
 and we hope it's so sweet 

00:06:19.869 --> 00:06:24.209
 thanks to the black car artist and president of the probe association 

00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:27.659
