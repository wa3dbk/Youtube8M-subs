00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hello to all guys well found by 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.529
 francesco siciliani for a new video 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.160
 branded iphoneitalia.com new focus for 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.420
 apple watch 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.800
 let's see how it works 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.800
 have the application over 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.760
 yes I noticed that on apple watch 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.400
 unfortunately it is missing at least in this first 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.309
 wushu s version of the application of 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.680
 notes present on iphone ipod and mac 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.840
 so how to use les paul 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.390
 walker view notes with evernote 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.150
 an application that we have several times 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.309
 shown on iphoneitalia is also on 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.600
 our blog iphoneitalia.com we go to 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.879
 see how it works on apple watch 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.650
 then we will immediately have the 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.390
 recently viewed notes though 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.520
 we could also search in 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.309
 vocal way we will tell you later we can 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.230
 going to press the button creates one 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.260
 new note take to write a note 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.449
 now I have recorded this video before 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.979
 now I'm saying adding the audio 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.300
 so you can't hear the word not 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.780
 try again write a text 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.310
 dictating from the paul watson though 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.860
 practically helped we say the 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.509
 voice dictation to write the 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.020
 our proof that also comes 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.369
 added to the newly created section 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.250
 now let's try the research 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.080
 vocal so we write for example spin 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.500
 globe to search for all related notes 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.360
 the film lab in evernote is indeed 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.490
 we find so in a few seconds way 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.590
 very simple all the notes we are 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.049
 going to search we can scroll 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.060
 between the notes, open them and display them 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.070
 go back in short, go to 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.470
 always find what we need 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.420
 let's try again with another term of 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.390
 search for example let's try writing 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.610
 fantasy I should have a note on 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.890
 fantasy football with a summary of goals 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.170
 ok then our voice dictation 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.909
 it works very well there is no 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.979
 problem we also tried with a 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.020
 another term so everything works 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.600
 it is not true and true 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.340
 very very nice to use in 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.960
 this way there is also an option with the 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.519
 falstaff that allows us to go to 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.590
 add a new route or make a 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.269
 research in short, as there are already the two 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.130
 buttons at the top 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.870
 good guys with this bet us 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.760
 we have finished I thank you for 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.740
 Having followed this video, don't miss it 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.450
 the others focus on apple watch 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.330
 analyze again something that is not 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:28.100
 been told and nothing we meet again then 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.100
