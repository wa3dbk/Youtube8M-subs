it's nice and stiff and very lightweight
and<00:00:30.529> I<00:00:31.529> just<00:00:33.470> kind<00:00:34.470> of<00:00:34.530> had<00:00:34.650> to<00:00:34.680> piece<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.010> a

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
and I just kind of had to piece it a

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.180 
and I just kind of had to piece it a
little<00:00:35.490> bit<00:00:35.670> because<00:00:36.710> they<00:00:37.710> want<00:00:37.949> the<00:00:38.010> same

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
little bit because they want the same

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.630 
little bit because they want the same
science<00:00:38.730> but<00:00:39.600> either<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:40.020> rubber<00:00:40.530> cement<00:00:40.860> or

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
science but either a rubber cement or

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.520 
science but either a rubber cement or
sprain<00:00:42.510> ISA<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.699> glue<00:00:44.699> them<00:00:44.879> together<00:00:45.530> okay

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
sprain ISA and glue them together okay

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.020 
sprain ISA and glue them together okay
until<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.070> have<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.640> have<00:00:47.850> six<00:00:48.440> panels<00:00:51.559> green

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
until you have I have six panels green

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.020 
until you have I have six panels green
stick<00:00:54.030> from

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.240 

I<00:00:58.680> know<00:00:59.680> I<00:00:59.950> took<00:01:00.160> two<00:01:01.030> panels<00:01:01.570> and<00:01:02.100> taped<00:01:03.100> them

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
I know I took two panels and taped them

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.840 
I know I took two panels and taped them
together<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:05.140> I<00:01:05.199> can<00:01:05.410> fold<00:01:05.650> it<00:01:05.860> up<00:01:06.010> and<00:01:06.040> put<00:01:06.280> it

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
together so I can fold it up and put it

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.080 
together so I can fold it up and put it
away<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.960> same<00:01:08.229> thing<00:01:08.560> with<00:01:09.400> another<00:01:09.580> set<00:01:10.060> of

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
away the same thing with another set of

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.350 
away the same thing with another set of
tooth<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:11.560> these<00:01:11.830> two<00:01:12.190> can<00:01:12.550> fold<00:01:12.850> up<00:01:13.030> became

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
tooth so these two can fold up became

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.460 
tooth so these two can fold up became
2/3<00:01:13.840> because<00:01:14.830> it<00:01:15.190> won't<00:01:15.400> fold<00:01:15.729> flat<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:17.140> two

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
2/3 because it won't fold flat so two

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:25.200 
2/3 because it won't fold flat so two
sets<00:01:17.770> of<00:01:17.950> that<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:19.420> then<00:01:20.550> two<00:01:21.550> more<00:01:24.210> loose

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
sets of that and then two more loose

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.859 
sets of that and then two more loose
ones<00:01:25.600> so<00:01:26.530> we<00:01:26.650> can<00:01:26.940> stack<00:01:27.940> it<00:01:28.090> all<00:01:28.180> and<00:01:28.570> put<00:01:28.630> it

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
ones so we can stack it all and put it

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.499 
ones so we can stack it all and put it
away<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.979> when<00:01:30.640> you're<00:01:30.790> ready<00:01:30.970> to<00:01:31.180> use<00:01:31.210> it

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
away and when you're ready to use it

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.040 
away and when you're ready to use it
again<00:01:31.780> you<00:01:32.080> will<00:01:33.070> put<00:01:33.369> it<00:01:33.460> together<00:01:33.610> with<00:01:34.149> book

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
again you will put it together with book

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:44.219

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
you can use for small projects and for
