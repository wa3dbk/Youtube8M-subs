00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
the bowl and it's easiest if you

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
little container rather than crushing up

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.279 
little container rather than crushing up
in<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.430> bowl<00:00:56.640> but<00:00:56.879> I'm<00:00:57.059> just<00:00:57.149> taking<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.690> to

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.849 
again to crush it up I'm also taking the
spatula<00:01:01.050> but<00:01:01.170> it's<00:01:01.289> really<00:01:01.410> easy<00:01:01.620> if<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:01.829> use

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
spatula but it's really easy if you use

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.009 
spatula but it's really easy if you use
a<00:01:01.980> spoon<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.609> crush<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:03.000> up<00:01:03.059> as<00:01:03.239> well<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:03.899> now

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
a spoon to crush it up as well so now

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.810 
a spoon to crush it up as well so now

I'm taking my moisturizer and squeezing

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.609 
I'm taking my moisturizer and squeezing
in<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.090> little<00:01:06.450> bit<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.840> I'm<00:01:06.990> just<00:01:07.200> mixing<00:01:07.409> it

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
in a little bit and I'm just mixing it

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.950 
in a little bit and I'm just mixing it
up<00:01:07.740> with<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.490> eyeshadow<00:01:08.970> until<00:01:09.630> I<00:01:09.659> get<00:01:09.869> the

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
up with the eyeshadow until I get the

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:18.030 
up with the eyeshadow until I get the
right<00:01:10.049> consistency

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.100 

as<00:01:19.040> you<00:01:19.820> can<00:01:19.970> see<00:01:20.119> here<00:01:20.360> I<00:01:20.390> had<00:01:20.570> to<00:01:20.750> add<00:01:20.810> in<00:01:21.020> a

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
as you can see here I had to add in a

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.929 
as you can see here I had to add in a
little<00:01:21.140> bit<00:01:21.350> more<00:01:21.590> moisturizer<00:01:22.250> because<00:01:22.670> I

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
little bit more moisturizer because I

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:24.789 
little bit more moisturizer because I
thought<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.659> consistency<00:01:24.380> is<00:01:24.470> a<00:01:24.500> little<00:01:24.710> bit

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
thought the consistency is a little bit

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.130 
thought the consistency is a little bit
too<00:01:24.979> powdery<00:01:25.369> and<00:01:25.549> then<00:01:26.360> I'm<00:01:26.600> just<00:01:26.899> making

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
too powdery and then I'm just making

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.480 
too powdery and then I'm just making
sure<00:01:27.200> the<00:01:27.320> consistency<00:01:27.799> is<00:01:27.920> right<00:01:28.130> and<00:01:28.369> I'm

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
sure the consistency is right and I'm

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.149 
sure the consistency is right and I'm
just<00:01:28.520> scraping<00:01:29.360> up<00:01:29.689> all<00:01:29.960> of<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:30.590> mixture<00:01:30.770> and

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
just scraping up all of the mixture and

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:32.950 
just scraping up all of the mixture and
I'm<00:01:31.280> just<00:01:31.490> putting<00:01:31.789> it<00:01:32.000> back<00:01:32.180> into<00:01:32.659> the<00:01:32.780> little

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
I'm just putting it back into the little

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.020 
I'm just putting it back into the little
container<00:01:33.289> and<00:01:33.590> pressing<00:01:33.950> it<00:01:34.039> down<00:01:34.070> with<00:01:34.820> a

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
container and pressing it down with a

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.380 
container and pressing it down with a
very<00:01:35.450> small<00:01:35.990> spoon<00:01:36.530> and<00:01:37.490> then<00:01:37.970> I'm<00:01:38.060> taking<00:01:38.179> the

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390
