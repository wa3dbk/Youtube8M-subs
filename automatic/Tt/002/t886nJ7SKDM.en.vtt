and my quad angle i dug out of a junk
pile<00:01:57.509> when<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.899> was<00:01:58.049> about<00:01:58.259> 13<00:01:58.740> years<00:01:58.770> old<00:01:59.130> I

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
pile when I was about 13 years old I

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.310 
pile when I was about 13 years old I
didn't<00:02:01.200> know<00:02:01.290> what<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.710> was<00:02:01.890> at<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.310> time<00:02:03.320> but

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.819 
didn't know what it was at the time but
I<00:02:04.409> like<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.799> design<00:02:05.130> of<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:06.020> I'm<00:02:07.020> glad<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.409> did

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
I like the design of it I'm glad I did

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.400 
I like the design of it I'm glad I did
because<00:02:08.239> there<00:02:09.239> aren't<00:02:09.479> very<00:02:09.629> many<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:10.259> these

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
because there aren't very many of these

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.130 
because there aren't very many of these
