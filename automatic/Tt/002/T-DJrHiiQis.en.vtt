00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 hello everyone welcome today we are in 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.440
 the special one is on the balcony 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.429
 taking advantage of this one is lawful let's 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.780
 paint with template last week 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.230
 paint some shirts with a template and 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.039
 how I was going to be in the end I got 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.160
 then he is listening to something with the 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:24.010
 noise but good at the end I got 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:28.660
 that will stay very well and is to teach 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:32.009
 how it has been good we continue to prepare 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.009
 the table for 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:39.750
 for what they are going to do and as in the 

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:39.750
 tripod design as the voice for it 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.030
 I have an increasing staff 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.630
 I will now teach how the 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.030
 shirts for you to see 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.490
 this is the template that we use that 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.450
 cardboard we use that of a box of 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:25.899
 cereals of mercadona so nothing is 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.630
 very finite very easy to cut and allows 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:29.679
 tiny details then so that you 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.200
 you will be fine in a good carton 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:34.200
 when you have cardboard to believe them 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:47.160
 let's use first to paint 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:49.260
 footpegs and we will mount 94 9% 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.660
 power that you want me to be the one 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.890
 used because it has a matte finish and 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.630
 It is low pressure is easier to 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.380
 control when throwing the spray 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.050
 OK 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.030
 and the second is a wait positioner 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.260
 it's a glue that what it does is that 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.290
 you can place and 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.750
 place and remove the template of your 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:14.480
 site and it stays while you do not 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.850
 he wants to shake it goes very well does not leave 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.590
 waste is a wonder 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.810
 technique was used from this then the 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.030
 description I will put all the 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.150
 used materials that we can 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.769
 use is a paper 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.640
 with a little texture of ours without 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:33.480
 get to see why it is in the shade 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.390
 good has a little bit of texture 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.430
 Y 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.050
 will be a little better to do 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.200
 the box in question 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:45.980
 ok then we have chosen a little 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:49.190
 the taste does not matter if it is better than it is 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:53.950
 a little more because the 'rating' to soak 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:56.620
 and it better be a little thicker 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.920
 then before it was a corner so that 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.920
 move 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.520
 We take the fixative spray we give it a 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.940
 little but practically nothing 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.760
 around a little bit I will not know by 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.560
 what 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.560
 do not worry it's nothing a little 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.260
 we already have to know a little bit 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.489
 we want to know why you have to leave it 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.489
 since he does not have 15 seconds 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.630
 once we have it with the site 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.630
 we stick a little bit of everything 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:04:02.510
 it's like a glue is glue itself 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:05.430
 but then when you finish painting 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.730
 We can we can remove it in any 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.730
 moment 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.340
 and then what does not leave no waste 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.830
 Stains the paper and stains the surface 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.359
 where we do not want them to stay for 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:20.130
 that we have thrown in the template 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.130
 we have thrown in him 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.050
 we have not been on paper 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.600
 well on paper is much simpler and 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.030
 also why 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.300
 it's a totally flat position but 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:37.370
 to avoid t-shirts or painted the 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:40.610
 seen why type of surface that does not 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.190
 but it is curved in the wall or 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.470
 anything of those is better to use 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.479
 the previously positioner so you 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.600
 make sure it does not slip through any 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:49.600
 part 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:56.330
 if good part rises with super is 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:05:00.729
 a little bit with your fingers that some 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.729
 bad to get dirty does not happen anything is going 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.380
 how far you have to throw this 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:16.730
 to give for what then 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.730
 I'm not seeing what it is 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.840
 let's take a little here 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.840
 corners so it does not stain the paper 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.550
 raising the vision a little bit 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:35.260
 when the three will be discussed 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.850
 I'm watching during the march living 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:40.170
 whether it covers or not depends on distance in the 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.170
 that you are then 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:50.169
 and everything 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.169
 do not hurry if you see that soaks paris 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.840
 does not always have the pull as little 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.550
 to little 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.669
 is that I'm pulling and I'm paying the 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.669
 time 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:30.120
 Y 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:32.180
 Well, this is what you see, 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.290
 everything well covered I will take the camera 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.230
 As you can see, everything is well covered 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:40.910
 ok we will be listening to something because 

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.910
 A truck goes down the street of course 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:46.660
 what we do is remove the template 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.370
 again on the tripod and so I can 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.639
 remove both hands because if I do not go 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:50.639
 to roll 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:54.730
 you see it costs a bit to remove 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.650
 because the glue has made it 

00:06:54.730 --> 00:07:00.139
 is totally the subject has enjoyed 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:02.120
 it's magic you erase 

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:03.499
 if you have to do several what you have 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.870
 what to do is let it dry a little 

00:07:03.499 --> 00:07:09.310
 do not paint directly because 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:12.080
 but it will soak a lot and cardboard and you will finish 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:14.990
 spoiling the template better leave it 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.900
 it is clear the template has has a 

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:20.870
 life is worth x times you can 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:23.060
 paint with her but let's see what you say the 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.280
 life of the template yes 

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:27.610
 if you let take between the 3 painted and 

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.610
 painted 

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:49.539
 good and with and with this because it is already 

00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:49.810
 to sign and deliver to its owner and little 

00:07:49.539 --> 00:07:51.759
 plus 

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:53.680
 I hope it has been helpful achieved 

00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:56.680
 do 

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:59.350
 at the time of making template either in 

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:01.870
 base shirt on paper 

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:06.100
 you can little older with the landscape 

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:08.980
 Oriolan and I hope I'm going through a 

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:11.340
 hot day like mine come to us 

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.340
 we see
