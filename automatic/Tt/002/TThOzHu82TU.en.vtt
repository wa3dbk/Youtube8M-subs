00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.130 
kind of like my pre-workout I um it's
actually<00:02:29.190> um<00:02:29.430> branched<00:02:30.240> chain<00:02:30.390> amino<00:02:30.420> acid

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
actually um branched chain amino acid

since<00:02:31.350> it's<00:02:31.500> called<00:02:31.680> amino<00:02:32.040> energy<00:02:32.540> but<00:02:33.540> it's

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
since it's called amino energy but it's

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.360 
since it's called amino energy but it's
not<00:02:33.810> just<00:02:33.990> a<00:02:34.170> branched<00:02:34.470> chain<00:02:34.620> amino<00:02:34.650> acids

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
not just a branched chain amino acids

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.220 
not just a branched chain amino acids
it's<00:02:35.640> on<00:02:36.150> my<00:02:36.270> head<00:02:36.390> some<00:02:36.600> other<00:02:36.780> shit<00:02:36.990> in<00:02:37.110> there
