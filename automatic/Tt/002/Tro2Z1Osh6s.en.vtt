 so that they begin to soak 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.720
 the chiles have to be removed well 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.780

 Well, I'm going to wash the wand well 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:44.400
 to put it in a pot to cook 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.250
 I have here the pot ready with water 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.520
 already hot, well, I'm going to put the 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.060
 meat in here 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.570
 we are going to put four cloves of garlic 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.690
 here inside the pot a little bit of 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.620
 salt to start 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:07.590
 to consume it in the flesh 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:11.520
 and in the end we put whatever it takes 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:15.050
 according to your taste of each person 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:17.050
 the caldito is almost ready 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.160
 and the meat 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.080
 Well, it's a bit short 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.570
 but right now what I'm going to do is 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.220
 put the Chinese to boil and 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:30.540
 finish cooking the meat 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.840
 I have the chilies in the blender here 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:38.390
 with the species 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:42.900
 and I'm going to put a teaspoon of 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:46.080
 consommé of the swedish nord already know that to me 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.780
 I like to put all the meals not 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.110
 Swiss once or twice that my mom 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.480
 He told me to put the meals not 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.540
 Swiss that tasted great is not 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.739
 curly nord tomato and now I'm sure 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.920
 be sharing if you do not want to put 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:08.120
 you do not need two cloves of garlic 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.099
 I'm going to put it big here 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.099
 Now let's liquefy it 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.250
 I 'm also going to add a little bit of 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.790
 cornstarch flour 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:26.330
 you can also put flour flour 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:30.120
 this is just going to be for the broth 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:33.300
 Help him a little bit and give him a little 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:36.420
 of thickness nothing else in the end they're going to 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.430
 look that it will not be like atole is 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.209
 that nothing else that's why we need like 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.209
 a teaspoon 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:53.040
 here it takes two cloves of garlic 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:55.950
 the species and a spoonful of flour 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.990
 of cornstarch to give you a little bit of 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.600
 thickness to the broth 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:04.410
 well let's empty I have the 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:08.030
 Strainer in pieces do not like to call 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.030
 let's put it carefully 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:17.489
 Well now you have to hang it well and 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.819
 return it 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:23.270
 we already put the chile looks good 

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:27.050
 very rich and smells 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:31.849
 delicious here I have the onion and the 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:34.430
 tomatillo and the two laurel leaves are 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:37.849
 I'm going to put it in here a lot in 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:40.879
 mexico what we use or what we used 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:43.220
 is in mexico we put a little we 

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:49.819
 believe a little bit created us already saying with a 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:51.650
 type tuna in which they have thorns but 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:55.550
 instead of the game it's not that I 'm going to 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:05:00.080
 replace with some tomatitos like this my 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:02.210
 mom told us where there is not this 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:06.000
 little believe us here yes there is but it is very 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:09.880
 hard to find it I'm going to put some 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.160
 tomatillo halves 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:16.000
 the onion also I'm not going to put it 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:18.420
 here I will add the two sheets of 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.420
 laurel 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.500
 to boil everything together and you know 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:28.310
 As I always tell you, the salt will be 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:30.040
 taste of each person so I in 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.220
 half whole 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:37.540
 because I'm big I'm going to put him but 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:42.100
 well but I'll also approve him already 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:44.410
 boiling with everything to see if so for 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.700
 I think it's good salt or I put a 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:49.580
 a little more 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.950
 and right now we will wait for that thing 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:55.310
 a little more the meat is missing very 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:59.810
 little bit but let's leave it while 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:01.849
 it boils but that makes a rich broth 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.149
 spine 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:07.800
 I had my way because every person 

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:10.710
 we do in a different way 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:13.100
 as you want, you have to share them 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.950
 or otherwise 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:18.770
 this is this I share with you 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:21.580
 That's my way of preparing broth 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:25.610
 backbone and hopefully and that you like 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:30.860
 cooking with marias with all the love and 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:34.310
 all the taste as always preparing 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:37.160
 my rich recipes already know cooking with 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:40.960
 marian, do not leave me alone to give me 

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:45.530
 more encouragement and always say that I like 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:48.170
 or share subscribe if I go to 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:51.200
 let it boil you do not have to prepare 

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:54.470
 a rich lonely rice that is no longer 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:57.440
 I'm going to show them because I already know 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:07:01.690
 I showed earlier 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:03.130
 and so we're going to prepare it so that 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:07.760
 share it 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:09.920
 with the backbone caldito, so 

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:13.250
 let's wait for this rich to arrive 

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:16.220
 broth for after the model comes to 

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:18.650
 try it cooking with Maria we come back in 

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:22.160
 a while 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:27.050
 I already have the broth dish here 

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:29.220
 backbone so we have the spine 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:32.210
 the little bone 

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.210
 the meat 

00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:40.789
 the delicious ones and their rice soups are 

00:07:36.679 --> 00:07:43.509
 Limoncito and his tortillas is already hurt and 

00:07:40.789 --> 00:07:43.509
 he's going to try it 

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:52.130
 well we want you to try the dish 

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:54.500
 broth the broth of thorns or what is not 

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:56.510
 forget him 

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.600
 good afternoon good morning good evening 

00:07:56.510 --> 00:08:01.210
 as Maria says 

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:04.540
 this now we had to try a 

00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:06.670
 backbone caldito does so much both 

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:09.220
 time I did not approve and I have a 

00:08:06.670 --> 00:08:12.420
 anecdote about this spirit this 

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.420
 backbone broth
