00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.949 
achieved more that most of the people
thought<00:02:23.519> but<00:02:23.790> i<00:02:23.939> think<00:02:24.389> that<00:02:24.599> the<00:02:24.810> guys

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
thought but i think that the guys

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.720 
thought but i think that the guys
ingestion<00:02:25.409> believed<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.099> we<00:02:26.249> can't<00:02:26.489> do<00:02:26.609> it

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
ingestion believed that we can't do it

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.550 
ingestion believed that we can't do it
and<00:02:26.939> i<00:02:27.030> think<00:02:27.480> that's<00:02:27.689> what<00:02:27.900> that's<00:02:28.499> what

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
and i think that's what that's what

quite small but they have really good
sports<00:03:21.900> people<00:03:22.259> so<00:03:22.799> why<00:03:23.099> is<00:03:23.159> that<00:03:23.310> do<00:03:23.579> they

sports people so why is that do they
have<00:03:23.819> a<00:03:23.849> real<00:03:24.120> good<00:03:24.509> system<00:03:25.109> like<00:03:25.379> from<00:03:25.680> the

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
have a real good system like from the

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.069 
have a real good system like from the
beginning<00:03:26.189> on<00:03:26.340> or<00:03:26.989> how<00:03:27.989> do<00:03:28.049> you<00:03:28.229> explain<00:03:28.470> that

beginning on or how do you explain that
well<00:03:31.079> I<00:03:31.109> think<00:03:31.439> these<00:03:32.040> Olympics<00:03:32.519> were<00:03:32.699> special

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.140 
well I think these Olympics were special
you<00:03:34.290> know<00:03:34.409> I<00:03:34.439> think<00:03:34.829> we<00:03:35.280> broke<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.699> metal<00:03:36.000> of

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
you know I think we broke the metal of

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.960 
you know I think we broke the metal of
the<00:03:36.389> metal<00:03:36.750> record<00:03:37.109> we<00:03:37.949> almost<00:03:38.069> doubled<00:03:38.549> it<00:03:38.669> so

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
the metal record we almost doubled it so

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.979 
the metal record we almost doubled it so
it<00:03:39.299> was<00:03:39.479> it<00:03:39.870> was<00:03:40.049> really<00:03:40.379> great<00:03:41.069> this<00:03:41.340> year

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
it was it was really great this year

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.990 
it was it was really great this year
having<00:03:42.989> a<00:03:43.079> hockey<00:03:43.290> team<00:03:43.560> there<00:03:43.889> for<00:03:44.669> the<00:03:44.759> first

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
having a hockey team there for the first

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.770 
having a hockey team there for the first
time<00:03:45.180> ever<00:03:45.389> was<00:03:45.689> something<00:03:46.049> special<00:03:46.259> too<00:03:47.780> we

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
time ever was something special too we

motivation for the last few games I you

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.520 
motivation for the last few games I you
know<00:04:17.849> it's<00:04:18.060> a<00:04:18.150> really<00:04:18.359> hard<00:04:18.419> situation<00:04:18.780> to<00:04:19.380> be

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
know it's a really hard situation to be

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.409 
know it's a really hard situation to be
in<00:04:19.560> I<00:04:19.949> think<00:04:20.159> at<00:04:20.489> this<00:04:20.759> point<00:04:20.880> in<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.209> season

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
in I think at this point in the season

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.620 
in I think at this point in the season
with<00:04:21.810> with<00:04:22.169> three<00:04:22.409> games<00:04:22.620> to<00:04:22.860> play<00:04:23.010> and

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
with with three games to play and

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.830 
with with three games to play and
and<00:04:24.370> nothing<00:04:25.370> at<00:04:25.490> stake<00:04:25.610> but<00:04:25.940> but<00:04:26.420> wins<00:04:26.630> and

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
and nothing at stake but but wins and

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.380 
and nothing at stake but but wins and
losses<00:04:27.130> it's<00:04:28.130> a<00:04:28.250> true<00:04:28.430> test<00:04:28.700> of<00:04:28.820> character<00:04:29.000> who

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
losses it's a true test of character who

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:33.160 
losses it's a true test of character who
