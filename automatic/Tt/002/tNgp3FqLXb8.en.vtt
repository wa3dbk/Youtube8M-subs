00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.870 
they're usually it's only one game so I
think<00:02:03.450> with<00:02:04.229> all<00:02:04.410> three<00:02:04.679> games<00:02:04.860> happening<00:02:05.399> it

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
think with all three games happening it

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.320 
think with all three games happening it
just<00:02:05.910> showcases<00:02:06.780> how<00:02:07.140> great<00:02:07.410> our<00:02:07.440> gamers<00:02:07.830> and

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
just showcases how great our gamers and

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.760 
just showcases how great our gamers and
gives<00:02:09.330> an<00:02:09.450> opportunity<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:10.080> grow<00:02:10.440> our<00:02:10.590> game

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
gives an opportunity to grow our game

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.680 
gives an opportunity to grow our game
internationally<00:02:11.430> as<00:02:11.580> well<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.970> hopefully

internationally as well and hopefully

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.510
