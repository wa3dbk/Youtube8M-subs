00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
one magnetic lock box and open it just

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.350 
one magnetic lock box and open it just
to<00:01:07.560> see<00:01:07.770> what<00:01:08.010> type<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.250> items<00:01:08.700> we<00:01:08.850> can<00:01:08.880> expect

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
to see what type of items we can expect

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.870 
to see what type of items we can expect
to<00:01:09.420> get

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.389 

alright<00:01:17.509> so<00:01:17.719> I<00:01:17.750> got<00:01:17.840> an<00:01:18.110> immobilizer<00:01:18.710> that's

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
alright so I got an immobilizer that's

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:21.880 
alright so I got an immobilizer that's
pretty<00:01:19.789> worthless<00:01:20.180> and<00:01:20.930> that's<00:01:21.259> why<00:01:21.469> I<00:01:21.500> say

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
pretty worthless and that's why I say

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.560 
pretty worthless and that's why I say
you<00:01:21.950> know<00:01:22.189> with<00:01:22.520> only<00:01:22.700> a<00:01:22.820> seven<00:01:23.210> percent

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
you know with only a seven percent

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.420 
you know with only a seven percent
chance<00:01:23.869> for<00:01:24.170> a<00:01:24.200> common<00:01:24.500> cover<00:01:24.680> it's

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
chance for a common cover it's

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.620 
chance for a common cover it's
definitely<00:01:26.000> not<00:01:26.960> a<00:01:27.020> good<00:01:27.229> idea<00:01:27.259> to<00:01:27.799> use<00:01:28.039> one

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
definitely not a good idea to use one

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.020 
definitely not a good idea to use one
you<00:01:29.630> know<00:01:29.750> it's<00:01:30.350> certainly<00:01:30.770> a<00:01:30.890> risk<00:01:31.520> that<00:01:31.700> you

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
you know it's certainly a risk that you

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.630 
you know it's certainly a risk that you
can<00:01:32.210> take<00:01:32.420> but<00:01:32.810> I<00:01:33.110> would<00:01:33.860> definitely<00:01:34.039> advise

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
can take but I would definitely advise

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.899 
can take but I would definitely advise
against<00:01:35.119> it<00:01:36.399> alright<00:01:37.399> so<00:01:37.579> when<00:01:37.729> I<00:01:37.759> was

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
against it alright so when I was

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.789 
against it alright so when I was
originally<00:01:38.119> recorded<00:01:38.689> me<00:01:38.990> doing<00:01:39.259> the<00:01:39.380> tasks

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
originally recorded me doing the tasks
