00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
break the ball what do you think I think

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.370 
break the ball what do you think I think
you're<00:02:15.170> gonna<00:02:15.260> have<00:02:15.500> 300<00:02:16.489> miles<00:02:16.640> of<00:02:17.450> recoil<00:02:17.900> in

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
you're gonna have 300 miles of recoil in

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.470 
you're gonna have 300 miles of recoil in
your<00:02:18.530> face<00:02:18.709> is<00:02:18.950> what<00:02:19.130> I<00:02:19.160> think<00:02:19.459> that<00:02:20.330> could

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
your face is what I think that could

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.570 
your face is what I think that could
happen<00:02:20.720> or<00:02:21.110> it<00:02:21.500> could<00:02:21.650> go<00:02:21.680> through<00:02:22.010> I'm<00:02:22.220> I

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
happen or it could go through I'm I

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.509 
happen or it could go through I'm I
think<00:02:23.000> these<00:02:23.120> things<00:02:23.150> are<00:02:23.420> built<00:02:23.630> so<00:02:23.810> tough<00:02:24.049> to

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
think these things are built so tough to

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.009 
think these things are built so tough to
take<00:02:25.519> a<00:02:25.549> ball<00:02:25.760> up<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:26.030> a<00:02:26.060> 90<00:02:26.269> miles<00:02:26.510> an<00:02:26.630> hour<00:02:26.750> I

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
take a ball up to a 90 miles an hour I

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.680 
take a ball up to a 90 miles an hour I
think<00:02:27.380> you<00:02:27.500> can<00:02:27.680> do<00:02:27.799> to<00:02:28.250> 300<00:02:28.730> going<00:02:28.910> four<00:02:29.390> times

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
think you can do to 300 going four times

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.800 
think you can do to 300 going four times
the<00:02:29.959> speed<00:02:30.670> well<00:02:31.670> you<00:02:31.820> know<00:02:31.910> what<00:02:32.090> let's<00:02:32.630> find

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
the speed well you know what let's find

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.970 
the speed well you know what let's find
out<00:02:32.959> is<00:02:33.080> find<00:02:33.350> out<00:02:33.530> three<00:02:34.720> two<00:02:35.720> one
