00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 Hello, today I want to offer you 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.629
 recipe for a delicious cake that 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.660
 can cook for your family or 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.660
 guests for this we need 2 eggs 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.529
 1 cup of sugar is all good 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.529
 beat with a mixer 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:28.120
 add two cups of flour better 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.120
 sifted of course 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.140
 1 cup sour cream but preferably not so 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.140
 thick like mine 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.539
 add soda quenched with vinegar 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.640
 and mix it all up well later 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.949
 best beat with a mixer 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.850
 dough can also be added or vanilla 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:07.130
 or nuts you too will be very tasty 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:11.259
 so our dough is whipped now 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.460
 shift into shape and put in the oven 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:18.020
 we shift in the form and put the oven 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:21.440
 on the middle fire is desirable oven 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.500
 heat up pre and leave for 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:28.399
 40 minutes and did not look completely 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.050
 time will come and so little even 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.610
 stand and cool down after 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.110
 time runs out and then only 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:39.140
 open their parting at this time we 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.899
 make cream melted butter 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.800
 somewhere we pack one pack in a can 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:49.600
 Condensed milk is not well whipped with a mixer 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.600
 the cream should be very thick 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.460
 during this time we also prepare the icing for 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:01.700
 of this we will need 3 tablespoons 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.700
 milk 2 teaspoons cocoa 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:13.980
 and seemingly teaspoon butter 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.830
 as well as 4 spoons of sugar 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.400
 shuffle and set on slow fire 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.230
 and 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.400
 and gradually stir until full 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.440
 sugar dissolving 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:29.580
 Immediately get uniform error too 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.920
 and during this time I have excluded accessories 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.070
 but should not be a little bit for the guests because 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.390
 that very liquid will spread and 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.390
 freezing effects that I wanted 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.400
 after we have baked our cake 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.400
 cut it lengthwise into part 2 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.520
 these two parts are well lubricated by our 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:12.520
 cream 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.349
 cream can add pieces of some 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.950
 fruits such as delicious bananas 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.950
 and kiwi 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.090
 so that he turned out beautiful I 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.819
 flipped the code and smear the glaze 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.859
 now the lower part but if you have 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:54.870
 the top is also beautiful and you can 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:58.170
 lubricate and versions start after that 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.390
 the cake can be a little decorate I took 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:04.340
 ordinary kulechek and cut them a corner 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.340
 and now I put the cream on the cake 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:14.120
 on top you can so thank decorate but 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:19.449
 me it is not very original just 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.449
 Orange slices I laid out the form. 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.190
 Here is such a review all nice 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.190
 appetite
