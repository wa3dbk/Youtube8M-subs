think<00:01:12.420> it's<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.780> real<00:01:12.990> possibility<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.740> that

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
think it's a real possibility that that

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.280 
think it's a real possibility that that
might<00:01:14.220> happen<00:01:14.430> but<00:01:14.760> another<00:01:15.720> thing<00:01:16.020> that

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
might happen but another thing that

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.230 
might happen but another thing that
could<00:01:16.830> be<00:01:16.979> going<00:01:17.130> down<00:01:17.250> with<00:01:17.640> this<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:18.090> that

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
could be going down with this is that

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.640 
could be going down with this is that
they<00:01:18.450> they're<00:01:18.780> just<00:01:18.990> joking<00:01:19.170> with<00:01:19.380> us<00:01:19.439> they
