so what we will typically do with the
clients<00:02:44.420> we'll<00:02:44.570> start<00:02:44.840> them<00:02:44.990> on<00:02:45.170> a<00:02:45.700> like<00:02:46.700> a<00:02:46.730> leg

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
clients we'll start them on a like a leg

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.980 
clients we'll start them on a like a leg
press<00:02:47.210> machine<00:02:47.270> that's<00:02:47.980> really<00:02:49.930> kind<00:02:50.930> of

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
press machine that's really kind of

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.710 
press machine that's really kind of
goldish<00:02:51.500> it's<00:02:51.890> just<00:02:52.160> so<00:02:52.460> easy<00:02:52.670> and<00:02:53.000> then<00:02:53.540> we

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
goldish it's just so easy and then we

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.840 
goldish it's just so easy and then we
graduate<00:02:54.380> them<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:54.980> this<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:55.580> then

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
graduate them to this and then

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.490 
graduate them to this and then
eventually<00:02:56.240> we'll<00:02:56.450> go<00:02:56.540> like<00:02:56.750> to<00:02:57.020> a<00:02:57.050> dumbbell

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
eventually we'll go like to a dumbbell

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.980 
eventually we'll go like to a dumbbell
squat<00:02:57.890> and<00:02:58.220> from<00:02:58.640> there<00:02:58.820> to<00:02:59.030> a<00:02:59.060> barbell<00:02:59.660> squat

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990
