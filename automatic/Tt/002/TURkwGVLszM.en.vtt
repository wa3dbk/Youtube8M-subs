I'm going to pull a shaft out okay and
we'll<00:03:28.020> just<00:03:28.140> speed<00:03:28.320> up<00:03:28.380> here<00:03:28.680> work<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.340> axle

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
we'll just speed up here work the axle

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.340 
we'll just speed up here work the axle
out<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.000> then<00:03:30.209> you<00:03:30.360> actually<00:03:30.540> have<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:31.050> work

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
out and then you actually have to work

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.410

use a pry bar and get that moved out of
the<00:03:39.390> way<00:03:39.420> and<00:03:39.900> then<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:40.769> axle<00:03:41.130> comes<00:03:41.340> right

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549
