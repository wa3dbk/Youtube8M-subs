00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.520
 hello today we have a modular 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.480
 origami 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:20.970
 rainbow ring for this modular 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.359
 crafts prepare colored squares 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.300
 paper size 8 by 8 centimeters 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.539
 all modules will be added one by one 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.539
 to sample 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.730
 we fold our square in half 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.980
 unfolding the leaf and in half again 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.840
 unfold 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.500
 Now we are bending this side to 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.500
 center line 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.059
 and in the same way this side again 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.059
 let's turn on the center line 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:17.030
 here is this bottom edge bend here to 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.030
 this line 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:40.510
 open paper and triangle 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:44.160
 put back now we have this one 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.160
 line on old here's to this line 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.180
 and raise the rectangle up 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.660
 turn over our blank 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.150
 strip down 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.260
 we have two white triangles here 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.689
 we drop down 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:23.610
 one triangle bent and the second 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:26.630
 just as well down the rectangular strip 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.580
 lift up 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.580
 and fold our module in half 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.819
 we got one here 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:41.650
 harvesting 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.340
 the remaining modules are assembled from squares 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.340
 just as well 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.319
 I folded all the modules left them by 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.660
 colors order colors you can choose 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:11.860
 yourself 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:14.830
 take 2 modules, see each module 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:17.320
 we have a pocket and a rectangular 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.720
 the little thing about one module we have to put 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.729
 in the pocket of another 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.340
 push in on one side here i'm 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:27.070
 got pushed on the other side too 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.979
 the most push in the pocket here 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:34.780
 it turned out now we take the next module 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:36.870
 and again put the rectangular tips in 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:41.139
 pocket 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:43.600
 pushing the second one with the other 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:46.560
 parties 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.560
 and the next 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.819
 so we have to assemble all the modules 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.690
 when all modules are assembled only 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.190
 close their ring for this 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:29.670
 connect 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:33.800
 modules again and rectangular tips 1 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.800
 put it in the pocket of another 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:40.100
 try to make both rectangles 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:43.590
 hit the pocket at the same time 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.800
 Here is a beautiful rainbow ring with us 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.800
 happened
