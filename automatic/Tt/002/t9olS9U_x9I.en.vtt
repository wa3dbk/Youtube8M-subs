then soft peaks and finally stiff peaks

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.790 
then soft peaks and finally stiff peaks
it<00:00:59.910> is<00:01:00.149> your<00:01:00.480> that<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.840> add<00:01:01.020> your<00:01:01.230> food<00:01:01.500> color

your icing sugar and the old powder and
this<00:01:23.759> stage<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.240> called<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.570> macro<00:01:25.049> nonce

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
this stage is called a macro nonce

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.789 
this stage is called a macro nonce
you're<00:01:25.500> going<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.710> mix<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.250> into<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:27.680> into<00:01:28.680> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
you're going to mix it into the into the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.880 
you're going to mix it into the into the
egg<00:01:28.979> whites<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.610> make<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.090> into<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.360> paste<00:01:30.890> this

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
egg whites and make it into a paste this

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.440 
egg whites and make it into a paste this
paste<00:01:32.430> has<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.390> be<00:01:33.619> very<00:01:34.619> very<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.850> has<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.329> be

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
paste has to be very very it has to be

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.899 
paste has to be very very it has to be
precise<00:01:36.869> it<00:01:37.200> cannot<00:01:37.500> be<00:01:37.560> too<00:01:38.040> liquidy<00:01:38.520> because

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
precise it cannot be too liquidy because

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.490 
precise it cannot be too liquidy because
then<00:01:39.090> your<00:01:39.240> macaron<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:39.689> going<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:39.990> spread<00:01:40.170> and

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
then your macaron is going to spread and

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.950 
then your macaron is going to spread and
the<00:01:40.530> feet<00:01:41.009> won't<00:01:41.220> form<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.939> if<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:42.659> too

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
the feet won't form and if it is too

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.870 
the feet won't form and if it is too
thick<00:01:43.350> your<00:01:43.860> shells<00:01:44.130> will<00:01:44.369> crack

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.550 

once<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.090> have<00:01:51.119> finished<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.780> process<00:01:52.320> you

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
once you have finished that process you

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.609 
once you have finished that process you
fill<00:01:52.829> it<00:01:52.920> into<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.220> piping<00:01:53.670> bag<00:01:55.670> and<00:01:57.530> then<00:01:58.530> you

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
fill it into a piping bag and then you

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.560 
fill it into a piping bag and then you
buy<00:01:58.799> pads<00:01:59.159> on<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.640> it's<00:02:00.000> nothing<00:02:00.390> but<00:02:00.539> a

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
buy pads on it it's nothing but a

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.530 
buy pads on it it's nothing but a
v-shape

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.410 

but<00:02:06.170> when<00:02:06.320> it's<00:02:06.470> baked<00:02:06.800> it<00:02:07.730> looks<00:02:08.180> like<00:02:08.390> a
