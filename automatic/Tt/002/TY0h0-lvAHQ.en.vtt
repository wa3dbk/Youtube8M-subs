00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.470
 the régis bittencourt highway and the entrance 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.230
 of the ring also east contour 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.610
 here in great Curitiba Curitiba here 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.349
 handling is very large 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.289
 trucks coming out from the north 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.660
 northeast center west direction southeast and 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.119
 enter to the south and vice versa 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.090
 here is problem not then until in 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.119
 troops to the center of curitiba and this 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.789
 entrance has a long and personal stretch 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.840
 has cried a lot of this east stretch are 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.610
 various problems 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.890
 according to the class that takes this part 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.219
 here in curitiba the problems that they 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.710
 face here is lack of supervision 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:43.410
 lack of policing danger at night and 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.719
 signaling and we are going to 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.450
 take a look there to see if it really 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.760
 only happens if the 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.399
 section of the class come on guys ring 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.640
 curitiba road or east boundary 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.989
 as is known by the paraná staff 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.969
 the eastern boundary receives a 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.340
 very large truck volume 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.359
 more than 60% of the vehicles 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.510
 around here 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.250
 are ways to stretch trucks with 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.900
 loads coming from the rio grande do sul santa 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.930
 catarina argentina chile uruguay 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.900
 Paraguay and the state of Paraná in the 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.030
 southbound on loaded freighters that 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.900
 comes from the south- west center of the 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.170
 northeast 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.000
 are more than 20 thousand trucks / day in 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.640
 small stretches like this one next to 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.150
 exit or entrance from são paulo until 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.540
 It looks like a good good tread European highway 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.030
 signaling a beautiful landscape but it has 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.009
 and that's when the staff 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.750
 bleaching is very dangerous 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.210
 especially when traffic to 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.600
 that we stay up to two hours 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.090
 there with this work and the accident and I 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.549
 very very dangerous, we even know 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.049
 make this route and London paranaguá 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.780
 this part of the ring road that is very 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.969
 very dangerous is too much a hole 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.469
 very much traffic here time of 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.409
 rainy season right here is 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.939
 complicated to pass and issue of assault is 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.560
 over the region beyond the Wide Field and 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.689
 until arriving in curitiba he the stretch 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.310
 dangerous even the part of the night there is 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.560
 complicated spend almost an assault him 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.780
 said it was a speech here right from the ring 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.500
 pavement we tried to break the 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.600
 Europe 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.250
 It is not such a neat practice but 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.160
 I tried it's dangerous that's the size of the 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.770
 hole is very bad asphalt problem 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.110
 and of course the danger also assaulted 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.660
 He is from parana here from curitiba but 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.000
 we were roberson it was a personal thing 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.820
 It says that this is dangerous must 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.290
 ask and fat for sure there is 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.640
 to top off the field in the hills you 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.970
 deliver the toll on a truck 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.130
 company was stolen it happens 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.160
 way personal prepared alone played 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.570
 stumbling block is that nothing is right up 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.680
 in the series ally the road is heavy 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.480
 loaded 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.430
 there it is easy staff goes upstairs 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.330
 truck it only addresses the driver 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.330
 I have to do right 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:06.629
 one of the complaints of the class of the stretch 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.420
 which intersects here the east contour are 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:12.269
 Points like this of armandinho bonitinho 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.099
 cool hair but the night here is 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.049
 dangerous because it is dangerous 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.060
 maybe if he stops at the shoulder a 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:21.420
 any problem in the vehicle when it 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.310
 slope foreigners say here 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.670
 Finally there are the bad guys in the corner 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.739
 hidden waiting channel touched them 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.950
 attack the staff asks the police 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.970
 road or the concessionaire 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.700
 keep vehicles here all the time 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.560
 especially at night is when the 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:42.260
 staff attacks who cuts here 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.260
 this ring road east this outline 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:51.599
 Donizete is a miner from the port of 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:56.250
 campinas but he is from guaxupé minas 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:58.260
 is always important so the 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.799
 federal government only importance to 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.889
 ever 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:04.440
 Neo patience and there is a day that is 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:07.889
 The little bird that sit is two hours 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:11.599
 delay brings the message is too much movement 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:15.840
 much movement and the thing does not develop 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:18.120
 and the driver is then also lost that 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.590
 At night for the day there are many more people 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.019
 that just attacking expect to stay 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.240
 hidden in the talking benches is the 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.460
 fact the congestion for the 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.970
 transit still think the world bandits 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.599
 huh 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.729
 The year comes to play but stopped dead 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:34.710
 It's lost, it gets dangerous. It gets dangerous. 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.110
 very dangerous because he took advantage of 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.080
 Who send a girl of guaxupe mines? 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.659
 General, he does not talk out there, they're just talking. 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.599
 that I have here is he sends a hug 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:47.340
 get out of there first a new company 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:48.990
 in business and we keep searching 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.760
 know about the people who are running 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.780
 here how this passage is dangerous 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.909
 or is it not 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.000
 in the ring is small 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:59.669
 points of support like ss but it's little to 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.229
 the volume and size of the trucks that 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:04.080
 they circulate here in the 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:06.900
 and what is the appeal of users of 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.300
 eastern outline of the big dylan the face 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.670
 Who will improve even more? 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.370
 what sense of 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.960
 asphalt and more supervision because 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.530
 You do not have to send it here. 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.810
 truck and it is a direct accident or before 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.500
 even from a truck over there to 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.650
 all 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:30.420
 It's a heavy move here so you have to 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:34.350
 have more signaling to bureaucratic weapons 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:37.860
 and it's ugly for the freighter here now 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:39.870
 License Plate 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.850
 not even a little how you call my 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.740
 name of a thousand already contracted in the 

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:46.980
 road the first time is not many 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.260
 times a week long shooting workout 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.370
 plateau is more false and the little ball 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.430
 road time there 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:55.950
 between all this it will give about 12 13 days 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:58.410
 on top of back with time four days to 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:00.870
 portugal in belém the river belém belém vai 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:03.150
 rise on demand but living by 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.860
 here but it's good in full chat music 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.560
 the ball in play all the time but 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.210
 bush a lot of good 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.340
 just say that the ring road here continues 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:14.040
 dangerous for road users is 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.410
 dangerous was even dangerous. 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.720
 this viaduct that so worth it for the 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:21.900
 event the pomegranate I know is hit by 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.970
 The truck is very time-consuming, this is ours. 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.530
 here is dangerous 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.420
 who thinks the volume is large has a 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.340
 too big to do anything for us 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.630
 and only you is not an appeal will stay here 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:30.990
 to the authorities that is not the first 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.120
 of many 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.010
 this matter bank so many people and the 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.170
 Ringroad here from Curitiba is very much 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:41.240
 dangerous and very bad and by the volume 

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:41.240
 have to improve urgently
