00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.890
 good morning to all guys less maple 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.870
 I'm here today with a brand new video 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.630
 in which I want to present you a 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.460
 lift on minecraft that is this thing 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.410
 here really fabulous then not 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.049
 begin by explaining the base to yourself 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.520
 of elevator operation 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.949
 obviously it's about working with the 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.390
 new snap on the last snap shot in the 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.430
 which arranged who have present 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.250
 added this piston thing with the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.050
 slam blog or with the 1.8 when 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.179
 will then come out of a moment immediately 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.189
 see what as shaped as before 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.100
 all as I notice with this system 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.010
 can make really exaggerated jumps 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.379
 I can practically skip something like that 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.309
 12 Pythagorean theorem we don't want to 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.530
 to do it 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.420
 blocks but the thing even more 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.100
 interesting is that I can automate 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.020
 all that is, I don't have to be up 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.750
 a pete a practice I can use every 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.149
 any other income momentum are 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.579
 stay here I can make a jump 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.590
 really had an incre but you have to 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.859
 I can assure you it did not fly to from 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.820
 having jumps can be said fabulous 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.500
 thanks to this mechanism 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.420
 and then say a moment to show you 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.119
 especially the last thing or the 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.490
 made of how it works when I 'm on a 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.659
 block or maybe I'm near a 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.070
 block ie so maybe they are 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.670
 slightly above slightly below 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.710
 pressing activating the piston precisely 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.210
 receives a push that pushes me towards 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.790
 up and I would say that this is everything 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.280
 enough there is nothing else to say 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.420
 now let's go and analyze the elevator 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.950
 helping them make up really short 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.259
 just because so are the people who 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.610
 they tell apple you can't stay six hours 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.500
 he explains he has no chance of the case indeed 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.470
 you are right, we are right away 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.240
 the elevator then then first 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.780
 I assure you that it does not always work because 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.070
 I had created 3 4 snapshots ago and by sound 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.280
 update update update 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.290
 update snapshots was born a moment 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.479
 before it worked every time now 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.860
 practically if you don't position yourself well 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.450
 it works a lot less 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.219
 let's look at this kind of thing right now 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.980
 having this was a mistake of its own 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.510
 obvious now you will see a moment 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:04.660
 let's see if we can do it 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:08.680
 work because you happen to do 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:10.930
 just petty figures ok except 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.270
 the last piece we say that maybe 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.800
 the most paid one in general would say that 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.110
 the lift works the purpose is that 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.370
 to shoot at the speed of light 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.250
 actually number city ​​from light though 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.780
 something particularly fast not 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.760
 we have time to waste I mean a 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.830
 make all these sky we are 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.980
 of the real minecraft air of which we must 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.630
 do something fast, especially not 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.330
 there is almost redstone that is to make you understand 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.160
 it's not like maybe 400 thousand circuits 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.770
 that I saw them destroy four 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.690
 mountains dig 6 valleys to do it 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.290
 no simply while a thing of 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:49.690
 kind then then I don't know for 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.920
 what kind reason dying though is the 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.570
 fact that I'm paying maybe too much 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.220
 quickly today I hope you understand me 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.860
 same though I'm very euphoric of 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.960
 this thing you see for a moment as it did 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.480
 the structure are all structures made 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:05.980
 equal distanced by as much as six blocks 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.590
 now let's check 123456 means that 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:13.750
 there are six between this and this other 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:15.430
 blocks or 5 1 2 3 4 5 5 blocks ok 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.930
 so it means you wanted to place 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.090
 five empty blocks 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.930
 1232 do five blocks with the other 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.910
 empty and so on 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:26.130
 and then built us around the sert of 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.150
 then built us around 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.100
 let's see for a moment how else made a 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.100
 other the other piece of the circuit we have 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.530
 press tours plate put on a beautiful 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.540
 I have a beautiful think what it means 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:40.870
 when you pass by atimus in electric that 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.780
 do this very nice thing you notice 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.080
 really nice like a little things 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.820
 of the layers that delay some posts 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.260
 two tics first thing goes better with a 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.610
 small works better with two goodies 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.810
 in short, one is never sure which one 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.900
 works better 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:58.900
 then we have a fantastic block 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.570
 normal normal block with above 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.100
 redzone and then we have two pistons then 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.739
 what happens when the signal arrives 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.900
 this one pushes the other two 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.340
 ok this is what they are connected and 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.230
 then this part immediately starts 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.019
 own splinter 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.580
 the beast so what happens if I do 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.400
 they are for example in these neighborhoods 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:20.889
 as soon as I step on now I show 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.380
 then log in with this as soon as you step 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.760
 above they are from themes such as 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.810
 we are on another 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.220
 in short a nice p stoner the cus dio 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.350
 ok anyway more or less actually 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.120
 it works like this and shoots you in the air 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.250
 first for the last time it is not safe 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.600
 it works then actually means 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.590
 best to know to put on 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.690
 so I do click down 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.160
 to put oneself first is the goal made by his 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.960
 more or less seems to work 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.979
 except always the last one the last one is 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.199
 the more band I owe you again 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:51.880
 sincerely understand why 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.070
 according to me there is a factor of its own 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.020
 deep hatred we try another hundred 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.940
 be the same position 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.560
 I sell as much bland as 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.970
 movement however the last apparently 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.760
 instead he just doesn't want to know type 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.919
 can you fuck me I can't can't 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:12.789
 sure to offer my work to you proof 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:14.380
 as an atom the timer at 12345 no a 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:15.639
 as it seems that the last one has no desire 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.870
 to collaborate 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.780
 maybe we made some mistakes 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:22.120
 it is simply a stupid system that 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.610
 yes bank you see for a moment you of 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.289
 fix it according to the needs can 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.180
 also be that he put these things 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:30.700
 useless or something useless 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:33.280
 however, the error is found 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.050
 because you are good stoners I have a lot 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.520
 trust you 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.229
 actually wanting it could also end 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.639
 first I don't really understand why I am 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:41.200
 all the same in the end to this is a 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:44.200
 error here should be no arrone 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:46.840
 the others are fine I do not understand 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.240
 this is seriously but really 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.740
 I am very bitter anyway for the 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.090
 I would say that it actually works 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.650
 the last was the last proceeding 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.710
 it should be the one that makes you jump 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.210
 in the air then you with yours those two 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.460
 little legs with your w 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:03.130
 on this platform it arrived for 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.780
 get off nothing easier there 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.400
 I ask to do something backwards 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.099
 just put a bucket of water that 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.810
 you are all good with the buckets here 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:13.120
 he said something like that 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.889
 4x4 hole sees to catch him when 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.260
 go down and your ankles are broken 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:18.699
 okay the last thing i wanted to tell you at 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.280
 launch system that actually could 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:21.720
 also in my opinion save me 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.030
 I saw want to be complete 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.340
 exhaustive and above all boring 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.600
 story then you see yourself here and 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.130
 obviously started mid this way 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.290
 caught the loan a little 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.790
 time you're not pecking the pole because 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.380
 if you stay too far you talked about that 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:36.180
 do n't get this thing for a ticket 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.070
 tested against the pole 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.080
 by pressing this button we activate 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.520
 a mechanism that occurs from current to 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.950
 a piston I think who shoots 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.360
 flash in the air I don't know why I say shoots 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:48.389
 pescia which in reality is not a shoot 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:51.840
 flash ament just a shoot of 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:53.580
 human bullet in the blue sky 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.400
 indeed blue reality is fine anyway 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.050
 I would say co delirious enough for today vi 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.550
 thank you for seeing this video recently 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.750
 and I can't wait for 1.8 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.430
 martini is known for what other news 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.990
 you want to see almost a little says coutinho 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.669
 evening i'm talking very fast 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.450
 present none of you will understand from 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:09.110
 little to these things 

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.110
 catherine all that
