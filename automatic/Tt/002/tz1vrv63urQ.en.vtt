a<00:02:01.700> comparison<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:04.369> 50<00:02:05.369> mil<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.790> Canon

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
a comparison of the 50 mil the Canon

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.279 
a comparison of the 50 mil the Canon
50mm<00:02:06.509> f-18<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.619> Canon<00:02:07.950> 50mm<00:02:08.369> f-14<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.660> the

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
50mm f-18 the Canon 50mm f-14 and the

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.640 
50mm f-18 the Canon 50mm f-14 and the
Canon<00:02:10.619> 50mm<00:02:11.270> f12<00:02:12.270> l<00:02:12.599> lens

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
Canon 50mm f12 l lens

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.160 
Canon 50mm f12 l lens
so<00:02:14.099> you've<00:02:14.700> got<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.180> varying<00:02:15.569> progression<00:02:16.049> of

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
so you've got a varying progression of

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.780 
so you've got a varying progression of
lenses<00:02:16.500> there<00:02:16.680> in<00:02:16.769> the<00:02:16.860> Canon<00:02:17.190> lineup<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.670> got

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
lenses there in the Canon lineup you got

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.539 
lenses there in the Canon lineup you got
the<00:02:17.879> very<00:02:18.239> expensive<00:02:18.659> f12<00:02:19.470> l<00:02:19.920> lens<00:02:20.250> which<00:02:20.459> i

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
the very expensive f12 l lens which i

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.699 
the very expensive f12 l lens which i
think<00:02:20.610> is<00:02:20.790> just<00:02:20.819> under<00:02:21.260> $2,000<00:02:22.260> or<00:02:22.440> somewhere

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
think is just under $2,000 or somewhere

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:23.539 
think is just under $2,000 or somewhere
in<00:02:22.799> that<00:02:22.860> neighborhood

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
in that neighborhood

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:27.199 
in that neighborhood
you've<00:02:23.909> got<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.269> f-14<00:02:25.110> which<00:02:25.739> is<00:02:25.950> around<00:02:26.310> four

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
you've got the f-14 which is around four

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.670 
you've got the f-14 which is around four
hundred<00:02:27.239> five<00:02:27.750> hundred<00:02:27.810> dollars<00:02:28.319> if<00:02:28.470> memory

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
in the middle there but it's a 50 and I

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:29.360 
in the middle there but it's a 50 and I
believe<00:03:24.480> it<00:03:24.630> was<00:03:24.780> a<00:03:25.910> 58<00:03:26.910> or<00:03:27.889> 57<00:03:28.889> as<00:03:29.010> well<00:03:29.190> I'd

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
believe it was a 58 or 57 as well I'd
