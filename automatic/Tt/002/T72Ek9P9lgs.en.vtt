one of the things we've heard is that
there's<00:00:17.279> going<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.550> be<00:00:17.609> canon<00:00:18.210> 7d<00:00:18.570> Mark<00:00:18.690> tues

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
there's going to be canon 7d Mark tues

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.150 
there's going to be canon 7d Mark tues
floating<00:00:19.680> around<00:00:19.800> at<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.189> Sochi<00:00:20.460> Olympics

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
floating around at the Sochi Olympics

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.250 
floating around at the Sochi Olympics
probably<00:00:23.160> they'll<00:00:23.519> have<00:00:23.789> no<00:00:24.210> name<00:00:24.570> badges<00:00:24.840> on

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.679 
probably they'll have no name badges on
them<00:00:25.529> or<00:00:25.650> name<00:00:25.859> badges<00:00:26.130> mast<00:00:26.640> but<00:00:27.359> they're<00:00:27.539> out

them or name badges mast but they're out
basically<00:00:28.230> essentially<00:00:28.859> in<00:00:29.130> test<00:00:29.490> runs<00:00:29.789> at

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
basically essentially in test runs at

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.389 
basically essentially in test runs at
the<00:00:30.630> Sochi<00:00:31.320> Olympics<00:00:31.349> whether<00:00:31.890> that's<00:00:32.099> true

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
the Sochi Olympics whether that's true

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.370 
the Sochi Olympics whether that's true
or<00:00:32.489> not<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.700> don't<00:00:32.910> know<00:00:33.030> but<00:00:33.120> that's<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.780> rumor

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
or not I don't know but that's the rumor

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.220 
or not I don't know but that's the rumor
mill<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:35.399> there<00:00:35.969> are<00:00:36.000> 70<00:00:36.570> mark<00:00:36.750> tues<00:00:36.989> out

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
mill is that there are 70 mark tues out

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.290 
mill is that there are 70 mark tues out
there<00:00:37.559> for<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.920> sochi<00:00:38.280> olympics<00:00:38.700> now<00:00:39.149> the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
there for the sochi olympics now the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.150 
there for the sochi olympics now the
other<00:00:39.390> thing<00:00:39.510> is<00:00:39.690> we<00:00:39.960> don't<00:00:40.079> really<00:00:40.440> know<00:00:40.860> yet

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
other thing is we don't really know yet

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.220 
other thing is we don't really know yet
if<00:00:41.370> indeed<00:00:42.030> it's<00:00:42.239> going<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.480> be<00:00:42.600> even<00:00:42.750> called

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
if indeed it's going to be even called

if indeed it's going to be even called
the<00:00:43.440> 70<00:00:43.920> mark<00:00:43.950> two<00:00:44.340> stands<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.059> reason<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.480> 70

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
the 70 mark two stands to reason the 70

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.299 
the 70 mark two stands to reason the 70
was<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.050> big<00:00:46.230> success<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.920> stands<00:00:47.129> to

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
was a big success and it stands to

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.650 
was a big success and it stands to
reason<00:00:47.340> they<00:00:47.820> would<00:00:47.940> they<00:00:48.149> would<00:00:48.180> bring<00:00:48.390> go<00:00:48.539> to

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
reason they would they would bring go to

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.049 
reason they would they would bring go to
mark<00:00:48.870> two<00:00:49.079> similar<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.430> way<00:00:50.550> they've<00:00:50.789> done

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
mark two similar to the way they've done

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.040 
mark two similar to the way they've done
mark<00:00:51.629> tues<00:00:51.899> with<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.910> 5d<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.120> with<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.780> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
mark tues with the 5d and with the the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.200 
mark tues with the 5d and with the the
1d<00:00:55.410> series<00:00:55.770> but<00:00:56.730> what<00:00:57.300> we<00:00:57.420> have<00:00:57.629> now<00:00:57.899> is

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
1d series but what we have now is

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.490 
1d series but what we have now is
essentially<00:01:00.210> i<00:01:00.239> think<00:01:00.780> we've<00:01:00.989> kind<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.379> got

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
essentially i think we've kind of got

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.560 
essentially i think we've kind of got
distilled<00:01:01.980> down<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.190> what<00:01:02.579> we<00:01:02.730> think<00:01:03.030> the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
distilled down to what we think the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.060 
distilled down to what we think the
specs<00:01:04.019> are<00:01:04.290> on<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.220> canon<00:01:05.610> 7d<00:01:06.000> now<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:07.140> stands

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
specs are on the canon 7d now it stands

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.399 
specs are on the canon 7d now it stands
to<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.939> stands<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.659> reason<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.960> these<00:01:10.140> may

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
to it stands to reason that these may

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.580 
to it stands to reason that these may
not<00:01:10.710> be<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.280> actual<00:01:11.490> specs<00:01:12.360> but<00:01:12.659> usually<00:01:13.500> at

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
not be the actual specs but usually at

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.740 
not be the actual specs but usually at
this<00:01:13.770> point<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.250> time<00:01:14.509> when<00:01:15.509> we're<00:01:15.630> getting

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
this point in time when we're getting

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.840 
this point in time when we're getting
this<00:01:16.259> close<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.979> release<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.490> camera

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
this close to a release of the camera

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.480 
this close to a release of the camera
we're<00:01:18.299> pretty<00:01:18.600> tight<00:01:18.930> now<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.500> what<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.159> specs

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
we're pretty tight now on what the specs

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.580 
we're pretty tight now on what the specs
are<00:01:20.670> actually<00:01:21.060> going<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.299> be<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:21.750> here<00:01:22.439> we<00:01:22.560> go

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
are actually going to be so here we go

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.830 
are actually going to be so here we go
this<00:01:22.890> is<00:01:22.920> what<00:01:23.100> we<00:01:23.189> got<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.909> far<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.659> what

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
this is what we got so far this is what

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.999 
this is what we got so far this is what
the<00:01:24.960> latest<00:01:25.400> updates<00:01:26.400> are<00:01:26.700> on<00:01:27.000> specs<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:28.009> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
the latest updates are on specs and the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.069 
the latest updates are on specs and the
question<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.460> are<00:01:29.700> these<00:01:30.210> going<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.840> be<00:01:30.960> the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
question is are these going to be the

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.510 
question is are these going to be the
real<00:01:31.259> specs<00:01:31.650> let<00:01:32.009> me<00:01:32.100> know<00:01:32.189> what<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.369> think

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
real specs let me know what you think

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.710 
real specs let me know what you think
let's<00:01:32.790> go<00:01:32.909> through<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.150> specs<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.540> then<00:01:33.630> we

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
let's go through the specs and then we

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.780 
let's go through the specs and then we
can<00:01:33.840> discuss<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.220> 20<00:01:35.790> or<00:01:35.820> 24<00:01:36.509> megapixel

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
can discuss that so a 20 or 24 megapixel

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.480 
can discuss that so a 20 or 24 megapixel
dual<00:01:38.790> pixel<00:01:39.299> CMOS<00:01:39.570> AF<00:01:39.990> sensor<00:01:40.409> when<00:01:41.250> we<00:01:41.340> say

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
dual pixel CMOS AF sensor when we say

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.780 
dual pixel CMOS AF sensor when we say
that<00:01:41.670> dual<00:01:41.880> pixel<00:01:42.409> CMOS<00:01:43.409> AF<00:01:44.009> sensor<00:01:44.520> we're

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
that dual pixel CMOS AF sensor we're

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.490 
that dual pixel CMOS AF sensor we're
talking<00:01:45.060> about<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.299> same<00:01:45.329> type<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.750> one<00:01:46.380> that

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
talking about the same type of one that

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.800 
talking about the same type of one that
we<00:01:46.619> have<00:01:46.770> in<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.040> 70d<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:48.270> gives<00:01:48.479> us<00:01:48.630> that

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
we have in the 70d that gives us that

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.950 
we have in the 70d that gives us that
awesome<00:01:49.590> video<00:01:50.579> focus<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.329> follow<00:01:51.630> focus

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
awesome video focus that follow focus
