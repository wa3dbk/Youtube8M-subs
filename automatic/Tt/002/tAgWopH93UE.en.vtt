00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello all so welcome one day 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.600
 more today I give you a new video that is going to 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.240
 be about how to cover the dark circles under 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.960
 bluish many we tend to have a 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.759
 furrows or bags all kinds of 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.660
 problem that arise under our 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.100
 eyes 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.770
 there is a very simple way of 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.930
 correct them and it's with cosmetics and with 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.730
 makeup in this video I wanted 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.039
 make a small summary of several 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.830
 techniques and several methods and several 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.570
 secrets or tricks to get everything 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.210
 that lower triangle of the ojera 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.739
 completely cleared now that 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.420
 we started the prayer course again 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.829
 we are not going to work and we have to 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.870
 get used to getting up again 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.340
 soon in the morning we do not want the 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.020
 dark circles are the protagonists of 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.170
 our first days of work 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.789
 our first days of course let's say 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.440
 that we will go completely in some faces 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.140
 of feeling that we have not slept 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.629
 well or that we had to evaluate and 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.270
 who can say that we have risen 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.360
 perfect 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.460
 if we tend to have bags or 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.170
 swollen eyes in the morning there 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.089
 many times that yesterday morning I 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.370
 awake with focused games there are 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.800
 several systems that we can use the most 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.050
 easy and fast that's the cold we can 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.870
 put two blades in the freezer and 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.600
 always have them ready to take them out and 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.740
 apply them under our eyes 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.550
 we can also do the same with a 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.040
 ice Cube 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.320
 the cold produces vasoconstriction for 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.720
 which means that all the vessels 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.970
 Vascular will stay tighter 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.270
 that eliminates the throw of inflammation the 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.580
 swelling and leave this whole area as if 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.320
 was perfectly relaxed the 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.149
 Next step would be to use our cream 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.550
 Eye contour is very important 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.800
 keep the entire lower area hydrated 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:45.670
 of the eyes not only this area here 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:48.580
 but completely the triangle even 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.500
 above the eyelid is a very 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.810
 delicate of a very finite skin needs 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.790
 its proper hydration seeks that 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.939
 just hydrate me on the skin and that 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.280
 have a little 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.710
 a tensor let's say I do not pretend that I 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.689
 eliminate the bags or remove the 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.920
 dark circles but if we no longer prepare the area 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.110
 a little bit to work later 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.810
 about it with makeup other brands 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.700
 commercial as garnier for example that 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.590
 they offer their correctors and they also have 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.510
 one that is just the moisturizer is not 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.480
 concealer in a pain format 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.810
 which is usually cold and has properties 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.180
 caffeinated and properties offering 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.189
 specifically to my this 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.079
 I really like to apply it for everything 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:32.090
 this triangle from the letter of the 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:34.790
 nose up to the temple because it's pretty 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.769
 bright is very light and if we do not have 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.150
 A very pronounced dark circles simply 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.680
 we can have a little bloated 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.390
 We are adding a little bit of 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.640
 treatment at the same time is a 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.769
 pretty nice product I like them 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.909
 a lot and I do not usually use it for when I want 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.310
 a quick corrector because 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:51.079
 Surprisingly it covers quite well 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.180
 many people have super problems 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:55.970
 pigmentation in dark circles is to say that 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.889
 the very blue purples are very intense 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.260
 very dark and regardless of the 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:02.359
 areas that you sleep or from the tired one 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.650
 tired you 're going to be there but 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:05.930
 Well luck everything in playing with the 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.510
 colors to counteract that there 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.099
 that problem of dark circles under the eyes 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.349
 I recommend you look for 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:15.019
 correctors that are a tad pro wise 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:17.269
 that throw more salmon the colors more 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:19.099
 pinkish oranges plus salmon 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.840
 they counteract the purple because they are 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:22.639
 complementary colors persie 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.569
 neutralizes in each other the most 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:25.609
 famous of all 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.370
 of the brand bobby braun and it's a pre 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:30.170
 corrector and here we have the sub tone 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.879
 Naranjita de Naranjo are often used 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.680
 before the normal concealer and over 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.650
 we would put your normal concealer to 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.019
 cover that tone and that is skin color 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.329
 natural the pre corrector what we want 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:44.209
 apply only in the area that we have 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:46.219
 bluish eye either just to this part 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.469
 from here or the entire lower part of the eye 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:51.079
 where we see that our skin 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:52.819
 tends to a more blue or purple tone what 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:54.769
 blur and masters well so you do not 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.090
 note any color cut and over 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.909
 we could apply our concealer 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.579
 normal this would be the corrector tone of 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:03.680
 my perfect skin and I would put it over 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:05.870
 blurring little touches in all this 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.239
 triangle to disguise the change of 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.340
 color and to finish covering all the 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.069
 if our problem is a problem 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.930
 of bags or that we simply have a 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.639
 sinking here right now to me 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.829
 surely you can not see it but if 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:22.039
 he ducked his head so you see I have here 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.750
 a more sunken area our best 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:25.910
 ally are the type correctors 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.530
 illuminator have them very many 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.689
 marked a product that has been made very 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.399
 famous and that luckily 

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:33.049
 has come out very much to the market and we can 

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:35.539
 buy from high-end to low-end 

00:04:33.049 --> 00:04:37.189
 of products of this style what 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:39.829
 we would do would be to apply just the 

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:42.589
 corrector in the south I remove dark that 

00:04:39.829 --> 00:04:45.529
 we see where that shadow of the furrow is made 

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:48.319
 or from the bag and blur only within 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:49.699
 that area this type of correctors have 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:51.229
 some particles that reflect light 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:53.329
 although at first glance it is not very 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.309
 polished for nothing is simply a 

00:04:53.329 --> 00:04:57.829
 technology that makes it catch the light and the 

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:59.689
 reflects so in the shadows it does not 

00:04:57.829 --> 00:05:01.789
 they will see why they are being reflected 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:04.129
 the light we can also use to 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:06.349
 illuminate the whole part of the triangle of 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:08.089
 under the eye because usually 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:09.939
 give it a clearer effect we 

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:13.550
 I awake to have all this area here 

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:15.050
 clearer more illuminated finally as 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.429
 we will have applied several layers of 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.169
 corrector although they are correctors 

00:05:16.429 --> 00:05:21.469
 different textures or different 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:23.869
 formats it is advisable to apply some 

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:26.360
 powders and with a brush is very soft 

00:05:23.869 --> 00:05:27.919
 I apply it under the eye so I'm going to 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.719
 I seal the corrector will ensure 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.939
 that does not move throughout the day 

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:33.960
 other secrets for dark circles and many 

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:36.270
 Sometimes we often overlook it 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:39.150
 illuminate the lacrimal of the eye and the part 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.729
 high of the eyebrow when adding those points of 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.710
 light also gives a very awake effect and 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:45.449
 often clear a lot to the area and 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.190
 up to here the video how to correct 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.900
 our dark circles I hope that I have 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.819
 helped and have left 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.410
