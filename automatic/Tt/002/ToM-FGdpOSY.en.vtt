00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.000
 hello my name is arthur lashes i 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.400
 engaged in the construction of a single plane 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.620
 in this video I will try to answer 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:18.840
 Frequently Asked Questions 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:21.080
 so the plane on this video channel 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.220
 I will post a video with the results 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.510
 surviving aircraft assembly stages video 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.090
 It is not 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.399
 any action guide see 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.360
 such video instructions how to collect 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.070
 the plane is just my subjective experience 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.079
 which for sure is to commit some 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.570
 errors and inaccuracies patlon 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.260
 I do not bear any responsibility if 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.370
 any of my viewers 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.969
 similarly will collect 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.969
 something remains 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.250
 I'm doing construction analysis for 8 gigs 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.949
 . 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.340
 managed model is one place 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.739
 the plane with all the necessary tried 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:12.240
 upgraded instrumentation engine with 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:15.390
 betonka such I stand the plane in the final 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:20.759
 to the address designer type ten 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.730
 1112 in 1990, he flew Articles 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.310
 you can enter 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:27.310
 find enough search engine dial on 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.700
 slipway argument 2 and literally the first 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.390
 the link will point to a copy of this 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:37.110
 articles on all necessary drawings 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.520
 naturally with at Signet 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.040
 admitted some may close 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.410
 inaccuracies and errors not in size 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.510
 size just weren't hands therefore 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.750
 everyone has to think about 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:52.590
 read some nodes even keys 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.590
 count completely 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.100
 the plane will almost completely 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.870
 made of wood and plywood 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.330
 some particularly important kingdom sites like 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:09.670
 changing or even that is motorama 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:18.400
 Gingerbread July 20 but made out puts 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:21.880
 main give this anchor really 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:26.650
 allowed in the collector planes 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:30.930
 almost completely business turbo 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.930
 also considered very successful soul 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:39.519
 to force were several times 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:44.060
 specializes in engines for 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:45.620
 snowmobile map and monavie and some 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.200
 companies that are professional 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.920
 are engaged in the release of 2 4 place aircraft 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.939
 put the engines here but to 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.430
 Sorry to date, near 

00:02:54.939 --> 00:03:03.139
 power side needed was minimized 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:07.340
 I have to put the engine Minsk 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:09.919
 motor factory for 640 doctor products 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.970
 bears that are pretty wide 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:16.519
 applied in amateur mom i 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.609
 sold and care also releases 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:27.560
 slightly modified engine 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:30.620
 designed precisely for easy times i 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.879
 airplane builder cause pain 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:37.040
 unfortunately it is necessary smooth demands 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:41.180
 absolutely newbie want but if you're on 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.780
 silhouette passing mood as possible 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.780
 see and something 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.780
 investiture 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.760
 the percentage of readiness of the aircraft will not be estimated at 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.640
 Zion 18 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.510
 that's very little considering how much 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.960
 time gone 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:01.830
 Part I create channels for 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:04.380
 to and push yourself not to slow down 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.410
 pace but for all this time when not on 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:11.450
 Nikolaev to leave it all 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.450
 so will titanium be planed end 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.160
 Naturally we know the exact amount I can not 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:23.840
 i think by now i am 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.840
 spent about 600 700 dollars 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.500
 how much is still spent too 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.890
 hard to say but i think that common 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:35.580
 the budget for the construction of the aircraft from 5 to 7 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:38.630
 thousand then the top bar even higher 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.770
 higher raise can be left and 202 and 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.140
 equipment more friend and so on and 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.590
 like that but they are a worm me 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:48.360
 I am guided by figure 5-7 thousand tons well 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.660
 all this of course is very judging of the body less 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:58.610
 for sure the flowers are not 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:05:01.880
 like I can't fly red 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:06.200
 I was lucky to only sell 1 1 2 place 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:09.680
 with 4 seater aircraft to another maximum 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:13.220
 minutes and also it is natural kicking 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:17.530
 new senators are rather oriented on 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:25.040
 I leave the physics of flight to study 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:26.510
 models for you to build on it 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.880
 solaris aircraft required 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.680
 pass through the register 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.230
 appropriate voice and help therapy 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.550
 aging amateur pilot and on legitimate 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.550
 grounds to fly an airplane 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.740
 your question and you can leave 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:44.420
 comments can also sit block 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.020
 which is completely dedicated to the construction 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.660
 Lena herself 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.540
 where I talk in more detail about all 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:54.010
 the nuances that I still do like me 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:56.030
 Now the problem to give further move 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:59.890
 subscribe to the channel I think that 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.890
 will be very losing the village
