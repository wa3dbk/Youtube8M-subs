of<00:00:33.010> roast<00:00:33.309> I<00:00:33.730> like<00:00:34.660> to<00:00:34.840> run<00:00:35.140> my<00:00:35.410> meat<00:00:35.590> before<00:00:35.980> I

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
of roast I like to run my meat before I

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.740 
of roast I like to run my meat before I
roast<00:00:36.340> it<00:00:36.519> and<00:00:36.670> I<00:00:36.760> put<00:00:36.969> a<00:00:37.149> little<00:00:37.390> bit<00:00:37.629> of

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
roast it and I put a little bit of

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.720 
roast it and I put a little bit of
butter<00:00:37.989> probably<00:00:38.649> about<00:00:38.800> a<00:00:38.859> teaspoon<00:00:39.160> and<00:00:39.640> I

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
butter probably about a teaspoon and I

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.060 
butter probably about a teaspoon and I
put<00:00:39.969> that<00:00:40.120> on<00:00:40.510> the<00:00:41.050> meat<00:00:41.230> rather<00:00:41.590> than<00:00:41.800> on<00:00:41.949> the

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
put that on the meat rather than on the

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.220 
put that on the meat rather than on the
pan<00:00:42.370> and<00:00:42.609> that<00:00:43.149> would<00:00:43.329> be<00:00:43.420> the<00:00:43.570> same<00:00:43.809> if<00:00:43.989> I<00:00:44.109> was

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
pan and that would be the same if I was

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.930 
pan and that would be the same if I was
going<00:00:44.410> to<00:00:44.469> oil<00:00:44.559> the<00:00:44.949> meat<00:00:45.100> add<00:00:45.309> oil<00:00:45.579> the<00:00:45.730> meat

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
going to oil the meat add oil the meat

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.630 
going to oil the meat add oil the meat
not<00:00:46.420> the<00:00:46.480> pan<00:00:46.809> now<00:00:47.440> the<00:00:47.500> reason<00:00:47.890> I<00:00:47.980> do<00:00:48.039> this<00:00:48.190> is

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
not the pan now the reason I do this is

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.479 
not the pan now the reason I do this is
that<00:00:48.879> it<00:00:48.969> contains<00:00:49.600> the<00:00:50.109> fat<00:00:50.440> around<00:00:51.129> the<00:00:51.309> meat

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
that it contains the fat around the meat

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.400 
that it contains the fat around the meat
and<00:00:51.760> it<00:00:51.820> helps<00:00:52.239> the<00:00:52.420> surface<00:00:52.839> of<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.079> meat<00:00:53.260> to

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
and it helps the surface of the meat to

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:11.810 
and it helps the surface of the meat to
caramelize<00:00:54.100> beautifully<00:01:07.409> on<00:01:08.409> the<00:01:08.590> other<00:01:08.710> side

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.429 

so<00:01:12.820> now<00:01:12.850> that<00:01:13.060> nice<00:01:13.509> and<00:01:13.750> brown<00:01:13.930> that<00:01:14.229> goes

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
so now that nice and brown that goes

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.800 
so now that nice and brown that goes
into<00:01:14.619> the<00:01:14.829> oven<00:01:14.860> at<00:01:15.220> 220<00:01:15.490> degrees<00:01:16.090> Celsius<00:01:16.570> to

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
into the oven at 220 degrees Celsius to

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.230 
into the oven at 220 degrees Celsius to
roast

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.410 

so<00:01:22.240> now<00:01:22.480> my<00:01:22.780> meat<00:01:22.990> is<00:01:23.230> cooked<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:25.060> need<00:01:25.210> to<00:01:25.300> be

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
so now my meat is cooked you need to be

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.180 
so now my meat is cooked you need to be
able<00:01:25.510> to<00:01:25.630> determine<00:01:26.050> how<00:01:26.470> cooked<00:01:26.830> it<00:01:27.010> is

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
able to determine how cooked it is

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.400 
able to determine how cooked it is
because<00:01:27.910> I've<00:01:28.030> got<00:01:28.180> venison<00:01:28.540> here<00:01:28.960> I<00:01:28.990> want<00:01:29.290> it

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
because I've got venison here I want it

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.830 
because I've got venison here I want it
nice<00:01:30.010> and<00:01:30.370> rare<00:01:30.550> so<00:01:30.910> you<00:01:31.090> can<00:01:31.240> see<00:01:31.510> as<00:01:31.660> I'm

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
nice and rare so you can see as I'm

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.470 
nice and rare so you can see as I'm
squeezing<00:01:32.260> it<00:01:32.530> it's<00:01:33.010> got<00:01:33.160> lots<00:01:33.550> of<00:01:33.790> good<00:01:34.060> so

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
squeezing it it's got lots of good so

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.210 
squeezing it it's got lots of good so
that<00:01:34.660> means<00:01:34.870> it's<00:01:35.080> gonna<00:01:35.140> be<00:01:35.260> lovely<00:01:35.830> and<00:01:35.860> rare

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
that means it's gonna be lovely and rare

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.450 
that means it's gonna be lovely and rare
now<00:01:36.880> it<00:01:37.060> needs<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.480> rest<00:01:37.830> and<00:01:38.830> this<00:01:38.890> is<00:01:39.040> really

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
now it needs to rest and this is really

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.280 
now it needs to rest and this is really
important<00:01:40.120> because<00:01:40.180> it<00:01:40.540> allows<00:01:40.750> the<00:01:40.990> juices

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
important because it allows the juices

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.620 
important because it allows the juices
just<00:01:41.650> dispersed<00:01:42.070> evenly<00:01:42.250> and<00:01:42.790> the<00:01:43.240> meat<00:01:43.450> will

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
just dispersed evenly and the meat will

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.620 
just dispersed evenly and the meat will
be<00:01:43.720> so<00:01:44.140> much<00:01:44.380> more<00:01:44.650> tender<00:01:45.130> so<00:01:45.490> leave<00:01:46.300> it<00:01:46.330> like

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
be so much more tender so leave it like

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.300 
be so much more tender so leave it like
that<00:01:46.840> but<00:01:47.050> the<00:01:47.140> piece<00:01:47.320> of<00:01:47.500> tinfoil<00:01:47.680> and<00:01:48.220> a

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
that but the piece of tinfoil and a

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.550 
that but the piece of tinfoil and a
cloth<00:01:48.550> on<00:01:48.700> top<00:01:48.910> for<00:01:49.390> about<00:01:49.570> 10<00:01:49.960> minutes

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
cloth on top for about 10 minutes

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.859 
cloth on top for about 10 minutes
the<00:01:50.740> bigger<00:01:51.010> the<00:01:51.190> cut<00:01:51.370> of<00:01:51.490> roast<00:01:51.730> the<00:01:52.300> longer

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
the bigger the cut of roast the longer

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.980 
the bigger the cut of roast the longer
it<00:01:52.960> takes<00:01:53.140> to<00:01:53.320> rest<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:55.119> now<00:01:55.360> my<00:01:55.570> meat<00:01:55.780> has

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
it takes to rest so now my meat has

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.130 
it takes to rest so now my meat has
rested<00:01:56.500> it's<00:01:56.890> time<00:01:57.280> to<00:01:57.520> carve<00:01:57.790> it<00:01:58.030> and<00:01:58.240> this<00:01:58.960> is

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
rested it's time to carve it and this is

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.680 
rested it's time to carve it and this is
really<00:01:59.250> important<00:02:00.250> to<00:02:00.310> notice<00:02:00.820> which<00:02:01.119> way<00:02:01.150> the

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
really important to notice which way the

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.920 
really important to notice which way the
grain<00:02:02.050> of<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.440> meat<00:02:02.470> goes<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:04.180> here<00:02:04.570> you<00:02:04.810> can

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
grain of the meat goes so here you can

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.810 
grain of the meat goes so here you can
see<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.290> grain<00:02:05.619> of<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:05.979> meat<00:02:06.010> is<00:02:06.400> running

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
see the grain of the meat is running

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.990 
see the grain of the meat is running
this<00:02:07.060> way<00:02:07.390> like<00:02:08.080> this<00:02:08.410> so<00:02:09.310> I<00:02:09.340> need<00:02:09.459> to<00:02:09.670> carve

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
this way like this so I need to carve

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.240 
this way like this so I need to carve
across<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.959> grain<00:02:11.200> to<00:02:11.440> have<00:02:11.560> very<00:02:11.920> short

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
across the grain to have very short

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.580 
across the grain to have very short
fibers<00:02:12.880> for<00:02:13.180> maximum<00:02:13.720> tenderness

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
fibers for maximum tenderness

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.430 
fibers for maximum tenderness
so<00:02:15.220> now<00:02:15.400> let's<00:02:15.700> carve<00:02:16.060> it<00:02:16.330> and<00:02:16.540> I<00:02:16.959> wanted<00:02:17.290> a

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
so now let's carve it and I wanted a

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.310 
so now let's carve it and I wanted a
really<00:02:17.860> rare<00:02:18.310> result<00:02:18.880> here<00:02:19.270> but<00:02:19.480> it's<00:02:19.750> venison

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
really rare result here but it's venison

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.400 
really rare result here but it's venison
and<00:02:20.470> because<00:02:21.160> venison<00:02:21.610> is<00:02:21.730> so<00:02:22.090> lean<00:02:22.540> it's

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
and because venison is so lean it's

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.350 
and because venison is so lean it's
important<00:02:24.070> that<00:02:24.100> you<00:02:24.340> serve<00:02:24.610> at<00:02:24.760> rare<00:02:25.090> or

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
important that you serve at rare or

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.140 
important that you serve at rare or
medium<00:02:25.780> rare<00:02:26.080> look<00:02:26.680> how<00:02:26.920> juicy<00:02:27.190> that<00:02:27.519> is<00:02:30.150> and

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
medium rare look how juicy that is and

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.240 
medium rare look how juicy that is and
you<00:02:31.360> can<00:02:31.540> see<00:02:31.930> that<00:02:32.140> this<00:02:32.260> is<00:02:32.410> perfectly

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
you can see that this is perfectly

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.780 
you can see that this is perfectly
evenly<00:02:33.940> cooked<00:02:34.420> all<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.350> way<00:02:35.380> through<00:02:35.790> and

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
evenly cooked all the way through and

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.670 
evenly cooked all the way through and
that<00:02:36.910> is<00:02:37.060> what<00:02:37.239> you<00:02:37.360> get<00:02:37.540> from<00:02:37.870> resting<00:02:38.410> and

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
that is what you get from resting and

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.120 
that is what you get from resting and
you<00:02:39.340> can<00:02:39.550> really<00:02:39.970> see<00:02:40.330> how<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:41.050> small<00:02:41.620> piece<00:02:41.950> of

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
you can really see how a small piece of

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.790 
you can really see how a small piece of
meat<00:02:42.340> goes<00:02:42.820> a<00:02:43.090> really<00:02:43.660> long<00:02:43.810> way

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.860
