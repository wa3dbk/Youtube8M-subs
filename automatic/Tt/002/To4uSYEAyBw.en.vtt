00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.120
 healthy and lively with our four-legged friends but an infection 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.930
 with worms can hit every dog ​​and every cat 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.680
 but hardly anyone knows exactly what the favorite animal is for deworming 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.680
 has to learn under guidance 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.949
 So our animals only see pets and that's why it does not apply 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:24.030
 who have no idea as far as we can see it over 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.050
 that's us 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.000
 the right answer to the question of how often your own animal is dewormed 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.740
 had to get hold of pet owners at the expert organization 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.090
 Represented in Germany by Professor Dr. Schnieder of the Veterinary 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.830
 University of Hannover 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.350
 important to him is the protection of tapeworms and coils Lohmann 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.860
 Now we want to be that way 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.739
 dangerous or something 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:50.960
 Euro important 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.820
 because on the one hand they can draw a lot on people and because they are 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.820
 On the other hand, looking for diverse development opportunities 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.420
 Dogs and cats can become infected from the environment 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.930
 by recording an honorary member intermediate score so while playing 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.720
 Going out there, these stages of development can be taken up 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.990
 but at home there is also a risk of infection for the four-legged friends 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.500
 the owner of the animal himself unconsciously brings Wurmeier into the apartment approx 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.970
 supposedly safe ground can be so infected for example on the domestic cat 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.979
 therefore all animals should be regularly treated for worm infections 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.830
 otherwise, serious harm to young animals is usually too much to feel 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.380
 strengthened and impairment 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.400
 and Sweden 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.130
 that can 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.700
 Humor gave birth to bone deformations even to the death of everyone 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.220
 Lead animals

 an infection is dangerous for dogs and cats of all ages the card 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.140
 is the weather allows 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.630
 to Frankfurt analyzes in the laboratory of the institute, the staff will be almost 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.920
 always find 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.479

 should know how many times here must be wormed

 Ascot has a special scheme with four different risk groups 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:03.160
 developed

 to 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:19.019
 This graph gives information like deworming from the engraving 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:21.299
 must be performed 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.019
