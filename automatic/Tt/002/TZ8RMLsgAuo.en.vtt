00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.390
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:08.840
 Huh Hahha' 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:14.510
 Alliance's Hello mine it is today Emaa 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:21.260
 Takanagi station low cost organization using Bam 2 wall breaker 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:25.380
 I wonder if a Well went strength Well, one relatively strong ne per Town Hall sphere I mean 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:29.820
 I want to continue the attack dress have a firm is Well quite Defense 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.669
 It's still like that, but now it's supposed to talk in another video 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.930
 But it is very good for any base 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:42.000
 It corresponds and it is not surprising even in the pharming base of the marsh phantom beast kind 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:45.400
 So take them up in the roots it may be possible to ride resources Ogonneka' Poi 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.940
 Well because it has become a spirit that could very well this time 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.270
 I hope you can see how it's attacking 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.270
 Yes 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:01:01.600
 Well , I will introduce it soon, but first the tone hole below 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:07.030
 In addition, it is attacking for a while because it is to Roth Ruffy Gane head, but after that from here 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.110
 I decided to attack Nee It is such a base, but it is the most important role Hey I'm attacking 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.659
 Did 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:15.890
 Well yeah yes I thought it would be a key point 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:20.210
 First of all, because I did not put that wall breaker up there 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.569
 Was open and Mosu can but before her properly until either I Yeah another Manda a goal Breaker 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.500
 Ne 

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:28.820
 After all, the combination Tteyuu this record drinking and the ball Breaker is I think very or strongest 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:36.260
 After all it is going to attack into it this time 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:40.610
 In that spell use 1 and use a hero also the very existence that is the dance 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:45.350
 Firmly guarding and attacking in the form of a little bit from behind the emmer 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:48.810
 It feels like it's quite your own child and it's very fast 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:54.930
 I say that destroying the resources, yes this is this kind of feeling 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.500
 I am still quite advanced now , but there is quite a lot of Barbarian King's hp 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.420
 To be 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:02.840
 There are already 2 safes left in the vault and Archer Queen's hit points are 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.460
 It is Banpan 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.580
 It is an archer such as this level in a but it is very strong and very cool 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.300
 Yes 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.770
 It's like that one more time this time 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:21.800
 Or I thought that N keep the I and 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:27.500
 Well that's the position of the wizard tower and then it's 6 plus w 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:29.030
 It is that still in there is the fact that its hp is less its very strong in 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.510
 After all 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.760
 2 range attack is very strong yes 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.750
 And it's kind of nice to this wizard tower this time 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:43.970
 Yes, that contains the bad sound 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:47.120
 Since it is not within the scope to protect the incident, then the author group 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:51.480
 Ignoring the sort of wizard augmentation 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:55.870
 For the wilderness it can attack 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:03:02.049
 Another losing confirmed like that I Machir also for I say 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:03.819
 This will be taken , but even in this organization, the whole flow will be seen as I explained just in the end. 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:08.680
 I think if you can 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:10.310
 I did not say I did not say until I say side cut 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.880
 Grandma and its 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.410
 Some ne 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:21.030
 Yes I feel say to go into the firm to destroy the defense facility 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:24.690
 But reinforcements documents have become too difficult to do with this big base that has been bothersome 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:28.290
 Although I did not do it, of course it would be nice if I did 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:32.040
 After all this another strong thing is still that 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:38.370
 It's not right Onz or Archer or Archer 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:42.060
 Training at 0 o'clock The strongest is Roh and the combination is anything but strong. 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:45.760
 But after all, it is really important that Rage is the timing of the Les 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:49.120
 a Well I think there is only practice to the bottom Yes 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:54.730
 In Wall Boone, as I said it is here 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:56.470
 Way turned into not wizard and eco for sleep Well this also is in Nekocha construction does not start-up of 1 year old 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:01.510
 From coming in, but a fan 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:05.490
 Say that still do not cause the attack at all to Archer who are here just to function 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:11.490
 Well that kind of feeling hey 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:11.970
 I felt like it was an attack Yes I feel this berm press w The good one is a horse 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:18.600
 Horse 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:20.070
 It then referred to as that bam w in a balm to the right wing Well I one of the attack that 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:25.480
 I as a Susumen spearhead 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:30.160
 Now we have to introduce I think that we want to introduce the Waneba 6 but personal Bam 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:33.990
 A little enter and organize the Neiman all-breaker Thank you for viewing It is recommended 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.969
 Fortunately it is by Bai Once you become just below reference 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.080
 I will 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:37.969
 th 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.009
 I am 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:42.749
 Ray 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.749
