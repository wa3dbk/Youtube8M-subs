00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
skiing is that Activision thought about

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.920 
skiing is that Activision thought about
their<00:02:21.770> customers<00:02:22.310> who<00:02:22.880> haven't<00:02:23.120> invested<00:02:23.810> in

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
their customers who haven't invested in

their customers who haven't invested in
color<00:02:24.170> televisions<00:02:24.890> because<00:02:25.040> this<00:02:25.400> game

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
color televisions because this game

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:37.620 
color televisions because this game
plays<00:02:25.940> extremely<00:02:26.569> well<00:02:26.750> in<00:02:26.959> black<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.380> white

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630
