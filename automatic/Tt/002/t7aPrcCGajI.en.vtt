00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.900
 Hi everyone , how are you? 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.150
 Today's video the hair and I media 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.540
 I'll teach you how to make lights. 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.540
 blue 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:34.530
 How can you read this hair already? 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.610
 the blue ones but I'm going to make it whole 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.100
 again 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.140
 If you have virgin hair, you only have 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.460
 an easy one that you will do differently 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.989
 and the time that I get there I'll notice 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.120
 we start to embarrass hair and 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.660
 dividing it in half to later see 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.660
 with the cap 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.989
 the cap I'm going to wear this silicone 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.339
 that you can use several times 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.100
 I like to put some talcum 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:04.830
 inside so that she gets better at 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.000
 head and wires leave her with more 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.350
 facility 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.920
 now it just fits in the head and 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.190
 now just pull I'm using a needle 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.080
 1.5 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.299
 The secret of pulling is what you 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.270
 They are seeing I put one needle 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.539
 turn and fake o place of a ride 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.970
 and pull this will pull right into the root of the 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.009
 hair and another secret is always to start 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:35.580
 from above as I said in another video 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:36.990
 it helps to not screw everything we 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.909
 on the bottom 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.940
 how can you see continue doing 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.369
 the same way now as you can 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.630
 I go back to see Chando in some 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.209
 little holes that I think this is the 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.159
 Little hair so it's okay. 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:51.780
 coming back and closing again is always good 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.399
 be happy in the hand to 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.319
 disagreeing because what has been 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.319
 Sometimes it does not come whole and not content it 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:00.300
 goes full 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:02.819
 We finish but as you can not read 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.289
 I pulled up under the burrow because the 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.560
 my client's hair ends there 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.660
 then you have to pull down and 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.819
 I'll do the braiding and I'll go 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.660
 put under the towel to not have 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.660
 danger of tarnishing 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.340
 Now let's do the mixing. 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.940
 I always put an amount of 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.220
 decolorizing for two of an x 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.860
 This is the basic mix. 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.970
 move and see if you're at the point 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.790
 do you want 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.500
 When will I put on my cap? 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.060
 Lights on the burrow I'd rather leave one. 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.239
 a little thicker not to have the 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.940
 risk of leaking and staining the hair is this 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.760
 What causes those polka dots? 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.230
 undesirable 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.879
 This is the part that's going to be a bit 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.940
 different for those who have hair 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:53.099
 virgin as she already has at the ends and I will 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.790
 only discolouring powder in a 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.799
 place where you do not have the 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.010
 I will leave about ten minutes after 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:02.260
 see steps he whole 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.519
 and for those who have to get their hair in there 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.920
 it's not that way 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.609
 if you have something dark black paint 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.260
 like this 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.090
 you may have to go through the 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.859
 tips for later on root 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.049
 but this is subject to another video 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.250
 If you have paint, do not risk it. 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.340
 do not pull the hair look for a 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.340
 professional 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.790
 after 10 minutes you can 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.860
 to observe that there already gave a good race 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.750
 now I will spend the rest of hair 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.450
 call for another 20 minutes 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.819
 in this case how to invade blue is not 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.040
 It is necessary for the hair to 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:38.620
 clear to emphasize why the 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.230
 blue is a dark color so if it stays 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.890
 pulled pro orange yellow does not have a 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.890
 problem 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:52.450
 look how it got rich yellowish 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.260
 bluish greenish blue flag 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.299
 Brazil 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.519
 But it's okay, it'll all be 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.750
 corrected at the time of coloring as I 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.870
 said we will use the coloring 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.780
 dark if it was a light would not work 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.280
 now let's go for the cream mix I 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.410
 I put a good amount of cream 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:13.180
 white each one sees the amount of hair 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:15.280
 What are we trying to do for the color blue? 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.959
 I'll use methylene blue a lot 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.789
 right amount if you want more 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:24.520
 dark colors make more make lighter 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:26.950
 put less in the mixture also use the 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.599
 gentian violet it will help to 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:31.270
 When the hair runs out, it does not 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:33.639
 it's green it's going to put 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.800
 a little bit not so much as the blue 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:38.770
 because otherwise it will get more purple and blue 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.729
 She 's just to break the devil anyway. 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.729
 now it 's just a good move 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:49.969
 plus a hair with shampoo to take away 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.589
 all excess bleaching powder from the 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:54.020
 hair 

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:56.059
 soon after the removal of the cap 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.309
 put a little bit of conditioner 

00:04:56.059 --> 00:05:01.749
 so that the removal of the cap is more 

00:04:58.309 --> 00:05:01.749
 easy and do not want to socialize 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:08.360
 now I wash the whole shampoo well 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:16.159
 to open the 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:18.199
 clean hair cuticles strip the entire 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:20.689
 and excess water comes with the mixture 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:28.520
 passes around the hair then I'll leave 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:30.409
 team about 20 minutes 20 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.229
 past minutinhos I'll rinse well 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:36.469
 this hair take away all the excess of 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:38.479
 and I will also look at the parts that 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:40.699
 stained because you do not have to 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.169
 to do one part or another gets stained 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:44.509
 does not get red wine 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:48.139
 there I come pure methylene blue and 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:50.180
 Rich, where did you hurt later? 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:52.639
 add a little water to give 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.409
 a decrease in methylene blue and I go 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:55.310
 hairs on the hair to give a 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:57.979
 cooled 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:02.240
 I'll leave 15 minutes and then he 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:03.830
 called the hair finished lights now 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.949
 just finish the hair the way you 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.949
 to prefer 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.190
 this is the wet result then blue 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.540
 Very strong 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:20.190
 sometimes it will be a little dry 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:22.080
 and this is the result circus I 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.990
 I finished with the curls I appreciated 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.210
 still the wicks to keep this 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.880
 hair is just to make that little 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:33.240
 cream with methylene blue to violet 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.290
 gentian and spend once a week and 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.960
 there they stopped 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:41.240
 if you liked as always click on 16 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.240
 wrote on the channel and until the next video
