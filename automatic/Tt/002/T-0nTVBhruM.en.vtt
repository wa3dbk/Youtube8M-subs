00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220

in Mexico I think they've either just
graduated<00:03:06.790> or<00:03:06.940> they're<00:03:07.090> still<00:03:07.330> in<00:03:07.570> college

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
path and check out some ruins and then

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.080

recommending The Shining or carry

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:09.329 
recommending The Shining or carry
because<00:06:08.319> I<00:06:08.409> think<00:06:08.469> a<00:06:08.649> lot<00:06:08.679> of<00:06:08.799> people<00:06:09.039> honestly

00:06:09.329 --> 00:06:09.339 
because I think a lot of people honestly

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:11.100 
because I think a lot of people honestly
if<00:06:09.549> they<00:06:09.699> checked<00:06:10.059> out<00:06:10.179> the<00:06:10.299> shining<00:06:10.659> I<00:06:10.779> like<00:06:10.989> I

liked<00:06:11.379> it<00:06:11.559> but<00:06:11.649> I<00:06:11.739> think<00:06:11.919> a<00:06:11.949> lot<00:06:12.069> of<00:06:12.129> people

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:12.519
