00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.460

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.410

 really easy they are delicious not 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.390
 we have practically added sugars 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.540
 so I am in the watermelon mixture 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.460
 light there is only sugar the sweet 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.649
 of the fruit therefore at this point a 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.480
 corner sighet and mature beautiful 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.399
 now begins the film period I am 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.989
 really perfect the fact immediately 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.210
 see how they are done 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.280
 let's start immediately preparing the watermelon 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.350
 therefore it will be enough to remove all of them 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.660
 seeds we cut it into big pieces 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.660
 so then we just removed the 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.000
 you sow blacks and now we just have to 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.059
 blend it well as a blender ad 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.059
 immersion 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.890
 to make color even more vivid 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.620
 add a handful of bowels ve 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.750
 we made it a puree 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.340
 so we simply blend and 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.490
 you can also put le 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.500
 strawberries or if you don't want to, don't put it on 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.150
 just leave the watermelon 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.030
 this however will give the color a 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.229
 just lively and intense 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.009
 we help our ice cream establishments 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:32.170
 me but all a ladle and I put 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.780
 everything in a bowl so I can 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.090
 it gets easier is not filled and everything 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.979
 how much the icicle up to the top why 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.430
 then we will make a coordinated decoration 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.810
 riina, however, if you make popsicles 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.759
 simply to the watermelon of course 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.190
 fill in everything if you want 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.289
 make as we left some space 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.590
 put in the freezer for at least 10 15 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:56.320
 minutes to then make the decoration 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.770
 now let's go to put a little bit of 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:03.009
 yogurt that we are practically recreating 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.630
 let's say the design of the so 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.209
 real curia of the slice 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:11.310
 then the same to the white part na 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:13.450
 that you see when you drag the hurry 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.260
 let's put back in the freezer for a while 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:19.959
 just a handful of minutes to do 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.170
 the last layer then we take a kiwi 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.060
 well ripe and peel it well on its own 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.970
 we put in a blender glass 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.280
 by immersion we add a spoon 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.560
 of brown sugar and furian fine up 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.560
 to get a nice smooth compound 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.640
 now we can therefore do the latter 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.750
 narrow street that would be the peel of the 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.569
 our watermelon 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.900
 so let's put a little bit of the kivu on 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.370
 smoothie in all the molds 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.950
 trying to be precise enough 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.769
 leveling well I think it is a matter of fact 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.599
 only to put toothpicks in 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:59.049
 all the molds we put on then 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:00.819
 the racket and wooden toothpicks i 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.069
 our icicles are ready we have it 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.349
 just removed from the mold look at that 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:08.200
 cute they are they really are really 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.630
 good pests and if you don't have it 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.640
 mold and saw that in the video of the 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.010
 you have asked for the other pitches 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.560
 in many you can use it every 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.390
 Popsicle molds for those who 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.160
 sell friends or even other stores of 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.890
 housewares or if you really don't have 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.680
 nothing a little glass even of those from 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.299
 coffee or simple plastic ones e 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.650
 it's fine, you put it in it 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.720
 nice toothpick is done 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.430
 about the toothpicks also these 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.980
 are you asked so much 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.379
 you can buy in all the stores 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.329
 of well-stocked housewives in this 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:42.489
 period should almost have us 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.049
 surely I very much hope that the 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.730
