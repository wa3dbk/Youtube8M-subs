00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.050 
feature of this map plan right here I've
a<00:01:49.780> wall<00:01:50.560> with<00:01:50.770> her<00:01:51.010> to<00:01:51.160> get<00:01:51.280> inside<00:01:51.550> and<00:01:51.910> I<00:01:52.030> just

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
a wall with her to get inside and I just

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.550 
a wall with her to get inside and I just
made<00:01:52.330> like<00:01:52.540> that<00:01:52.720> just<00:01:52.900> goes<00:01:53.110> one<00:01:53.350> way<00:01:53.530> and

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
made like that just goes one way and

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.320 
made like that just goes one way and
it's<00:01:54.010> also<00:01:54.190> a<00:01:54.310> little<00:01:54.430> bit<00:01:54.550> easier<00:01:54.820> to<00:01:55.180> escape

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
it's also a little bit easier to escape

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.110 
it's also a little bit easier to escape
top<00:01:55.870> of<00:01:56.050> your<00:01:56.230> robber<00:01:57.300> all<00:01:58.300> right<00:01:59.910> it's<00:02:00.910> over

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
here this little area is worth up

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.620 
here this little area is worth up
robbers<00:02:03.340> would<00:02:03.520> spawn<00:02:03.760> right<00:02:04.240> now<00:02:04.360> I<00:02:04.390> can't

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
robbers would spawn right now I can't

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.000 
robbers would spawn right now I can't
really<00:02:04.810> see<00:02:04.930> if<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:05.110> spawn<00:02:05.320> point<00:02:05.560> but<00:02:05.770> one<00:02:05.920> of

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
really see if the spawn point but one of

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.060 
really see if the spawn point but one of
her<00:02:06.510> way<00:02:07.510> right<00:02:07.780> here<00:02:08.080> it's<00:02:08.500> just<00:02:08.740> sort<00:02:09.040> of

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
her way right here it's just sort of

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.730 
her way right here it's just sort of
like<00:02:09.130> old<00:02:09.310> tent<00:02:09.640> area<00:02:09.929> this<00:02:10.929> pallets<00:02:11.350> on<00:02:11.530> top

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
like old tent area this pallets on top

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.640 
like old tent area this pallets on top
too<00:02:12.010> if<00:02:12.790> you<00:02:12.940> cannot<00:02:13.240> do<00:02:13.690> it<00:02:13.810> right<00:02:13.990> up<00:02:14.200> you

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
or at least I think so then back here so

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.030 
or at least I think so then back here so
nice<00:03:11.610> little<00:03:11.850> creates<00:03:12.030> hide<00:03:12.240> behind<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:13.140> this

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
over here this is the warehouse nice

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.420 
over here this is the warehouse nice
little<00:03:16.380> truck<00:03:16.590> outside<00:03:16.770> there's<00:03:17.130> bunch<00:03:17.310> of

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
so once again this is the copies one

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
so once again this is the copies one
point<00:03:40.620> okay<00:03:41.620> now<00:03:41.800> here<00:03:42.130> these<00:03:42.310> are<00:03:42.370> like

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
point okay now here these are like
