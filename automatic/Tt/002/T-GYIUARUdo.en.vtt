they used to be a walkway but generally
speaking<00:03:44.850> this<00:03:45.890> looks<00:03:46.890> pretty<00:03:47.430> much<00:03:47.489> like<00:03:47.700> he

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
speaking this looks pretty much like he

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.580 
speaking this looks pretty much like he
did<00:03:48.180> back<00:03:48.750> then<00:03:49.049> and<00:03:50.600> so<00:03:51.600> does<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:52.019> drive<00:03:52.290> area

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
did back then and so does the drive area

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.270 
did back then and so does the drive area
and<00:03:53.070> so<00:03:53.549> does<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:53.940> Chaplaincy<00:03:54.600> area

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280

and so does the Chaplaincy area
chaplaincy<00:03:56.280> center<00:03:56.730> area<00:03:56.940> which<00:03:57.299> was<00:03:57.540> a<00:03:57.600> car

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
chaplaincy center area which was a car

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.170 
chaplaincy center area which was a car
park<00:03:58.260> then<00:03:58.950> and<00:03:59.190> it's<00:03:59.310> sort<00:03:59.519> of<00:03:59.670> pretty<00:03:59.970> much<00:04:00.060> a

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
park then and it's sort of pretty much a

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.610 
park then and it's sort of pretty much a
car<00:04:00.450> park<00:04:00.750> now<00:04:01.049> and<00:04:01.940> so<00:04:02.940> you<00:04:03.870> know<00:04:03.900> there's

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
car park now and so you know there's

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.080 
car park now and so you know there's
lots<00:04:04.799> of<00:04:04.980> things<00:04:05.040> that<00:04:05.400> have<00:04:05.489> changed<00:04:05.549> but<00:04:05.970> the

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
lots of things that have changed but the

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.510 
lots of things that have changed but the
main<00:04:06.269> thing<00:04:06.299> is<00:04:06.570> the<00:04:06.780> residences<00:04:07.530> and<00:04:07.770> the<00:04:08.340> new

main thing is the residences and the new

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.180 
main thing is the residences and the new
buildings

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
buildings

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.400 
buildings
now<00:04:11.190> we<00:04:11.250> move<00:04:11.520> on<00:04:11.700> to<00:04:11.730> Malcolm<00:04:12.450> well<00:04:13.080> which

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
now we move on to Malcolm well which

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:17.120 
now we move on to Malcolm well which
hasn't<00:04:13.709> changed<00:04:15.350> hardly<00:04:16.350> at<00:04:16.440> all<00:04:16.620> since<00:04:16.950> I

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
hasn't changed hardly at all since I

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.280 
hasn't changed hardly at all since I
remember<00:04:17.609> in<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:17.940> 1980s<00:04:18.690> which<00:04:18.870> is<00:04:18.989> probably

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
remember in the 1980s which is probably

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.949 
remember in the 1980s which is probably
a<00:04:19.530> bad<00:04:19.769> thing<00:04:20.160> considering<00:04:21.000> how<00:04:21.419> it<00:04:21.600> was<00:04:21.750> not<00:04:21.930> a

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
a bad thing considering how it was not a

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
dump then and it's pretty much an utter

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.219 
dump then and it's pretty much an utter
horrible<00:04:25.350> dump<00:04:25.650> now<00:04:25.950> by<00:04:26.220> the<00:04:26.280> look<00:04:26.520> of<00:04:26.610> it<00:04:26.790> and

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
horrible dump now by the look of it and

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.650 
horrible dump now by the look of it and
