can activate him one more time I think

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.990

he does sound like a parakeet the only

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.999 
he does sound like a parakeet the only
thing<00:01:07.210> I<00:01:07.390> have<00:01:07.750> issue<00:01:07.960> with<00:01:08.170> it's<00:01:08.710> the<00:01:08.830> big

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
thing I have issue with it's the big

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:12.350 
thing I have issue with it's the big
holes<00:01:09.340> in<00:01:09.610> his<00:01:09.729> chest<00:01:10.060> the<00:01:10.360> top<00:01:10.569> ones<00:01:10.869> a<00:01:11.020> sensor

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
holes in his chest the top ones a sensor

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.760 
holes in his chest the top ones a sensor
and<00:01:13.360> then<00:01:13.569> the<00:01:13.720> floor<00:01:13.990> in<00:01:14.110> the<00:01:14.200> middle<00:01:14.319> are<00:01:14.619> the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
and then the floor in the middle are the

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.800 
and then the floor in the middle are the
speaker<00:01:15.310> and<00:01:15.729> the<00:01:15.910> bottom<00:01:16.270> ones<00:01:16.479> for<00:01:16.750> the

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
speaker and the bottom ones for the

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.410 
speaker and the bottom ones for the
screw<00:01:17.170> hole<00:01:17.410> I<00:01:17.740> think<00:01:18.250> they<00:01:18.580> could<00:01:18.880> have<00:01:19.119> a

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
screw hole I think they could have a

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.880 
screw hole I think they could have a
little<00:01:19.660> better<00:01:19.990> with<00:01:20.229> that<00:01:20.380> I<00:01:20.440> think<00:01:20.770> they

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
little better with that I think they

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.410 
little better with that I think they
could<00:01:21.069> have<00:01:21.160> put<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:21.429> sensor<00:01:21.700> and<00:01:22.030> his<00:01:22.149> beak

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
could have put the sensor and his beak

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.050 
could have put the sensor and his beak
or<00:01:22.690> his<00:01:22.810> eye<00:01:23.080> and<00:01:23.530> the<00:01:24.280> speaker's<00:01:24.700> could<00:01:24.970> have

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
or his eye and the speaker's could have

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.320 
or his eye and the speaker's could have
been<00:01:25.270> the<00:01:25.450> the<00:01:26.349> battery<00:01:26.709> casing<00:01:27.310> could<00:01:28.240> have

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
been the the battery casing could have

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.089 
been the the battery casing could have
been<00:01:28.450> accessible<00:01:28.990> from<00:01:29.289> the<00:01:29.410> back<00:01:29.619> perhaps

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:30.099 
been accessible from the back perhaps

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:34.230 
been accessible from the back perhaps
but<00:01:30.819> overall<00:01:31.149> he<00:01:31.450> is<00:01:31.599> cute<00:01:32.910> so<00:01:33.910> if<00:01:34.000> you<00:01:34.090> have<00:01:34.209> a
