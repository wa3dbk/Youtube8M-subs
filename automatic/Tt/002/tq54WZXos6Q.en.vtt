00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.350
 Hello you, I greet you all 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.879
 welcome to a new video of 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.580
 me and to my skin and hair 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.200
 routine in the morning during the week and there 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.849
 I always start the day with one 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.170
 shower I got used to that and 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.599
 Although very happy with the shower gel 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.550
 currently rituals that jogi flowed 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.890
 not super delicious donates a lot 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.449
 Moisture it smells phenomenal and 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.789
 especially the consistency is great 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.740
 and then for the harem a shampoo and 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.230
 my flush of gannett review the 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.000
 vanilla milk in pattaya is like it is for 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.920
 me the best thing i use 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.469
 for a very long time and yes donates 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.850
 my hair really well moisture 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.100
 and then used for the body of 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.050
 venus you rich body butter and must 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.210
 say this is a great alternative to 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.399
 glory from above and the plan of the street 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.680
 Taste and then I always do it 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.539
 really separate and that I go after 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.399
 the shower then so to speak yes ans 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.020
 Sink logically and then 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.050
 I wet my whole face 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.449
 one to then immediately with the next 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.800
 to move on, and that's her 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.410
 certainly knows it from many 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.510
 I love my balea ph neutral 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.000
 lotion and I always give it that way 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.590
 Spread a few balls on my hand 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.810
 that then within so i rub 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.760
 terribly nice together and then that 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.710
 whole face and then shy away 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.540
 really good and I have to 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.689
 really say that this product is mine 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.490
 It has improved incredibly well 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.200
 has a little bit in the winter months 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.820
 Some places too dry 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.830
 therefore I have to say but if the 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.450
 Care after that is better for 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.740
 I have not been a problem and it has 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.320
 but already subsided again 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.000
 pimples and and it is actually 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.229
 no more emerged so my 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.119
 has really been very good 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.619
 improved and that's why I can do this 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.420
 recommend product only 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.340
 and if I already foamed that then 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.329
 then I feel it with just 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.329
 lukewarm water 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.270
 and if it is dry then I rub it 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.710
 not but I always take 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.200
 fresh towels I think that is 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.789
 very important right in the face with 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.140
 bacteria and so on as me now 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.450
 really always a fresh action and 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.670
 finally everything gently off so none 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.289
 strong friction or so because the skin yes 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.700
 one way or another very sensitive in the face 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.170
 is definitely with me I'm like that 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.569
 or such a sensitive one 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.510
 and yes, if I did that 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.700
 then my deo is used and that 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.620
 my beloved is allowed maximum protection 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.080
 I love everything and always 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.940
 can recommend again and then I clean 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.799
 my teeth currently with the l max 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.120
 sensitive professional that has mine 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:31.000
 dentist given because I have a time 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.410
 so long has extremely sensitive teeth 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.580
 were so sensitive and I have to say 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.049
 that it is very good of it 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.450
 gone back and that's why I need 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:40.870
 of course, first off and he on 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.660
 and yes plaster medical and 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.709
 then I always use one 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.049
 mouthwash and the time that of all 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.489
 I'll have that 5 and 1 mouthwash 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:50.950
 I'm recommended by the 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.930
 night bittersweet so the nasa de 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.250
 I link you below in the infobox 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.870
 she says that tastes like 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.320
 Chewing gum and I have to say that's right 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.760
 but even if it is cheaper it is 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.829
 not as nice as that of the 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.590
 turiner and while I do it all 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:07.420
 In the mouth for 30 to 40 seconds 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.069
 and spit and use whatever 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.590
 I have a facial water from clinics in 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.569
 the stage 2 pac that simply on ipad 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.880
 and yes here again completely over mine 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.130
 face and so took the last 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.410
 skin dolls down or so pimples 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.750
 that are there or see redness of it 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.880
 that flawlessly away and when I do that 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.829
 then face water then 20 to 30 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.930
 seconds've Leave for use 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.790
 I mean currently favorite eye cream 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.799
 and that of biotherm that's it 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.420
 no ice and I always have it in you 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.459
 favorites video already said it is for 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.290
 me the best eye cream I ever 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.609
 have tried and definitely sit down 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.500
 buy again 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.790
 fend off some of the products that I have 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.170
 in any case, of course, as always 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.660
 to write in the infobox 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.060
 I have to say that this cream is very 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.829
 Year is not thin she is so 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.900
 a bit I gel but it does 

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.129
 unbelievably good at rubbing them 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.260
 So my eyes, you are so 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:58.599
 a little bit of sharing is also on the eye 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.879
 with the leftovers and must say it donates 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:03.010
 so much moisture so that can 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:04.510
 from clinic and not at all 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.890
 It has all my dry spots 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.689
 eliminated and that's why it's one 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:12.400
 Do not really love it every morning 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:15.040
 use then we come to the next one 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.509
 secret tip or my more holy grail 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.479
 I said in the morning was the cream of 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:21.190
 biotherm that's the aqua source and that 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:22.889
 is so reminiscent of an apricot-colored 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.180
 me always a bit of the 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:28.479
 clinique yes that also has the same 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:31.840
 consistency somehow but this product 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:34.060
 is really worth all his money because 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.650
 I have not only through the st 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.580
 I use the evening user but this 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.900
 here so soft this day 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.510
 balanced skin get the trend 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.430
 not he does not redden the 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.690
 dry up too fast though 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.580
 does not stay very long on the 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.990
 Skin is a perfect make-up base 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.180
 and donate for me throughout the day 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.610
 humidity so I really love that 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.080
 idolatrous 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.000
 yes and then the last step 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.889
 It is definitely always one 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.300
 lip care whether it is now the businessman 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:03.010
 Skin and children's cream is a laboratory 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.340
 now in the case of the mail service 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:08.409
 the baby dolls or the labello or 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.030
 nivea it does not matter I always need 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:11.860
 lip care before the make up because 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.419
 after that comes up and then I'll come 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:15.010
 to the hair and that are then 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:17.560
 meanwhile also quite good 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.120
 dried because yes I ruble that one 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.419
 not to knot a bit too much 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.590
 the yes and the first step after 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:25.000
 I dry her so much 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:28.360
 made my klitschko henry is 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.760
 by play and not but it is yes 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.710
 rather a track and I use that 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.710
 Also every day I can mine 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.449
 I can comb hair afterwards 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.949
 also so that it will give dry hair and 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:40.960
 the super through cam I have that too 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.430
 feeling is donating moisture and 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.380
 after is through the temp I use 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.360
 always do my heat protection brilliant then 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.550
 blow-drying my hair I do not know if 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.380
 you notice but I have one 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.529
 new haircut it really went one 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.569
 whole lot 

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:55.069
 I have to say, and that's why I have to 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:57.589
 lately everything has changed 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:06:00.229
 I said, waving my hand 

00:05:57.589 --> 00:06:01.669
 Set my hair and carry it 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:03.439
 then always from the top so the crest 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:07.099
 just sit better and then I have 

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:08.689
 me from remington my gretchen and yes 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:11.509
 I always do that, so to speak 

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:12.709
 ponies outward and classifies the whole thing like that 

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:14.299
 There is a little bit there 

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:15.709
 So it's not really pure 

00:06:14.299 --> 00:06:18.499
 Everything is neat there should only one 

00:06:15.709 --> 00:06:19.819
 a little volume in and the whole stop 

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:21.409
 see structured and not 

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:23.329
 just hang down so flat if I 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:25.189
 she open because I can wear the hair 

00:06:23.329 --> 00:06:27.409
 but still completely to a ponytail 

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:29.899
 make or to a dutch then the whole 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:32.929
 nice fix it with hairspray and then 

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:35.689
 my favorite currently is the beauty 

00:06:32.929 --> 00:06:36.919
 look at oil or foamy beauty oil and 

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:39.679
 I admit because most so in the 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:42.109
 tips just below cleaned the hair 

00:06:39.679 --> 00:06:43.129
 so soon after and yes the leftovers pump 

00:06:42.109 --> 00:06:46.399
 I still go in a bit 

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:49.639
 the hair and root there a bit 

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:51.799
 rum until all I like and what 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:53.509
 shall I say grand this is 

00:06:51.799 --> 00:06:55.429
 my routine that I make every morning 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:56.869
 recently with the haircut I have 

00:06:55.429 --> 00:06:59.299
 also not done before i hope 

00:06:56.869 --> 00:07:00.289
 Of course it has helped and inspired 

00:06:59.299 --> 00:07:02.360
 I would be glad if you were the next 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:03.949
