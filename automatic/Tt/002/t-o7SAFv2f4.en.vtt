attractiveness and ugliness because I

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.310 
attractiveness and ugliness because I
guess<00:01:24.450> what's<00:01:24.659> happening<00:01:25.020> with<00:01:25.140> these

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
themselves in a way which is attractive

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.969 
themselves in a way which is attractive
I<00:01:30.119> don't<00:01:30.990> mean<00:01:31.110> many<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.409> intentionality

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
I don't mean many of the intentionality

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.330 
I don't mean many of the intentionality
of<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.490> but<00:01:32.700> there<00:01:33.680> they've<00:01:34.680> evolved<00:01:35.159> in<00:01:35.250> a

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
of that but there they've evolved in a

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.760 
of that but there they've evolved in a
way<00:01:35.490> which<00:01:36.259> which<00:01:37.259> gives<00:01:37.500> them<00:01:37.650> this

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
way which which gives them this

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.370 
way which which gives them this
presentation<00:01:38.250> or<00:01:38.520> quality<00:01:39.110> makes<00:01:40.110> them<00:01:40.259> very

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
presentation or quality makes them very

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.780 
presentation or quality makes them very
available<00:01:40.770> scar<00:01:41.400> coming

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
available scar coming

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.450 
available scar coming
which<00:01:43.790> makes<00:01:44.030> it<00:01:44.120> very<00:01:44.270> available<00:01:44.630> to<00:01:45.460> animals

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
which makes it very available to animals

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.220 
which makes it very available to animals
like<00:01:46.940> myself<00:01:47.210> but<00:01:47.450> also<00:01:47.540> to<00:01:47.780> birds<00:01:47.990> and

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230 
like myself but also to birds and

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.260 
like myself but also to birds and
squirrels<00:01:48.500> and<00:01:48.830> the<00:01:48.890> Restless<00:01:49.220> stuff<00:01:49.460> so<00:01:50.210> the

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
squirrels and the Restless stuff so the

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.840 
squirrels and the Restless stuff so the
delete<00:01:50.600> them<00:01:50.780> and<00:01:50.930> and<00:01:51.520> propagate<00:01:52.520> the<00:01:52.610> seeds

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
delete them and and propagate the seeds

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.930 
delete them and and propagate the seeds
that<00:01:52.940> way<00:01:54.250> and<00:01:55.250> I<00:01:55.340> think<00:01:55.370> that's<00:01:55.700> a<00:01:55.730> kind<00:01:55.880> of

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
that way and I think that's a kind of

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.720 
that way and I think that's a kind of
aesthetics<00:01:56.420> going<00:01:56.690> on<00:01:56.810> there<00:01:57.050> and<00:01:57.490> this<00:01:58.490> it's

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:58.730 
aesthetics going on there and this it's

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.840 
aesthetics going on there and this it's
I<00:01:59.000> guess<00:01:59.450> links<00:01:59.990> into<00:02:00.260> that<00:02:00.850> developing

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
I guess links into that developing

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.450 
I guess links into that developing
discipline<00:02:02.300> sometimes<00:02:02.780> called<00:02:03.460> evolutionary

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460

evolutionary aesthetics is is that is

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.290 
evolutionary aesthetics is is that is
that<00:02:33.380> that<00:02:33.740> sense<00:02:34.040> of<00:02:34.250> desire<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.090> sense

that that sense of desire and the sense

that that sense of desire and the sense
of<00:02:35.420> wanting<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.930> sense<00:02:36.170> of<00:02:36.230> attractiveness

repulsion and ugliness that we have is

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.660

horrible as a kind of warning signal so

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.599 
horrible as a kind of warning signal so
there's<00:04:14.840> some<00:04:14.959> complexities<00:04:15.739> in<00:04:15.890> that<00:04:16.040> but

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
there's some complexities in that but

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.060 
there's some complexities in that but
broadly<00:04:16.850> speaking<00:04:17.000> I<00:04:17.419> think<00:04:17.450> the<00:04:17.870> the<00:04:18.560> idea<00:04:18.859> is

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
broadly speaking I think the the idea is

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.500 
broadly speaking I think the the idea is
that<00:04:19.810> aesthetics<00:04:20.859> the<00:04:22.150> positive<00:04:23.150> or<00:04:23.240> negative

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
that aesthetics the positive or negative

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.050 
that aesthetics the positive or negative
appeal<00:04:24.050> to<00:04:24.680> the<00:04:24.770> sensors<00:04:25.280> the<00:04:25.460> visual<00:04:25.790> sense

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
appeal to the sensors the visual sense

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.570 
appeal to the sensors the visual sense
bad<00:04:26.270> perhaps<00:04:26.570> but<00:04:26.960> also<00:04:27.080> perhaps<00:04:27.580> the

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
bad perhaps but also perhaps the

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.790 
bad perhaps but also perhaps the
olfactory<00:04:29.210> sense<00:04:29.660> or<00:04:29.900> things<00:04:30.110> smell<00:04:30.350> nice<00:04:30.620> I

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
olfactory sense or things smell nice I

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.760 
olfactory sense or things smell nice I
smell<00:04:30.830> repulsive<00:04:31.930> and<00:04:32.930> maybe<00:04:33.169> to<00:04:33.320> the<00:04:33.350> sensors

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
smell repulsive and maybe to the sensors

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.920 
smell repulsive and maybe to the sensors
as<00:04:33.860> well<00:04:35.050> under<00:04:36.050> pins<00:04:37.540> well<00:04:38.540> does<00:04:38.900> that

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
as well under pins well does that

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.830 
as well under pins well does that
aesthetic<00:04:39.740> appeal<00:04:40.419> come<00:04:41.419> stems<00:04:41.840> out<00:04:42.110> of

aesthetic appeal come stems out of

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.409 
aesthetic appeal come stems out of

in arts practice that took me a lot

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:00.930 
in arts practice that took me a lot
longer<00:04:58.850> to<00:04:59.120> toss<00:04:59.389> this<00:04:59.539> assay<00:04:59.810> than<00:04:59.960> I<00:05:00.020> thought

longer to toss this assay than I thought

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.730 
longer to toss this assay than I thought
anyhow<00:05:01.940> the<00:05:02.000> only<00:05:02.630> bidder<00:05:03.139> wanted<00:05:03.440> to<00:05:03.500> tack<00:05:03.710> on

anyhow the only bidder wanted to tack on
to<00:05:03.979> the<00:05:04.130> end<00:05:04.280> of<00:05:04.430> that<00:05:04.460> and<00:05:04.669> I'll<00:05:04.729> try<00:05:04.910> and

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
to the end of that and I'll try and

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.760 
to the end of that and I'll try and
speak<00:05:05.539> more<00:05:05.720> about<00:05:05.750> this<00:05:06.020> at<00:05:06.139> the<00:05:06.289> time<00:05:06.500> is

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
speak more about this at the time is

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.580 
speak more about this at the time is
that<00:05:07.539> evolutionary<00:05:08.539> aesthetics<00:05:09.110> is<00:05:09.350> about

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
that evolutionary aesthetics is about

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.010 
that evolutionary aesthetics is about
the<00:05:09.740> look<00:05:10.010> of<00:05:10.160> things<00:05:10.340> and<00:05:10.729> the<00:05:10.900> impact<00:05:11.900> that

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
the look of things and the impact that

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.500 
the look of things and the impact that
things<00:05:12.229> make<00:05:12.470> on<00:05:12.620> the<00:05:12.710> sensors<00:05:13.210> things<00:05:14.210> look

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
things make on the sensors things look

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.710 
things make on the sensors things look
the<00:05:14.660> way<00:05:14.780> they<00:05:14.810> do<00:05:15.100> they<00:05:16.120> smell<00:05:17.120> the<00:05:17.389> way<00:05:17.510> they

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
the way they do they smell the way they

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.340 
the way they do they smell the way they
do<00:05:17.780> they<00:05:18.460> taste<00:05:19.460> the<00:05:19.700> way<00:05:19.820> they<00:05:20.030> do<00:05:20.350> because

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
do they taste the way they do because

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.570 
do they taste the way they do because
there<00:05:21.889> is<00:05:22.039> a<00:05:23.889> that's<00:05:24.889> either<00:05:24.979> positive<00:05:25.460> or

there is a that's either positive or

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
negative because they're they have a

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.710

kind of survival value attached to them

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.730 
kind of survival value attached to them
what<00:05:29.840> they<00:05:29.900> did<00:05:30.050> at<00:05:30.139> one<00:05:30.260> time<00:05:30.289> in<00:05:30.650> our

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
what they did at one time in our

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.879 
what they did at one time in our
evolutionary<00:05:31.250> history<00:05:32.500> what<00:05:33.500> I'm<00:05:33.650> quite

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
evolutionary history what I'm quite

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:35.560 
evolutionary history what I'm quite
interested<00:05:34.099> in<00:05:34.520> is<00:05:34.789> not<00:05:34.820> so<00:05:35.150> much<00:05:35.300> the<00:05:35.450> way

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
interested in is not so much the way

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.659 
interested in is not so much the way
they<00:05:35.720> look<00:05:35.979> but<00:05:36.979> how<00:05:37.160> they<00:05:38.680> change<00:05:39.680> I<00:05:40.130> suppose

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
they look but how they change I suppose

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.629 
they look but how they change I suppose
how<00:05:40.910> they<00:05:41.060> change<00:05:41.360> in<00:05:41.630> our<00:05:41.750> imagination<00:05:42.639> how

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:43.639 
how they change in our imagination how

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:49.900 
how they change in our imagination how
we<00:05:45.280> currently<00:05:46.280> get<00:05:46.460> to<00:05:46.580> this<00:05:48.789> what<00:05:49.789> the

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910 
we currently get to this what the

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.700 
we currently get to this what the
difference<00:05:50.300> is<00:05:50.450> between<00:05:50.510> what<00:05:51.020> they<00:05:51.169> are<00:05:51.380> and

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
difference is between what they are and

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.649 
difference is between what they are and
how<00:05:51.919> they<00:05:52.099> appear<00:05:52.550> what<00:05:53.270> kind<00:05:53.539> of

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:53.659 
how they appear what kind of

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:55.590 
how they appear what kind of
transformations<00:05:54.470> are<00:05:54.620> being<00:05:54.830> made

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
transformations are being made

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.700

in<00:05:56.170> that<00:05:57.450> distinction<00:05:58.450> between<00:05:58.810> the<00:05:59.620> way

going<00:06:32.230> on<00:06:32.380> with<00:06:32.650> this<00:06:32.830> certain

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:33.550 
going on with this certain

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.880 
going on with this certain
transformations<00:06:33.940> editing<00:06:34.660> processes<00:06:35.290> are

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:35.890 
transformations editing processes are

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.660 
transformations editing processes are
being<00:06:36.220> affected<00:06:37.530> to<00:06:38.530> this<00:06:38.680> environment<00:06:39.010> which

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:39.670 
being affected to this environment which

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.390 
being affected to this environment which
is<00:06:40.590> transforming<00:06:41.590> the<00:06:41.680> data<00:06:41.890> of<00:06:42.130> the<00:06:42.160> world

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 
is transforming the data of the world

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.220 
is transforming the data of the world
into<00:06:42.670> the<00:06:42.700> stuff<00:06:43.030> of<00:06:43.180> my<00:06:43.330> experience<00:06:43.960> as<00:06:44.110> I'm

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:44.230 
into the stuff of my experience as I'm

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.140 
into the stuff of my experience as I'm
kinda<00:06:44.470> think<00:06:44.710> of<00:06:44.860> and<00:06:45.460> that<00:06:45.790> must<00:06:46.000> be

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.150 
kinda think of and that must be

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.400 
kinda think of and that must be
evolutionary<00:06:46.690> as<00:06:46.810> well<00:06:46.960> there<00:06:47.110> must<00:06:47.170> be<00:06:47.290> an

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:47.410 
evolutionary as well there must be an

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.860 
evolutionary as well there must be an
evolutionary<00:06:47.980> good<00:06:48.220> reason<00:06:48.640> why<00:06:49.180> I<00:06:49.210> can<00:06:49.540> only

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:49.870 
evolutionary good reason why I can only

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.020 
evolutionary good reason why I can only
see<00:06:50.170> the<00:06:50.380> visible<00:06:50.560> the<00:06:51.370> parts<00:06:51.640> of<00:06:51.670> the<00:06:51.760> visible

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.030 
see the visible the parts of the visible

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.180 
see the visible the parts of the visible
spectrum<00:06:52.120> that<00:06:52.420> I<00:06:52.540> can<00:06:52.810> and<00:06:53.470> I<00:06:53.590> can't<00:06:53.830> students

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:54.190 
spectrum that I can and I can't students

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.190 
spectrum that I can and I can't students
of<00:06:54.310> the<00:06:54.370> ultraviolet<00:06:54.910> or<00:06:54.970> infrared<00:06:55.030> or<00:06:55.840> detect

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.030 
wind or those kind of things there's an

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.220 
wind or those kind of things there's an
evolutionary<00:07:01.540> good<00:07:01.690> reason<00:07:02.110> for<00:07:02.290> that<00:07:04.230> and

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:05.230 
evolutionary good reason for that and

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:06.720 
evolutionary good reason for that and
I'd<00:07:05.380> like<00:07:05.560> to<00:07:05.620> think<00:07:05.830> of<00:07:06.010> that<00:07:06.190> as<00:07:06.250> a<00:07:06.460> kind<00:07:06.670> of

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:06.730 
I'd like to think of that as a kind of

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.360 
I'd like to think of that as a kind of
poetic<00:07:06.960> transformation<00:07:08.010> really<00:07:09.010> harking

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:09.370 
poetic transformation really harking

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:10.500 
poetic transformation really harking
back<00:07:09.430> to<00:07:09.580> stuff<00:07:09.880> I'm<00:07:10.000> talking<00:07:10.030> about<00:07:10.300> on<00:07:10.450> the

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:10.510 
back to stuff I'm talking about on the

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.040 
back to stuff I'm talking about on the
other<00:07:10.660> channel<00:07:10.690> right<00:07:11.080> now<00:07:11.140> but<00:07:11.920> there's<00:07:12.100> a

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.050 
other channel right now but there's a

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:15.240 
other channel right now but there's a
poetic<00:07:14.050> transformation<00:07:14.860> taking<00:07:15.100> place

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:15.250 
poetic transformation taking place

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.090 
poetic transformation taking place
between<00:07:15.670> the<00:07:16.000> stuff<00:07:16.180> of<00:07:16.300> the<00:07:16.360> world<00:07:17.010> so<00:07:18.010> it

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:18.100 
between the stuff of the world so it

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:22.910 
between the stuff of the world so it
becomes<00:07:18.370> my<00:07:18.700> stuff<00:07:19.480> of<00:07:19.600> my<00:07:19.720> experience

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:22.920 

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.910 

grounded<00:07:23.920> in<00:07:24.150> adaptation<00:07:25.150> and<00:07:25.920> the

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:26.920 
grounded in adaptation and the

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.420 
grounded in adaptation and the
contingencies<00:07:27.700> of<00:07:27.730> evolution<00:07:28.330> and<00:07:28.800> that<00:07:29.800> is

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:30.430 
contingencies of evolution and that is

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.530 
contingencies of evolution and that is
best<00:07:30.730> thought<00:07:30.940> of<00:07:31.000> as<00:07:31.210> a<00:07:31.270> kind<00:07:31.510> of

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:31.540 
best thought of as a kind of

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:38.400 
best thought of as a kind of
evolutionary<00:07:31.740> poetics<00:07:32.740> a<00:07:35.130> long<00:07:36.130> time
