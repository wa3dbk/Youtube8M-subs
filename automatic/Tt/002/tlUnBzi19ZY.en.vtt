00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
purpose of this we're going to use the

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.250 
purpose of this we're going to use the
two<00:00:23.100> most<00:00:23.279> generic<00:00:23.609> characters<00:00:24.109> as<00:00:25.109> the

two most generic characters as the

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.830 
two most generic characters as the
computers<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.949> see<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.699> have<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:27.150> squad<00:00:27.539> list

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
computers and see you have a squad list

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.810 
computers and see you have a squad list
you<00:00:28.109> can<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.680> can<00:00:28.830> change<00:00:29.070> squad<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.670> that

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
you can you can change squad so that

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.490

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
you're on the same team as somebody or

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.310 
you're on the same team as somebody or
by<00:00:32.160> yourself<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.899> every<00:00:33.899> single<00:00:33.930> character

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
by yourself and every single character

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.870 
by yourself and every single character
can<00:00:34.620> have<00:00:34.739> be<00:00:34.860> on<00:00:34.950> their<00:00:35.100> own<00:00:35.130> squad<00:00:35.579> or<00:00:35.760> like

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
can have be on their own squad or like

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.610 
can have be on their own squad or like
you<00:00:36.030> know<00:00:36.059> do<00:00:36.630> characters<00:00:37.050> can<00:00:37.200> be<00:00:37.260> on<00:00:37.410> supply

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
you know do characters can be on supply

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.170 
you know do characters can be on supply
think<00:00:37.860> it's<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> max<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.340> two<00:00:38.520> characters<00:00:38.940> per

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
think it's a max of two characters per

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.000 
think it's a max of two characters per
se<00:00:39.450> it's<00:00:39.780> actually<00:00:40.020> three<00:00:40.469> characters<00:00:40.860> per

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
se it's actually three characters per

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.160 
se it's actually three characters per
squad<00:00:41.280> but<00:00:41.520> that's<00:00:42.059> really<00:00:42.510> hard<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.840> one

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
squad but that's really hard to one

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.810 
squad but that's really hard to one
person<00:00:43.410> versus<00:00:43.920> three<00:00:44.100> people<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:44.550> not<00:00:44.700> many
