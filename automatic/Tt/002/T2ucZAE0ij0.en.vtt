00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.650
 ali made me people and sincerely 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.359
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.530
 it is unfortunately very very much again 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.330
 long ago, but we may have one 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.580
 I have heard another channel now 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.859
 finally managed all my exams 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.480
 that means I do not have any school anymore 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.730
 I have no more exams and I have to 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.160
 no noise for the first time 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.369
 which is in itself very liberating and 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.779
 if you want to hear more then 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.740
 you can in the description of the 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.510
 click first link 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.489
 because then I have the video 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.480
 linked from another channel and 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.239
 I have a bit closer to that 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.309
 Well, yes, at least I am 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.469
 a hired industrial businessman and 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.960
 That's why I have now 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.550
 more time so and last two weeks 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.440
 I celebrated myself a little bit year 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.390
 relaxed and therefore came only now 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.110
 times nothing like you see I am now 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.020
 here yes diligently tinkering s.dem testsystem 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.899
 I do not like everything here 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.449
 so good especially the included 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.350
 fan and so the general volume 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:10.680
 So it's okay and everyone would say 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.780
 that would be silent but I thought that would be 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.830
 but a little quieter but no matter 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.150
 to that then another video more me 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.939
 turn the ten times very briefly 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.700
 a little bit so they are beautiful again 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.170
 Both are also in contact with each other 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.430
 These red things shine so beautifully 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.400
 you can certainly somehow 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.890
 recognize the fans also light up 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.360
 Everyone is sitting there relatively bright you can see 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:42.180
 it is not quite as I make it something 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:44.070
 darker for a moment so the light here 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.680
 even a bit now 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.869
 I would say better 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.899
 therefore, they are shining respectively 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.360
 The LED fans are real very chic 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.439
 you can not say otherwise 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.630
 maybe you hear the pc too 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.960
 Of course, a little more of it shines 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.960
 also 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.530
 the cooler here is absolutely silent so 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.750
 you can recommend it to anyone but 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.940
 maybe I'll do that again 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:15.070
 small test or so but definitely 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:20.560
 an invariable recommendation for the 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:23.080
 tablet macho hno 2g brick heather already 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.560
 Exactly says I 'll do the light first 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.330
 back to 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.930
 So there you are looking forward too 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.340
 it better she is quite fancy 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.910
 of course compared to my course 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.930
 the housing I say times very cheesy 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.230
 I think that's the right one 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.230
 word for it 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:44.910
 and I will be back next unfortunately 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.430
 not yet in the graphics card test 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:53.020
 because there is a bit more expensive 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:55.420
 I am also on the weekend now 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.910
 back in bremen with my girlfriend from 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.540
 therefore, this week will be anyway 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.489
 nothing but I will be the first one first 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.980
 video from the list do what you want 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.140
 has voted and that the monitor 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.180
 Consulting that means I will each one 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:14.080
 or two or maybe even three 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.150
 Monitors in the range of 100 200 300 and 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.459
 maybe even recommend 500 euros 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.980
 and that will be the next video 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.690
 but his graphic test comes then 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.350
 hopefully directly behind it 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:29.950
 hopefully next week as well 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:34.060
 the proportion again at a little bit 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.680
 light but good I do not remember 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.940
 which was in second place at the 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.070
 vote that I have to look again 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.459
 and that would be relative 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:44.850
 In a timely manner, everyone else will come 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:48.010
 Of course, videos will come 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.019
 that's just his list where i am 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.850
 because the priorities can be set that way 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.440
 that means it will be all videos 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.570
 probably one might come 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.120
 not right or the last one or 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.600
 penultimate not even look but im 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.860
 basically everyone should come 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.660
 Also new here is mine 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.340
 internet may also have 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.980
 some already seen on facebook 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.079
 I or my facebook page here 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.700
 that the test system once a 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.410
 TV is connected that is that 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:19.560
 it right here 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:22.770
 the test system in operation that is 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.540
 120,000 line should be enough for now 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.930
 important to me is not the download 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:30.810
 but the upload of 6 mbit and that 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.130
 is really cool because I can 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.730
 then the video much faster 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.820
 Upload 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.240
 about a little bit more than twice that way 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.070
 fast 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.850
 compared to a 50,000 line 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:45.420
 with 25 mbit upload there are of course 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:49.010
 also some people with such very poor whole 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.490
 bad on the internet 0.14 upload and 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.010
 1963 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.090
 I really could not live with that 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:58.440
 people definitely have my condolences 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.630
 I also had to live a long time with 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.370
 a line but now it is to 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:08.940
 happiness would be much better 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:12.990
 I tell myself yes overclock video is 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:17.070
 I'm still doing that, too 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:18.480
 I have not been able to continue like 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.860
 I said the last days and 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.060
 weeks a bit first relaxed 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.520
 but definitely is coming especially now 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.820
 I just do not have to learn anything anymore that is 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.560
 very well 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.560
 and what else have I forgotten? 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:37.950
 overclock pc oh so if synonymous if you 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.430
 the whole specifications of the 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:43.470
 test system listed again 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.820
 you want to know me then 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.460
 say I try mine 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.900
 to tinker description 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:53.040
 what the test system actually consists of 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:54.750
 So so cpu graphics card that have the 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:59.510
 most likely seen that 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.510
 here this is the palit store mix 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:07.090
 oh yes and that he forgot too here 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:09.550
 are beautiful Amazon package that is 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.920
 passing a parcel he had said and 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:16.120
 I'll be there soon 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:19.540
 Pretty things test by teen vogue 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:21.850
 level I think that's exactly what it has 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.050
 Give me a dear gentleman from the 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.870
 marketing department I believe 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:28.840
 sent by kimi view i hope that 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:31.510
 that's what it's supposed to mean 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.630
 bluetooth 4.0 be that possible 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:36.370
 then just relax 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:38.200
 I hope this is in one of the 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.720
 cars available here 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.970
 but I think that is quite 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.100
 interesting especially for you later 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.380
 I had most of a little younger 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.850
 but later maybe that will be for you 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.640
 also very interesting if he times 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:53.380
 have a car and then drive 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.150
 bluetooth in the car is not bad 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:59.140
 and if we do not have that at home 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:01.330
 then part of it is quite useful so that 

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.130
 Also comes so now that's it but 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.610
 really as long as the video thought 

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:07.840
 not be anymore 

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:11.380
 now I should have said everything 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.790
 if not then it does not matter to me 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.820
 keep on happily 

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:17.260
 few programs maybe over 

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.610
 tactically enter the process 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:23.440
 a little bit as said before that comes 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:27.880
 a video processor is an i5 4670 

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:29.770
 k and that is relatively well known 

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.500
 processor or so mainstream 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:36.760
 moderately and then when I overclock the 

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:38.200
 I think it's best because one 

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.120
 Six-kernels overclock that one more 

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.440
 little something other than a 4- core 

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.650
 overclock and then I prefer to do it 

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.780
 land of a 4-schooner because most 

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.770
 of you will just have to be in five like that 

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.750
 OK 

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.700
 that's what it's meant to be people I'm glad 

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.120
 I'll be back to videos soon 

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.970
 can 

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:59.820
 go in and see you in the 

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:59.820
 next week again bite then giotto
