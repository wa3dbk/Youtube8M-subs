00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
Forsberg not NASCAR director what's the

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.189 
Forsberg not NASCAR director what's the
difference<00:00:14.009> drifting<00:00:14.370> is<00:00:14.610> not<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.480> race<00:00:15.809> it's

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
difference drifting is not a race it's

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.220 
difference drifting is not a race it's
more<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.190> show<00:00:17.460> it's<00:00:17.789> like<00:00:18.359> action<00:00:18.810> sport

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
more of a show it's like action sport

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.990 
more of a show it's like action sport
the<00:00:19.500> idea<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:20.100> look<00:00:20.279> like<00:00:20.340> you're<00:00:20.640> about<00:00:20.820> to

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
the idea is to look like you're about to

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.929 
the idea is to look like you're about to
crash<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:22.189> that's<00:00:23.189> what<00:00:23.340> makes<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.910> most

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
crash and that's what makes it the most

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.820 
crash and that's what makes it the most
exciting<00:00:24.600> obviously<00:00:25.050> pushing<00:00:25.470> right<00:00:25.710> up

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
exciting obviously pushing right up

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.109 
exciting obviously pushing right up
against<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.070> wall<00:00:26.250> staying<00:00:26.580> in<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.760> gas<00:00:26.910> and

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
against the wall staying in the gas and

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.370 
against the wall staying in the gas and
powering<00:00:27.420> through<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.840> especially<00:00:28.109> in

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
powering through it and especially in

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.720 
powering through it and especially in
tandem<00:00:28.590> competition<00:00:29.099> just<00:00:29.250> getting<00:00:29.519> right<00:00:29.699> up

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
tandem competition just getting right up

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.910 
tandem competition just getting right up
on<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.029> lead<00:00:30.840> driver<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.410> being<00:00:31.590> able<00:00:31.679> to

mimic<00:00:32.099> another<00:00:32.969> cards<00:00:33.300> action<00:00:33.719> while

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
mimic another cards action while

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.690 
mimic another cards action while
drifting<00:00:34.440> through<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.890> course<00:00:35.309> at<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.520> same

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
drifting through a course at the same

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.520 
drifting through a course at the same
time<00:00:35.880> yes<00:00:36.780> we<00:00:36.960> do<00:00:40.670> oh<00:00:41.670> well<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:42.719> pretty

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
time yes we do oh well it's pretty

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.440 
time yes we do oh well it's pretty
difficult<00:00:43.890> because<00:00:44.399> there's<00:00:44.670> not<00:00:45.000> too<00:00:45.270> much

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
difficult because there's not too much

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.450 
difficult because there's not too much
training<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.440> can<00:00:46.620> do<00:00:46.739> for<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.100> just<00:00:47.250> kind<00:00:47.430> of

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
training you can do for you just kind of

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.850 
training you can do for you just kind of
got<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.700> dive<00:00:47.879> into<00:00:48.120> it<00:00:48.450> I'm<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.860> self-taught

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
got to dive into it I'm a self-taught

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.400 
got to dive into it I'm a self-taught
I've<00:00:50.219> took<00:00:50.969> me<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.449> few<00:00:51.629> years<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.930> figure<00:00:52.170> it

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
I've took me a few years to figure it

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.090 
I've took me a few years to figure it
out<00:00:52.500> but<00:00:52.829> now<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.670> ah<00:00:54.770> actually<00:00:55.770> not<00:00:56.070> that

gonna ask you to teach me by now I'm
just<00:01:04.920> get<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.220> trouble<00:01:08.420> so<00:01:09.420> if<00:01:09.689> guys<00:01:09.900> or<00:01:10.290> girls

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
just get in trouble so if guys or girls

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.740 
just get in trouble so if guys or girls
want<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.040> get<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.430> drifting<00:01:11.850> what's<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
want to get in and drifting what's the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.590 
want to get in and drifting what's the
first<00:01:12.990> step<00:01:13.439> first<00:01:14.340> step<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:14.970> get<00:01:15.540> a

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
first step first step is to get a

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.050 
first step first step is to get a
rear-wheel<00:01:16.080> drive<00:01:16.200> car<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.939> after<00:01:17.939> that

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
rear-wheel drive car and after that

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.210 
rear-wheel drive car and after that
there's<00:01:18.390> only<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.170> couple<00:01:19.229> small

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
there's only a couple small

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.679 
there's only a couple small
modifications<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.180> might<00:01:21.330> want<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.630> do

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
modifications that you might want to do

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.630 
modifications that you might want to do
to<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.930> car<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.140> help<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.590> slide<00:01:22.740> better<00:01:23.310> and

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
to the car to help it slide better and

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.510 
to the car to help it slide better and
then<00:01:24.210> it's<00:01:24.830> essentially<00:01:25.830> just<00:01:25.890> seat<00:01:26.310> time

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
then it's essentially just seat time

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.249 
then it's essentially just seat time
it's<00:01:26.759> just<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:27.090> lot<00:01:27.299> of<00:01:27.450> seat<00:01:27.630> time<00:01:27.659> you're

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
it's just a lot of seat time you're

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.929 
it's just a lot of seat time you're
you're<00:01:28.680> never<00:01:29.130> going<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.369> figure<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.610> out<00:01:29.759> just

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
you're never going to figure it out just

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.640 
you're never going to figure it out just
kind<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.210> sitting<00:01:30.570> around<00:01:30.659> wait<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.470> have

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
kind of sitting around wait and you have

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:32.870 
kind of sitting around wait and you have
to<00:01:31.829> just<00:01:31.979> get<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.340> car<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.549> go<00:01:32.729> out<00:01:32.850> and

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
to just get in the car and go out and

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.300 
to just get in the car and go out and
spin<00:01:33.840> out<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.020> bunch<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.320> times<00:01:34.409> but<00:01:34.770> that's<00:01:35.070> why

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
spin out a bunch of times but that's why

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.620 
spin out a bunch of times but that's why
I<00:01:35.369> was<00:01:35.520> saying<00:01:35.700> if<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.000> have<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.210> place<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.479> go

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
I was saying if you have a place to go
