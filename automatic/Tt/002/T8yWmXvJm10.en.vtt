00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.750
 hello everyone here charlie welcome to 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.340
 a new gifted video today we're going to 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.650
 redo a video opening chests 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.689
 since they have left two new chests in 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.800
 the last update and good are the 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:19.900
 very interesting chests that also 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.039
 introduce a new mechanic that I believe 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.990
 which is quite important for everything 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.000
 this kind of videos as you know before 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.500
 when I saw a chest the possibility that 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.840
 you drop an item that has that 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.640
 chest was totally random always 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.649
 There were certain items that could fall 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.170
 with random codes and then there was one that 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.370
 it was like especially weird I think what 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.410
 they called it was because it was the new intel 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.510
 cover a super special item a 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.730
 legendary a mythical etc. very good 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.930
 since from this last party with these 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.149
 two confesses translates a new mechanics 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.890
 that these chests work and in all 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:49.750
 the previous ones that is basically what 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.350
 ago is that you do not point cash repeated 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.730
 that is, if a chest has eight items 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.110
 when you open a chest you coach one 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.000
 but when he speaks he feels he is not going to 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.680
 to be able to play repeated that's great 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.450
 because logically you do not have repeated 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.280
 that normally then when you open with 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.629
 strawberry is the last thing you want and what 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.369
 good is that we say that if you buy 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.840
 in several chests could several keys 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.880
 you could technically get all the 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.630
 items of 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.700
 without worrying except the weird let's say 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.780
 the special courier the super mythical 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.460
 legendary does not fall within this as 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.380
 he calls you in rotation I think not 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.850
 touch to repeated but the items 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.320
 Chest normal from now no 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.240
 they will be repeated until you buy 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.490
 everything is to say if you have 8 and you buy eight 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.259
 keys open another eight chests in the 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.549
 ninth it reboots the account and 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.259
 they can touch you again logically 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.880
 because there is no more and we have three of 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.069
 chest so we found today we are going to 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.560
 open the 3rd of their arms another day 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:42.599
 I will open the king of andy that is another 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.490
 version of it because I'm missing 

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:45.659
 still two I want to open four decade 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.490
 these chests cool a lot because 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.340
 they also have sets these did not even have 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.560
 300 complete sets have a set for the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.830
 lifestyle is a set for you knight 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.049
 a set for abdul and a set for faceless 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.360
 void and the power the power of 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:02.819
 reward is the super special that is the 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.950
 what I want is to sell spirit 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:06.509
 this is the legendary one that has the 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.519
 legendary halls and the mythical head 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.190
 I think because he is a hero that I loved 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.780
 in the fool spirit then to see if a 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.040
 little luck I get this one that does not come 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.300
 within the rotation but with these 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.650
 four keys yes no 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.950
 I'm going to make sure that I fall 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.180
 these four so let's go over there we 're going to 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.060
 open the first 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.750
 and give me the set of 20 it was spirit valve the 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.270
 giant the most expensive dome 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.750
 the face I'm going now I do not know if they go to 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.750
 end of the video 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.220
 It's not my favorite face I'm going but 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.320
 well you see that you are 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.730
 like shading because this is not going to 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.330
 touch us port with our three or 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.510
 better spirit 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.620
 come there is not a set of the life thriller 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.490
 which is the first one there is one of these 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.560
 that is very cool 3 knight at the moment 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.450
 we are lucky 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.530
 Well, that's because this is the exile that 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.360

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.470

 It is also the presence of a set of 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.500
 pastor in chests the actor is also the 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.500

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.670
 horns and back spikes and a 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:14.680
 belt with a chain and even more 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.680
