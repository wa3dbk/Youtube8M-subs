00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
circular motions and then i just blend

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.840 
circular motions and then i just blend
it<00:01:01.739> out<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.890> little<00:01:02.190> bit<00:01:02.430> more<00:01:02.609> with<00:01:02.820> a

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.750 
the intensity of the highlight color was
lost<00:01:12.630> from<00:01:12.869> blending<00:01:13.409> i<00:01:13.680> am<00:01:13.860> going<00:01:14.220> back<00:01:14.430> in

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
lost from blending i am going back in

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:23.390 
lost from blending i am going back in
and<00:01:15.330> adding<00:01:16.049> a<00:01:16.170> little<00:01:16.409> bit<00:01:16.560> more<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:22.189> back<00:01:23.189> to

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
which is like the 217 equivalent and I'm

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:51.370 
which is like the 217 equivalent and I'm
applying<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.740> in<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.369> soft<00:01:41.790> circular<00:01:42.090> motion

after<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:05.039> I'm<00:02:05.189> going<00:02:05.520> with<00:02:05.819> this<00:02:06.630> small

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
after that I'm going with this small

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.540 
after that I'm going with this small
shader<00:02:07.259> brush<00:02:07.350> into<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:07.979> color<00:02:08.250> called

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
shader brush into this color called

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.449 
shader brush into this color called
silver<00:02:09.060> appropriately<00:02:10.050> enough<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.649> I

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
silver appropriately enough and I

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.479

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.350 
actually sprayed my brush with fix+
just<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.209> give<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.480> a<00:02:15.810> more<00:02:16.160> intense

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
just to give it a more intense

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.180 
just to give it a more intense
appearance<00:02:18.360> on<00:02:18.569> that<00:02:18.750> silver<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:19.950> I'm

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
appearance on that silver so I'm

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.309 
appearance on that silver so I'm
applying<00:02:20.640> that<00:02:20.819> in<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.209> dabbing<00:02:21.450> motion<00:02:21.630> and

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
applying that in a dabbing motion and

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.500 
applying that in a dabbing motion and
then<00:02:22.560> just<00:02:23.250> keep<00:02:23.430> packing<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:23.970> on<00:02:24.060> until<00:02:24.450> you

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
then just keep packing it on until you

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.020 
then just keep packing it on until you
get<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:24.989> desired<00:02:25.349> intensity<00:02:26.130> on<00:02:26.340> that<00:02:26.579> eye<00:02:26.790> I
