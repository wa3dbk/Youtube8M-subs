00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.420
 this one when you 're going to use a 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.560

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.049
 different skills of the landlord will 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.789

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.299
 put each skill in place like this 

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:40.209
 in the bar here in the quick conjuration 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:45.709
 Quick build type of one is the q2 we 

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:48.289
 r I like to leave the adornment that too 

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:51.560
 I need to attack and it's night and I 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:54.229

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.380
 Okay, okay village. 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.489
 look at the difference of the smart cast change 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.469

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.729
 time to change 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:10.320
 look that 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.570
 and it does not matter the type if you pass from 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.680
 maximum regime looks only yields the maximum 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.510
 what is this 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.750

 change the type you do it here 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.540
 type will have to see where it will go 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.810
 click here it makes you very light 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.190
 type will give an advantage of your 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.300
 opponent because you're going to have to 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.770
 turn and go since the avaí and it goes 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.920
 to be with the smart cast you will 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.600
 screw if you are so this is it 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.120
 basically what is a cast 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.660

 also with catarina also the same thing 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:34.140
 The same thing, I also like to let 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.730

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.489

 You will click on your enemy will give 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.000
 relapsed will open the surrendered relapse goes 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.130
 stay in it 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.110
 This is going to take a lot of your time. 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.220
 if you have with qat smart it 's just you 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.500
 clicking on it 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.720
 then you lose the slot that is falling 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.549
 Kind's going to be great here near 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.410
 one she already uses type will not open that you 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:01.110
 rend you will click it it's just you 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.459
 have the mouse on it is near 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.680
 This makes it much more practical and more 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.049
 quick leave your questions and also in a 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.049
 comment types have any questions of 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:12.660
 what to do about such a type law 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:16.109
 how to play against a tarp 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:18.690
 It's difficult, it's not like playing 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.560
 against the trash like playing against one 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.120
 Social 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.130
 but still leaves a comment that is 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.169
 responding to the type I make a 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.790
 video taking a relative of who 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.010
 asked and left the question on the screen 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.260
 and responding at the same time it will be 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.460
 pretty cool how to do it but kind of need 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.919

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.540

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.510

 you do not need to do any of this 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.370
 because it was only a quick video 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.919
 explaining more cast 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.330

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:05.610
 inscribed in the channel is when you enter the 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.130
 youtube will show that I sent a

 get updates from my pilots 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.700
 so this is more practical for those who 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:20.639
 follows if you do not fall 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:23.040
 notifications and that's it. 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:26.460
