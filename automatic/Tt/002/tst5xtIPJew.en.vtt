enabled device to you overdrive to get

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.619 
enabled device to you overdrive to get
your<00:00:55.409> signal<00:00:55.739> but<00:00:56.460> figured<00:00:57.269> we<00:00:57.359> walk<00:00:57.600> through

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
your signal but figured we walk through

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.989 
your signal but figured we walk through
kind<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.260> how<00:00:58.409> that<00:00:58.469> happens<00:00:59.100> I'll<00:00:59.699> do<00:00:59.879> it

00:00:59.989 --> 00:00:59.999 
kind of how that happens I'll do it

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:01.430 
kind of how that happens I'll do it
generically<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.809> then<00:01:00.929> it<00:01:01.019> can<00:01:01.109> apply<00:01:01.379> to

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
generically and then it can apply to

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.280 
generically and then it can apply to
these<00:01:01.710> different<00:01:02.039> devices<00:01:02.300> so<00:01:03.300> let<00:01:03.690> let's

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
these different devices so let let's

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.080 
these different devices so let let's
pull<00:01:04.470> out<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.710> overdrive<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.400> start<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:06.000> up

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
pull out the overdrive and start it up

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:14.410 
pull out the overdrive and start it up
and<00:01:06.300> we'll<00:01:06.390> walk<00:01:06.840> through<00:01:06.870> a<00:01:07.320> little<00:01:07.590> bit<00:01:07.620> here

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.940 

so<00:01:15.420> here's<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.810> overdrive<00:01:16.260> to<00:01:16.740> get<00:01:16.860> it

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
so here's the overdrive to get it

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.639 
so here's the overdrive to get it
started<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.580> just<00:01:17.790> press<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.210> hold<00:01:18.240> on<00:01:18.659> the

0 62 I'm not sure if each overdrive has
their<00:02:55.990> own<00:02:56.100> default<00:02:57.100> password<00:02:57.580> if<00:02:57.700> they<00:02:57.790> all

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:32.399 
there we go we got the mobile gadget or
pop<00:04:31.059> enough<00:04:31.299> now<00:04:31.479> let<00:04:31.599> me<00:04:31.629> just<00:04:31.689> check<00:04:32.019> a

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:32.409 
pop enough now let me just check a

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:34.799 
pop enough now let me just check a
signal<00:04:32.889> here<00:04:33.069> on<00:04:33.369> the<00:04:33.519> overdrive<00:04:33.819> so<00:04:34.629> here's

00:04:34.799 --> 00:04:34.809 
signal here on the overdrive so here's

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:36.619 
signal here on the overdrive so here's
the<00:04:34.929> overdrive<00:04:35.349> we<00:04:35.589> see<00:04:35.799> that<00:04:36.009> the<00:04:36.189> signals

00:04:36.619 --> 00:04:36.629 
the overdrive we see that the signals

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:40.169 
the overdrive we see that the signals
it's<00:04:37.629> got<00:04:37.749> two<00:04:37.929> bars<00:04:38.139> a<00:04:38.649> 3g<00:04:39.189> now<00:04:39.519> I<00:04:39.549> haven't

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:40.179 
it's got two bars a 3g now I haven't

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:43.199 
it's got two bars a 3g now I haven't
tried<00:04:40.360> this<00:04:40.509> on<00:04:41.099> this<00:04:42.099> new<00:04:42.429> device<00:04:42.939> and

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:43.209 
tried this on this new device and

00:04:43.209 --> 00:04:45.629 
tried this on this new device and
browser<00:04:43.389> let's<00:04:43.779> see<00:04:44.199> if<00:04:44.469> we<00:04:44.679> go<00:04:44.829> to<00:04:44.889> overdrive

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
browser let's see if we go to overdrive

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.359 
browser let's see if we go to overdrive
if<00:04:45.909> we<00:04:46.029> can<00:04:46.149> actually<00:04:46.419> manage<00:04:46.919> the<00:04:47.919> overdrive

00:04:48.359 --> 00:04:48.369 
if we can actually manage the overdrive

00:04:48.369 --> 00:04:51.979 
if we can actually manage the overdrive
from<00:04:48.669> the<00:04:48.789> Safari<00:04:49.239> browser<00:04:49.539> on<00:04:49.899> the<00:04:50.199> iPad

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:51.989 
from the Safari browser on the iPad

00:04:51.989 --> 00:04:54.209 
from the Safari browser on the iPad
should<00:04:52.989> just<00:04:53.139> be<00:04:53.259> able<00:04:53.289> to<00:04:53.439> type<00:04:53.619> in<00:04:53.769> overdrive

00:04:54.209 --> 00:04:54.219 
should just be able to type in overdrive

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:58.289 
should just be able to type in overdrive
and<00:04:54.699> there<00:04:54.849> we<00:04:54.939> go<00:04:56.159> so<00:04:57.159> as<00:04:57.489> you<00:04:57.759> can<00:04:57.849> see<00:04:58.059> it

00:04:58.289 --> 00:04:58.299 
and there we go so as you can see it

00:04:58.299 --> 00:05:01.619 
and there we go so as you can see it
actually<00:04:58.809> works<00:04:59.049> right<00:04:59.649> on<00:04:59.860> the<00:05:00.149> iPad<00:05:01.149> I'm<00:05:01.449> not

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:01.629 
actually works right on the iPad I'm not

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:03.179 
actually works right on the iPad I'm not
sure<00:05:01.689> if<00:05:01.929> that<00:05:01.989> works<00:05:02.259> on<00:05:02.409> the<00:05:02.529> iphone<00:05:02.649> or<00:05:03.039> not

00:05:03.179 --> 00:05:03.189 
sure if that works on the iphone or not

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:05.489 
sure if that works on the iphone or not
so<00:05:03.969> there<00:05:04.119> you<00:05:04.149> go<00:05:04.239> this<00:05:04.569> is<00:05:04.719> a<00:05:04.749> I'll<00:05:05.169> show<00:05:05.349> this

your overdrive and manage it and see the

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:16.739 
your overdrive and manage it and see the
signal<00:05:15.399> strength<00:05:15.579> you<00:05:16.089> can<00:05:16.179> see<00:05:16.329> the<00:05:16.419> battery

00:05:16.739 --> 00:05:16.749 
signal strength you can see the battery

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:18.749 
signal strength you can see the battery
remaining<00:05:16.989> is<00:05:17.199> ninety-seven<00:05:17.739> percent<00:05:17.769> does

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:18.759 
remaining is ninety-seven percent does

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:20.609 
remaining is ninety-seven percent does
the<00:05:18.879> weak<00:05:19.029> signal<00:05:19.449> right<00:05:19.599> now<00:05:19.749> at<00:05:19.929> ten<00:05:20.139> percent

00:05:20.609 --> 00:05:20.619 
the weak signal right now at ten percent

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:23.639 
the weak signal right now at ten percent
or<00:05:21.039> I'm<00:05:21.279> at<00:05:21.899> so<00:05:22.899> these<00:05:23.050> won't<00:05:23.259> be<00:05:23.379> very<00:05:23.529> good

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:23.649 
or I'm at so these won't be very good

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:25.139 
or I'm at so these won't be very good
speed<00:05:24.039> test<00:05:24.309> but<00:05:24.459> at<00:05:24.550> least<00:05:24.639> show<00:05:24.849> you<00:05:24.909> how<00:05:25.089> to

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:25.149 
speed test but at least show you how to

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:27.119 
speed test but at least show you how to
connect<00:05:25.779> the<00:05:26.019> overdrive<00:05:26.499> when<00:05:26.679> you<00:05:26.769> do<00:05:26.919> have<00:05:26.949> a

00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:27.129 
connect the overdrive when you do have a

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:29.579 
connect the overdrive when you do have a
signal<00:05:27.549> area<00:05:27.999> and<00:05:28.269> this<00:05:28.899> particular<00:05:29.079> room<00:05:29.469> of

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:29.589 
signal area and this particular room of

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:30.989 
signal area and this particular room of
my<00:05:29.679> house<00:05:29.860> doesn't<00:05:30.339> usually<00:05:30.489> get<00:05:30.759> a<00:05:30.819> good

00:05:30.989 --> 00:05:30.999 
my house doesn't usually get a good

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:33.059 
my house doesn't usually get a good
signal<00:05:31.179> with<00:05:31.479> pretty<00:05:31.749> much<00:05:31.839> any<00:05:32.019> carrier<00:05:32.379> so

00:05:33.059 --> 00:05:33.069 
signal with pretty much any carrier so

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:34.889 
signal with pretty much any carrier so
it<00:05:33.219> varies<00:05:33.429> when<00:05:34.059> I'm<00:05:34.149> out<00:05:34.239> in<00:05:34.269> the<00:05:34.419> road<00:05:34.539> it's

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:34.899 
it varies when I'm out in the road it's

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:38.449 
it varies when I'm out in the road it's
quite<00:05:35.199> good<00:05:35.379> actually<00:05:36.809> so<00:05:37.809> that's<00:05:37.959> a<00:05:38.050> look<00:05:38.169> at

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:38.459 
quite good actually so that's a look at

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:41.100 
quite good actually so that's a look at
quickly<00:05:39.459> and<00:05:39.699> as<00:05:39.999> you<00:05:40.119> can<00:05:40.239> see<00:05:40.269> with<00:05:40.839> just<00:05:41.019> a

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
quickly and as you can see with just a

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.489 
quickly and as you can see with just a
couple<00:05:41.289> steps<00:05:41.529> to<00:05:41.739> set<00:05:41.949> up<00:05:42.039> the<00:05:42.269> ipad<00:05:43.269> now<00:05:44.079> let

00:05:44.489 --> 00:05:44.499 
couple steps to set up the ipad now let

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:47.249 
couple steps to set up the ipad now let
me<00:05:44.529> go<00:05:44.739> ahead<00:05:44.829> and<00:05:44.949> grab<00:05:45.309> just<00:05:46.269> grab<00:05:46.569> my<00:05:46.719> zoom<00:05:46.989> I

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:55.389 
you over diet let's take a look so we go

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:59.429 
you over diet let's take a look so we go
to<00:05:55.449> settings<00:05:56.219> wireless<00:05:57.569> wireless<00:05:58.569> on<00:05:58.749> tap<00:05:59.289> on

to settings wireless wireless on tap on

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:03.959 
to settings wireless wireless on tap on
networks<00:06:01.349> there<00:06:02.349> it<00:06:02.439> is<00:06:02.529> overdrive<00:06:03.099> so<00:06:03.849> let's

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:03.969 
networks there it is overdrive so let's

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:05.219 
networks there it is overdrive so let's
see<00:06:04.149> if<00:06:04.209> this<00:06:04.300> connects<00:06:04.659> ok<00:06:05.019> there's<00:06:05.169> the

everybody has the same default overdrive

00:06:28.329 --> 00:06:30.449 
everybody has the same default overdrive
password<00:06:28.779> so<00:06:29.379> now<00:06:29.499> it's<00:06:29.649> connecting<00:06:30.099> to<00:06:30.369> the

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:30.459 
password so now it's connecting to the

00:06:30.459 --> 00:06:36.239 
password so now it's connecting to the
overdrive<00:06:30.789> hopefully<00:06:35.039> nice<00:06:36.039> thing<00:06:36.219> about

00:06:36.239 --> 00:06:36.249 
overdrive hopefully nice thing about

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:48.580 
status screen I really like this versus

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.340 
status screen I really like this versus
the<00:07:48.729> mifi<00:07:49.090> because<00:07:49.419> it<00:07:49.570> will<00:07:49.690> give<00:07:49.810> me<00:07:49.840> battery

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:50.350 
the mifi because it will give me battery

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:52.650 
the mifi because it will give me battery
life<00:07:50.560> and<00:07:50.860> connection<00:07:51.580> least<00:07:52.120> an<00:07:52.210> indication

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:52.660

many people are connected to the

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.800 
many people are connected to the

00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:58.810 
overdrive so that's a look at connecting

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.800
