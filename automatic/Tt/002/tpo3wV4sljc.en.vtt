to do the occasional editorial in this
case<00:00:16.039> often<00:00:17.039> you<00:00:17.130> see<00:00:17.310> cartoons<00:00:17.820> like<00:00:18.060> this

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:25.910 

and<00:00:24.449> then<00:00:24.570> compared<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.260> recent<00:00:25.470> photo

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920

and then compared to the recent photo
realistic<00:00:26.160> cartoons<00:00:27.000> like<00:00:27.210> this<00:00:32.840> and<00:00:33.840> you

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
realistic cartoons like this and you

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.229 
realistic cartoons like this and you
gotta<00:00:34.170> wonder<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.649> yourself<00:00:34.770> are<00:00:35.670> cartoons

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
gotta wonder to yourself are cartoons

aiming<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.809> be<00:00:36.989> more<00:00:37.410> realistic<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:38.899> think<00:00:39.899> this

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
aiming to be more realistic I think this

hit<00:00:40.290> me<00:00:40.469> when<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:40.920> was<00:00:41.040> watching<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.579> all<00:00:41.730> things

so<00:00:49.590> you've<00:00:49.739> tuned<00:00:49.980> into<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.340> coaching<00:00:51.770> now<00:00:52.770> this

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
so you've tuned into a coaching now this

could<00:00:53.489> be<00:00:53.550> me<00:00:53.879> over<00:00:54.149> analyzing<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.840> joke

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
could be me over analyzing the joke

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.229 
could be me over analyzing the joke
seeing<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.010> cartoon<00:00:56.489> character<00:00:56.520> is

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
seeing that a cartoon character is

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.209 
seeing that a cartoon character is
feeling<00:00:57.570> offended<00:00:57.899> by<00:00:58.289> becoming<00:00:58.829> over

different<00:01:01.350> techniques<00:01:01.559> one<00:01:02.309> strives<00:01:02.640> for

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
different techniques one strives for

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.759 
different techniques one strives for
replicating<00:01:03.390> realism<00:01:03.930> while<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.439> other<00:01:04.559> one

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
replicating realism while the other one

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.859 
replicating realism while the other one
relies<00:01:05.040> heavily<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.610> exaggeration<00:01:06.540> what<00:01:06.840> I

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
relies heavily on exaggeration what I

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.080 
relies heavily on exaggeration what I
mean<00:01:07.140> more<00:01:07.320> specifically<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.640> drawing

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
mean more specifically is that a drawing

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.330 
mean more specifically is that a drawing
in<00:01:09.210> motion<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.810> not<00:01:09.840> real<00:01:10.409> most<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.280> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
in motion is not real most of the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.130 
in motion is not real most of the
consequences<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.360> characters<00:01:12.840> getting

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
consequences of the characters getting

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.410 
consequences of the characters getting
hurt<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.530> an<00:01:13.650> over-the-top<00:01:14.040> fashion<00:01:14.790> or<00:01:14.939> even

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
hurt in an over-the-top fashion or even

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.510 
hurt in an over-the-top fashion or even
their<00:01:15.600> reactions<00:01:16.170> I've<00:01:16.350> seen<00:01:16.680> as<00:01:16.830> reflections

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
their reactions I've seen as reflections

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.700 
their reactions I've seen as reflections
things<00:01:18.210> we<00:01:18.420> don't<00:01:18.600> perceive<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.259> actually

things we don't perceive is actually

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.249 
things we don't perceive is actually
happening<00:01:20.189> it's<00:01:20.790> probably<00:01:21.299> why<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.659> success

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
happening it's probably why the success

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.380 
happening it's probably why the success
of<00:01:22.470> hand-drawn<00:01:23.070> cartoons<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.850> relied<00:01:24.360> on

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
of hand-drawn cartoons that relied on

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.570 
of hand-drawn cartoons that relied on
slap<00:01:24.930> sticks<00:01:25.259> like<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.619> Looney<00:01:25.890> Tunes<00:01:26.159> Oh<00:01:26.400> Tom

going<00:03:45.390> back<00:03:45.660> to<00:03:45.810> my<00:03:45.900> point<00:03:46.200> on<00:03:46.410> whether
