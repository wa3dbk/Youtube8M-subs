00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:07.430
 it's like an abandoned house but it's that 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.930
 is supposed to kill people like 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.760
 that the people rebelled and they 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.670
 they cut the feet 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.220
 but they cut off his feet or they are made 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.930
 the mutilated or how or just did it 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.180
 horns 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.920
 they killed him and then they cut him 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:28.519
 feet but first they also killed him with 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.799
 a shotgun bullet with shotguns 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.769
 and they blew his jaw and then and 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:36.049
 then when he was dead he was 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:39.049
 they cut the feet and annual the legends 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.810
 to where it appears or what wave does not appear 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.900
 as it appears back there by the 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.579
 desert about three o'clock at night 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.450
 the hand of the morning that you are 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.889
 inventing old not clear that not then 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.120
 they realized they rebelled and the 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:56.419
 killed in fact here they are like the 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.939
 marks of the battle so true how weird 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:01.390
 here and here is everything all in the chest 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:03.490
 this one fell down why 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:12.610
 because here this entered right and a hole 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:15.459
 there is a hole that needs a hole that 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.950
 today in a manches that stung he killed them 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.489
 different ways but still they see it 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.489
 all for the roof 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:28.990
 as up and his head broke the 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:31.230
 roof has many enemies 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.060
 it was one of the cruelest deaths that 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:40.220
 they had everything and as it explains is this 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:43.540
 part which is that I am here 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.540
 also fir 1 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:52.430
 force today I believe that a telephone 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:57.370
 what is it that people could call what 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.370
 installed in case he could survive if 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:04.070
 are people are we going on the phone 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.750
 but they say they see their shadow or 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.210
 it is not say that if you stop here to 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.600
 3 o'clock in the morning you see your shadow 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.760
 today it is uncertain it is not a tree there is 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:20.560
 wait at 3 o'clock in the morning for 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:20.560
 appear at 3 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:28.570
 yes, but I'm dead or I was pulled out 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.570
 of the high good game is going to make sense
