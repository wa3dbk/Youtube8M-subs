00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.380
 Art robbery at the Nazi era and the return 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.000
 Procurement This is a thematic topic 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.470
 we met again and again in the media 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.940
 and a movie dealing with one 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.769
 busy history and whose 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.190
 trailer we look at is the woman 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.460
 in gold then so the lawyer how are you 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.170
 him 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.300
 in the estate of my sister I am up 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.520
 I need somebody to do that 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.020
 I can trust 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:25.170
 can you give me not the way that goes 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.609
 not so this is a full time job and 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.240
 through the glasses you can do it 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:35.120
 not see 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:38.059
 filthy that's my aunt ard 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.890
 times of gustav klimt it is beautiful 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.559
 see us at home so far 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.660
 expropriated and since then she is in 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.760
 Belvedere in Vienna from stuck and you 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.019
 again, a danger would be a sign 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.790
 not really wonderful they really believe 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:51.440
 Austria would put this picture out 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.239
 So it's over the sofa of an old lady 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.290
 It would have been a mistake too 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.060
 to attempt 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.220
 I never thought that me 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.960
 come back this is our home at 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.310
 evening of my wedding was halfway 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.019

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.520
 Welcome as you will be so many 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.320
 stones in the way put the any 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.420
 possible 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.750
 the painting belongs between enns family 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.160
 she is the mona lisa austria we 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.350
 will fight for what ours 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.700
 opinion down 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.530
 I do not admit that you do not yet 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.759
 similar 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.050
 I want a suit to submit the 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.130
 sue the austrian state 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.130
 Have a good time 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.250
 they will never win we are 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.740
 do not eat the cake 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.570
 they have disabled me all the time 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.250
 and medi door slammed in front of the nose 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.910
 my ladies and gentlemen that is one 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.910
 historical moment 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.890
 the people saw only a masterpiece 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:51.960
 one of the biggest artists of austria 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.969
 But I see a picture of my aunt 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.210
 a woman who lives with me about this 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:56.210
 spoke 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.170
 Vienna is a james bond movie and you are 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.170
 sean connery 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.869
 Interesting look consistently good cast 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.759
 and then you have the feeling of a topic 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.900
 what sony is that is probably 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.520
 will not reach the mainstream 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.290
 but rather for cineastes thought the 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.000
 Woman in gold brings us won 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.370
 entertainment expected from 4 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.200
 june 2015 in German cinemas and 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.300
 tells the story of the family blog 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.700
 a family has quite art possessed 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.080
 also during the Nazi era and was expropriated 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.060
 and then a time jump tells of 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.800
 a descendant played by helen 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.170
 Mirrors of a woman 50 years later 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.790
 the United States of America lives 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.040
 and decides to bring this art back 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.200
 there is a particular image 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.120
 her aunt adele depicts a picture 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.190
 if that or in the most people 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.750
 that has been one of klimt's drawings 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.760
 of course see a great work of art 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.590
 that Austria hangs in a museum 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.880
 but above all she sees her aunt there 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.620
 pure piece of family one piece 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.330
 humanity and especially theirs 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.980
 I'm willing to bring back what 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.989
 you belong and that's why you decide 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.640
 Austria to downsize their page 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.930
 An attorney played by Ryan Reynolds 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.459
 and especially in kaarst also German 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.020
 people in there like daniel brÃ¼hl or too 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.700
 you can stay moritz for a short time 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.440
 say that my great mixture 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.640
 actor had quite interesting 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.080
 story because as we always say 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.190
 again art robbery in the media 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.870
 it will also be discussed 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.830
 But there are documentaries about these films 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.330
 dealing with special with it 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.040
 are always a bit busy 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.209
 rare and above all helen mirren im 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.880
 Kern is a woman who can 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.049
 definitely whole strands of action on 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.760
 their shoulders are carrying the faith 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.440
 me that's a very fine one 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.790
 there will be so few people left 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.959
 I'm sorry that I'm sorry now 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.580
 think that you are probably good 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.900
 is seen and yet by a few 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.500
 I should be happy in the end 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.430
 me on it 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.200
 most of you probably 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.030
 Do not say my thing or at all 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.650
 cats leave you the trailer anyway 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.940
 I like to comment on me 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.530

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.150
