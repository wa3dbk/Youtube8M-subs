00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.280
 a 

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:12.079
 effectively of 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:16.970
 this field of volkswaguen created called amarok which means 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:20.499
 in the language of the Wolf Eskimos 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:22.759
 is 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.749
 an exceptional pd sin have we really tried it several times 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.739
 The technical characteristics of the amarok bag are 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.540
 impressive 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.540
 starting because it's a vehicle 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.730
 double cabin 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.990
 per hundred of those we are used to normally see in our 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.900
 market 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.370
 but percent starts the armada the amarok being a little bigger more 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.130
 width 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.220
 that you are use of competitors 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.110
 when we go to technical specifications we have an engine 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.649
 exceptional 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.440
 really exciting two liters 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.989
 double turbo 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.890
 with the highest horsepower in the market 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.040
 163 horses exceeds 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.610
 the the immediate competitor in three horsepower 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.660
 and there the most important thing in that type of engines the torque 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.670
 of 400 grandchildren surpassing in 20 minutes instant arzu 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.510
 the competitor 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.720
 the specifications d four for four abc 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.600
 percent 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.000
 the duplication of efforts for example is the only vehicle and day in 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.730
 the world 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.370
 dyn that can put the duplication joseph to what we know as pig 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:48.540
 walking at less than 8 kilometers per hour he makes the transition from high to 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.790
 save any other vehicle in the world ettien it's time to take out 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.870
 important feature is a vehicle then made to stop our 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.670
 topography and for us bad roads definitely that momentum inside 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.690
 got this model that he 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.099
 as social goods 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.049
 the first time I vote and raid in the spades segment 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.489
 of in medium 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.700
 with this one with this vehicle they conceived it as a product for 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.509
 Latin America for our conditions from every point of view 

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:26.889
 ec and the tests or if lohan have shown it why 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:28.669
 the amarok 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:30.139
 in his first test 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:31.979
 harder can not be 

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:34.979
 it was the closing the companion 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:37.959
 of the bullfighters in the ring 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:39.419
 who just finished 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:42.419
 we know that a Colombian in new loans 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:44.139
 full 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:47.739
 irene became the one where they were always on par 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.789
 of livestock producers 

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:52.039
 behaving the chamuco 

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:55.039
 the best moment of form 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:01.859
 Rosario arrives in Argentina 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.809
 on May 15 and has been traveling by road 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:07.279
 all latin america 

00:03:07.279 --> 00:03:10.810
 i percent going from in studies here to costa rica 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.459
 and following your doctor 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.149
 Now we have a total distance of 16 thousand kilometers through the most 

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:19.679
 difficult is that you can not imagine in South America 

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:22.529
 Of course, by a lot of road 

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:27.919
 but they did pass from there photo c that show where they happened are in 

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:28.799
 Internet 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.319
 You can see it 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.439
 percent and percent confirm a few days the ten people who come 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:37.599
 with that these ground vehicles in china 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:39.199
 efe for said 

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:43.149
 and so hopefully they have not had the slightest problem anywhere 

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:45.209
 when they come out of your mouth 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.739
 what we have is programmed the first 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.959
 what they do not understand that in the middle of July already available for the 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:52.569
 sale 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.299
 at this moment we are already at the command 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:57.609
 the fat man who is expected in sherry 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:00.519
 and experience in general 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.369
 the symbolic act compared to what they have 

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:06.369
 the price of food what we are hearing 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:08.249
 that in the region 

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:10.279
 it's in 45 minutes 

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:13.949
 very competitive because of the characteristics it has 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:16.469
 been a bit annoying 

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:19.359
 d this mission of its main competitors 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.830
 includes insist with with much higher technical characteristics 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:25.649
 but very happy
