00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
how to make a envelope using paper or

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.299 
how to make a envelope using paper or
like<00:00:09.210> using<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:09.630> graphing<00:00:10.080> paper<00:00:10.260> any<00:00:10.710> sort<00:00:11.250> of

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
like using a graphing paper any sort of

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.320 
like using a graphing paper any sort of
paper<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:12.920> you<00:00:13.920> can<00:00:14.130> better<00:00:14.759> look<00:00:14.969> like<00:00:15.120> this

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
paper and you can better look like this

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.939 
paper and you can better look like this
so<00:00:15.780> I'm<00:00:15.870> going<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.080> make<00:00:16.230> it<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.410> little<00:00:16.680> bit

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
so I'm going to make it a little bit

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.890 
so I'm going to make it a little bit
smaller<00:00:17.190> but<00:00:18.150> you<00:00:18.270> can<00:00:18.420> use<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.690> same

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
smaller but you can use the same

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.410 
smaller but you can use the same
technique<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.350> make<00:00:19.680> it<00:00:20.160> make<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.210> size

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
technique to make it make the size

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.109

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.229 
time so there we go so and now you have
an<00:02:09.879> opening<00:02:10.269> that<00:02:10.690> looks<00:02:10.899> like<00:02:11.110> this<00:02:11.349> and<00:02:12.239> we

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
an opening that looks like this and we

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.110 
an opening that looks like this and we
just<00:02:13.569> glue<00:02:13.780> down<00:02:13.930> this<00:02:14.140> one<00:02:14.379> real<00:02:14.560> quick<00:02:15.120> all

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
this it doesn't really matter and i'm

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.030 
this it doesn't really matter and i'm
just<00:02:26.410> going<00:02:26.650> to<00:02:26.680> use<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:28.390> pencil<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:29.170> i'm<00:02:29.739> going

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
just going to use a pencil and i'm going

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.830 
just going to use a pencil and i'm going
to<00:02:30.130> use<00:02:30.280> like<00:02:30.430> a<00:02:30.459> pen<00:02:30.760> does<00:02:31.299> it<00:02:31.420> really<00:02:31.510> matter

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
to use like a pen does it really matter

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:39.350 
to use like a pen does it really matter
though<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:32.730> just<00:02:33.730> mark<00:02:35.250> how<00:02:36.250> big<00:02:36.489> it<00:02:36.670> is<00:02:37.410> and

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
though and just mark how big it is and

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:47.069 
though and just mark how big it is and
then<00:02:43.709> cut<00:02:44.709> it<00:02:44.890> it<00:02:45.519> isn't<00:02:45.790> really<00:02:46.120> it<00:02:46.420> depends

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
then cut it it isn't really it depends

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.970 
then cut it it isn't really it depends
on<00:02:47.380> the<00:02:47.440> size<00:02:47.829> and<00:02:48.400> yeah<00:02:49.000> so<00:02:49.870> then<00:02:50.019> just<00:02:50.349> cut<00:02:50.739> it

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
on the size and yeah so then just cut it

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.550 
on the size and yeah so then just cut it
and<00:02:53.130> as<00:02:54.130> you<00:02:54.310> can<00:02:54.459> see<00:02:54.840> I'm<00:02:55.840> playing<00:02:55.900> it<00:02:56.349> right

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
and as you can see I'm playing it right
