00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:10.100
 I was here this morning to take the exam 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.900
 of the coastal boat license 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.740
 it went very well since I had 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.030
 the license 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.340
 this morning there is not really any 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.779
 surprise the final apprehension had 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.790
 not normal but since we had been well 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.500
 prepared by the school but a training 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.580
 a day that in the end we Ave. 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.680
 all the basics needed to pass 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.630
 the review after a little revision 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.150
 greenhouse but we get to the assessors 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.439
 I followed three nights of classes between 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.350
 the notes we had taken his little 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.890
 memo booklet is super well done and 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.890
 online tests 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.350
 what we propose are 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.820
 ship license training 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.140
 as much mercury wierre because you have to know 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.250
 that in Paris it is quite possible 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.790
 to pass the sea license but not all 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.790
 Polish 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.360
 he 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.360
 he 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.620
 the hÃ©naff is present in paris in the 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.090
 12th district with regard to 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.840
 the training center and the part 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.610
 administrative 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.560
 we also have a center of 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.060
 training located on the entity barge 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.060
 just behind the houseboat al assad 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.300
 the object of the court is already taking 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.730
 awareness and acquaintance 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.950
 of all the phenomena we are 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.110
 exposed when sailing in particular to 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.900
 proximity to the coast and which depends on 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.720
 sure the security that is the condition 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.490
 sovereign is a priority of any seafarer 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.040
 today in gps accuracy all to 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.680
 is satisfactory but we will navigate 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.160
 always all the reservations to which 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.160
 we are thinking 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.550
 logic shakes VHF radio will you 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:02.430
 to communicate with 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.990
 you are going 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.250
 bad but it's long but 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.420
 it is beautiful today the tooth 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.560
 paris so it's really nice to 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.929
 to be able to sail on the Seine 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.549
 there is 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.019
 current so to stay on course it's 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.700
 complicated thanks to the counselor 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.560
 of alexander low it is true that there 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.750
 then comes loÃ¯c now we will do 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.609
 a speed test so you have good 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.019
 as I say you'll accelerate so 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:25.019
 a little frank go there 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.020
 in fact the father make me we it's more 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.310
 that a piece of paper we will not bring 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.050
 people it's fine to get them to 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.250
 Russia to get their license but 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.290
 in fact we were trying to deliver a 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.730
 message and real training for 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.140
 that people are more aware 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.460
 still navigation techniques 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.440
 and except this sense more secure 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:51.120
 when they go out especially at sea 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:53.030
 he german river my friend and wang opn 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.560
 not regularly on vacation there 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.090
 each time we had regrets by 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.150
 the objective audience is allowed 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.500
 therefore deadlines 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.990
 next stay the standard their a boat 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.290
 these first 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.290
 desire
