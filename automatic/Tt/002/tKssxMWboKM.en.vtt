00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.800
which minority of people know

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.840
"Stem of Artichoke Salad"

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.280
but if you want fristly we learn the ingredients

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.240
then start cooking

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.040
8 sprays of artichoke

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.040
2 tablespoons of mayonnaise

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.600
2 tablespoons of yoghurt

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.600
2 cloves of garlic

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.520
2 tablespoon of olive oil

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.200
1 teaspoon of salt

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.600
and half of a lemon

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.560
now we can start cooking "Stem of Artichoke Salad"

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.320
while buying artichoke the seller hulls, prepares...

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.120
and drop out the sprays of it

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.440
if he gives the sprays we shall take or buy

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.600
dont't waste them
19 
00:01:08,600 --&gt; 00:01:11,880
because these sprays are the friends of our liver

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.280
they have ability to fix liver

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.720
they look too heavy but they are too healty

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.720
we peel theese fully

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.720
we peel somewhere even if we have peeled before

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.280
as you see they pretty slimed

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.280
we also cut the tips of it

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.440
we have such a water, we add lemon and salt in it

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.000
we immediately drop the sprays not them to darken

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and continue to the process

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.880
we peeled the last spray too

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.880
now go near the fire to boil them

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.840
we put the pressure cooker onto the fire

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.680
we drop the sprays of artichoke

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.080
we add lemon juice...

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.200
and some salt on it

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.000
and add some hot water to boil quickly

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.400
we close the cover

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.320
and when it whistles we will cook 5 more minutes

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.040
actually, as you see cooking "Stem of Artichoke Salad" is not difficult

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.640
now we shall complete by getting together the ingredients

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.920
the yoghurt...

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.920
mayonesse...

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.800
now we will mix them well

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.800
also some salt

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.800
as it can be seen there is no tack

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.800
now we chop the garlic

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.360
we can mince, or we can chop

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.360
whatever can you take it easy

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.400
we add them also

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.680
as you know mayonesse has too much oil

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.520
therefore it is enough to add 2 tablespoons of oliveoil

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.080
mix more

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.440
that is enough

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.840
now we chop the artichoke sprays boiled

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.040
we never dump its water

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.320
now we add it to the mixture

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.920
now we can service the salad

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.400
as we said we never dump its water

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.200
because it prevents liver

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:34.040
even if you have no problem it provides powerful liver

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.560
did you know that the mayonesse and  olive is a good pair

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
you can decorate with olive

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.120
we can decorate whatever we want

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.680
a strange salad

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.520
yes "Stem of Artichoke Salad"

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.840
