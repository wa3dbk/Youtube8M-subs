00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.700 

plan<00:00:24.630> your<00:00:24.720> defenses<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.320> defeat<00:00:25.560> the

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
plan your defenses and defeat the

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.929 
plan your defenses and defeat the
zombies<00:00:26.099> okay<00:00:27.650> just<00:00:28.650> like<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.800> last<00:00:29.400> stand<00:00:29.640> type

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
zombies okay just like a last stand type

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.860 
zombies okay just like a last stand type
thing<00:00:31.669> yeah<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.790> looks<00:00:32.969> like<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.300> okay<00:00:33.840> so

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
thing yeah it looks like it okay so

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.910 
thing yeah it looks like it okay so
let's<00:00:36.870> see<00:00:37.050> we<00:00:37.200> got<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.440> pick<00:00:37.559> what<00:00:37.770> we<00:00:37.890> want

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
let's see we got to pick what we want

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.959 
let's see we got to pick what we want
put<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.579> down<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.120> hope<00:00:39.239> for<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.510> best

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:40.969 
put it down and hope for the best

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:49.940 
put it down and hope for the best
so<00:00:41.969> why<00:00:42.629> don't<00:00:42.690> we<00:00:42.809> do<00:00:48.140> if<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.230> do<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.710> these

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
so why don't we do if I do to these

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.500 
so why don't we do if I do to these
that's<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.850> thousand<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:52.100> then<00:00:53.100> five<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:53.969> these

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
that's a thousand and then five of these

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:02.000 
that's a thousand and then five of these
that's<00:00:55.020> another<00:00:55.199> thousand<00:01:00.500> and<00:01:01.500> then<00:01:01.859> I'll

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
that's another thousand and then I'll

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:12.250 
that's another thousand and then I'll
keep<00:01:02.690> EMPs<00:01:03.690> with<00:01:04.019> me<00:01:05.960> just<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.170> case<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:09.140> that

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:23.030 

the<00:01:13.260> infinite

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.230 

not<00:01:24.040> just<00:01:24.220> throw<00:01:24.400> a<00:01:24.460> couple<00:01:24.700> other<00:01:24.820> ones<00:01:25.030> on

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
not just throw a couple other ones on

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.310 
not just throw a couple other ones on
there<00:01:25.450> I<00:01:25.480> don't<00:01:25.600> know<00:01:25.720> if<00:01:25.780> I'm<00:01:25.930> going<00:01:26.050> to<00:01:26.140> use

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
there I don't know if I'm going to use

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:33.810 
there I don't know if I'm going to use
them<00:01:26.470> or<00:01:26.590> not<00:01:27.660> all<00:01:28.660> right<00:01:28.780> so<00:01:29.050> let's<00:01:29.230> see<00:01:32.820> main

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
them or not all right so let's see main

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.550 
them or not all right so let's see main
plan<00:01:34.210> is<00:01:34.420> going<00:01:34.570> to<00:01:34.660> be<00:01:34.840> to<00:01:35.050> have<00:01:37.050> two<00:01:38.050> of<00:01:38.170> these

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:49.440 

then<00:01:41.560> laser<00:01:42.070> beans<00:01:42.660> and<00:01:47.940> that's<00:01:48.940> about<00:01:49.270> it

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
then laser beans and that's about it

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.760 
then laser beans and that's about it
let's<00:01:49.810> try<00:01:50.080> it

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.030 

this<00:01:57.570> method<00:01:58.570> may<00:01:58.600> suck<00:01:59.050> it<00:01:59.259> may<00:01:59.410> work

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
this method may suck it may work

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.499 
this method may suck it may work
I<00:02:00.070> just<00:02:00.729> don't<00:02:01.090> know<00:02:01.330> yet<00:02:01.540> we<00:02:01.750> got<00:02:01.899> to<00:02:03.270> go<00:02:04.270> just

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
I just don't know yet we got to go just

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.270 
I just don't know yet we got to go just
try<00:02:04.930> it<00:02:05.080> and<00:02:05.229> find<00:02:05.800> out<00:02:06.040> I<00:02:07.920> mean<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:09.009> winter

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
try it and find out I mean the winter

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.710 
try it and find out I mean the winter
melons<00:02:09.550> are<00:02:09.640> going<00:02:09.759> to<00:02:09.820> slow<00:02:10.000> them<00:02:10.119> down<00:02:10.149> and

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
melons are going to slow them down and

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.420 
melons are going to slow them down and
then<00:02:10.929> the<00:02:11.170> laser<00:02:11.590> beans<00:02:11.890> are<00:02:12.100> just<00:02:12.160> going<00:02:12.340> to

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
then the laser beans are just going to

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.140 
then the laser beans are just going to
keep<00:02:12.780> hacking<00:02:13.780> away<00:02:13.900> at<00:02:14.230> them<00:02:14.790> so<00:02:15.790> hopefully

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
keep hacking away at them so hopefully

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.060 
keep hacking away at them so hopefully
that's<00:02:16.330> enough<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:19.390> defeat<00:02:19.840> them<00:02:20.140> but<00:02:20.770> it

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
that's enough to to defeat them but it

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.920 
that's enough to to defeat them but it
might<00:02:21.130> not<00:02:21.400> be<00:02:21.750> only<00:02:22.750> way<00:02:22.930> to<00:02:22.989> know<00:02:23.230> is<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:24.930> keep

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
might not be only way to know is to keep

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.509 
might not be only way to know is to keep
the<00:02:26.140> scene<00:02:28.170> I'm<00:02:29.170> going<00:02:29.260> to<00:02:29.440> stop<00:02:29.920> these<00:02:30.220> guys

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
the scene I'm going to stop these guys

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.160 
the scene I'm going to stop these guys
right<00:02:31.030> here<00:02:33.480> will<00:02:34.480> eat<00:02:34.630> through<00:02:34.840> that<00:02:34.959> walnut

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170
