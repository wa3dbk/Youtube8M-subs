00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
not to type too tightly because lace

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.080 
not to type too tightly because lace
does<00:01:02.819> rip<00:01:03.749> but<00:01:04.260> maybe<00:01:04.589> if<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.070> add<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.580> little

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
does rip but maybe if you add a little

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.380 
does rip but maybe if you add a little
bit<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.660> hot<00:01:07.260> glue<00:01:07.290> or<00:01:08.100> just<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.940> little<00:01:09.150> dab<00:01:09.360> of

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
bit of hot glue or just a little dab of

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:21.820 
bit of hot glue or just a little dab of
glue<00:01:09.750> right<00:01:09.870> there<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.650> would<00:01:11.340> be<00:01:11.700> perfect

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.980
