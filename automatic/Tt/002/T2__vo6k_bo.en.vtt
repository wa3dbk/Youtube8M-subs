00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.099
 strong for washing 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.750
 received 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:13.330
 That can happen when you do the process 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.660
 not before you washed it once 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:20.500
 has then extend the again 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:23.710
 if you 're sewing in here before 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.019
 the shadow area looks relatively 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.800
 it has not been generously sewn 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.910
 problem 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:33.520
 Here you just have to how many 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.910
 inch you are missing in the case 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:40.810
 there about five and a half centimeters on 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:43.240
 this point if you like now 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.910
 distance of two centimeters from the ground 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:49.810
 you have to have the seam up here on 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:52.360
 disconnect and then have the whole process 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.340
 let down that far down here 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.970
 an additional length of three 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.580
 centimeters results but notes 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.680
 depending on how your anteroom is 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:06.010
 she'll be in the middle a bit 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.200
 by bending and if you are in the middle 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.600
 mostly evaluates their small distance to 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:14.200
 boat notice as on the sides 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.590
 You should then try the shapes 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.420
 somehow or just to get it straight 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.789
 to keep high times and then looks so 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.590
 when about two inches approximately or 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.840
 if you have a two-centimeter difference 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.369
 has between in the middle and outside then 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.770
 this probably corresponds to the 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:33.159
 Bend you have to look though 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.679
 It really is the bend 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:39.880
 in the next step I'll show you then 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:42.039
 as her the upward trend i am 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.130
 mark that before then also here 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:48.969
 I'll show you that and then have to 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:51.039
 we just put the stuff down here 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:53.530
 let's go down that means this one 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.009
 it's getting worse here at the back 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.570
 come 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:59.080
 show how this works 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.080
