00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
and we're able to go up one nil here in

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.750 
and we're able to go up one nil here in
the<00:01:06.780> middle<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.350> first<00:01:07.680> half<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.310> tried

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
the middle of the first half and I tried

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.810 
the middle of the first half and I tried
to<00:01:09.030> get<00:01:09.210> another<00:01:09.600> golia<00:01:10.170> but<00:01:10.860> his<00:01:10.979> keyboard<00:01:11.430> is

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
to get another golia but his keyboard is

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.510 
to get another golia but his keyboard is
saving<00:01:12.360> instead<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:13.020> we<00:01:13.140> go<00:01:13.350> into<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:14.040> second

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
saving instead and we go into the second

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.609 
saving instead and we go into the second
half<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.180> it's<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.750> some<00:01:15.869> quick<00:01:16.020> passing<00:01:16.500> to

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
half and it's just some quick passing to

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.679 
half and it's just some quick passing to
split<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.070> defense<00:01:17.220> apart<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.180> really<00:01:18.509> do

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
split the defense apart and I really do

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.179 
split the defense apart and I really do
like<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.110> passing<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.740> game<00:01:19.950> this<00:01:20.130> year

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
like the passing on the game this year

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.399 
like the passing on the game this year
it<00:01:20.759> feels<00:01:21.090> really<00:01:21.390> really<00:01:21.630> good<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
it feels really really good and in the

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.280 
it feels really really good and in the
end<00:01:22.530> here<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:23.009> could<00:01:23.580> make<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.689> nil<00:01:25.020> get<00:01:25.259> a

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
end here I could make it it to nil get a

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.469 
end here I could make it it to nil get a
quite<00:01:25.680> comfortable<00:01:26.280> lead<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:27.000> kept<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.420> the

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
quite comfortable lead and I kept on the

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.300 
quite comfortable lead and I kept on the
pressure<00:01:27.840> he<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.170> seeing<00:01:28.380> if<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:28.650> can<00:01:28.710> add<00:01:29.070> to

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
pressure he is seeing if I can add to

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.670 
pressure he is seeing if I can add to
that<00:01:29.340> goal<00:01:29.759> tally<00:01:30.090> we<00:01:30.750> find<00:01:31.079> very<00:01:31.320> well<00:01:31.530> we

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
that goal tally we find very well we

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.950 
that goal tally we find very well we
break<00:01:31.979> on<00:01:32.159> through<00:01:32.369> into<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:33.030> box<00:01:33.299> we<00:01:33.479> try<00:01:33.900> to

that's<00:04:59.020> a<00:04:59.169> clear<00:04:59.410> offside<00:04:59.800> on<00:05:00.070> vérella<00:05:00.490> so<00:05:00.729> the

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
that's a clear offside on vérella so the

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.909 
that's a clear offside on vérella so the
game<00:05:01.000> ends<00:05:01.270> at<00:05:01.419> two<00:05:01.690> to<00:05:01.900> nil<00:05:02.080> but<00:05:02.289> still<00:05:02.560> yet

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
game ends at two to nil but still yet

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.670 
game ends at two to nil but still yet
another<00:05:03.070> win<00:05:03.580> we're<00:05:04.270> sitting<00:05:04.570> on<00:05:04.840> a<00:05:04.900> nine<00:05:05.440> and

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
another win we're sitting on a nine and

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.830 
another win we're sitting on a nine and
points<00:05:06.130> in<00:05:06.250> the<00:05:06.490> division<00:05:06.880> after<00:05:07.090> three<00:05:07.600> games

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
points in the division after three games

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.290 
points in the division after three games
so<00:05:08.080> that<00:05:08.110> is<00:05:08.350> pretty<00:05:08.560> good<00:05:08.949> and<00:05:09.130> we<00:05:10.120> basically

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
so that is pretty good and we basically

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.779 
so that is pretty good and we basically
just<00:05:10.660> need<00:05:11.080> four<00:05:11.470> more<00:05:11.620> points<00:05:11.889> to<00:05:12.100> to<00:05:12.490> get<00:05:12.669> the

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:12.789 
just need four more points to to get the

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:14.790 
just need four more points to to get the
title<00:05:13.030> one<00:05:13.389> more<00:05:13.539> point<00:05:13.750> to<00:05:13.930> promote<00:05:14.560> and

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
title one more point to promote and

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.969 
title one more point to promote and
after<00:05:15.460> that<00:05:15.610> I<00:05:15.669> decided<00:05:16.080> to<00:05:17.080> see<00:05:17.349> if<00:05:17.830> I<00:05:17.919> could

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
after that I decided to see if I could

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:20.460 
after that I decided to see if I could
build<00:05:18.370> my<00:05:18.580> substitution<00:05:19.389> squad<00:05:19.720> I<00:05:20.020> knew<00:05:20.260> what

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.710 
build my substitution squad I knew what
players<00:05:20.740> who<00:05:20.919> wanted<00:05:21.280> to<00:05:21.490> use<00:05:21.849> and<00:05:22.150> I<00:05:22.539> knew

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
players who wanted to use and I knew

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.960 
players who wanted to use and I knew
what<00:05:22.900> confirmation<00:05:23.650> I<00:05:23.740> wanted<00:05:24.070> to<00:05:24.220> play<00:05:24.610> and

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:24.970 
what confirmation I wanted to play and

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.969 
what confirmation I wanted to play and
the<00:05:25.090> first<00:05:25.330> player<00:05:25.570> picked<00:05:25.960> up<00:05:26.110> was<00:05:26.320> a<00:05:26.349> deep<00:05:26.800> I

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
the first player picked up was a deep I

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:30.089 
the first player picked up was a deep I
i<00:05:27.280> really<00:05:28.120> want<00:05:28.330> to<00:05:28.419> trap<00:05:28.750> Jax<00:05:29.229> Emma<00:05:29.500> tennis<00:05:29.919> as

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
well as Australia and charisma and then

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.010 
well as Australia and charisma and then
I<00:05:33.160> realized<00:05:33.610> okay<00:05:34.150> they<00:05:34.570> were<00:05:34.690> actually<00:05:34.990> a

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
I realized okay they were actually a

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.390 
I realized okay they were actually a
little<00:05:35.080> bit<00:05:35.260> more<00:05:35.410> expensive<00:05:35.770> than<00:05:36.160> I<00:05:36.220> had

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
little bit more expensive than I had

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.360 
little bit more expensive than I had
four<00:05:36.760> and<00:05:37.090> I<00:05:37.630> had<00:05:37.870> 20,000<00:05:38.620> points<00:05:38.800> all<00:05:39.130> of<00:05:39.310> a

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
four and I had 20,000 points all of a

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.370 
four and I had 20,000 points all of a
sudden<00:05:39.400> after<00:05:40.210> I<00:05:40.659> then<00:05:40.810> picked<00:05:40.990> up<00:05:41.110> five

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:41.380 
sudden after I then picked up five

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.710 
sudden after I then picked up five
players<00:05:41.800> I<00:05:42.039> have<00:05:42.250> 300<00:05:42.760> coins<00:05:42.909> left<00:05:43.270> and<00:05:43.599> I

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
players I have 300 coins left and I

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.870 
players I have 300 coins left and I
still<00:05:44.050> needed<00:05:44.409> six<00:05:44.830> more<00:05:45.039> players<00:05:45.340> for<00:05:45.699> my

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
still needed six more players for my

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.629 
still needed six more players for my
squad<00:05:46.360> so<00:05:47.020> I<00:05:47.050> was<00:05:47.470> not<00:05:47.590> able<00:05:47.830> to<00:05:48.039> finish<00:05:48.340> off

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:48.639 
squad so I was not able to finish off

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:50.790 
squad so I was not able to finish off
the<00:05:48.849> squadron<00:05:49.300> instead<00:05:49.659> I<00:05:49.690> decided<00:05:49.930> to<00:05:50.560> put

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
the squadron instead I decided to put

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.860 
the squadron instead I decided to put
him<00:05:50.949> some<00:05:51.490> concept<00:05:52.090> place<00:05:52.270> you<00:05:52.449> just<00:05:52.630> kind<00:05:52.840> of

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
him some concept place you just kind of

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.750 
him some concept place you just kind of
get<00:05:53.020> an<00:05:53.080> idea<00:05:53.169> what<00:05:53.680> we<00:05:53.800> are<00:05:53.830> going<00:05:54.280> to<00:05:54.430> build

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
get an idea what we are going to build

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.180 
get an idea what we are going to build
eventually<00:05:55.510> I'll<00:05:56.260> most<00:05:56.530> likely<00:05:56.620> be<00:05:57.010> in<00:05:57.039> the

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
eventually I'll most likely be in the
