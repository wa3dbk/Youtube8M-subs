comparing<00:00:03.870> an<00:00:04.049> iphone<00:00:04.380> 5<00:00:04.680> prototype<00:00:05.310> i

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
comparing an iphone 5 prototype i

comparing an iphone 5 prototype i
received<00:00:05.819> from<00:00:05.940> an<00:00:06.150> anonymous<00:00:06.330> source<00:00:06.680> to<00:00:07.680> the

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
received from an anonymous source to the

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.790 
received from an anonymous source to the
iphone<00:00:08.370> 4s<00:00:08.820> in<00:00:09.120> white<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:10.380> most<00:00:10.559> recent

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
iphone 4s in white the most recent

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.629 
iphone 4s in white the most recent
iphone<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.670> apples<00:00:11.940> lineup<00:00:12.679> so<00:00:13.679> if<00:00:14.549> we

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
iphone and apples lineup so if we

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.029 
iphone and apples lineup so if we
compare<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.059> both<00:00:15.210> we<00:00:16.109> can<00:00:16.379> see<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:16.800> the

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
compare the both we can see that the

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.870 
compare the both we can see that the
iphone<00:00:18.000> 5<00:00:18.270> prototype<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:19.340> slightly<00:00:20.340> thinner

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
iphone 5 prototype is slightly thinner

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.429 
iphone 5 prototype is slightly thinner
than<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.960> 4s<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:23.240> is<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.650> quite<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.680> bit<00:00:25.890> longer

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
than the 4s it is a quite a bit longer

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.169 
than the 4s it is a quite a bit longer
the<00:00:28.439> screen<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.980> lot<00:00:29.189> larger<00:00:29.400> which<00:00:29.939> is

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
the screen is a lot larger which is

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.930 
the screen is a lot larger which is
great<00:00:30.869> for<00:00:30.900> watching<00:00:31.410> films<00:00:31.619> playing<00:00:32.610> games

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
great for watching films playing games

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.910 
great for watching films playing games
it's<00:00:33.180> not<00:00:33.300> as<00:00:33.390> large<00:00:33.570> as<00:00:33.809> that<00:00:33.930> samsung<00:00:34.500> galaxy

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
it's not as large as that samsung galaxy

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.959 
it's not as large as that samsung galaxy
s3<00:00:35.100> screen<00:00:35.760> but<00:00:36.510> that's<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.469> bit<00:00:38.399> too<00:00:38.430> large<00:00:38.790> for

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
s3 screen but that's a bit too large for

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.190 
s3 screen but that's a bit too large for
my<00:00:39.210> taste<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.920> hits<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.280> spot<00:00:42.200> it's

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
my taste so this this hits the spot it's

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.020 
my taste so this this hits the spot it's
same<00:00:43.890> with<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:46.399> it<00:00:47.399> has<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.550> couple<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.910> other

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
same with and it has a couple of other

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.290 
same with and it has a couple of other
changes<00:00:48.270> as<00:00:48.600> well<00:00:48.750> we<00:00:49.590> take<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> look<00:00:49.950> at<00:00:50.039> that

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
changes as well we take a look at that

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.750 
changes as well we take a look at that
prototype<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:52.230> see<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.800> front-facing

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
prototype and see that the front-facing

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.380 
prototype and see that the front-facing
camera<00:00:54.360> has<00:00:54.949> moved<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.489> center<00:00:56.879> it's<00:00:57.270> no

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
camera has moved to the center it's no

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.319 
camera has moved to the center it's no
longer<00:00:58.250> to<00:00:59.250> left<00:00:59.550> of<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.539> speaker<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:02.329> of

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
longer to left of the speaker and of

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.149 
longer to left of the speaker and of
course<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.600> screen<00:01:03.809> is<00:01:03.930> larger<00:01:04.290> down<00:01:04.890> here<00:01:05.070> we

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
course the screen is larger down here we

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.280 
course the screen is larger down here we
have<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> home<00:01:05.549> button<00:01:06.439> now<00:01:07.970> speaker<00:01:09.290> speaker

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
longer at the top of the chop we only

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.429 
longer at the top of the chop we only
have<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.060> hold<00:01:21.299> button<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:24.049> we<00:01:25.049> also<00:01:25.200> have<00:01:25.320> a

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
have the hold button and we also have a

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.679 
have the hold button and we also have a
new<00:01:25.650> dock<00:01:26.009> connector<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.610> seems<00:01:26.820> like<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
new dock connector it seems like the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.440 
new dock connector it seems like the
dock<00:01:27.869> connector<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.530> 4s<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.549> quite<00:01:30.210> a<00:01:30.240> bit

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
dock connector on the 4s is quite a bit

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.660 
dock connector on the 4s is quite a bit
larger<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.380> take<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.590> look<00:01:31.770> at<00:01:31.860> this<00:01:31.950> image

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
larger you take a look at this image

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.649 
larger you take a look at this image
here<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.409> it<00:01:34.409> looks<00:01:34.470> like<00:01:34.680> this<00:01:35.450> some<00:01:36.450> type<00:01:36.630> of

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
here and it looks like this some type of

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.030 
here and it looks like this some type of
new<00:01:36.960> dock<00:01:37.200> connector<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.680> Apple<00:01:38.009> has

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
new dock connector that Apple has

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.929 
new dock connector that Apple has
developed<00:01:39.920> obviously<00:01:40.920> that's<00:01:41.430> why<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.640> can't

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
developed obviously that's why I can't

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.760 
developed obviously that's why I can't
plug<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.509> don't<00:01:43.259> have<00:01:43.409> this<00:01:43.560> dock

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
plug it in I don't have this dock

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.620 
plug it in I don't have this dock
connector<00:01:44.899> we<00:01:45.899> can<00:01:46.049> take<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.229> look<00:01:46.350> at<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.560> back

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
connector we can take a look at the back

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.410 
connector we can take a look at the back
so<00:01:48.630> have<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.869> same<00:01:49.049> camera<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.860> flash<00:01:50.420> apple

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
so have the same camera the flash apple

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.990 
so have the same camera the flash apple
logo<00:01:52.340> iphone<00:01:55.340> it<00:01:56.340> seems<00:01:56.670> like<00:01:56.820> it's<00:01:56.939> a

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
logo iphone it seems like it's a

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.170 
logo iphone it seems like it's a
prototype<00:01:57.270> since<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:58.399> also<00:01:59.399> has<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.729> serial

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
prototype since it also has the serial

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.510 
prototype since it also has the serial
number<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.450> XX<00:02:00.960> XX<00:02:02.509> you<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:04.159> the<00:02:05.159> back<00:02:05.340> is

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
number the XX XX you and the back is

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.180 
number the XX XX you and the back is
made<00:02:05.670> out<00:02:05.790> of<00:02:05.820> a<00:02:06.060> matte<00:02:06.960> black<00:02:07.439> aluminum<00:02:08.069> it

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
made out of a matte black aluminum it

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.630 
made out of a matte black aluminum it
seems<00:02:08.369> like<00:02:09.619> nice<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.950> touch<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.370> doesn't

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
seems like nice the touch it doesn't

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.930 
seems like nice the touch it doesn't
leave<00:02:11.730> any<00:02:11.910> fingerprints

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
leave any fingerprints

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.110 
leave any fingerprints
and<00:02:13.290> I<00:02:14.290> hope<00:02:15.160> it<00:02:15.280> doesn't<00:02:15.490> shatter<00:02:15.700> as<00:02:15.970> easily

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
and I hope it doesn't shatter as easily

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.890 
and I hope it doesn't shatter as easily
as<00:02:16.360> the<00:02:17.220> 4s<00:02:18.220> does<00:02:18.670> and<00:02:19.000> so<00:02:19.480> you<00:02:19.570> can<00:02:19.690> take<00:02:19.870> a

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
as the 4s does and so you can take a

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.260 
as the 4s does and so you can take a
look<00:02:20.080> here<00:02:20.260> I<00:02:20.290> got<00:02:20.580> nice<00:02:21.580> little<00:02:22.320> bruise<00:02:23.320> here

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
look here I got nice little bruise here

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:32.520
