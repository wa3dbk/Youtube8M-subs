used
now<00:02:16.069> typically<00:02:16.819> my<00:02:17.630> hair<00:02:17.930> does<00:02:18.200> not<00:02:18.230> respond

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
plan on wearing maybe just a big fro and

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.950 
plan on wearing maybe just a big fro and
oh<00:04:26.960> my<00:04:27.169> gosh<00:04:27.500> shrinks<00:04:27.889> up<00:04:28.070> because<00:04:29.030> I<00:04:29.360> mean<00:04:29.720> it

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
oh my gosh shrinks up because I mean it

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.499

really<00:04:30.350> really<00:04:30.650> moisturizes<00:04:31.580> the<00:04:31.610> hair<00:04:31.880> and

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:32.509 
really really moisturizes the hair and

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:34.719 
really really moisturizes the hair and
it's<00:04:33.020> a<00:04:33.139> great<00:04:33.380> humectant<00:04:34.070> so<00:04:34.220> it<00:04:34.280> attracts

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
it's a great humectant so it attracts

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:36.790 
it's a great humectant so it attracts
moisture<00:04:35.000> to<00:04:35.509> the<00:04:35.539> hair<00:04:35.660> and<00:04:36.139> if<00:04:36.229> you<00:04:36.380> do<00:04:36.560> then

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
was planning on doing so I've never

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.409 
was planning on doing so I've never
tried<00:04:52.099> doing<00:04:52.400> it<00:04:52.580> in<00:04:52.729> the<00:04:52.820> morning<00:04:53.060> and

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
tried doing it in the morning and

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.210 
tried doing it in the morning and
leaving<00:04:53.660> I'm<00:04:54.080> sure<00:04:54.380> you<00:04:54.530> would<00:04:54.680> have<00:04:54.710> great

leaving I'm sure you would have great
soft<00:04:55.580> hair<00:04:55.940> but<00:04:56.509> you<00:04:56.660> probably<00:04:56.990> would<00:04:57.380> end<00:04:57.560> up

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
soft hair but you probably would end up

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.830 
soft hair but you probably would end up
with<00:04:58.130> some<00:04:58.460> shrinkage<00:04:58.970> so<00:04:59.180> again<00:04:59.509> this<00:04:59.660> is

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840
