00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.970
 hello friends today I wanted to talk to 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.790
 you how to recycle the 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.300
 lipsticks sometimes breaks us 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.490
 they go out of fashion she does not like us 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.890
 the reason that is or simply not 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.560
 we hit the color well, so what 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.250
 we can do is take one or several 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.250
 lipsticks 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:29.470
 12 or geniuses lipsticks and make 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:33.820
 mix until you find the color that 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:36.930
 we like it and then we are going to merge it 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:40.540
 all to make a lipstick 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:44.079
 look, I have these two 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.870
 They are two colors 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.650
 that good 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.290
 look at this first 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.110
 although you see it is pretty rosy in 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.890
 reality 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.460
 to see how I do what it would be 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:04.339
 actually barely 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:06.740
 no labeling does not have much coverage is 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.220
 very clear for my taste and yet 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:14.230
 this 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:16.180
 because the truth today the truth is that to me 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.160
 I do not like so strong colors 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.060
 so what I'm going to do is going to be what 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.590
 next I'm going to take a glass a glass of 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.890
 what we have at home we go to catch 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.890
 the to put water and I will remove 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.899
 so the two pencils to see this one 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.899
 resist a little 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:43.869
 but good they come out quite easily 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.759
 in agreement let's book at least one 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.299
 of the packaging because we will clean it 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.320
 we will clean this from inside and after 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:54.890
 with the 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.229
 as if it were closed with the little thing 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.580
 is towards down we will throw the 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.390
 mixture 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.710
 now what I will do with the two with the 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.970
 two cachitos 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:12.480
 go to the microwave and I'm going to heat it 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.040
 until it melts I'll mix it and 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.130
 we will see the result then you 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.530
 you can do it then first try it if 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.810
 you want me I've already tried testing 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.940
 on a piece of paper or a white plastic 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.950
 with the different colors that you have 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.880
 until you find the color that convinces you 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.310
 now at once good girls I come here 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.160
 30 seconds I've had it in fact there's 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.550
 one of the pieces that is still being 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.990
 undoing 30 seconds as much as 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.420
 I've had but what I see is that 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.580
 while it falls apart it dries up 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.430
 also then that's why I've wanted 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.200
 come and do it fast I'm 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.130
 dissolving everything with a brush of a 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.130
 Very nice color 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:01.050
 and now what we are going to do 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.050
 it's going to be everything 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.659
 How do I see it? 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.659
 and that I can do it too 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.849
 put everything 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.510
 inside 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.489
 goodbye pencil 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.489
 we lower as much as we can 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.200
 It is done 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.200
 no you do not see 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.530
 what I do is that with the brush 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.290
 I'm getting in, you could also put 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.960
 in a pillbox because After 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.170
 then we always use a brush and 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:56.010
 It would be simpler but good this time 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.010
 will be 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.659
 all good here 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.659
 so that I do not have holes 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.340
 very good 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.240
 Well now that it is full it is worth what 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.680
 you will do it will be to put it in the freezer 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:54.069
 a few minutes and then I tell you is already 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:57.860
 the lipstick made now let's 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:05:01.890
 see that it does not break 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.830
 well it has been fine I think it is 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:07.070
 what is a color 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:09.590
 much more like what I to what 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:12.800
 I wanted because this is all 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.630
 I hope you liked it remember that 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.360
 you can put it if you want in a 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:20.450
 pillbox or in a little gadget 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.690
 if you do not want bundled with the theme of 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:26.840
 do the bar but good 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:29.080
 is one more way to take advantage of the remains 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.490
 that are not things to go pulling 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:35.080
 come I hope you liked it and a 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.080
 kiss see you in the next
