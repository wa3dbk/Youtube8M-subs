00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.750
 I people it's patent 80 hd I hope 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.830
 that you have in question its cost 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.630
 for a new video on the channel 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.520
 a new review a review 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.779
 exceptional that of the Swedish striker 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.360
 from paris saint germain 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.189
 zlatan ibrahimovic in team version 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.360
 the season you have six stadiums signed 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.380
 little one without giving philippe yet 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.090
 so have to pause or to 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.130
 put back in the background observe them at 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.329
 level of the team because I have 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.710
 played in a single team of leaders 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.940
 teams because I place them and 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.230
 the jobs of the teams but there are 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.230
 actually only in a madness that I 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.129
 I'm going to test it's a team league 1 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.380
 miss France 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.240
 a team that is really very very 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.500
 bad in game end especially room attane 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.870
 ibrahimovic he is doing very badly in 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.910
 game makes it zlatan ibrahimovic 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.040
 will start by talking about its price 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.750
 so his price here is a player who 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.790
 cost very very very very very very expensive 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.890
 between 2 million 300 thousand and three 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.770
 million five hundred thousand credit on xbox 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.479
 between 4 million and 7 million 300 thousand 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.409
 credit on playstation so that's true 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.909
 that it is a player who is not 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.939
 everything accessible to everyone 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.000
 for example for a lot less you can 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.389
 take you the pair of attackers aguero 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.530
 tox and tv stoxx for cheaper than if 

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:24.179
 you're going to buy just Latin 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.609
 ibrahimovic so if you have them 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:29.009
 credits do what you want after 

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:30.590
 is it is beautiful it is a day that 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.049
 not worth that price a player but 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.179
 it's really very very very bad 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.320
 in the game so at the level of these points 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:37.880
 positive now because there is 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.350
 no negative point is the tan 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.880
 old-fashioned ibrahimovic in the points 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.159
 negatives I was just the four 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.039
 stars technical gestures but hey I 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.539
 decided to grow from low blow in 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.880
 positives there anything there all 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.289
 kicks set at the level of 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.719
 free kicks it's absolutely irrelevant 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.609
 what his far-off free kicks are 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:58.009
 almost all dangerous 89 years 

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:59.719
 accuracy of free kicks with 1.99 in 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.060
 punching power and 1.90 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:03.349
 indeed all free kicks leave 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.390
 really very well rolled free kick 

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:07.610
 at the entrance to the repair area 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.649
 kind placed over the wall that's 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.290
 good with him then at the level of 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.700
 penalties 1,98 in penalty kick over 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.280
 seven journals I got three of 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.930
 penaltys with the plane tree but as 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.310
 it's a review there was a lot of 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.069
 rage after the penalties I pulled 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.180
 only one because beats every time 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.470
 that they were getting a penalty in a 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.519
 match in fact his rage left just 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.829
 behind so it's true that's when 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.030
 even quite complicated the only penalty that 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:31.430
 I had them I put them at the bottom 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.290
 obviously after the strike 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.209
 I took everything that's good because it's 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.090
 anything these stats in typing 98 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.220
 95 finish cat 99 in power of 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.410
 strikes his jelly already evoked 99 years 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.269
 beat recovery can hit 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.889
 in just about any 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.239
 position with snow at thann ibrahimovic 

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:49.730
 knowing that there are the four stars 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.269
 bad foot sapho also to specify a 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.290
 left foot 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.659
 huge 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.890
 Well, it's done it's crazy 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.159
 it's madness when you're in front of 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:56.629
 cages 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:59.120
 even if he still missed me 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:01.250
 some pretty big stuff test this is 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.489
 true on the whole it really stays 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.840
 a keeper killer after at 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.730
 pass quality pass quality 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.840
 is just huge 91 years pass on the 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.079
 card so it's true that I have when 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.310
 even a little hard it's on him but 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:15.200
 when I tried some openings 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.150
 with the pass quality is really at 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.280
 meet you 91 years not on the map 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.930
 93- year-old game vision his sixty when 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.269
 not bad in game 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.599
 at the level of his physique it's just a 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:28.670
 tank is 99 in force 96 in agility he 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.439
 at 81 in relaxation knowing they were closing 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.439
 95 do you even imagine in the 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:35.900
 aerial domain he is 46 years old equilibrium 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:37.579
 but as low as usual that stats 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.169
 in equilibrium poses absolutely no 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.599
 problem it will be really very very good 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:42.739
 on his legs in the shoulder it is he who 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.510
 knocked down the opponents I'm 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.560
 fell on a ramos totti I like my 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.139
 clips do not do what I'm not going 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.790
 at the end of the action but ben in fact I 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:51.260
 fell on a totti ramos and all the 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.579
 match I did not victimize ie 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.099
 that there is a time like it is missing or 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.720
 polars matane he rolls finally he leaves 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.859
 boulÃ© rolled in the ramos and this with 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.959
 fasteners a step on the head 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:01.800
 so it's true it's a little bit 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.950
 yeah that's just 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.260
 see the speed he's 84 years old speed on 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.780
 the map so people that neither bregovic 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.030
 regular with 76 speed is very 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.650
 very difficult to defend on him then 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.930
 if you add almost 10 more 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.980
 imagined speed imagine the ravages 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.120
 imagine the ravages online 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.590
 technically really very very 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.100
 impressive with the 4-star gesture 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.090
 technical 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.810
 obviously we obviously regret 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.300
 the absence of 5 stars but 99 in 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.500
 dribbling game with the 4 stars gestures 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.060
 at the level of the execution of 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.050
 tripe is really crazy that 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.030
 a long time ago that I did not take as much 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.160
 fun to play like that with a 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.290
 player I really did the review in 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.610
 fashion and obviously it's a review so 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.230
 I wanted to score goals but 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.880
 unlike some review I am 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.950
 really thoroughly thoroughly on the goals and 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.630
 it is there I was rather in mode 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.710
 fun with the animals jean louis 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.720
 warmth textile etc 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.070
 and it's true he's a great player 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.510
 fun to play so this is already the 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.700
 last clip in monstrous free-kick 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.910
 which ends in the skylight of 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:58.770
 the opponent so there you have the record 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.850
 zlatan ibrahimovic will be displayed 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.290
 in front of your eyes 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.420
 so as you selling the points 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.890
 positive because there is not too much 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.870
 negative so the set pieces kicked 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.160
 the free kicks the penalties is 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.240
 really very good his vision of 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.970
 game that is just huge 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.000
 the striking one encompasses any finishing and 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.590
 did fly long hunt I talked about 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.180
 longchamps because in fact I have not 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.140
 marked but all lots each parent 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.610
 is really very very well the clauses 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.450
 number 8 has hitherto been here for 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.910
 the shot I missed luck 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.320
 his outside of the foot was almost 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.520
 arrested each time the guards he has 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.020
 searched in the skylight but it goes 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.040
 very very good 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.320
 these ball checks his taken from 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.180
 ball are just huge 99 we control 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.010
 dribble technically that impressive 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.570
 physical it's an impossible buffalo to 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.650
 move almost game head in the 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.260
 aerial field the very very good 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.280
 obviously but 95 so bah he's cheating 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.720
 a lot of head balloons and more 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.490
 of that there is a good bad stat and 

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.319
 1.99 in accuracy 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.460
 four-star air domain name 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:49.990
 bad foot he has both feet 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.039
 positioning always suitable fact 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.199
 always the right call 

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:55.360
 the advantage of these contributions enough 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:57.370
 so if leila's contributions 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.470
 low defensive average offense 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.479
 that is to say, leave without ever 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.889
 will have all the time ahead and bacon it 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:05.289
 make the call in the deep it's done 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:07.180
 still very bad thanks to his speed his 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:08.500
 pass quality and four stars 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.330
 and very technical hunting it's a point 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.220
 positive my self i consider this as a 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.330
 negative point but that's for most 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.190
 of you it is a positive point 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.690
 still because there are a lot of 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.970
 people who are just against the fact 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.680
 it thann and gesture 5 stars 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:22.930
 technical so you see the record in 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.330
 the stats with that any bregovic seven 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.949
 matches 14 goals 2 assists this is 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.659
 not a non struye record I know I have 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:30.849
 had and I'm hungry I'm going I 'm fit is 

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:33.819
 used to better for some big 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:35.259
 players but because there is a but on 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:37.690
 the seven matches I finished that one 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:39.039
 alone every time you tear who you do not

 as soon as you start stringing together 

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:46.780
 goals with a penalty kick the guys who get 

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:48.370
