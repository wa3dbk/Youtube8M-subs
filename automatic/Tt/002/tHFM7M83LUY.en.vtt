00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.450
 say that we can say that it is a little 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.799
 classy blogger and the stuff that I could 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.520
 to say it's instead of talking to me 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.659
 will have to come and test 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.689

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.130

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.710
 have a cap a nice uniform 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.899

 the fast food codes the uniform is from 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.270
 rigor 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.640
 what is the difference in cost between 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.079
 get a look here is the one 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.689
 can find in a brand that we do not 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.579
 will not quote then what the fat 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.710
 difference for me it's the products 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.270
 the products are fresh we work 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.590
 enormously actually here at 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.049
 restaurant we prepare them ourselves 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.549
 like our fries like our sauces would 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.959
 although we pronounce a set you 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.209
 want to know some secrets all to 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:02.579
 does very well to make a good burger 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:04.020
 there are several secrets here is the first 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.670
 so it's the bread of a danger notes 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.840
 it's a recipe we worked with 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.459
 it's an exclusive recipe we are 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.050
 from scratch point for this bread there 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.120
 and so it's fresh every morning there 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.890
 is delivered before each agreement service 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.000
 then the meat 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.530
 so you see there we are on a piece 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.050
 Charolais we cut it ourselves 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.650
 Christmas and of course here we know 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.769
 cook the meat 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.760
 it's a very important moment we're going 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.530
 caramelized the surface of the plane 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.230
 so we go there compressed to make 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.329
 the juices out of the meat to 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.640
 cause this caramelization so 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:35.590
 after that you help me success so there 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.200
 it's an old appearance in the house 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.709
 his secret secret the smoked chest 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.500
 yeah in the confused boot but she 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.239
 What should be slightly crunchy 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.650
 what's in this little sauce tax 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.540
 horse so that's a sauce 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.760
 barbecue barbecue sauce that we revisited 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.670
 so actually we worked the 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.989
 sauce to stay on something that 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.609
 people know yes and with 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.829
 some small ingredients to come 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:02.409
 surprise them is this this medina barbecue 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.389
 quickly closed but dean baker actually 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.129
 still a little secret in there again 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:07.840
 a secret decidedly it's more of a 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.319
 burger it's a diary and the 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.909
 squeegee 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.439
 so we get the whole volumes on 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:12.879
 receives the rouche raclette that is cut 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:16.299
 we saclay you everywhere 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:19.870
 sorry then there then the pottery 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:22.750
 smoke vasisht praying and finally the 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.579
 final touch it's really the whole 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.599
 difference with others in bus rejection 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.980
 that you could tread commented in 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.989
 other institutions but let's do 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.069
 clean slate of the past 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:34.959
 I will not go majority yeah you can we go 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.669
 add fresh grass really 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.840
 brought this little touch of freshness 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.579
 so at the end of the mouth is very 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.440
 interesting so here in this case with 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:44.000
 the barbecue sauce we have there 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.540
 the grass that we prefer is the 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.600
 chives way up and you ready in state 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.210
 solemn moment resort and 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.040
 hamburgers and true that says fast food has 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.390
 said kraft paper it would only be when 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.080
 not even break with the good old ones 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.070
 habits 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.840
 thank you kaling tati is a little disappointed she 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.520
 did not have any toys in his happy meal 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.940
 but the taste compensates for the disappointment 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.250
 games I seem luscious have well 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.320
 build the outside the meat go 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.900
 just super tasty a little bath on 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.130
 smells of cheese the sauce is 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.190
 Antoine killings damage whether it's a 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.109
 secret recipe but the fast food is 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.060
 not just the new burger but 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.630
 fashionable is the guillou da lequoy 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.630
 leviosa 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.379
 today tonight then obviously 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.180
 fed guillaume and god to the eye to 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:35.999
 quite typically the fast food punctuates me 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.189
 a dish in Japan that we eat enough 

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:40.259
 quickly between two often start 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:44.069
 at the bar and a very popular package 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:45.180
 what is cheap and we are 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:47.009
 tried to make it a little bit of their 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.379
 work and make it more prestigious 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:49.800
 more flexible even the plush and more 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:52.110
 trend 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.259
 so how do you make a 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.330
 chic Japanese ravioli we use a 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:58.979
 dordogne pig which is provided 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.240
 by the desnoyers butchery way which is 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.560
 today the best butcher 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.370
 Parisian that you can find 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.870
 but in the big restaurants 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.610
 we use the same and then there is the 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.110
 missed season done by the chef with 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.419
 which I actually work at the start 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.250
 that the leader of passage 53 which is our 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.229
 starred restaurant 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.960
 the recipe that's done by a 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:17.430
 great chef also obviously this pig from 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.229
 dordogne is not cooked any 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.699
 how to love a dribble of oil 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.810
 a slight trickle of oil underneath but 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:23.849
 it's not cooking in oil 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.479
 what's good is it's a lot 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:26.159
 more digestible 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.689
 yes it allows crispy cooking 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:30.150
 underneath we can see the glosses 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:31.680
 adventure little we add water and 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.689
 then we get the cooking 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.729
 net steam and both textures 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:36.839
 crispy melts 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:38.879
 it's not because we're in a 

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:41.249
 fast food chic that we do not have the right to 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:44.489
 play with chopsticks 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:47.509
 I have there are super good a little 

00:05:44.489 --> 00:05:47.509
 sauce next to citrus 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.510
 no 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:00.220
 12 gaza still clearly what 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.090
 line is to the angels promised swore she 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.090
 niera bio drive in
