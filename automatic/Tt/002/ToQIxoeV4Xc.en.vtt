00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.609
 more to my channel now I bring the booster 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.470
 of too much literary information and 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.480
 hidden that gives for a day too much with 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.210
 books and also by channel louis 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.580
 Luis Cyber ​​and then be very sincere 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.289
 just spent the worst nightmare for me 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.109
 any super book out there and 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.939
 it turns out that I am by record button 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.740
 it is because he comes to sit me and I was yes 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.510
 looking for the questions of all that and 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.420
 after that I put my finger on the button 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.220
 to record and it turns out that the 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.170
 recording when I thought I was 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.910
 starting to record then all that 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.739
 half an hour I'm recording talking 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.620
 in front of the camera for you 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.540
 it was like that it went like this 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.540
 and well, if that just happened 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:51.600
 but the best style to choose is 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.700
 because he already has a very good sense of 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.710
 fashion and this although it is already a neighbor and 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.420
 Normally I'm not using clothes 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.520
 very cool but when she can use 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.290
 Super stylish dress and super cute if 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.790
 fashioned cobos and everything and I think if 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.770
 lived in the contemporary world and 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.350
 it would be like that super fashionista then 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.970
 elena to my literary and it always seems 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.010
 I will always always choose what they were going for 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.020
 to Basques from the series of academies virus 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.700
 of the knights if I had a boyfriend myself 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.830
 I would expect that it came well off as well as 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.509
 facing all the bad vices but 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.009
 definitely as is the 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.100
 aware of the way in which 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.250
 change for her and how she accepted with her or 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.320
 is that it is so nice step you have to 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.180
 I started loving and I ended up hearing and the 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.830
 truth is that for some reason I can not 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.840
 remember more of a character that has 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.610
 loved at first you are hated but more 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.170
 the one on my shelf is the water 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.270
 this is stephanie mayer but that 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.430
 only because I bought the version 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.740
 that is the people will compose here and 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.600
 then it's like a big print 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.820
 then the letter is like double the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.180
 Book size 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.890
 they are the literary one and if it is although I have 1 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.350
 and sporting come inside a book 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.070
 then the selection to cure almost of 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.780

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.610
 the one of the chosen them some jewelry 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.500
 literary the truth that I do not have any 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.810

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.820
 but I do not have but if I have an end to the 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.560
 street the rhythms that demand height and 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.470
 Well, I suppose its mostly because 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.050
 I could put my hand in the new shirt like that 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.180

 appointment wing when it fills series because 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:29.660

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.800
 in the favorite conclusive car before 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.420

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.720

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.110
 space telescope this one is busy 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.180
 skills that I look for in the book and the 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.890
 truth is that I do not judge neither critics nor 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.710
 discriminate books before books 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.540
 then I am open to everything 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.560
 youthful since of the favorite book the 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.330

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.740
 jackson also micro vision owner 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.420
 two shots and two ships also serve 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.610

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.410
 missing the favorite book and I do not have a 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.130

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.340
 he took many pictures he knows his books that I 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.050
 they love berlin then 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.300
 admin macchi bonito just in case 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.070
 they are interested in seeing others when it happens 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.320
 something sad in a book and it can be 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.730
 together options the first is to stay 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.950
 in the place where I am with 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.630
 mental position and I begin to recapitulate 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.550
 everything happens if the second option is 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.170
 that can of my brother my beloved of a 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.120
 friend that is closer and 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.980
 I start telling you about what happened and 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.110
 I get sadder because they do not 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.030
 they understand why I'm sad when 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.520
 reading a book I feel 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.960
 perfectly put me a book at 100 300 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.209
 with our pages in one sitting 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.760
 but usually I can not do that 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.980
 because I go out or the university or then 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.020
 generally put about two or three days 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.150
 to the book that I finished faster 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.730
 and it seems good that instead I 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.680
 discard this book have 350 pages 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.360
 and you do not have the best story of the 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.160
 world but I think you know the moment 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.190
 indicated because when I sat in 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.480
 grow and I think it lasts like 34 hours a 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.790
 soon reading a new and last 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.980
 favorite book the windows of death to 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.080
 graus and this series of a character can 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:47.270
 that is funny that has a maturity 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.040
 very high intellectual also that 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.080
 make good decisions 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.850
 13 and the next question is that I 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.380
 personal foot appears and put it 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.240
 contrary to what I just told you 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.070
 which is why neither abduction and 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.330
 basically to do this thing that is done 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.100
 in this moment that is talking to 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.720

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.610
 of fear or hummingbird mini me that 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.110
 mosley is the answer no doubt here I think 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.900
 but if we call the time of 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.880
 blood and last book that made me cry 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.350

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.930
 can say from the chosen one or from the 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.480

 the cap that has precision ships 

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:56.180
 that to one the invisible ones are opposed or 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.099
