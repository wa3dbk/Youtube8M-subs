00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
mounted on the backside of it what we're

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.380 
mounted on the backside of it what we're
going<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.769> do<00:01:04.949> since<00:01:05.370> its<00:01:05.580> top<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:06.030> out<00:01:06.180> is

going to do since its top is out is
we're<00:01:06.570> going<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.750> slide<00:01:07.020> those<00:01:07.259> dowels<00:01:07.619> into

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
we're going to slide those dowels into

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.499 
we're going to slide those dowels into
the<00:01:08.159> channel<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.610> stop<00:01:08.850> system<00:01:09.360> would

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:09.509 
the channel to stop system would

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.819 
the channel to stop system would
normally<00:01:09.899> go<00:01:10.020> into<00:01:11.119> okay<00:01:12.229> and<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.560> want<00:01:13.740> to

normally go into okay and I want to

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:16.880 
normally go into okay and I want to
bring<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.100> in<00:01:14.220> far<00:01:14.579> enough<00:01:14.630> initially<00:01:15.860> or<00:01:16.860> I

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
bring it in far enough initially or I

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.160 
bring it in far enough initially or I
can<00:01:17.159> bring<00:01:17.340> my<00:01:17.549> blade<00:01:17.820> up<00:01:19.729> and<00:01:20.780> cut<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.930> end<00:01:22.049> of

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
can bring my blade up and cut the end of

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:31.250 
can bring my blade up and cut the end of
that<00:01:22.259> board<00:01:22.560> off

now according to the book polygons and
we're<00:01:37.120> going<00:01:37.270> to<00:01:37.300> try<00:01:37.510> to<00:01:37.570> do<00:01:37.750> a<00:01:37.780> ring<00:01:38.110> up

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
we're going to try to do a ring up

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.050 
we're going to try to do a ring up
that'd<00:01:38.530> be<00:01:39.100> about<00:01:39.220> eight<00:01:39.490> and<00:01:39.670> three<00:01:39.880> eighths

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
that'd be about eight and three eighths

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.450 
that'd be about eight and three eighths
or<00:01:40.180> so<00:01:40.360> in<00:01:40.510> diameter<00:01:40.660> and<00:01:41.500> according<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.310> the

or so in diameter and according to the
book<00:01:42.640> to<00:01:43.420> do<00:01:43.600> that<00:01:43.840> each<00:01:44.170> segment<00:01:44.560> would<00:01:44.950> be

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
book to do that each segment would be

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.650 
book to do that each segment would be
two<00:01:45.340> and<00:01:45.370> a<00:01:45.550> quarter<00:01:45.760> so<00:01:46.090> what<00:01:46.240> I<00:01:46.300> want<00:01:46.479> to<00:01:46.570> do

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:05:00.520 

we<00:03:56.990> quit

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:11.450 

we<00:05:01.530> have<00:05:01.710> our<00:05:01.890> 12<00:05:02.160> pieces<00:05:02.670> cut<00:05:10.010> so<00:05:11.010> to<00:05:11.070> drive

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
we have our 12 pieces cut so to drive

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:17.210 
we have our 12 pieces cut so to drive
fit<00:05:11.730> the<00:05:11.880> ring<00:05:15.620> take<00:05:16.620> those<00:05:16.860> you<00:05:16.980> notice

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
fit the ring take those you notice

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.950 
fit the ring take those you notice
there's<00:05:17.370> almost<00:05:17.550> no<00:05:17.910> tear<00:05:18.240> out<00:05:18.450> on<00:05:18.660> these

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
there's almost no tear out on these

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.510 
there's almost no tear out on these
that's<00:05:19.110> because<00:05:19.530> we<00:05:19.710> have<00:05:19.860> the<00:05:20.010> material

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
that's because we have the material

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.160 
that's because we have the material
backed<00:05:20.820> up<00:05:21.150> on<00:05:21.420> the<00:05:21.890> backside<00:05:22.890> and<00:05:23.900> also<00:05:24.900> on

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.170 
backed up on the backside and also on

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.930 
backed up on the backside and also on
the<00:05:25.350> underside<00:05:25.950> so<00:05:26.190> there's<00:05:26.400> really<00:05:26.520> no<00:05:26.760> place

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:26.940 
the underside so there's really no place

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.110 
the underside so there's really no place
for<00:05:27.270> the<00:05:27.390> fibers<00:05:27.950> to<00:05:28.950> tear<00:05:29.190> into<00:05:29.400> and<00:05:30.030> if

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
for the fibers to tear into and if

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.430 
for the fibers to tear into and if
you're<00:05:30.300> in<00:05:30.420> the<00:05:30.510> wood<00:05:30.690> turning<00:05:31.050> you're<00:05:31.170> really
