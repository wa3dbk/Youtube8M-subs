program<00:00:54.600> running<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.110> background<00:00:55.199> so

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
program running in the background so

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.849 
program running in the background so
it's<00:00:56.640> probably<00:00:56.940> going<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.480> tax<00:00:57.840> my<00:00:58.410> system

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
it's probably going to tax my system

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.319 
it's probably going to tax my system
quite<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.160> bit<00:01:00.320> so<00:01:01.320> my<00:01:01.770> FPS<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.609> probably<00:01:03.090> not

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
quite a bit so my FPS is probably not

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.899 
quite a bit so my FPS is probably not
going<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.600> be<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.750> high<00:01:04.549> again<00:01:05.549> this<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.880> a

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
going to be that high again this is a

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.310 
going to be that high again this is a
test<00:01:06.240> run<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.780> just<00:01:07.380> wanted<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.860> see<00:01:08.100> how<00:01:09.320> it

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
test run I just wanted to see how it

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.830 
test run I just wanted to see how it
does<00:01:10.650> with<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.250> video<00:01:11.580> program<00:01:12.540> running<00:01:12.750> in

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
does with this video program running in

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.800 
does with this video program running in
the<00:01:12.900> background<00:01:12.960> out<00:01:13.439> currently<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.340> am<00:01:14.430> in

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
the background out currently I am in

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.070

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
that it's daytime so you can see better

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.039 
that it's daytime so you can see better
now<00:01:26.220> i<00:01:26.280> do<00:01:26.460> have<00:01:26.670> fraps<00:01:27.299> running<00:01:27.689> up<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
now i do have fraps running up in the

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.499 
now i do have fraps running up in the
left<00:01:28.259> upper<00:01:28.710> left<00:01:29.040> hand<00:01:29.130> corner<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:32.210> see<00:01:33.210> here

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:40.880 
left upper left hand corner and see here
now<00:01:34.909> it's<00:01:35.909> about<00:01:36.890> 27<00:01:37.890> 28<00:01:38.900> 23<00:01:39.900> frames<00:01:40.530> per

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
now it's about 27 28 23 frames per

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.679 
now it's about 27 28 23 frames per
second<00:01:41.310> here<00:01:41.490> normally<00:01:42.000> if<00:01:42.150> i<00:01:42.270> didn't<00:01:42.659> have

second here normally if i didn't have

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.980 
second here normally if i didn't have
the<00:01:42.899> program<00:01:43.320> running<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:44.460> would<00:01:44.729> be<00:01:45.619> about<00:01:46.700> 48

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
the program running it would be about 48

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.270 
the program running it would be about 48
now<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.049> settings<00:01:49.500> are<00:01:49.710> all<00:01:49.979> on<00:01:50.869> max<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:52.350> mean

now the settings are all on max I mean

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.100 
now the settings are all on max I mean
max<00:01:54.240> everything<00:01:55.110> in<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.770> highest<00:01:55.979> setting

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
anyways I was getting frustrated because

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.920 
anyways I was getting frustrated because
I<00:03:39.370> kept<00:03:40.090> dying<00:03:40.860> I'm<00:03:41.860> not<00:03:42.040> a<00:03:42.070> really<00:03:42.930> good

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
I kept dying I'm not a really good

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.250 
I kept dying I'm not a really good
player<00:03:44.260> I<00:03:44.820> should<00:03:45.820> say<00:03:46.120> I<00:03:46.390> just<00:03:46.900> play

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
player I should say I just play

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.640 
player I should say I just play
occasionally<00:03:48.720> this<00:03:49.720> game<00:03:49.960> is<00:03:50.110> very<00:03:50.290> very<00:03:50.530> nice

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
occasionally this game is very very nice

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.210 
occasionally this game is very very nice
although<00:03:53.650> I<00:03:53.890> do<00:03:54.010> wish<00:03:54.280> that<00:03:54.340> it<00:03:54.610> was<00:03:55.470> an<00:03:56.470> MMO<00:03:56.980> if

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
although I do wish that it was an MMO if

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.250 
although I do wish that it was an MMO if
it<00:03:57.340> wasn't<00:03:57.640> MMO<00:03:57.970> I<00:03:58.210> think<00:03:58.960> it<00:03:59.050> would<00:03:59.170> have

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
it wasn't MMO I think it would have

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.190 
it wasn't MMO I think it would have
really<00:03:59.380> kicked<00:03:59.740> ass<00:04:00.330> because<00:04:01.330> I<00:04:02.370> quit<00:04:03.370> wow

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
really kicked ass because I quit wow

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.190 
really kicked ass because I quit wow
it's<00:04:05.200> been<00:04:05.410> about<00:04:05.590> a<00:04:05.650> year<00:04:05.740> since<00:04:06.100> I<00:04:06.430> quit

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
it's been about a year since I quit

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.810 
it's been about a year since I quit
anyways<00:04:09.000> so<00:04:10.000> far<00:04:10.240> so<00:04:10.450> good<00:04:11.250> it<00:04:12.250> would<00:04:12.460> be<00:04:12.610> a<00:04:12.640> lot

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:12.820 
anyways so far so good it would be a lot

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.670 
anyways so far so good it would be a lot
smoother<00:04:13.270> if<00:04:13.300> I<00:04:13.510> didn't<00:04:13.930> have<00:04:14.020> the<00:04:14.140> program<00:04:14.500> on

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
smoother if I didn't have the program on

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.260 
smoother if I didn't have the program on
again<00:04:15.120> you<00:04:16.120> can<00:04:16.480> play<00:04:17.080> this<00:04:17.260> game<00:04:17.940> with<00:04:18.940> an<00:04:19.000> old
