00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:12.289
 good there we're going to prepare chicken breast batter what Americans 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:16.420
 they call girl at the end of the month and to do it we're going to need 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.599
 flour bread crumbs we are ready 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:24.170
 and chicken breast the breast that is already clean of fat and open 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:29.209
 We were going to cut into strips about two centimeters wide and 10 centimeters long 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:31.840
 approximately 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.080
 and for the batter we are going to mix 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.480
 the breadcrumbs 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.730
 the sesame 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.250
 salt pepper 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.640
 and if there are no kids 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.350
 body neither cemented and if not then not because they fear tone and to children this 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.350
 they love it and we remove it well 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.740
 we split the two eggs 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.500
 We were going to overflow the flour first 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.730
 then egg 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.270
 two 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.660
 and finally the mixture with the bread crumbs 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.660
 We were doing with patience 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.120
 nick 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.909
 and now we go 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.639
 hazare and rock part to the fire 

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.569
 abundant olive oil 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.069
 basically a young girl stop when she's hot and let's do it in batches 

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:19.089
 of not many lives 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:22.119
 because if it does not cool the felcc 

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:25.119
 we turn around 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:40.219
 we propose you on a paper napkin to drain well 

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:49.299
 let's avoid this crunchy chicken breast that I'm sure you like a hug 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:49.979
