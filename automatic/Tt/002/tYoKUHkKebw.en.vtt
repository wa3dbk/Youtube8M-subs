that<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:20.039> old<00:00:20.340> map<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.880> old<00:00:21.029> rules<00:00:21.359> all<00:00:21.720> the

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
that the old map the old rules all the

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.840 
that the old map the old rules all the
old<00:00:22.020> assumptions<00:00:22.350> are<00:00:22.619> gone<00:00:22.800> an<00:00:23.070> evil<00:00:23.609> power

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
old assumptions are gone an evil power

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.120 
old assumptions are gone an evil power
of<00:00:24.150> some<00:00:24.359> sort<00:00:24.630> not<00:00:25.260> exactly<00:00:25.590> sure<00:00:25.800> what<00:00:26.099> it

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
of some sort not exactly sure what it

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.089 
of some sort not exactly sure what it
could<00:00:26.310> be<00:00:26.340> has<00:00:27.119> taken<00:00:27.510> over<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.810> server<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.289> I

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
could be has taken over the server and I

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.890 
could be has taken over the server and I
think<00:00:29.849> you're<00:00:29.970> going<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.119> find<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.720> your

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
think you're going to find that your

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.999 
think you're going to find that your
experience<00:00:31.199> there<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.619> going<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.800> be<00:00:31.859> quite

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
experience there is going to be quite

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.830 
experience there is going to be quite
different<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.669> lot<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.480> watched<00:00:33.660> our

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
different a lot of you watched our

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.299 
different a lot of you watched our
survival<00:00:34.380> series<00:00:35.420> probably<00:00:37.010> eight<00:00:38.010> or<00:00:38.070> nine

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
survival series probably eight or nine

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.280 
survival series probably eight or nine
videos<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.760> guess<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.120> total<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.540> a<00:00:39.989> lot<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.140> you

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
videos I guess in total and a lot of you

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.069 
videos I guess in total and a lot of you
wanted<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:41.129> have<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:41.340> experience<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.210> so<00:00:42.360> in

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
wanted to have that experience and so in

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.639 
wanted to have that experience and so in
conjunction<00:00:44.040> with<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:44.460> evil<00:00:44.730> power<00:00:44.940> we<00:00:45.840> now

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
conjunction with this evil power we now

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.529 
conjunction with this evil power we now
are<00:00:47.070> essentially<00:00:47.760> going<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.969> be<00:00:48.059> forced<00:00:48.300> to

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
are essentially going to be forced to

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.799 
are essentially going to be forced to
experience<00:00:49.110> more<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.410> a<00:00:49.530> survival<00:00:50.809> setup

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
experience more of a survival setup

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.350 
experience more of a survival setup
instead<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.620> co-op<00:00:53.010> like<00:00:54.000> creative

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
instead of a co-op like creative

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.380 
instead of a co-op like creative
building<00:00:54.690> mode<00:00:55.579> the<00:00:56.579> rules<00:00:56.820> are<00:00:57.030> going<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.329> be

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
building mode the rules are going to be

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.360 
building mode the rules are going to be
a<00:00:57.420> little<00:00:57.539> bit<00:00:57.719> weird<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.920> may<00:00:59.100> or<00:00:59.250> may<00:00:59.340> not

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
a little bit weird so you may or may not

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.459 
a little bit weird so you may or may not
like<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.730> but<00:00:59.879> we're<00:01:00.629> trying<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.020> out<00:01:01.170> as<00:01:01.350> an

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
like it but we're trying this out as an

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.869 
like it but we're trying this out as an
experiment<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.129> think<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.460> lot<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.730> are

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
experiment and I think a lot of you are

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:03.820 
experiment and I think a lot of you are
going<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.059> get<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> kick<00:01:03.390> out<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.570> it

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
going to get a kick out of it

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.320 
going to get a kick out of it
essentially<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> main<00:01:05.129> rules<00:01:05.400> are<00:01:05.700> random

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.370 
this as an experiment 1.3 is you know
minecraft<00:01:39.360> as<00:01:39.570> well<00:01:39.720> as<00:01:39.840> bucket<00:01:40.140> will<00:01:40.259> be

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
minecraft as well as bucket will be

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.530 
minecraft as well as bucket will be
coming<00:01:40.619> out<00:01:40.740> hopefully<00:01:41.400> soon<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.880> we<00:01:42.360> don't

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
coming out hopefully soon and we don't

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.300 
coming out hopefully soon and we don't
want<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.649> know<00:01:43.740> really<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.070> have<00:01:44.189> the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
want to you know really to have the

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.830 
want to you know really to have the
server<00:01:44.549> down<00:01:44.790> at<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.119> time<00:01:45.390> while<00:01:45.689> we're

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
server down at that time while we're

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.120 
server down at that time while we're
waiting<00:01:46.110> for<00:01:46.140> upgrades<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.770> we<00:01:46.829> thought<00:01:47.009> we

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
waiting for upgrades and we thought we

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.789 
waiting for upgrades and we thought we
would<00:01:47.159> try<00:01:47.369> this<00:01:47.490> as<00:01:47.820> an<00:01:47.939> experiment<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:49.290> see

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
would try this as an experiment to see

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.920 
would try this as an experiment to see
what<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.759> guys<00:01:50.880> think<00:01:51.119> anyway<00:01:51.630> it<00:01:51.689> should<00:01:51.720> be

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
what you guys think anyway it should be

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.469 
what you guys think anyway it should be
a<00:01:51.960> lot<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.140> fun<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.939> the<00:01:53.939> other<00:01:54.060> thing<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.329> want

a lot of fun and the other thing I want

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.760 
a lot of fun and the other thing I want
to<00:01:54.509> mention<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.930> all<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.320> names<00:01:55.500> on<00:01:55.710> the
