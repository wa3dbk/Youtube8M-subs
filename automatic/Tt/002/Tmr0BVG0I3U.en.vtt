00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.289
 welcome tutorial character creation for the game 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:18.220
 My name is Died 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.579
 this tutorial offered by the circuit producer 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:24.579
 and today we will develop a three-dimensional character 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:27.829
 putting in play 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.279
 At first we're doing conceptual art there. 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:32.970
 of our character 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.850
 tennis is one of the suspects 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.510
 I'm not going at the moment 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.100
 between background 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.350
 about this 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.649
 the process of 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:42.700
 conceptual 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.930
 but vote by making small comments 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.520
 about it 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.520
 the Indians' last contact 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.320
 Here I started. 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.020
 I'm doing my part, there's no way to do it. 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.710
 the minister of the farm 3 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.010
 I'm telling you that the southern tool 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.900
 how much ahead do we do 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.900
 the tutorial this character 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.390
 now that we already know what to model 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.990
 We'll move on to 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.370
 from modeling 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.420
 neto boot using the lookout point are two points 5 7 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.310
 and back by passing some basic commands 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.910
 to start doing some character 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.910
 so what I'm going to get into edit housing etc 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.330
 He has already been released. 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.570
 that's how April with him over the phone 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.870
 and I will not enter the view mode by pressing the key late 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.040
 entered into an obligation 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.030
 I have it here 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.000
 the exercise 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 after working beyond these 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.790
 the basic commands as such had taught 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.960
 movement 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.960
 so I'm going to click on one of those axes 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.790
 for liking 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.099
 what to do in the area 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.619
 a translation 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.619
 in this norberto phase become this 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:18.579
 another as a single button using 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.329
 is the extradition command 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:23.509
 I will not press the keyboard 

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:25.269
 I'll drag 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:26.429
 another 

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:28.749
 he will stir the flashes 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:31.749
 from the phases being driven 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.849
 other command that votes using a lighter 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:43.069
 on the shortcut key is the s key 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.149
 I'm going to press on the keyboard 

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:48.879
 the pivot key moves the mouse toward touching 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.039
 of farce 

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:53.559
 I come back by changing the scale 

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:55.779
 of this selected phase 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:58.779
 I'll be able to get vaccinated so easy 

00:03:00.529 --> 00:03:02.719
 is a group of French 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:05.719
 already making scandal 

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:09.729
 another statement because they vote for defeat are 

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:15.509
 hence your command I'm going to press fish 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.519
 and I'll tell you his side 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.519
 even winding mouse 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.929
 and another basic command that I'm going to continue 

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:26.759
 is the cut command 

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:29.609
 in the control scene 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.470
 it will govern to a line 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.470
 I never got discouraged in the magenta color 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.379
 in one hour 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:38.229
 in a session 

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:39.220
 of my object 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.619
 so I'm going to click 

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:43.979
 Mom said I want to cut here. 

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:46.069
 and I will position the cut line 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.069
 a double-click was confirmed 

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:53.079
 We can see 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.079
 was reported in those points 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:03.669
 I'll add one more 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:06.859
 and I'll talk about modifiers 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:09.859
 is to do the modeling of the character 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:13.399
 he will adopt that the character will submit 

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:16.079
 then the two sides will be the same 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.539
 not to have the work we do on her and on both sides and to vote using 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.809
 very stretched single 

00:04:21.809 --> 00:04:25.459
 so I'm going to make a subdivision the pressure to give up the court 

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:29.499
 Levo chose are subdividing 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.830
 the division office of germany 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.830
 in my way of seeing text 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.800
 delete the right 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:47.939
 nasdaq es question is right of the central court disease 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.430
 and I'll delete these gadgets leaving only half the group 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:55.009
 now the little 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:56.430
 I did not hit too much 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.719
 after cinema you were friends 

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:01.979
 which will automatically be general 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.289
 the other half than the cube 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.699
 not even any operation I've done is a year 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:09.180
 automatically 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.409
 it will be done right? 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:13.629
 at this time 

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:15.650
 so these plot 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.389
 the other basic commands used 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:20.580
 and from now on we will start 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.530
 doing this modeling
