words and then pull it the radio up

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.440 
words and then pull it the radio up
itself<00:03:22.299> out<00:03:23.549> then<00:03:24.549> you've<00:03:24.700> got<00:03:24.850> these<00:03:25.030> three

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
itself out then you've got these three

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.810 
itself out then you've got these three
cables<00:03:25.989> this<00:03:26.500> is<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:26.799> bus<00:03:26.980> cable<00:03:27.459> and<00:03:27.670> then

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
cables this is the bus cable and then

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.310 
cables this is the bus cable and then
these<00:03:27.970> are<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.180> two<00:03:28.269> wiring<00:03:28.810> harnesses<00:03:29.260> so

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
these are the two wiring harnesses so

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.569 
these are the two wiring harnesses so
you<00:03:29.709> can<00:03:29.860> get<00:03:29.950> power<00:03:30.160> if<00:03:31.060> you<00:03:31.180> want<00:03:31.329> to<00:03:31.390> do<00:03:31.510> is

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
you can get power if you want to do is

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.600 
you can get power if you want to do is
you<00:03:33.579> pull<00:03:34.540> out<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:35.140> bus<00:03:35.320> cable<00:03:35.799> like<00:03:36.070> that<00:03:36.310> and

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
you pull out the bus cable like that and

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.690 
you pull out the bus cable like that and
then<00:03:37.600> on<00:03:37.630> these<00:03:37.930> two<00:03:38.110> cables<00:03:38.500> there's<00:03:39.220> little

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
then on these two cables there's little

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.550 
then on these two cables there's little
latches<00:03:39.940> on<00:03:40.269> the<00:03:40.390> bottom<00:03:40.750> I'll<00:03:41.049> start<00:03:41.290> to<00:03:41.380> show

is totally disconnected my case I have a
new<00:04:16.100> radio<00:04:16.489> but<00:04:16.910> I<00:04:17.000> don't<00:04:17.180> have<00:04:17.269> the<00:04:17.420> wiring

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
new radio but I don't have the wiring

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.440 
new radio but I don't have the wiring
harness<00:04:18.080> yet<00:04:18.380> I<00:04:18.500> ordered<00:04:18.980> it<00:04:19.100> offline<00:04:19.430> so<00:04:19.910> I've

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
harness yet I ordered it offline so I've

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:28.900 
harness yet I ordered it offline so I've
got<00:04:20.840> my<00:04:21.320> radio<00:04:21.470> all<00:04:22.010> set<00:04:22.670> up<00:04:24.670> here<00:04:27.520> it's<00:04:28.520> a<00:04:28.640> Sony

don't scratch when I put it in but
you've<00:04:32.420> got<00:04:32.540> the<00:04:32.660> two<00:04:32.810> wiring<00:04:33.200> harnesses<00:04:33.650> and

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
you've got the two wiring harnesses and

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.380 
you've got the two wiring harnesses and
I<00:04:34.880> have<00:04:35.600> them<00:04:35.810> wire<00:04:36.020> nutted<00:04:36.440> and<00:04:37.390> electrical

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
I have them wire nutted and electrical

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.240 
I have them wire nutted and electrical
tapes<00:04:38.600> that<00:04:38.780> are<00:04:38.900> all<00:04:39.020> ready<00:04:39.140> to<00:04:39.380> go<00:04:39.530> if<00:04:39.740> you

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
tapes that are all ready to go if you

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.710 
tapes that are all ready to go if you
need<00:04:40.310> to<00:04:40.460> step-by-step<00:04:41.060> process<00:04:41.480> for<00:04:41.510> that

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
need to step-by-step process for that

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.510 
need to step-by-step process for that
I'll<00:04:41.840> make<00:04:41.990> a<00:04:42.050> new<00:04:42.290> video<00:04:42.410> and<00:04:42.770> show<00:04:42.920> you<00:04:42.950> but

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
I'll make a new video and show you but

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.880 
I'll make a new video and show you but
you<00:04:44.360> won't<00:04:44.510> use<00:04:44.690> all<00:04:44.960> of<00:04:45.140> these<00:04:45.260> cables<00:04:45.740> you'll

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
you won't use all of these cables you'll

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.860 
you won't use all of these cables you'll
only<00:04:46.070> use<00:04:46.190> this<00:04:46.610> one<00:04:46.880> this<00:04:47.120> one<00:04:47.360> will<00:04:47.480> just<00:04:47.720> sit

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
only use this one this one will just sit

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.020 
only use this one this one will just sit
in<00:04:47.990> there<00:04:48.140> and<00:04:48.260> you<00:04:49.130> obviously<00:04:49.610> need<00:04:49.760> the<00:04:49.790> bus

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
in there and you obviously need the bus

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.680 
in there and you obviously need the bus
cable<00:04:50.450> so<00:04:50.600> what<00:04:50.750> you<00:04:50.870> do<00:04:51.050> is<00:04:52.180> put<00:04:53.180> the<00:04:53.300> radio

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
cable so what you do is put the radio

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.230 
cable so what you do is put the radio
let's<00:04:54.350> see<00:04:54.740> it<00:04:55.430> this<00:04:55.580> way<00:04:56.060> and<00:04:56.620> then<00:04:57.620> you<00:04:57.650> take

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
let's see it this way and then you take

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.050 
let's see it this way and then you take
this<00:04:59.240> big<00:04:59.630> wiring<00:05:00.050> harness<00:05:00.470> and<00:05:00.680> it<00:05:01.610> goes<00:05:01.790> into

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
this big wiring harness and it goes into

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:13.840 
this big wiring harness and it goes into
the<00:05:02.740> rectangular<00:05:04.240> one<00:05:09.430> so<00:05:10.430> just<00:05:12.430> put<00:05:13.430> it<00:05:13.460> in<00:05:13.669> as

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
the rectangular one so just put it in as

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.520 
the rectangular one so just put it in as
far<00:05:14.060> as<00:05:14.150> you<00:05:14.240> can<00:05:14.330> go<00:05:14.510> and<00:05:14.840> then<00:05:15.169> it's<00:05:15.320> like

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
far as you can go and then it's like

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:21.040 
far as you can go and then it's like
that<00:05:16.090> then<00:05:17.090> you<00:05:18.050> take<00:05:18.350> the<00:05:19.160> bus<00:05:19.400> cable<00:05:20.050> and

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
that then you take the bus cable and

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.270
