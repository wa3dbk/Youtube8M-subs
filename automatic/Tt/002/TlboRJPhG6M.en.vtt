 soon the works on the third island 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.200
 in this video today we are looking for a spreadsheet 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.490
 out 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.870
 the mega sena when you play with the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.390
 seven tens 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:21.960
 in 105 games closing 100% the scene because 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:26.970
 You only need to hit any group 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.939
 of the 15 group with those wanting to help themselves 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.219
 we will have to polish the 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.239
 millionaire awards of the mega-sena 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:40.320
 we have here is the first globe 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:43.290
 are 14 frame bases where 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.070
 the number being distributed at 15 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.449
 groups 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:55.500
 the second group is to be the fifth 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:59.329
 sixth, seventh and eighth ninth and tenth 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.780
 fifth group, ie at any time 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:05.850
 of these 15 groups are among the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.400
 the groups hit at least three dozen 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.020
 in two groups with which we will have the 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.510
 obligation of the scene let's make a 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:18.420
 simulation here we go because no group 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:27.680
 about four to tenteen and the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:31.790
 25 and in group 3 is the certainty in 42 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:36.680
 37 and 17 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:42.180
 note that I would have the scene closed 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:45.770
 Let's occur in group 5 I have a 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.770
 ten years 2038 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:57.030
 I got everyone group read today in group 2 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:02:02.909
 and 12 from group 11 and 12 and from group s with 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:08.009
 sure not 38 just me 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:18.470
 accept a akna and a good block the 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:18.470
 goal that the 119 and a23 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.950
 I will accept 6 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.040
 then this method he is sensational 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.040
 because if I sit in any order 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.860
 of the 15 group 3 like 12 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.829
 I have to get old their just 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:40.110
 twice in two bars of either 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:46.500
 of the few in group 2 is certainty 28 and 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:55.280

 in 2050 while in addition to 20 and 44 44 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.250
 They said I would have the court closed. 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:35.070
 some because if I hit a base of 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:35.070
 train and the groups of two 2850 and 31 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:43.510
 note that I would have a machine and a 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:46.150
 interest in acquiring this block 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.620
 worksheet using all six 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.710
 dozens 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.720
 closing the scene in castle of 8 is only 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.850
 find just get in touch here 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.800
 with two centers of our channel in
