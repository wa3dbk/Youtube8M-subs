00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
day the tree ox is accuracy blew me away

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.950 
day the tree ox is accuracy blew me away
as<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.610> was<00:00:59.730> able<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.000> get<00:01:00.239> easy<00:01:00.480> kills<00:01:00.840> from

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
as I was able to get easy kills from

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
but I could also defend myself from

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.200 
but I could also defend myself from
