00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
choice on that I think so i think in a

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.240 
choice on that I think so i think in a
way<00:02:22.860> especially<00:02:23.189> if<00:02:23.790> it's<00:02:24.420> like<00:02:24.629> a<00:02:24.950> video<00:02:25.950> with

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
way especially if it's like a video with

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.030 
way especially if it's like a video with
like<00:02:26.459> a<00:02:26.489> dark<00:02:27.329> artist<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.200> they<00:02:28.290> feel<00:02:28.500> like<00:02:28.739> it

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
like a dark artist and they feel like it

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.740 
like a dark artist and they feel like it
should<00:02:29.310> be<00:02:29.430> all<00:02:29.549> dark<00:02:29.879> girls<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.390> girls<00:02:30.510> kind

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
should be all dark girls the girls kind

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.039 
should be all dark girls the girls kind
of<00:02:30.900> like<00:02:31.079> hate<00:02:31.829> that<00:02:32.069> they<00:02:32.220> put<00:02:32.939> in<00:02:33.060> or<00:02:33.420> give<00:02:33.840> a

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
of like hate that they put in or give a

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.319 
of like hate that they put in or give a
spotlight<00:02:34.590> to<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.069> girl<00:02:35.310> that's<00:02:35.549> either<00:02:35.760> Latin

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
spotlight to a girl that's either Latin

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.990 
spotlight to a girl that's either Latin
or<00:02:36.569> of<00:02:36.989> another<00:02:37.260> race<00:02:37.379> and<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.459> think<00:02:38.700> it's<00:02:38.879> just

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
or of another race and I think it's just

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.899 
or of another race and I think it's just
more<00:02:39.450> about<00:02:40.379> mixing<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.099> all<00:02:41.190> together<00:02:41.370> and

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909 
more about mixing it all together and

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.149 
more about mixing it all together and
and<00:02:42.150> it's<00:02:42.900> not<00:02:43.139> really<00:02:43.319> about<00:02:43.409> race<00:02:43.709> it's<00:02:43.950> just

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
and it's not really about race it's just

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.129 
and it's not really about race it's just
about<00:02:44.340> getting<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.879> spot<00:02:45.239> and<00:02:45.269> being<00:02:45.959> the

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
about getting that spot and being the

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.020 
about getting that spot and being the
right<00:02:46.290> one<00:02:46.470> for<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.769> right<00:02:46.920> part<00:02:47.159> it<00:02:47.489> is<00:02:47.730> that
