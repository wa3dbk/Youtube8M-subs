Fila Beasley he's a nice effect and they
are<00:00:29.929> really<00:00:30.080> exploring<00:00:30.710> the<00:00:31.189> field<00:00:31.519> of<00:00:31.789> Living

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210

Architecture<00:00:32.420> it's<00:00:33.230> more<00:00:33.530> skill<00:00:33.920> in<00:00:34.040> the

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
Architecture it's more skill in the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.700 
Architecture it's more skill in the
concept<00:00:34.640> face<00:00:34.910> and<00:00:35.420> it<00:00:35.570> inspired<00:00:36.050> me<00:00:36.230> for<00:00:36.560> my

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
concept face and it inspired me for my

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.950 
concept face and it inspired me for my
work<00:00:36.740> in<00:00:37.430> the<00:00:37.880> sense<00:00:38.150> that<00:00:38.330> it<00:00:38.570> could<00:00:38.750> also

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
work in the sense that it could also

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.220 
work in the sense that it could also
arrive<00:00:39.590> for<00:00:39.980> design<00:00:40.400> or<00:00:40.730> fashion<00:00:41.300> that's<00:00:41.510> we

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
arrive for design or fashion that's we

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.180 
arrive for design or fashion that's we
we<00:00:42.830> sort<00:00:43.280> of<00:00:43.370> stopped<00:00:43.670> creating<00:00:44.150> the<00:00:44.690> endless

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
we sort of stopped creating the endless

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.770 
we sort of stopped creating the endless
pieces<00:00:46.190> and<00:00:46.430> then<00:00:46.550> throw<00:00:47.060> it<00:00:47.120> away<00:00:47.330> so<00:00:47.540> that

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
pieces and then throw it away so that

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.390 
pieces and then throw it away so that
you<00:00:48.050> can<00:00:48.230> create<00:00:48.410> a<00:00:48.620> to<00:00:48.890> ask<00:00:49.040> for<00:00:49.310> example

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
you can create a to ask for example

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.900 
you can create a to ask for example
which<00:00:50.030> is<00:00:50.240> partly<00:00:50.840> alive<00:00:51.230> that<00:00:51.590> can<00:00:51.910> devolve

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
which is partly alive that can devolve

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.240 
which is partly alive that can devolve
into<00:00:53.210> another<00:00:53.690> dress<00:00:54.050> in<00:00:54.380> three<00:00:54.740> years<00:00:54.920> or

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
into another dress in three years or

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.510 
into another dress in three years or
something<00:00:55.490> that<00:00:56.270> we<00:00:56.570> make<00:00:57.500> better<00:00:57.800> use<00:00:57.920> of<00:00:58.160> a

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
something that we make better use of a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:31.480 
something that we make better use of a
material

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.620 

I<00:01:31.549> was<00:01:32.270> wearing<00:01:32.750> a<00:01:33.049> plastic<00:01:34.040> kind<00:01:35.030> of<00:01:35.210> Swan

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
I was wearing a plastic kind of Swan

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.380 
I was wearing a plastic kind of Swan
Lake<00:01:35.659> dress<00:01:36.530> really<00:01:37.460> amazing<00:01:38.030> I've<00:01:38.180> never

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
Lake dress really amazing I've never

00:01:38.390 --> 00:02:02.730 
Lake dress really amazing I've never
seen<00:01:38.689> you<00:01:38.750> dressed<00:01:39.049> like<00:01:39.170> this<00:01:39.470> before

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.700 

it's<00:02:03.700> a<00:02:03.850> lot<00:02:04.000> of<00:02:04.150> synthetic<00:02:05.110> materials

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
it's a lot of synthetic materials

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.710 
it's a lot of synthetic materials
because<00:02:06.130> I<00:02:06.310> thought<00:02:06.549> that<00:02:06.759> really<00:02:07.090> was<00:02:07.329> part

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
because I thought that really was part

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.870 
because I thought that really was part
of<00:02:07.869> the<00:02:08.020> concept<00:02:08.500> I<00:02:08.649> make<00:02:08.860> organic<00:02:09.220> shape<00:02:09.640> I

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
of the concept I make organic shape I

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.240 
of the concept I make organic shape I
think<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:10.539> whole<00:02:10.720> idea<00:02:11.140> of<00:02:11.739> the<00:02:11.980> Living

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
think the whole idea of the Living

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.850 
think the whole idea of the Living
Architecture<00:02:12.430> is<00:02:13.180> combining<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:14.380> iconic

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
Architecture is combining the iconic

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.040 
Architecture is combining the iconic
sign<00:02:15.069> of<00:02:15.250> us<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.849> more<00:02:16.090> scientific<00:02:16.810> I

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
sign of us and the more scientific I

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.800 
sign of us and the more scientific I
also<00:02:17.410> use<00:02:17.770> polymer<00:02:18.340> like<00:02:18.670> transparent<00:02:19.510> 3d

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
also use polymer like transparent 3d

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.660 
also use polymer like transparent 3d
printing<00:02:20.319> which<00:02:20.560> was<00:02:20.830> something<00:02:21.280> totally<00:02:21.430> new

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
printing which was something totally new

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.870 
printing which was something totally new
for<00:02:21.819> me<00:02:22.060> I<00:02:22.390> use<00:02:22.750> a<00:02:22.780> lot<00:02:23.019> of<00:02:23.170> couple<00:02:23.880> married

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
for me I use a lot of couple married

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.090 
for me I use a lot of couple married
couple

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
couple

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.910 
couple
I<00:02:26.300> try<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.330> use<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.750> lot<00:02:28.020> of<00:02:28.050> shine<00:02:28.410> in<00:02:28.800> this

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
I try to use a lot of shine in this

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.910 
I try to use a lot of shine in this
collection<00:02:29.190> because<00:02:29.940> it's<00:02:30.650> together<00:02:31.650> with

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
collection because it's together with

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.980 
collection because it's together with
the<00:02:32.280> movement<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.030> light<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.720> really

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
the movement and the light the really

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.230 
the movement and the light the really
soft<00:02:34.200> materials<00:02:34.860> it's<00:02:35.040> hard<00:02:35.310> or<00:02:35.520> soft<00:02:35.700> in<00:02:36.090> at

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
soft materials it's hard or soft in at

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.810 
soft materials it's hard or soft in at
the<00:02:36.330> same<00:02:36.510> time<00:02:36.750> so<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.230> looks<00:02:37.830> really<00:02:38.160> nice<00:02:38.430> so

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
the same time so it looks really nice so

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.900 
the same time so it looks really nice so

new material how did it go I'm working
on<00:03:01.709> it<00:03:01.860> but<00:03:02.340> it<00:03:02.629> takes<00:03:03.629> longer<00:03:04.110> than<00:03:04.319> one

season but it's working and I am I'm
really<00:03:07.590> thinking<00:03:07.830> it<00:03:08.250> can<00:03:08.459> work<00:03:08.730> out<00:03:09.120> next
