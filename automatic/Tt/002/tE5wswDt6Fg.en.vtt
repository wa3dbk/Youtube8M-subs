00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:09.200
 hello let's see how to play a song 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.209
 your opponent that you want to touch the eyes of 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.250
 sky of Victor Heredia which is the 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:15.820
 song that we are going to see now with notes 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.820
 easy 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:23.640
 we started in me the tone is my minor and 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.100
 let's make an association of notes 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.710
 that are repeated 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.130
 the association of notes that you have to 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:36.010
 remember is 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.010
 to me minor 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:42.600
 the seventh the first thing that you have to 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.600
 to do is to know these notes come to you 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.230
 do not 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:58.040
 and these are the notes of the repeat 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:01:03.210
 E minor seventh no more re 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:05.790
 and we return to my minor 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:11.659
 the pace that we are going to apply in this 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.659
 heaven eyes song is the next 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.210
 the 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.450
 I'll explain 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.530
 one down 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:36.979
 the second sea bottom up third and 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:36.979
 down 4 4 123 with 123 faster 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.189
 but 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.189
 why not 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.740
 are approximate notes will not come out such 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:55.100
 what the song 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.840
 but they are easy notes and this way 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:02.060
 you can go playing this song 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.600
 generally when one pulls songs 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:11.300
 on guitar he does it with notes that sound 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:15.440
 well and that they are approximate 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.770
 no you do not usually play all the melody such 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.260
 what the original 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.710
 it is an accompaniment to be able to sing 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.210
 one a song 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.210
 if you are looking 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.780
 on the internet a letter will appear 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:36.720
 chords 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.720
 possible to interpret the melody 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.540
 we go to the first part of the chorus 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.540
 It's different 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:52.770
 what 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:54.450
 I look at the bottom of your external eyes 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:03:01.830
 erase me 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:06.360
 with everyone and the world is erased and 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:13.500
 discover the sky when you know me 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:16.320
 in tender eyes or with the sky eyes 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:20.160
 Do not leave me in mid-flight 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:30.320
 like being the eyes of being all my life 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:30.320
 for this dream 1000 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:39.000
 that part of the chorus have other 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.000
 different 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.100
 and not 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.240
 where 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.240
 the seventh 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:56.030
 this is repeated again and again 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:00.430
 Sun 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:03.060
 re the seventh 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.060
 min 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.900
 now how can you learn this 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.030
 good song first of all you have 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.950
 that learn the letter you buy the cid 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.470
 and original of aerial vÃ­ctor and you 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.760
 we hear the lyrics over and over until 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.490
 that you learn by heart 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.270
 after learning the succession of the 

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.639
 notes 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.480
 and then you go singing with the lyrics that you already 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.040
 you know by heart 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:31.580
 At first you can forget a little 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.970
 of the rhythm of this hand nor marks the 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.970
 notes 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:44.199
 for example 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:50.580
 If I forget what is true if I 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:57.180
 will take me away from the most 0 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:05:02.900
 the eyes of heaven will remind me if I 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:06.090
 will move me away from the true 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:09.950
 that is more by marking the notes 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:14.450
 and then you put the rhythm 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:17.710
 notice that I was a little bit wrong 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.710
 beginning the new 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:32.610
 I will forget 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:38.980
 but if I stayed away from the sincere 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:44.640
 the eyes of heaven do not remember if I 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:44.640
 away from the omar montero 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:53.140
 and so you practice it again and again 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:57.720
 the next the last part is also 

00:05:53.140 --> 00:06:01.620
 it is the same is this association of notes 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:04.800
 you grab and practice it for half an hour and 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:09.520
 you listen to the original again and compare 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:12.610
 You are making memory of the song 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:15.460
 I recommend that you try to memorize 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:17.919
 memorize the musical notes memorize 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:20.930
 the letter memorize the rhythm memorize 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:23.139
 everything and not write it down 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:26.499
 on a paper 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:28.270
 then as you have memorized this you go 

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:30.639
 generating a musical memory that 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.960
 you can also apply it and you 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:35.889
 help to get other songs 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:39.539
 different so always to learn the 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:41.710
 Memory songs choose a song 

00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:44.469
 practice the months until it comes out 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:47.169
 perfect here we are seeing eyes of 

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:49.120
