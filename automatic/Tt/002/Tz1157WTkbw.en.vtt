 plants hope and love where you step 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.520
 you are a flamenco angel with nothing 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:15.670
 I gave him a couple of kisses for each of 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:18.989
 the conches that form your hair leave 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.989
 that caresses the wind

 in this life I adore you 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.569
 in all the rest 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.569
 I'll be with you 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.000
 good 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.080
