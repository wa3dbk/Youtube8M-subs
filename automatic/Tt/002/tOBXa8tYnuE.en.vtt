00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:12.400
 Hello everyone, well, today we are going to do 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.910
 a led no 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.240
 is 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.000
 a tool for sewing especially 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.360
 formerly used for sewing 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.360
 leather 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.710
 then it is still used today 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.759
 what happens that already with the machines of 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.550
 sew and everything we have of 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.870
 machinery because it is much easier 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.449
 but for some patch it is followed 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:42.410
 using then the first thing I'm going to 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:46.630
 to do is cut a piece of 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.630
 of wood to make what is the handle 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:02.489
 Well, I also have already mounted 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:06.949
 which is the lathe lathe drill and also 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.949
 with the march stopped to be able 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:16.150
 and directly from here since the 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.160
 Drill trigger is fixed 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.810
 so you do not have to walk around 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.810
 then simply with giving it here 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:44.430
 Well, it is already taking another form and 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.430
 this is the cap that I'm going to put 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.780
 good 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.270
 yes 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.370
 a little bit of fine sandpaper 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.099
 ah 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.190
 and a tap here to get her 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.930
 the east and ready 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.140
 good the cap 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.140
 is ready 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.549
 well and now of 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:20.610
 a rod of an umbrella that are 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:24.420
 closed so we cut one of the 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:28.280
 pieces and with this we are going to do what 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.280
 ya channel na 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.140
 once we have made the hole with 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.520
 the corresponding bit more or less 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.640
 thickness of 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.640
 of the rod is when we will put it 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:48.200
 on your site 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:51.110
 and with the radial we will make the row point 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:55.040
 Well I took advantage of some sticks 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:58.640
 old billiards that I had out there and 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.850
 I've also cut them because I do not 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.580
 wood is hard and 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.430
 Giving me a call 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.610
 it saves me a little work what I've 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.370
 fact is to go making handles for 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:14.160
 different letters that I have here that 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:17.459
 they are already a few years old but not 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:19.920
 they had what is the mango I still have 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.359
 also made a punch with a rod 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.359
 unstable steel 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.780
 and is 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.140
 needle that is from a sewing machine 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:37.540
 industrial that comes in handy for 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:37.540
 certain leather sewing works 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.890
 it's been a lot of years 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.820
 with me that is a punch for little things 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:48.849
 Chiquitita already has many more years of 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.460
 20 at least 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:51.930
 do not 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.979
 and these are the ones that I just did 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.820
 also that they are slow of channel these are 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:01.770
 I used to 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:05.950
 to sew what was animal tools 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:10.290
 what united the leather with the wood or the 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.290
 thing for 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.800
 to what was the saddle or things 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.560
 so then keep the channel it 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.389
 I used to put the thread 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.850
 difference between this and this is that a 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:27.560
 It has a hole and forward where it 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.560
 I put the thread 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.370
 and with a kind of sewed fit 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.040
 of 8 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:38.689
 very well then this what I wanted them 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.840
 teach in relation to 

00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:43.330
 what are letters 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:47.500
 that have been used for a long time 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:51.020
 time and now except for certain 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:54.809
 artisan works as they are in disuse 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:58.189
 very well, thank you very much, I hope 

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:58.189
 have liked and until next time
