00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
represents the opposing point of view

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.190 
represents the opposing point of view
finally<00:02:07.580> you<00:02:07.940> can<00:02:08.060> go<00:02:08.209> to<00:02:08.269> the<00:02:08.420> casting<00:02:08.869> window

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
finally you can go to the casting window

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.140 
finally you can go to the casting window
where<00:02:09.739> you<00:02:09.769> can<00:02:09.860> take<00:02:10.129> any<00:02:10.369> character<00:02:10.940> and

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
where you can take any character and

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.780 
where you can take any character and
assign<00:02:11.510> them<00:02:11.659> any<00:02:11.930> one<00:02:12.379> of<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.739> 500<00:02:13.400> icons

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
assign them any one of the 500 icons

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.330 
assign them any one of the 500 icons
that<00:02:14.269> come<00:02:14.510> with<00:02:14.690> dramatical<00:02:15.260> so<00:02:15.920> this

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
that come with dramatical so this

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.730 
that come with dramatical so this
character<00:02:16.819> for<00:02:17.000> example<00:02:17.480> might<00:02:17.959> be<00:02:17.989> made<00:02:18.379> to

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
character for example might be made to

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.490 
character for example might be made to
be<00:02:18.890> this

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
be this

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.350 
be this
that<00:02:21.040> way<00:02:21.280> you<00:02:21.340> can<00:02:21.580> get<00:02:21.730> in<00:02:21.849> better<00:02:22.030> touch

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
that way you can get in better touch

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.970 
that way you can get in better touch
with<00:02:22.599> the<00:02:22.690> characters<00:02:23.170> while<00:02:23.680> you're<00:02:23.830> working

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
with the characters while you're working

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.120 
with the characters while you're working
with<00:02:24.160> them<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.580> software<00:02:28.890> but<00:02:29.890> there<00:02:30.040> are

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
with them and the software but there are

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.280 
with them and the software but there are
many<00:02:30.340> other<00:02:30.640> areas<00:02:30.790> for<00:02:31.510> helping<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:32.020> create

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
many other areas for helping to create

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.900

them is in brainstorming here you can

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.740 
them is in brainstorming here you can
select<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.860> character<00:02:42.160> generator<00:02:42.819> and<00:02:43.090> when

select the character generator and when

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.290 
select the character generator and when
you<00:02:43.870> do<00:02:44.140> you<00:02:44.770> have<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:45.040> opportunity<00:02:45.730> to<00:02:46.150> have

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
you do you have the opportunity to have

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.120 
you do you have the opportunity to have
dramatical<00:02:46.870> automatically<00:02:47.800> create

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130
