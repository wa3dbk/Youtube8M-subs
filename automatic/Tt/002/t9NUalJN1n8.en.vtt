that<00:03:13.060> is<00:03:13.180> 12<00:03:13.480> inches<00:03:13.689> so<00:03:14.049> that<00:03:14.079> I<00:03:14.230> don't<00:03:14.379> have

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
that is 12 inches so that I don't have

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.129 
that is 12 inches so that I don't have
to<00:03:14.799> cut<00:03:15.099> it<00:03:15.250> to<00:03:15.730> frame<00:03:16.000> my<00:03:16.180> face<00:03:16.419> because<00:03:16.900> it's

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
to cut it to frame my face because it's

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:18.990 
to cut it to frame my face because it's
already<00:03:17.590> at<00:03:17.739> the<00:03:17.889> length<00:03:18.129> that<00:03:18.280> I<00:03:18.400> wanted<00:03:18.760> so

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
already at the length that I wanted so

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.709 
already at the length that I wanted so
that's<00:03:19.599> perfect

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:21.719 
that's perfect

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:25.500 
that's perfect
the<00:03:22.719> ends<00:03:23.199> are<00:03:23.319> still<00:03:23.590> beautiful<00:03:24.269> of<00:03:25.269> course

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
the ends are still beautiful of course

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.849 
the ends are still beautiful of course
it's<00:03:25.689> been<00:03:25.840> too<00:03:26.019> late<00:03:26.169> so<00:03:26.439> there's<00:03:26.650> really

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
it's been too late so there's really

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.800 
it's been too late so there's really
nothing<00:03:27.639> to<00:03:27.669> say<00:03:27.819> about<00:03:28.090> it<00:03:28.359> because<00:03:28.449> there's

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
nothing to say about it because there's

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.990 
nothing to say about it because there's
no<00:03:28.989> change<00:03:29.319> in<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.590> hair<00:03:29.889> and<00:03:30.280> sometimes<00:03:30.790> when

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
no change in the hair and sometimes when

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.659 
no change in the hair and sometimes when
you<00:03:31.090> do<00:03:31.389> cut<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:32.109> hair<00:03:32.319> whether<00:03:33.129> it<00:03:33.370> be<00:03:33.519> with

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:33.669 
you do cut the hair whether it be with

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:36.420 
you do cut the hair whether it be with
permanent<00:03:34.060> semicolon<00:03:34.780> here<00:03:35.079> you<00:03:35.799> open<00:03:36.220> it<00:03:36.310> up

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
permanent semicolon here you open it up

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.819 
permanent semicolon here you open it up
the<00:03:36.549> cuticle<00:03:37.090> of<00:03:37.269> the<00:03:37.359> hair<00:03:37.569> strand<00:03:38.290> to

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
the cuticle of the hair strand to

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.249 
the cuticle of the hair strand to
deposit<00:03:39.189> color<00:03:39.699> so<00:03:40.299> sometimes<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:41.019> Chipko

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:41.259 
deposit color so sometimes the Chipko

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:43.140 
deposit color so sometimes the Chipko
doesn't<00:03:41.739> close<00:03:41.949> all<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.340> way<00:03:42.459> so<00:03:42.519> the<00:03:42.790> hanka

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
doesn't close all the way so the hanka

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.869 
doesn't close all the way so the hanka
turn<00:03:43.449> rough<00:03:44.379> but<00:03:44.739> this<00:03:44.919> can<00:03:45.159> still<00:03:45.459> remain

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
turn rough but this can still remain

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.899 
turn rough but this can still remain
very<00:03:46.299> soft<00:03:46.810> even<00:03:47.049> to<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.409> process<00:03:47.889> so<00:03:48.519> I'm

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:48.909
