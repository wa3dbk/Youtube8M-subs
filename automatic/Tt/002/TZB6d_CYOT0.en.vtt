00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.870 
hey everyone filson ebbets here with
another<00:00:16.139> tweak<00:00:16.530> from<00:00:16.860> cydia<00:00:17.280> this<00:00:17.550> one<00:00:17.760> is

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
another tweak from cydia this one is

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.990 
another tweak from cydia this one is
called<00:00:18.090> clock<00:00:18.540> hide<00:00:18.930> hyphen<00:00:19.680> PK<00:00:20.340> but<00:00:20.730> we'll

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
called clock hide hyphen PK but we'll

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.330 
called clock hide hyphen PK but we'll
just<00:00:21.030> call<00:00:21.510> it<00:00:21.660> cockeyed<00:00:22.230> now<00:00:22.860> you're<00:00:23.070> going

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
just call it cockeyed now you're going

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.580 
just call it cockeyed now you're going
to<00:00:23.460> need<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.700> special<00:00:24.360> repo<00:00:24.779> because<00:00:24.990> this<00:00:25.410> is

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
to need a special repo because this is

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.040 
to need a special repo because this is
still<00:00:25.920> in<00:00:26.160> beta<00:00:26.189> but<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.270> seems<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.750> be<00:00:27.779> working

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
still in beta but it seems to be working

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.380 
still in beta but it seems to be working
just<00:00:28.290> fine<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:29.160> it's<00:00:29.340> also<00:00:29.520> a<00:00:29.700> pretty<00:00:30.090> cool

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
just fine and it's also a pretty cool

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.990 
just fine and it's also a pretty cool
feature<00:00:30.689> so<00:00:31.590> clock<00:00:31.919> I'd<00:00:32.160> basically<00:00:32.430> allows

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
feature so clock I'd basically allows

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.790 
feature so clock I'd basically allows
you<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.390> hide<00:00:33.660> your<00:00:33.840> clock<00:00:34.140> on<00:00:34.380> your<00:00:34.620> lock

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
you to hide your clock on your lock

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.069 
you to hide your clock on your lock
screen<00:00:34.829> just<00:00:35.700> like<00:00:35.820> lockscreen<00:00:36.540> clock<00:00:36.810> hide

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
screen just like lockscreen clock hide

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.890 
screen just like lockscreen clock hide
except<00:00:38.010> there's<00:00:38.400> something<00:00:38.850> else<00:00:39.030> if<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.720> go

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
except there's something else if you go

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.720 
except there's something else if you go
within<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.440> settings<00:00:40.710> right<00:00:41.100> here<00:00:41.130> you<00:00:41.520> can

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
within the settings right here you can

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.700 
within the settings right here you can
go<00:00:41.880> ahead<00:00:41.970> and<00:00:42.090> change<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.690> alpha<00:00:43.170> which<00:00:43.680> is

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
go ahead and change the alpha which is

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.740 
go ahead and change the alpha which is
basically<00:00:44.280> one<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.760> them<00:00:45.030> is<00:00:45.270> your<00:00:45.450> opacity

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
basically one of them is your opacity

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.810 
basically one of them is your opacity
and<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.350> other<00:00:46.500> one<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.740> the<00:00:46.920> position<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.670> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
and the other one is the position of the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.290 
and the other one is the position of the
clock<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.630> y<00:00:49.140> axis<00:00:49.620> position<00:00:49.830> to<00:00:50.340> be<00:00:50.520> specific

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
clock the y axis position to be specific

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.820 
clock the y axis position to be specific
so<00:00:51.780> let's<00:00:51.930> go<00:00:52.050> ahead<00:00:52.080> and<00:00:52.260> put<00:00:52.470> this<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.800> the

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:52.830 
so let's go ahead and put this to the

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.410 
so let's go ahead and put this to the
middle<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.340> we'll<00:00:53.700> go<00:00:53.850> ahead<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.180> go<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.330> our

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
middle and we'll go ahead and go to our

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.660 
middle and we'll go ahead and go to our
lock<00:00:54.690> screen<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.230> as<00:00:55.620> we<00:00:55.800> can<00:00:55.950> see<00:00:56.160> our<00:00:56.400> lock

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
lock screen and as we can see our lock

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.760 
lock screen and as we can see our lock
screen<00:00:57.030> clock<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.110> center<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
screen clock is in the center of the

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.380 
screen clock is in the center of the
lock<00:00:58.980> screen<00:00:59.160> instead<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.880> being<00:01:00.090> at<00:01:00.240> the<00:01:00.360> top

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
lock screen instead of being at the top

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.549 
lock screen instead of being at the top
as<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:01.170> normally<00:01:01.380> should<00:01:01.640> so<00:01:02.640> oh<00:01:03.210> no<00:01:03.840> I'm<00:01:04.080> seem

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
as it normally should so oh no I'm seem

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.530 
as it normally should so oh no I'm seem
to<00:01:04.710> be<00:01:04.830> having<00:01:04.979> iOS<00:01:05.489> problems<00:01:06.030> right<00:01:06.270> there

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
to be having iOS problems right there

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.109 
to be having iOS problems right there
anyways<00:01:07.350> let's<00:01:07.380> go<00:01:07.740> back<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.310> video<00:01:08.640> will

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
anyways let's go back to the video will

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.780 
anyways let's go back to the video will
turn<00:01:09.780> down<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.259> and<00:01:10.590> if<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.189> want<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.610> put

this<00:01:11.970> up<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.329> little<00:01:12.570> bit<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:13.229> will<00:01:13.470> basically

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
this up a little bit this will basically

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.340 
this up a little bit this will basically
tone<00:01:14.340> down<00:01:14.579> the<00:01:14.820> opacity<00:01:14.939> on<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.780> clock<00:01:16.049> now

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
tone down the opacity on the clock now

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.990 
tone down the opacity on the clock now
you<00:01:16.740> can't<00:01:16.950> really<00:01:17.070> see<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.340> too<00:01:17.580> well<00:01:17.610> until

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
you can't really see it too well until

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.140 
you can't really see it too well until
you<00:01:18.510> put<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.870> almost<00:01:19.290> two<00:01:19.620> full<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.220> now<00:01:21.090> we

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
you put it almost two full and now we

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.480 
you put it almost two full and now we
can<00:01:21.360> see<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.720> barely<00:01:21.990> faded<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:22.920> there<00:01:23.159> let's

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
can see it barely faded in there let's

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.330 
can see it barely faded in there let's
kind<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.090> bring<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.390> back<00:01:24.540> over<00:01:24.840> here<00:01:25.050> and

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
kind of bring it back over here and

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.890 
kind of bring it back over here and
there<00:01:26.340> we<00:01:26.460> go<00:01:26.610> we<00:01:26.880> kind<00:01:27.120> of<00:01:27.210> toned<00:01:27.510> down<00:01:27.690> the

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
there we go we kind of toned down the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.620 
there we go we kind of toned down the
opacity<00:01:27.990> we<00:01:28.650> can<00:01:28.800> also<00:01:28.979> do<00:01:29.370> both<00:01:29.760> we<00:01:30.240> can<00:01:30.450> put

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
opacity we can also do both we can put

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.570 
opacity we can also do both we can put
this<00:01:30.780> all<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.140> way<00:01:31.170> at<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.409> bottom<00:01:31.680> near<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
this all the way at the bottom near the

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.550 
this all the way at the bottom near the
slider<00:01:32.880> looks<00:01:33.510> kind<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.870> cool<00:01:34.080> if<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.409> have<00:01:34.530> a

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
slider looks kind of cool if you have a

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.890 
slider looks kind of cool if you have a
really<00:01:35.010> good<00:01:35.250> wallpaper<00:01:35.790> for<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.450> back<00:01:36.690> you

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
really good wallpaper for the back you

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.510 
really good wallpaper for the back you
can<00:01:36.930> put<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.620> middle<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.100> use

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
can put it in the middle and use

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.940 
can put it in the middle and use
lockscreen<00:01:39.180> clock<00:01:39.510> hide<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:40.020> hide<00:01:40.260> that<00:01:40.530> top

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
lockscreen clock hide to hide that top

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.640 
lockscreen clock hide to hide that top
bar<00:01:41.250> I'm<00:01:41.610> not<00:01:41.970> really<00:01:42.120> sure<00:01:42.210> why<00:01:42.659> this<00:01:42.720> tweak

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
bar I'm not really sure why this tweak

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.590 
bar I'm not really sure why this tweak
doesn't<00:01:44.159> allow<00:01:44.370> you<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.640> hide<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.030> top<00:01:45.330> bar

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
doesn't allow you to hide that top bar

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.050 
doesn't allow you to hide that top bar
and<00:01:45.810> just<00:01:45.990> hides<00:01:46.260> the<00:01:46.500> clock<00:01:46.770> but<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.670> guess

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
and just hides the clock but I guess

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.730 
and just hides the clock but I guess
you'll<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:48.479> have<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:49.049> put<00:01:49.229> two<00:01:49.440> tweaks

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
you'll just have to put two tweaks

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.890 
you'll just have to put two tweaks
together<00:01:50.130> download<00:01:50.880> lockscreen<00:01:51.420> clock<00:01:51.659> I'd

together download lockscreen clock I'd
