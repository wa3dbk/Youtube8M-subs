than any other part of our body so it's

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.790 
than any other part of our body so it's
important<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.610> use<00:00:38.820> products<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:40.379> will<00:00:40.770> help

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800

to minimize your risks of skin damage
and<00:00:44.160> sun<00:00:44.550> damage<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:45.660> we<00:00:45.750> have<00:00:45.840> two<00:00:46.079> products

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
and sun damage so we have two products

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.990 
and sun damage so we have two products
three<00:00:46.710> products<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.250> we<00:00:47.370> use<00:00:47.579> we<00:00:47.820> use<00:00:47.969> a

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
three products that we use we use a

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.510 
three products that we use we use a
derma<00:00:48.360> lack<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.960> which<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.680> an<00:00:49.920> alpha<00:00:50.219> hydroxy

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
derma lack of which is an alpha hydroxy

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.369 
derma lack of which is an alpha hydroxy
product<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.239> helps<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.629> soften<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.199> outer

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
product that helps to soften the outer

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.799 
product that helps to soften the outer
layer<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.149> at<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.239> same<00:00:54.420> time<00:00:54.660> it

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
layer and at the same time it

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.479 
layer and at the same time it
facilitates<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.710> penetration<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.460> the

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
facilitates the penetration of the

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.420 
facilitates the penetration of the
vitamin<00:00:56.940> A<00:00:57.530> so<00:00:58.530> we<00:00:58.649> have<00:00:58.770> two<00:00:58.949> different<00:00:59.100> body

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
vitamin A so we have two different body

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.970 
vitamin A so we have two different body
products<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.420> can<00:01:00.809> be<00:01:01.050> used<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.559> treat<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
products that can be used to treat the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.310 
products that can be used to treat the
skin<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.910> vitamin<00:01:03.270> form<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.899> Bridget

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
skin in the vitamin form and Bridget

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.929 
skin in the vitamin form and Bridget
would<00:01:04.470> diagnose<00:01:04.920> your<00:01:05.100> skin<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.610> lets<00:01:05.790> you

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
would diagnose your skin and lets you

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.330 
would diagnose your skin and lets you
know<00:01:06.090> which<00:01:06.330> ones<00:01:06.600> were<00:01:06.990> applicable<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.250> your

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
know which ones were applicable to your

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.179 
know which ones were applicable to your
situation

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
situation

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:13.460 
situation
so<00:01:11.189> my<00:01:11.310> recommendation<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:12.330> course<00:01:12.630> would<00:01:13.439> be

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
so my recommendation of course would be

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.210 
so my recommendation of course would be
to<00:01:13.830> use<00:01:14.100> those<00:01:14.580> products<00:01:15.270> like<00:01:15.600> every<00:01:16.530> day<00:01:16.890> and

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
to use those products like every day and

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.460 
to use those products like every day and
every<00:01:17.520> night<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:18.119> moreover<00:01:18.780> after<00:01:18.960> shower

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
every night and moreover after shower

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.010 
every night and moreover after shower
because<00:01:20.430> we<00:01:20.580> all<00:01:20.700> know<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.479> water<00:01:21.780> there

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
because we all know that in water there

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.690 
because we all know that in water there
is<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> lot<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.409> chlorine<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:23.280> don't<00:01:23.460> want

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
is a lot of chlorine and we don't want

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.700 
is a lot of chlorine and we don't want
you<00:01:23.970> know<00:01:24.119> chlorine<00:01:24.659> just<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.140> ruin<00:01:25.320> your<00:01:25.560> skin

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
you know chlorine just to ruin your skin

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.200 
you know chlorine just to ruin your skin
so<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.549> would<00:01:26.850> use<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.509> course<00:01:28.100> body<00:01:29.100> cream<00:01:29.610> with

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210
