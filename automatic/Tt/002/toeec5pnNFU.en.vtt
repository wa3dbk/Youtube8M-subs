support I think that that would clean up
the<00:03:19.220> plan<00:03:19.430> to<00:03:19.580> pivot<00:03:19.760> tremendously<00:03:20.330> Oscar<00:03:20.960> how

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.150 
would help moving the court further out
underneath<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.840> basket<00:03:29.990> but<00:03:30.680> I<00:03:30.710> make<00:03:30.950> it<00:03:31.070> let

surprised<00:04:47.090> them<00:04:47.270> there<00:04:47.450> was<00:04:47.570> an<00:04:47.690> opening

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
surprised them there was an opening

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.129 
surprised them there was an opening
burst<00:04:48.320> in<00:04:48.590> this<00:04:48.740> game<00:04:49.040> by<00:04:49.820> your<00:04:50.150> team<00:04:50.480> and<00:04:50.810> then

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
burst in this game by your team and then

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:52.510 
burst in this game by your team and then
the<00:04:51.230> Celtics<00:04:51.620> held<00:04:51.800> it<00:04:51.919> often<00:04:52.220> came<00:04:52.490> back

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
the Celtics held it often came back

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.430 
the Celtics held it often came back
what's<00:04:53.240> your<00:04:53.389> perspective<00:04:53.630> Jerry<00:04:54.169> and<00:04:54.320> what

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
what's your perspective Jerry and what

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.290 
what's your perspective Jerry and what
happened<00:04:54.830> well<00:04:55.310> Brent<00:04:55.520> I<00:04:55.610> really<00:04:55.850> thought<00:04:56.090> the

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
happened well Brent I really thought the

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.150 
happened well Brent I really thought the
way<00:04:56.419> Boston<00:04:56.870> play<00:04:57.020> we're<00:04:57.200> maybe<00:04:57.590> lucky<00:04:57.860> to<00:04:58.070> be

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
way Boston play we're maybe lucky to be

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.980 
way Boston play we're maybe lucky to be
as<00:04:58.280> close<00:04:58.460> as<00:04:58.669> we<00:04:58.820> are<00:04:59.000> but<00:04:59.300> frankly<00:04:59.750> I<00:04:59.780> like

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
as close as we are but frankly I like

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.240 
as close as we are but frankly I like
our<00:05:00.169> position<00:05:00.620> I<00:05:00.710> think<00:05:00.889> we're<00:05:01.010> gonna<00:05:01.100> win

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
our position I think we're gonna win

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.860 
our position I think we're gonna win
this<00:05:01.400> game<00:05:01.550> the<00:05:01.700> second<00:05:02.000> half<00:05:02.120> why<00:05:02.510> would<00:05:02.750> you

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:02.870 
this game the second half why would you

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.180 
this game the second half why would you
say<00:05:03.110> that<00:05:03.139> other<00:05:03.560> than<00:05:03.770> just<00:05:03.950> being

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
say that other than just being

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.770 
say that other than just being
optimistic<00:05:04.340> about<00:05:04.940> your<00:05:05.090> franchise<00:05:05.540> what<00:05:05.720> do

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
optimistic about your franchise what do

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.600 
optimistic about your franchise what do
you<00:05:05.870> see<00:05:06.139> that<00:05:06.590> encourages<00:05:07.130> you<00:05:07.250> well<00:05:07.430> you

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
you see that encourages you well you

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.090 
you see that encourages you well you
know<00:05:07.639> I<00:05:07.700> see<00:05:08.450> us<00:05:08.600> have<00:05:08.780> a<00:05:08.810> lot<00:05:09.110> of<00:05:09.260> energy<00:05:09.650> and

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
know I see us have a lot of energy and

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.159 
know I see us have a lot of energy and
defensively<00:05:10.760> I<00:05:10.940> think<00:05:11.660> we<00:05:11.780> can<00:05:11.870> do<00:05:11.960> a<00:05:11.990> little

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
defensively I think we can do a little

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.440 
defensively I think we can do a little
bit<00:05:12.320> better<00:05:12.470> job<00:05:12.860> we<00:05:13.010> have<00:05:13.130> a<00:05:13.160> Boston<00:05:13.460> it<00:05:13.760> shot

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
bit better job we have a Boston it shot

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.030 
bit better job we have a Boston it shot
the<00:05:14.630> ball<00:05:14.750> tremendously<00:05:15.350> well<00:05:15.650> but<00:05:15.860> I<00:05:15.979> think

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
the ball tremendously well but I think

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.740 
the ball tremendously well but I think
they've<00:05:16.430> searched<00:05:16.700> out<00:05:16.910> the<00:05:16.940> loose<00:05:17.240> man<00:05:17.479> maybe

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
they've searched out the loose man maybe

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.330 
they've searched out the loose man maybe
better<00:05:17.960> than<00:05:18.080> we<00:05:18.229> have<00:05:18.440> maybe<00:05:19.010> we<00:05:19.190> were<00:05:19.310> a

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
better than we have maybe we were a

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.620 
better than we have maybe we were a
little<00:05:19.460> bit<00:05:19.669> too<00:05:19.820> high<00:05:19.970> for<00:05:20.150> this<00:05:20.240> game<00:05:20.419> but<00:05:20.540> I

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
little bit too high for this game but I

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.670 
little bit too high for this game but I
think<00:05:20.780> we're<00:05:20.870> gonna<00:05:21.020> play<00:05:21.110> a<00:05:21.139> great<00:05:21.350> second

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
think we're gonna play a great second

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.950 
think we're gonna play a great second
half<00:05:21.710> Oscar<00:05:22.550> what<00:05:23.180> do<00:05:23.240> you<00:05:23.330> think<00:05:23.570> about<00:05:23.810> this

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
half Oscar what do you think about this

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.480 
half Oscar what do you think about this
game<00:05:24.169> well<00:05:24.590> I<00:05:24.620> think<00:05:24.740> Paris<00:05:25.190> is<00:05:25.280> playing

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
game well I think Paris is playing

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.219 
game well I think Paris is playing
exceptionally<00:05:26.180> with<00:05:26.389> very<00:05:26.600> fine<00:05:26.750> basketball

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
exceptionally with very fine basketball

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:28.750 
exceptionally with very fine basketball
game<00:05:27.380> not<00:05:27.560> only<00:05:27.800> clean<00:05:27.979> when<00:05:28.250> it<00:05:28.460> when<00:05:28.669> the

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
game not only clean when it when the

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.159 
game not only clean when it when the
half-court<00:05:29.330> game<00:05:29.419> but<00:05:29.690> it's<00:05:29.810> getting<00:05:29.990> out<00:05:30.080> of

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169 
half-court game but it's getting out of

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:31.719 
half-court game but it's getting out of
court<00:05:30.320> on<00:05:30.350> a<00:05:30.440> break<00:05:30.620> and<00:05:30.919> Larry<00:05:31.220> Breton<00:05:31.550> goes

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:31.729 
court on a break and Larry Breton goes

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:33.879 
court on a break and Larry Breton goes
in<00:05:32.060> though<00:05:32.210> he's<00:05:32.330> not<00:05:32.479> scoring<00:05:32.840> is<00:05:33.470> making<00:05:33.830> the

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
in though he's not scoring is making the

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.129 
in though he's not scoring is making the
right<00:05:34.010> passes<00:05:34.520> you<00:05:34.910> know<00:05:35.000> Oscar<00:05:35.180> I<00:05:35.419> have<00:05:35.780> said

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:36.139 
right passes you know Oscar I have said

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:38.379 
right passes you know Oscar I have said
that<00:05:36.650> Eastern<00:05:37.070> Conference<00:05:37.639> basketball<00:05:37.820> is

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:38.389 
that Eastern Conference basketball is

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:41.230 
that Eastern Conference basketball is
tougher<00:05:38.810> more<00:05:39.410> physical<00:05:40.130> and<00:05:40.280> once<00:05:40.880> they<00:05:41.060> got

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
tougher more physical and once they got

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.909 
tougher more physical and once they got
into<00:05:41.419> a<00:05:41.510> bump<00:05:41.780> and<00:05:41.960> grind<00:05:42.050> war<00:05:42.530> that<00:05:42.830> the

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:42.919 
into a bump and grind war that the

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:44.350 
into a bump and grind war that the
Lakers<00:05:43.250> haven't<00:05:43.610> been<00:05:43.729> all<00:05:43.880> year<00:05:44.090> it<00:05:44.240> was

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
Lakers haven't been all year it was

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.180 
Lakers haven't been all year it was
going<00:05:44.510> to<00:05:44.570> be<00:05:44.690> tough<00:05:44.960> how<00:05:45.440> do<00:05:45.500> you<00:05:45.650> see<00:05:45.860> that<00:05:46.010> is

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
going to be tough how do you see that is

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.529 
going to be tough how do you see that is
there<00:05:46.340> a<00:05:46.400> difference<00:05:46.789> between<00:05:46.850> East<00:05:47.300> and<00:05:47.450> West

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:47.539 
there a difference between East and West

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:49.029 
there a difference between East and West
Coast<00:05:47.870> basketball<00:05:48.320> there<00:05:48.590> may<00:05:48.710> be<00:05:48.770> but<00:05:49.010> I

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:49.039 
Coast basketball there may be but I

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:50.050 
Coast basketball there may be but I
think<00:05:49.130> is<00:05:49.370> a<00:05:49.430> different<00:05:49.700> type<00:05:49.820> of<00:05:49.850> the

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
think is a different type of the

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.060 
think is a different type of the
basketball<00:05:50.539> just<00:05:50.780> say<00:05:50.960> you<00:05:51.020> know
