just a tutorial dungeon she's going to

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.970 
just a tutorial dungeon she's going to
do<00:00:27.790> a<00:00:27.820> little<00:00:28.060> light<00:00:28.390> through<00:00:28.660> its<00:00:29.260> on<00:00:29.380> max

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
do a little light through its on max

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.830 
do a little light through its on max
resolution<00:00:30.220> the<00:00:30.730> high<00:00:30.849> res<00:00:31.119> and<00:00:31.480> declare

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
resolution the high res and declare

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.700 
resolution the high res and declare
which<00:00:32.020> is<00:00:32.169> at<00:00:32.320> 1680<00:00:33.220> x<00:00:33.489> 1050<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:35.290> turn<00:00:35.559> the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
which is at 1680 x 1050 and turn the

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.470 
which is at 1680 x 1050 and turn the
other<00:00:35.860> the<00:00:36.309> like<00:00:36.850> there's<00:00:37.120> only<00:00:37.210> like<00:00:37.360> two

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
other the like there's only like two

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.320 
other the like there's only like two
settings<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:39.040> can<00:00:39.070> you<00:00:39.460> can<00:00:39.610> turn<00:00:39.790> up<00:00:40.000> all<00:00:40.239> the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:40.330 
settings you can you can turn up all the

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.600 
settings you can you can turn up all the
way<00:00:43.650> so<00:00:44.650> this<00:00:44.800> is<00:00:44.830> like<00:00:45.040> my<00:00:45.220> second<00:00:45.550> time

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
way so this is like my second time

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.030 
way so this is like my second time
playing<00:00:45.940> this<00:00:46.059> so<00:00:46.620> it's<00:00:47.620> actually<00:00:47.739> really

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
playing this so it's actually really

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.149 
playing this so it's actually really
cool<00:00:48.280> the<00:00:49.379> spells<00:00:50.379> and<00:00:50.589> stuff<00:00:50.680> how<00:00:50.890> they<00:00:51.040> do

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.159 
cool the spells and stuff how they do

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:54.899 
cool the spells and stuff how they do
that<00:00:51.309> like<00:00:51.790> you<00:00:52.629> can<00:00:52.839> combine<00:00:53.019> things<00:00:53.909> make

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:54.909 
that like you can combine things make

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.039 
that like you can combine things make
fireballs<00:00:55.420> cetera<00:00:56.460> using<00:00:57.460> like<00:00:58.049> different

00:00:59.039 --> 00:00:59.049 
fireballs cetera using like different

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:03.030 
fireballs cetera using like different
elements<00:00:59.519> and<00:01:00.519> then<00:01:01.260> attack<00:01:02.260> hear<00:01:02.620> yourself

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
elements and then attack hear yourself

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.490 
elements and then attack hear yourself
do<00:01:03.670> things<00:01:03.909> like<00:01:04.059> that

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:24.010 

so<00:01:10.250> let's<00:01:10.610> see<00:01:10.820> earth

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:33.590 

by<00:01:24.590> your

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.620 

and<00:01:34.200> surprisingly<00:01:34.619> this<00:01:35.040> game<00:01:35.280> requires

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
and surprisingly this game requires

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.289 
and surprisingly this game requires
minimum<00:01:36.630> requirements<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.259> an<00:01:37.350> 8800<00:01:38.299> nvidia

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
minimum requirements of an 8800 nvidia

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.230 
minimum requirements of an 8800 nvidia
which<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.950> its<00:01:40.950> normal<00:01:41.280> car<00:01:41.460> by<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> really<00:01:42.060> good

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
which is its normal car by a really good

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.620 
which is its normal car by a really good
card<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:43.640> that's<00:01:44.640> actually<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.180> minimum

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
card and that's actually the minimum

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.539 
card and that's actually the minimum
requirements<00:01:46.200> i<00:01:46.290> think<00:01:46.500> for<00:01:46.710> crysis<00:01:47.130> 2<00:01:47.340> in

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
requirements i think for crysis 2 in

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.700 
requirements i think for crysis 2 in
terms<00:01:47.759> of<00:01:47.940> GPU<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.570> cpu<00:01:48.960> doesn't<00:01:49.259> require<00:01:49.439> as

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
terms of GPU to cpu doesn't require as

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.999 
terms of GPU to cpu doesn't require as
much<00:01:50.180> but<00:01:51.180> yeah<00:01:51.479> that's<00:01:52.229> why<00:01:52.440> i<00:01:52.500> wanted<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.860> do

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
much but yeah that's why i wanted to do

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.660 
much but yeah that's why i wanted to do
a<00:01:53.039> little<00:01:53.250> gameplay<00:01:53.490> be<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.940> this<00:01:55.220> to<00:01:56.220> show<00:01:56.430> how

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
a little gameplay be of this to show how

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.789 
a little gameplay be of this to show how
it<00:01:56.850> runs<00:01:57.030> on<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.830> new<00:01:58.830> macbooks<00:02:00.140> and<00:02:01.140> see<00:02:01.530> even

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
it runs on the new macbooks and see even

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.609 
it runs on the new macbooks and see even
it's<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.580> 40<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.780> know<00:02:03.899> game<00:02:04.200> like<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:04.560> you

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
it's a 40 you know game like this you

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.290 
it's a 40 you know game like this you
would<00:02:04.890> think<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.369> just<00:02:05.520> look<00:02:05.729> at<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.000> oh<00:02:06.119> I

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
would think you just look at it oh I

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.449 
would think you just look at it oh I
don't<00:02:06.420> run<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.780> like<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.200> know<00:02:07.319> 60<00:02:08.160> frames<00:02:08.340> per

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
don't run it like you know 60 frames per

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.860 
don't run it like you know 60 frames per
second<00:02:08.970> but<00:02:09.259> actually<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.760> has<00:02:11.760> some<00:02:12.120> decent

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
second but actually it has some decent

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.920 
second but actually it has some decent
requirements<00:02:15.319> there<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.350> use<00:02:16.560> lightning<00:02:17.930> to

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
requirements there I use lightning to

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.110 
requirements there I use lightning to
turn<00:02:19.650> on<00:02:19.800> the<00:02:19.950> electric<00:02:20.130> generator<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:20.850> how<00:02:21.090> to

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
turn on the electric generator I how to

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.210 
turn on the electric generator I how to
make<00:02:21.360> made<00:02:21.660> an<00:02:21.780> earth<00:02:21.989> and<00:02:22.260> fire<00:02:22.319> on<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:23.069> one

it's there's like a self cap at 40 or
something<00:03:19.550> but<00:03:20.110> yeah<00:03:21.110> frames<00:03:21.440> terms<00:03:22.070> are<00:03:22.220> good

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
something but yeah frames terms are good

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:34.120 
something but yeah frames terms are good
I<00:03:22.520> don't<00:03:22.760> 140<00:03:24.190> but<00:03:25.190> see<00:03:26.110> freezing
