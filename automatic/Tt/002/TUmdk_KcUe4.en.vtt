00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 Today I explain to you as yours 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.850
 makes server more attractive by the 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.210
 Incorporate a logo in the multiplayer 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.210
 list 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.450
 so welcome my friends minecraft 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.820
 Tobacco is on this day therefore this time 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.010
 it goes einbinde about how I low the 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.810
 create user and so on and so on 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.060
 It's very simple 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.850
 he himself replaces that here 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.530
 size of 64 x 64 close the whole 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.120
 but now'll go straight to my 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.010
 starting the photoshop project as me 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.540
 had already started before and you 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.360
 See for yourself how I just have 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.470
 this logo is built in 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.930
 and to create that you need 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.820
 just a graphics program of your choice 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.230
 in the publisher I used photoshop because 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.129
 I've just installed that 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.479
 but it works with everyone else 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.949
 program if this because the whole in 

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:54.519
 png can thus save in the 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.809
 format tmg that because there that this 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.909
 Here you will background here sees the 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.110
 very invisible in that case, so to speak 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:03.199
 that he later also in the picture 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.760
 invisible is so around this logo now 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.850
 easy to create then we do that 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.970
 Integrate everything here that means you are 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.290
 times expensive logo or draws or he 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.750
 just makes a text box like me 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.250
 have done that and it colors 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.140
 Of course , you do all of that in that 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.880
 format 64 x 64 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.110
 the resolution is only the matter 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.729
 background content you can too 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.920
 leave transparent so if your logo 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.500
 want to have red in the background 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.450
 then it's just different but in that 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.890
 fall to 64 times many annoying 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.829
 I have resolutions by default 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.869
 left and the background transparency 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.670
 I should store the whole thing 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.619
 have got to me here is the logo 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.020
 built in the whole we save now 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.939
 sakes that it is important must 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.130
 Namely, have a specific name 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:49.710
 server - 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.200
 Michael takes care of that, of course 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.299
 now have the format png 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.119
 That's what we have stored here 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.350
 whole on the desktop off okay and then 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.600
 I have already you see here 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.820
 The background is invisible and only 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.990
 the writing is visible and the whole 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.149
 I'm doing now in my budget 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.610
 server pure so that works in the 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.250
 version 1.7 point 2 plus in all higher 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.319
 version 1.8 1.9 anyway, too 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.540
 the logo will go on 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.920
 just in here ensures that I have 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.040
 have already been here in the sentences is 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.560
 and it's enough if it's easy in here 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.120
 this folder is so I want it 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.370
 just say you have to go here now 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.319
 not somehow that somehow 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.910
 Setting server properties is enough 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.920
 just the reinziehen and 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.709
 name the server hyphen icon in 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.000
 the size 64 likes her 60 if now in 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.970
 server starts that lasts with me 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.410
 10 seconds in total and then in the 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.630
 multiplayer works that works 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.519
 every case impeccable so i am now 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.290
 in multiplayer and g in and you see 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.180
 it works here is the logo what 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.370
 we have just set here 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.079
 are a few more big servers 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.120
 who use the us also makes it stings 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.799
 a lot more than if you're like this 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.170
 the standard font is in the server 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.609
 list so that's great people me 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.900
 You can also have any events 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.049
 Announcement in which you have a specific 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.400
 logo makes what knows I'm creative 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.780
 I want to thank you for watching 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.760
