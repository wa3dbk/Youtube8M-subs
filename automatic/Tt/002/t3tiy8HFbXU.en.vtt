of like a hands across the border for
our<00:02:37.470> views<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.160> now<00:02:39.060> there's<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.330> small

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
our views and now there's a small

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.780 
our views and now there's a small
parking<00:02:40.440> fee<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:40.709> know<00:02:40.950> Washington<00:02:41.520> state

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
parking fee I know Washington state

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.229 
parking fee I know Washington state
parks<00:02:42.180> levees<00:02:42.989> and<00:02:43.220> I<00:02:44.220> think<00:02:44.640> now<00:02:44.849> there's<00:02:45.150> a

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
parks levees and I think now there's a

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.210 
parks levees and I think now there's a
levy<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:46.050> small<00:02:46.290> fee<00:02:46.530> for<00:02:46.709> parking<00:02:47.069> on<00:02:47.130> the

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
levy of a small fee for parking on the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.009 
levy of a small fee for parking on the

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
Canadian side because the parking area

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.050 
Canadian side because the parking area
isn't<00:02:49.349> actually<00:02:49.680> part<00:02:50.010> of<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.099> park<00:02:50.400> it's<00:02:50.610> one
