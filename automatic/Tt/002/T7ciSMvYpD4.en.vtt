00:00:02.279 --> 00:00:07.209
 the return in many bacteria ago 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.460
 it is a cyclic dna 

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:12.580
 molecule next to the genome 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.930
 additional genetic information is provided for the 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.660
 normal function of the bacterial cell 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.550
 you will not be needed size 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.789
 equivalent to one to two percent of 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.249
 Bacteria DNA we leave that in important 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.169
 tools genetic engineering you can as 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:28.349
 clown will be used in their sectors 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:31.529
 to reproduce certain genes 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.820
 vectors are manipulated plasmids 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.699
 into the plasmid becomes the respective one 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.739
 to renounce which previously with one 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:40.350
 Reduction enzyme from a donor DNA 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.210
 cut out was installed 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.280
 So when it comes to a recombination 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.079
 the dena 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.300
 the combined dna is going through 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.940
 transformation into the bacteria 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.719
 which then merges with the 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.820
 obtained division with increased plasmids 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.829
 Often the bacteria have an advantage 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.410
 can provide such as a 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.180
 Resistance to antibiotics examples 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.390
 are penicillin set to light or 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.189
 tetracycline only bacteria the one 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.829
 plasmid with a like in this example 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:14.189
 ampicillin resistance may have on 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:16.720
 breeding grounds grow with ambition 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.340
 So only bacteria can survive 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.689
 who own this resistance gene 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.299
 likewise the plasmid contains at least 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:27.579
 a dna sequence as the starting point of the 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:31.780
 dna the publication serves one calls her 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:33.729
 also agent of publication or short and 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.770
 since it has this replication origin 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.340
 the plasmid can be independent of the 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.439
 Thus, chromosomal DNA can be replicated 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.079
 they double independently of each other 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.250
 taken bacteria and is used in the 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:47.130
 division to the daughter cells 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.229
 passed 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.909
 at clooney's experiments carry space 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.420
 again usually an artificially inserted 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.030
 region 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.090
 They will go left or multiple 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.530
 called gloning time 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.960
 These receive a series of so-called 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.350
 editor interfaces for reduction 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.319
 enzymes that means the plasmid of 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.090
 editorial enzymen left in pohle 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.830
 have a recognition sequence 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.349
 exclusively at this point 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.750
 to be cut when placing 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.620
 the foreigners are exactly at this point 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.620
 dna inserted
