00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.360
 Frankfurt 2010 in our hall Vienna 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.489
 Stans percent of the makers 

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:17.539
 Geldmenge sets Wolfgang then there is a decidedly serious throws 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.289
 Product Manager Dreamless in Europe and Wolfgang Well, first of all the 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.710
 percent more tired eyes 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.710
 that was probably yesterday or cross country over 

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:32.179
 the goal of GCX 9 50 days before the order 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.260
 nice thing expect what you can count on that is the new 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.600
 the new thing about this 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.590
 Percent of nine titles is percent this one per 1 you think it works 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.430
 So silicone petz really has something completely new so can 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.560
 competitor 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.810
 In the past, the DIW was by train completely out of the celebrity couple 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.980
 when fabric jokes material called more 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.290
 the market treasures i now believe vans now for three or four years 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.090
 this place we worked for a long time developed 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.110
 and we came to the conclusion that 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.450
 in Nice silicone drives on a very specific regions the many small ones 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.700
 Air bubbles contain an absolutely realistic feeling 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.280
 Merck burst 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.950
 it is not in the trampoline as well as it does not work at the same time 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.550
 that is very very extreme again short term on the set it is very quiet me 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.549
 Now really strong Arai Neustrelitz Dirk Bauermann again 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.250
 So you may also with a rental apartments with parquet floor you may 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.270
 no neighbors you can not the grandma 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.070
 it is 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.030
 will be off as long as GM 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.290
 for the first time in my opinion also Mehdorn's something man of Steel for 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.030
 Music schools can be recommended around other places that is often the case 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.050
 that at some point that goes completely on the wrists 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.330
 in these tests 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.110
 With good conscience you can finally also music schools 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.700
 bright with it 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.719
 Peter put silicone is compacted years ago the elementary schools already like that 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:56.620
 much to tell 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.680
 at 12 o'clock not worked out ALOS bus tram here thus no plastic but 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.720
 already really massive Mittal 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.470
 three zones Petsos as a spectator here on it whether a song with them unfortunately 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.080
 not affiliated that makes percent but hear that two men 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.100
 Solomon our demonstrate on that the core 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.730
 by three different genres propeller machine with the participation in the 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.539
 Registry Office second evening hours it is sunny 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:23.420
 at the pool as well as me otherwise at the edge otherwise the group 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.230
 you can stop the two and St so exactly like an acoustic 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.159
 Trams actually have 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.410
 really is going on 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.359
 Yes, okay 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:34.469
 This is actually from the acoustic percent is thus not with 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:36.699
 Of course, it's different 

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:39.600
 I think it looks pretty good from Lingen and this one 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.120
 Executions 60 me massively wonderful what is this because the control unit data 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.849
 is there anything new to say about that? 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.189
 This is a real picture that her poems are bad that I am now 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:54.849
 The tips to 59 are differences to the predecessor's date in life 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:59.040
 Percent from the trade otherwise he would have gotten that is 

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:03.249
 a different sound create a drum 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:07.290
 AUD maybe soft on it in the next emptying Holthaus stronger 

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.919
 it 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:10.889
 if he is strong again December everything and Pakistan 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:15.459
 on top of each other and here in this module best packed more noise than before 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.619
 The case was it is more Staudt available as a download that are worth it 

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:24.219
 All in all, therefore, a successful people fundamentally overhauled 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:25.649
 say 

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:29.859
 Brunner was class and the beast in the market so that the customer can 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.060
 now to go along 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.499
 and here it gets there 

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:35.969
 but I hope that it finds Sarah good but who is the possibility 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:39.419
 because the inclined customer at least in the NLA to bring that order from us 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:40.040
 more 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.779
 good idea all right 

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:43.039
 Rolf decided the ECJ 

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:47.009
 Per cent brand product of which Johns here at the fair has us a bit something 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:51.419
 to the 950 Corporate Sales for the new DTX he thanked the mediators SAP Wolfgang 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:53.239
 Tylsch are still fun 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:53.659
 and whether
