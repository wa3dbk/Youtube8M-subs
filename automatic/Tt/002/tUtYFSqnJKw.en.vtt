souls such a an odd game in this

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.330 
souls such a an odd game in this
industry<00:01:10.380> where<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.799> just<00:01:10.950> sort<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.159> came<00:01:11.220> out

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
industry where it just sort of came out

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.030 
industry where it just sort of came out
of<00:01:11.490> nowhere<00:01:11.580> for<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.030> lot<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.270> people<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.750> none

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
of nowhere for a lot of people and none

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.010 
of nowhere for a lot of people and none
still<00:01:14.040> trying<00:01:14.220> some<00:01:14.400> new<00:01:14.430> ideas<00:01:14.640> and

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
still trying some new ideas and

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.240 
still trying some new ideas and
hopefully<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.049> won't<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.409> know<00:01:16.439> Restless<00:01:16.950> laws

too<00:01:17.580> much<00:01:17.729> absolutely<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.479> think<00:01:18.750> what's<00:01:19.590> been

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
too much absolutely I think what's been

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.320 
too much absolutely I think what's been
interesting<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.850> there<00:01:20.970> was<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.180> back

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
interesting and so there was the back

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.270 
interesting and so there was the back

where once multiplayer was kind of a
black<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.650> white<00:01:25.710> thing<00:01:26.040> now<00:01:26.189> it's<00:01:26.340> becoming

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
black and white thing now it's becoming

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.280 
black and white thing now it's becoming
much<00:01:26.850> more<00:01:27.000> grey<00:01:27.240> there<00:01:27.689> were<00:01:27.810> single<00:01:28.140> player

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
much more grey there were single player

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.660 
much more grey there were single player
games<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.799> there<00:01:29.040> were<00:01:29.100> multiplayer<00:01:29.490> games

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
games and there were multiplayer games

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.490 
games and there were multiplayer games
and<00:01:29.820> now<00:01:29.880> we're<00:01:30.030> getting<00:01:30.210> games<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.659> really

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
and now we're getting games that really

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.840 
and now we're getting games that really
do<00:01:31.590> blow<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.890> lines<00:01:32.040> between<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.490> two<00:01:32.640> they

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
do blow the lines between the two they

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.490 
do blow the lines between the two they
are<00:01:33.000> almost<00:01:33.390> like<00:01:33.600> ambient<00:01:34.049> multiplayer

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
are almost like ambient multiplayer

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.929 
are almost like ambient multiplayer
there<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.799> there<00:01:35.220> are<00:01:35.310> other<00:01:35.430> players<00:01:35.640> there

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
there is there are other players there

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.219 
there is there are other players there
we<00:01:36.090> cannot<00:01:36.240> always<00:01:36.390> aware<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.780> them<00:01:36.990> they're

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
we cannot always aware of them they're

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.039 
we cannot always aware of them they're
engaged<00:01:38.100> with<00:01:38.369> your<00:01:38.520> game<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:39.450> not<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.869> kind

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
particularly excited by the idea of

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.340 
particularly excited by the idea of
being<00:01:45.090> able<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.479> jump<00:01:45.720> in<00:01:45.840> someone<00:01:46.079> else's

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
that adds a nice kind of random element

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.130

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
do next and which is something that you

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.520 
do next and which is something that you
could<00:02:00.329> sort<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.659> do<00:02:00.750> with<00:02:00.869> dark<00:02:01.049> souls<00:02:01.259> if<00:02:01.409> you

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
could sort of do with dark souls if you

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.080 
could sort of do with dark souls if you
paid<00:02:01.890> enough<00:02:02.100> attention

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090
