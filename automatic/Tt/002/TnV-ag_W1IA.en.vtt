click yes you know that doesn't matter

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.109 
click yes you know that doesn't matter
and<00:01:08.790> then<00:01:08.939> first<00:01:09.360> like<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> wild<00:01:09.990> radio<00:01:11.119> you

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
and then first like a wild radio you

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.950 
and then first like a wild radio you
want<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.330> make<00:01:12.450> sure<00:01:12.479> you've<00:01:12.810> got<00:01:12.869> 2.5<00:01:13.650> years

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
want to make sure you've got 2.5 years

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.219 
want to make sure you've got 2.5 years
shows<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.820> I<00:01:17.820> find<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.240> 144<00:01:19.110> megabytes

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
shows and I find that 144 megabytes

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.380 
shows and I find that 144 megabytes
gives<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.159> best<00:01:20.369> connection<00:01:20.909> and

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
gives the best connection and

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.469 
gives the best connection and
performance<00:01:21.900> overall

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
performance overall

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.690 
performance overall
so<00:01:24.479> I'd<00:01:24.570> stick<00:01:24.840> with<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.110> 54<00:01:25.860> only<00:01:26.490> for

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
so I'd stick with that 54 only for

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.240 
so I'd stick with that 54 only for
wireless<00:01:27.030> G<00:01:27.240> devices<00:01:27.750> people<00:01:28.170> ask<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.650> go<00:01:29.070> for
