00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.899
 for it first we remove the bar 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.899
 Capable covers 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.500
 we face it but without leaving the 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.990
 forgotten 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.290
 then we remove the cover that protects the 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.790
 seating 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.790
 triangle for example I'm not re 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.090
 in this way 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.150
 to raise the seats simply 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.150
 we pull the rings from here 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.910
 we have taken one 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.470
 in this way we would have two seats 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.340
 front 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:45.010
 the three of the central part 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.630
 and one more the back we have with 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.040
 six seats 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.340
 we would do that in the back 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.340
 as well 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.230
 we would already be in configuration if you 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:54.230
 relax 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.039
 the space for the legs we already see that 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.039
 It is not very loose 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.859
 if we have 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.859
 an area for drinks bottle holder 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.830
 we need in positions and places 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.000
 let's imagine that we want to move to the 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.780
 third row of seats as we do 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.780
 simply with the handle here 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:29.730
 I'm sorry we'll see what progresses for 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.730
 forward also leans 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.259
 access to the third row of seats 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.150
 it stays perfectly with a great 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.360
 amplitude here we have two seats 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.520
 back we will check how 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.590
 walk tall and space for 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.350
 legs 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.359
 the truth that space seats for 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.609
 the legs and for the feet 

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:53.789
 virtually unusable unless 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:53.789
 let's be 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.800
 little ones 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:04.440
 well, small, better, children, because 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.440
 there is no room for the pieces even 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.810
 but good as all the 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.170
 systems gives us the option to travel in 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.170
 seven seats 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.090
 but always 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.090
 knowing that unlimited space
