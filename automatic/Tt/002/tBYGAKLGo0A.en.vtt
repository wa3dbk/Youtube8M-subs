today we're going to take a look at a

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.680 
today we're going to take a look at a
keyboard<00:00:03.659> cover<00:00:04.170> for<00:00:04.529> a<00:00:04.830> aluminum<00:00:05.339> macbook<00:00:06.029> in

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
keyboard cover for a aluminum macbook in

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.509 
keyboard cover for a aluminum macbook in
this<00:00:06.839> case<00:00:07.020> we're<00:00:07.200> looking<00:00:07.290> at<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.620> GT<00:00:08.220> max

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
this case we're looking at the GT max

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.419 
this case we're looking at the GT max
silicone<00:00:09.059> cover<00:00:09.330> for<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.960> MacBook<00:00:10.710> in<00:00:11.280> this

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
silicone cover for the MacBook in this

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.129 
silicone cover for the MacBook in this
case<00:00:11.610> this<00:00:11.759> is<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:12.090> aluminum<00:00:12.570> MacBook<00:00:12.960> it's

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
case this is the aluminum MacBook it's

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.320 
case this is the aluminum MacBook it's
not<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.320> MacBook<00:00:13.799> Pro<00:00:13.830> but<00:00:14.340> they<00:00:14.820> have<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.150> same

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
not a MacBook Pro but they have the same

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.870 
not a MacBook Pro but they have the same
general<00:00:15.690> design<00:00:16.020> so<00:00:16.260> this<00:00:16.410> will<00:00:16.650> work<00:00:16.949> on<00:00:17.460> all

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
general design so this will work on all

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.390 
general design so this will work on all
those<00:00:18.060> aluminum<00:00:18.449> mac<00:00:18.840> books<00:00:19.140> like<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.039> 13

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
those aluminum mac books like the 13

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.300 
those aluminum mac books like the 13
inch<00:00:20.580> 15<00:00:21.060> inch<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.480> 17<00:00:21.960> inch<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.439> have<00:00:23.100> been

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
inch 15 inch and 17 inch I have been

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.830 
inch 15 inch and 17 inch I have been
using<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.760> different<00:00:23.939> silicone<00:00:24.480> keyboard

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
using a different silicone keyboard

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.269 
using a different silicone keyboard
cover<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.140> very<00:00:25.350> simple<00:00:25.800> one<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.099> also

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
cover a very simple one that also

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.939 
cover a very simple one that also
protects<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.060> palm<00:00:27.779> rests<00:00:28.289> on<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.529> computer

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
protects the palm rests on the computer

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.859 
protects the palm rests on the computer
it<00:00:29.130> just<00:00:29.340> sort<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.580> fits<00:00:29.880> in<00:00:30.090> there<00:00:30.330> now<00:00:30.599> just

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
it just sort of fits in there now just

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.690 
it just sort of fits in there now just
rests<00:00:31.289> in<00:00:31.410> there<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.830> does<00:00:32.099> fit<00:00:32.309> around<00:00:32.430> the

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
rests in there it does fit around the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.850 
rests in there it does fit around the
keys<00:00:32.969> themselves<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.899> does<00:00:34.110> allow<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.380> light

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
keys themselves it does allow the light

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.190 
keys themselves it does allow the light
of<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.640> backlit<00:00:36.059> keyboard<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.600> shine<00:00:36.840> through

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
of the backlit keyboard to shine through

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.080 
of the backlit keyboard to shine through
only<00:00:37.559> problem<00:00:37.890> with<00:00:37.980> this<00:00:38.100> design<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.820> this

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
only problem with this design is this

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.549 
only problem with this design is this
lower<00:00:39.360> panel<00:00:39.629> which<00:00:39.930> constantly<00:00:40.290> moves

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
lower panel which constantly moves

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.380 
lower panel which constantly moves
around<00:00:40.680> when<00:00:41.010> I'm<00:00:41.100> using<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.850> does<00:00:42.120> get

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
around when I'm using it so it does get

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.690 
around when I'm using it so it does get
quite<00:00:42.570> annoying<00:00:43.020> it's<00:00:43.649> also<00:00:43.829> quite<00:00:44.190> numbing

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
quite annoying it's also quite numbing

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.569 
quite annoying it's also quite numbing
to<00:00:44.730> use<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.870> keyboards<00:00:46.320> does<00:00:47.010> feel<00:00:47.280> mushy

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
to use so the keyboards does feel mushy

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.760 
to use so the keyboards does feel mushy
because<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.360> silicone<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:49.079> actually<00:00:49.469> getting

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
because the silicone is actually getting

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.619 
because the silicone is actually getting
in<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.010> way<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.430> end<00:00:50.640> up<00:00:50.760> peeling<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.270> away

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
in the way so I end up peeling this away

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.720 
in the way so I end up peeling this away
and<00:00:51.809> not<00:00:51.930> using<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.530> do<00:00:52.590> like<00:00:52.860> using<00:00:53.219> silicone

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
and not using I do like using silicone

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.430 
and not using I do like using silicone
keyboard<00:00:54.120> covers<00:00:54.480> because<00:00:54.780> they<00:00:54.899> do<00:00:54.960> protect

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
keyboard covers because they do protect

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.709 
keyboard covers because they do protect
the<00:00:55.559> keys<00:00:55.770> from<00:00:56.039> wearing<00:00:56.789> out<00:00:57.030> or<00:00:57.090> developing

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
the keys from wearing out or developing

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.709 
the keys from wearing out or developing
that<00:00:57.840> shiny<00:00:58.260> black<00:00:58.770> plastic<00:00:59.250> look<00:00:59.760> as<00:00:59.940> the

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
that shiny black plastic look as the

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.080 
that shiny black plastic look as the
sort<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.230> textured<00:01:01.770> finish<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.609> keys<00:01:02.820> wear

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
sort of textured finish on the keys wear

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.850 
sort of textured finish on the keys wear
off<00:01:03.270> wherever<00:01:03.600> your<00:01:03.960> fingers<00:01:04.409> aren't<00:01:04.559> in

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
off wherever your fingers aren't in

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.670 
off wherever your fingers aren't in
constant<00:01:05.280> contact<00:01:05.489> with<00:01:05.850> them<00:01:06.229> so<00:01:07.229> since<00:01:07.590> I'm

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
constant contact with them so since I'm

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.320 
constant contact with them so since I'm
not<00:01:07.799> very<00:01:07.979> happy<00:01:08.340> with<00:01:08.520> this<00:01:08.760> design<00:01:09.150> I've

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
not very happy with this design I've

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.890 
not very happy with this design I've
decided<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.869> try<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.350> one<00:01:10.590> from<00:01:11.100> GT<00:01:11.490> max<00:01:11.939> it

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
decided to try this one from GT max it

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.350 
decided to try this one from GT max it
does<00:01:13.229> look<00:01:13.590> exactly<00:01:13.830> like<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.909> keyboard

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
does look exactly like the keyboard

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.499 
does look exactly like the keyboard
itself<00:01:16.310> on<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.580> only<00:01:17.759> unfortunate<00:01:18.000> thing<00:01:18.270> I

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
itself on the only unfortunate thing I

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.359 
itself on the only unfortunate thing I
see<00:01:18.689> here<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.380> completely<00:01:19.890> opaque

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
see here is that it is completely opaque

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.670 
see here is that it is completely opaque
so<00:01:20.610> we'll<00:01:20.939> probably<00:01:21.630> block<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.200> light<00:01:22.470> that

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
so we'll probably block the light that

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.219 
so we'll probably block the light that
shines<00:01:22.979> through<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:24.150> keys<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:24.810> let's<00:01:25.020> just

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
shines through the keys so let's just

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:32.280 
shines through the keys so let's just
take<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.409> look<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.710> see<00:01:25.770> how<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.310> works

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.300 

so<00:01:33.290> you<00:01:33.350> can<00:01:33.500> see<00:01:33.740> it's<00:01:33.890> stretchy<00:01:34.310> silicone

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
so you can see it's stretchy silicone

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.710 
so you can see it's stretchy silicone
you<00:01:37.310> can<00:01:37.430> see<00:01:37.579> the<00:01:37.700> keys<00:01:37.909> look<00:01:38.149> exactly<00:01:38.479> like

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
you can see the keys look exactly like

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.289 
you can see the keys look exactly like
the<00:01:39.049> ones<00:01:39.079> on<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:39.530> MacBook<00:01:39.850> so<00:01:40.850> when<00:01:41.000> you<00:01:41.090> put

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
the ones on the MacBook so when you put

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.330 
the ones on the MacBook so when you put
it<00:01:41.420> right<00:01:41.659> on<00:01:41.869> the<00:01:42.020> MacBook<00:01:42.200> it<00:01:42.590> should<00:01:42.890> fit<00:01:43.189> on

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
it right on the MacBook it should fit on

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.919 
it right on the MacBook it should fit on
perfectly<00:01:45.880> and<00:01:46.880> you'll<00:01:47.179> never<00:01:47.390> know<00:01:47.630> you<00:01:47.750> even

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
perfectly and you'll never know you even

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:50.169 
perfectly and you'll never know you even
have<00:01:48.289> a<00:01:48.560> silicone<00:01:49.189> keyboard<00:01:49.610> over<00:01:49.880> it<00:01:49.970> so

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:50.179 
have a silicone keyboard over it so

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:57.609 
have a silicone keyboard over it so
let's<00:01:50.330> see<00:01:50.420> how<00:01:50.479> it<00:01:50.630> feels<00:01:56.380> now<00:01:57.380> it<00:01:57.470> feels

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
let's see how it feels now it feels

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.380 
let's see how it feels now it feels
about<00:01:57.890> the<00:01:58.220> same<00:01:58.490> it<00:01:58.700> feels<00:01:58.880> maybe<00:01:59.119> a<00:01:59.210> little

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
about the same it feels maybe a little

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.960 
about the same it feels maybe a little
bit<00:01:59.570> better<00:01:59.689> than<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.520> silicone<00:02:01.520> keyboard<00:02:01.880> I

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
bit better than the silicone keyboard I

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.990 
bit better than the silicone keyboard I
was<00:02:02.210> using<00:02:02.539> before<00:02:03.190> it<00:02:04.190> definitely<00:02:04.549> looks<00:02:04.789> a

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
was using before it definitely looks a

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.749 
was using before it definitely looks a
lot<00:02:05.209> better<00:02:05.450> I<00:02:05.799> am<00:02:06.799> glad<00:02:07.130> it<00:02:07.159> doesn't<00:02:07.369> have<00:02:07.640> the

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
lot better I am glad it doesn't have the

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:09.460 
lot better I am glad it doesn't have the
palm<00:02:07.970> rest<00:02:08.000> anymore<00:02:08.690> which<00:02:08.840> was<00:02:08.869> constantly

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
palm rest anymore which was constantly

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.150 
palm rest anymore which was constantly
moving<00:02:09.679> around

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
moving around

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.610 
moving around
I<00:02:10.250> do<00:02:10.640> wish<00:02:10.910> this<00:02:11.150> was<00:02:11.390> protected<00:02:11.930> somehow<00:02:12.290> but

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
I do wish this was protected somehow but

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.640 
I do wish this was protected somehow but
I'm<00:02:13.190> just<00:02:13.489> going<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.670> trust<00:02:14.120> that<00:02:14.269> this

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
I'm just going to trust that this

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.080 
I'm just going to trust that this
anodized<00:02:15.650> aluminum<00:02:16.220> will<00:02:16.340> hold<00:02:16.549> up<00:02:16.700> to<00:02:16.849> where

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
anodized aluminum will hold up to where

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.089 
anodized aluminum will hold up to where
now<00:02:17.599> if<00:02:17.720> we<00:02:17.810> take<00:02:17.959> a<00:02:18.019> close<00:02:18.349> look<00:02:18.500> you<00:02:18.769> can<00:02:18.920> see

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
now if we take a close look you can see

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.460 
now if we take a close look you can see
that<00:02:19.310> it<00:02:19.489> fits<00:02:19.730> right<00:02:20.000> into<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.569> pocket<00:02:21.110> where

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
that it fits right into the pocket where

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.979 
that it fits right into the pocket where
the<00:02:21.590> keyboard<00:02:21.769> sits<00:02:22.480> if<00:02:23.480> you<00:02:23.599> peel<00:02:23.810> it<00:02:23.840> away

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
the keyboard sits if you peel it away

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.650 
the keyboard sits if you peel it away
you<00:02:24.140> can<00:02:24.319> see<00:02:24.530> it's<00:02:24.680> very<00:02:25.130> seamless<00:02:25.660> pretty

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
you can see it's very seamless pretty

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.440 
you can see it's very seamless pretty
neat<00:02:26.930> that<00:02:27.080> Mac's<00:02:27.290> very<00:02:27.560> impressed<00:02:27.920> with<00:02:28.069> it

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
neat that Mac's very impressed with it

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.610 
neat that Mac's very impressed with it
now<00:02:29.450> like<00:02:29.630> I<00:02:29.750> said<00:02:29.810> I'm<00:02:30.019> concerned<00:02:30.349> that<00:02:30.440> the

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
now like I said I'm concerned that the

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.809 
now like I said I'm concerned that the
backlight<00:02:31.010> won't<00:02:31.220> shine<00:02:31.430> through<00:02:31.640> these

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
backlight won't shine through these

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.000 
backlight won't shine through these
opaque<00:02:32.330> keys<00:02:32.720> so<00:02:33.349> let's<00:02:33.500> go<00:02:33.620> ahead<00:02:33.709> and<00:02:33.890> turn

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
opaque keys so let's go ahead and turn

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.319 
opaque keys so let's go ahead and turn
off<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.160> lights<00:02:34.489> and<00:02:34.640> see<00:02:34.910> what<00:02:35.060> it<00:02:35.150> looks

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:35.329 
off the lights and see what it looks

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:40.750 
off the lights and see what it looks
like<00:02:37.959> so<00:02:38.959> indeed<00:02:39.260> you<00:02:39.290> can't<00:02:39.650> see<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.190> print

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
like so indeed you can't see the print

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.580 
like so indeed you can't see the print
of<00:02:40.850> the<00:02:40.910> keys<00:02:41.180> themselves<00:02:41.930> so<00:02:42.140> let's<00:02:42.320> go<00:02:42.470> ahead

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
of the keys themselves so let's go ahead

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.080 
of the keys themselves so let's go ahead
and<00:02:42.739> zoom<00:02:42.859> up<00:02:43.040> again<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:43.670> show<00:02:43.820> you<00:02:43.880> what<00:02:44.060> I

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
and zoom up again and show you what I

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.099 
and zoom up again and show you what I
mean<00:02:45.850> so<00:02:46.850> if<00:02:46.910> I<00:02:47.000> peel<00:02:47.239> the<00:02:47.359> keyboard<00:02:47.840> cover

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
mean so if I peel the keyboard cover

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:51.580 
mean so if I peel the keyboard cover
back<00:02:48.500> if<00:02:49.040> I<00:02:49.130> can<00:02:49.340> get<00:02:49.519> in<00:02:49.700> it<00:02:49.850> you<00:02:50.109> can<00:02:51.109> see<00:02:51.350> that

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
back if I can get in it you can see that

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.330 
back if I can get in it you can see that
the<00:02:52.209> lettering<00:02:53.209> is<00:02:53.390> covered<00:02:53.950> there<00:02:54.950> is<00:02:55.100> one

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
the lettering is covered there is one

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.890 
the lettering is covered there is one
exception<00:02:55.640> here<00:02:56.060> we<00:02:56.209> do<00:02:56.390> have<00:02:56.420> a<00:02:56.630> little

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
exception here we do have a little

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.770 
exception here we do have a little
cutout<00:02:57.140> for<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.560> caps<00:02:58.100> lock<00:02:58.220> light<00:02:58.750> so<00:02:59.750> that

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
cutout for the caps lock light so that

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.770 
cutout for the caps lock light so that
works<00:03:00.700> but<00:03:01.700> it<00:03:01.790> would<00:03:01.910> be<00:03:02.030> great<00:03:02.389> if<00:03:02.600> this

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
works but it would be great if this

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.050 
works but it would be great if this
keyboard<00:03:03.290> cover<00:03:03.470> also<00:03:03.859> had<00:03:04.069> a<00:03:04.100> cutout<00:03:04.549> for<00:03:04.880> the

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
keyboard cover also had a cutout for the

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.360 
keyboard cover also had a cutout for the
letters<00:03:05.510> that<00:03:05.540> would<00:03:05.870> be<00:03:05.959> perfect<00:03:06.500> for<00:03:06.709> this

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370
