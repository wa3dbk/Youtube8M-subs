00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
bit more there so as I said this team is

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.129 
bit more there so as I said this team is
ridiculously<00:04:44.940> overpowered<00:04:45.389> it<00:04:45.630> was<00:04:45.810> what<00:04:46.110> I

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
ridiculously overpowered it was what I

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.379 
ridiculously overpowered it was what I
use<00:04:46.470> to<00:04:46.500> for<00:04:46.860> the<00:04:46.980> wager<00:04:47.190> games<00:04:47.580> and<00:04:47.850> you<00:04:48.150> just

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
use to for the wager games and you just

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.659 
use to for the wager games and you just
get<00:04:48.540> goals<00:04:48.840> everywhere<00:04:49.470> I<00:04:49.620> personally<00:04:50.490> do<00:04:50.639> not

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669

is<00:05:06.180> is<00:05:06.540> of<00:05:06.960> course<00:05:07.140> frustrating<00:05:07.830> but<00:05:07.950> here<00:05:08.190> is

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
is is of course frustrating but here is

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.220 
is is of course frustrating but here is
an<00:05:08.370> absolute<00:05:08.760> beautiful<00:05:09.180> goal<00:05:09.480> by<00:05:09.690> Ramirez

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
an absolute beautiful goal by Ramirez

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.830 
an absolute beautiful goal by Ramirez
look<00:05:10.410> at<00:05:10.530> that<00:05:10.680> top<00:05:10.950> corner<00:05:11.340> bang<00:05:11.640> so<00:05:12.480> yeah<00:05:12.690> the

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
look at that top corner bang so yeah the

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.680 
look at that top corner bang so yeah the
team<00:05:13.020> is<00:05:13.230> so<00:05:13.500> overpowered<00:05:14.130> and<00:05:14.390> like<00:05:15.390> I<00:05:15.419> said

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
team is so overpowered and like I said

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.630 
team is so overpowered and like I said
the<00:05:15.870> cost<00:05:16.140> should<00:05:16.350> be<00:05:16.410> above<00:05:16.950> I<00:05:17.160> think<00:05:17.520> it's

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
the cost should be above I think it's

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.610 
the cost should be above I think it's
around<00:05:17.729> 40k<00:05:18.479> but<00:05:18.720> I<00:05:18.780> haven't<00:05:18.960> quite<00:05:19.200> worked<00:05:19.410> it

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
around 40k but I haven't quite worked it
