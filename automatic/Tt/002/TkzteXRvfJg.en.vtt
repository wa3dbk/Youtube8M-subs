00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
to be 0 about 7 to 8 teaspoons of this

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.990 
to be 0 about 7 to 8 teaspoons of this
this<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.060> pretty<00:01:24.439> pretty<00:01:25.439> spicy<00:01:25.970> you'd<00:01:26.970> think

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
this is pretty pretty spicy you'd think

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.760 
this is pretty pretty spicy you'd think
like<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.570> were<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.720> be<00:01:27.900> spicier<00:01:28.380> but<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.650> is

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
like that were to be spicier but this is

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:36.310 
like that were to be spicier but this is
actually<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.130> little<00:01:29.189> bit<00:01:29.400> spicier<00:01:29.850> than<00:01:30.000> black

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.830 

so<00:01:36.590> we've<00:01:36.710> got<00:01:36.950> that<00:01:36.980> and<00:01:37.630> next<00:01:38.630> will<00:01:38.720> be<00:01:38.750> our

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840
