00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.360
In this episode we will build a simple jet vehicle.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.060
We need: a piece of rectangular cardboard,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.560
some bottle stoppers, the bigger the better,

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.220
here I have these from mineral water bottles.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.560
Let's make a hole in the caps.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.720
A hole in each one.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.200
As axles use these long sticks that can be found in dollar stores.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:59.400
And what we have to do is fit the stick into the hole of the wheel.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.680
But in order the axle can slide well we will make a kind of bearing.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.880
To do this, we cut a piece of drinking straw

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.520
a little shorter than the width of the rectangle

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.960
and with a little masking tape,

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.900
with a couple of pieces,  better ...

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:37.720
We ensure that the straw is completely parallel to the piece of cardboard

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.400
and then we introduce the shaft in the straw.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.460
And we can put the other wheel.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.180
I enlarge a little the hole ....

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.100
And we have done an axle.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.440
The same for the second axle.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.860
Now we need the propellant.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.900
We use a balloon and a piece of drinking straw.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.160
Let's do it, for example, this length.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.260
We put the straw in the balloon.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.400
And again with masking tape ....

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.180
Now, simply, we place it ...

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.700
... And it is ready our new vehicle.
