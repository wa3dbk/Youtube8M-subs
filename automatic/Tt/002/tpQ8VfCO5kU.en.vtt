00:01:33.239 --> 00:01:33.249 
than that I began to realize this was an

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:36.089 
than that I began to realize this was an
obligation<00:01:33.959> because<00:01:34.959> these<00:01:35.259> pieces<00:01:35.499> weren't

00:01:36.089 --> 00:01:36.099 
obligation because these pieces weren't

00:01:36.099 --> 00:01:38.580 
obligation because these pieces weren't
going<00:01:36.819> to<00:01:36.880> come<00:01:36.999> together<00:01:37.179> again<00:01:37.509> if<00:01:37.959> I<00:01:38.259> didn't

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
going to come together again if I didn't

go do this it wasn't gonna happen and I

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.199 
go do this it wasn't gonna happen and I
felt<00:01:41.079> it<00:01:41.229> deserved<00:01:41.380> to<00:01:41.889> shooting<00:01:42.759> mainly<00:01:43.090> at
