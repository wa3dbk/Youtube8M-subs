Hey jammers!

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.610
Snowyclaw here from the Animal Jam Spirit.

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.809
As you may have noticed, I’ve been playing
around with a new project idea.

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.740
I’m starting a crazy little series called
“Animal Jam History” – videos tackling

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.980
the complicated history of Jamaa.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.080
And what better way of retelling our history
than taking the form of my first Animal Jam

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.150
character, Old Frozenspirit?

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.140
I took the inspiration for the series’ style
from animation analysis videos I’ve seen

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.140
all around YouTube.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.509
I have teamed up with the jamtastic artist
BirdyCrossing to bring this animatic video

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.530
to life, and was hoping you may want to donate
to the cause!

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.540
Videos like these take a lot of editing power,
so if you, or you with the help of your parents,

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.930
want to assist in making this project possible
by donating to my Patreon that would be ever

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.010
so helpful.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.260
^-^ There are lots of little bonus prizes
that can come with your donation, and as time

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.700
goes by they will likely evolve into even
bigger and better things…

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.220
We’ll just have to wait and see.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.370
How Patreon works is this: first you decide
how much you’d like to donate per video.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.070
Don’t worry, I only count the videos that
are part of this project!

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.760
Not any of my “online Animal Jam” or “in
real life” ones.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.580
Second, you set a limit on how much you would
donate per month – I won’t be publishing

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.810
too many, since they are pretty time consuming
to make, but it’s a good safety measure.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.760
And finally, you decide on the prize that
comes with your donation!

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.580
Prizes range from early viewings and channel
shoutouts to being live, skype guests in some

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.990
of my Animal Jam videos.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.670
There are already four pawsome Spirit Patrons
– Birdy, Rockabilly, ava, and Corrallie.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:23.820
Thanks you guys!

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.670
I hope you will enjoy the upcoming videos.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.670
;)

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.000
If you’d like to help with the history aspect
of the video-making you can submit media (images,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.159
videos, articles) that have documentation
of Animal Jam’s past.

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.280
Submit what you find with links and attachments
in an email to animaljamspirit@gmail.com – if

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.640
you’re the first one to show me something
I didn’t know about Jamaa, you will be featured

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.940
in the video credits!

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.560
Be sure to include your sources though, so
I can feature them too.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.560
:)

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.950
Other than that, I just wan’t to know what
you think of the style!

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.350
And also, what aspects of Jamaa’s history
do you want to see me include?

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.040
Would you also like me to do another related
series focusing on the history of the game’s

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.040
most popular items?

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.040
“Animal Jam Items,” hmm…

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.040
I could see that happening.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.040
Let me know what you think in the comments
below!

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.180
Thank you for supporting me by watching my
crazy collection of videos about Jamaa.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.530
Hopefully this new theme will be a fun little
addition to the ever growing world of Animal

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.530
Jam.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:39.579
Hope to see you there, happy jamming!
