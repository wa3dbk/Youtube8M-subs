it so that's how this works you got a

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.790 
it so that's how this works you got a
lot<00:02:14.600> of<00:02:14.690> options<00:02:14.870> with<00:02:15.230> this<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:15.620> it<00:02:15.680> also

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
lot of options with this and it also

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.830 
lot of options with this and it also
comes<00:02:16.010> in<00:02:16.069> three<00:02:16.280> pieces<00:02:16.510> up<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.720> your

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
comes in three pieces up to your

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
preference and I'm using this one just

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.130 
preference and I'm using this one just
so<00:02:19.970> it<00:02:20.090> can<00:02:20.209> be<00:02:20.300> easier<00:02:20.600> I<00:02:20.690> guess<00:02:20.720> to<00:02:20.989> get<00:02:21.080> a
