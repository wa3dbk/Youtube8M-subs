00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
think one of the maps can be settled at

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.930 
think one of the maps can be settled at
a<00:00:30.840> los<00:00:31.289> angeles<00:00:31.800> as<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.250> can<00:00:32.369> see<00:00:32.520> here<00:00:32.790> this

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
a los angeles as you can see here this

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.350 
a los angeles as you can see here this
is<00:00:33.000> but<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.630> was<00:00:33.899> part<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.320> trailer<00:00:34.590> and

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
is but this was part of the trailer and

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.090 
is but this was part of the trailer and
as<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.480> can<00:00:36.600> see<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:37.020> background<00:00:37.500> is<00:00:37.920> like<00:00:37.950> a

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
as you can see the background is like a

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.190 
as you can see the background is like a
bunch<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.520> ruins<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.969> buildings<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.809> about<00:00:40.079> to

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
bunch of ruins of buildings and about to

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.990 
bunch of ruins of buildings and about to
get<00:00:40.350> big<00:00:40.649> getting<00:00:40.950> destroyed<00:00:41.250> by<00:00:41.370> planes<00:00:41.790> and

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
futuristic environment but like I think

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.789 
futuristic environment but like I think
it's<00:01:48.270> gonna<00:01:48.360> be<00:01:48.450> pretty<00:01:48.689> good<00:01:48.960> because<00:01:49.229> for

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
it's gonna be pretty good because for

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:50.780 
it's gonna be pretty good because for
sure<00:01:49.920> it's<00:01:50.009> gonna<00:01:50.130> be<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> lot<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.460> open<00:01:50.759> space

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
sure it's gonna be a lot of open space

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.899 
sure it's gonna be a lot of open space
and<00:01:51.149> not<00:01:52.049> like<00:01:52.259> it's<00:01:53.250> not<00:01:53.369> gonna<00:01:53.579> be<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.759> lot

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
and not like it's not gonna be a lot

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.700 
and not like it's not gonna be a lot
like<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.570> lot<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.840> buildings<00:01:55.259> or<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.409> lot<00:01:55.590> of

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
like a lot of buildings or a lot of

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.160 
like a lot of buildings or a lot of
areas<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.280> can<00:01:56.670> cover<00:01:56.820> your<00:01:57.000> head<00:01:57.180> so<00:01:57.990> it's

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
areas that can cover your head so it's

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.170 
areas that can cover your head so it's
gonna<00:01:58.259> be<00:01:58.409> good<00:01:58.560> for<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.770> killstreaks

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
gonna be good for the killstreaks

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.450 
gonna be good for the killstreaks
this<00:02:00.720> next<00:02:00.930> image<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.410> we<00:02:01.500> can<00:02:01.650> see<00:02:01.770> here<00:02:02.010> it

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
looks like some kind of power plant

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.530 
looks like some kind of power plant
looks<00:02:04.500> very<00:02:04.770> very<00:02:05.100> heavily<00:02:06.030> guarded<00:02:06.300> and

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
futuristic so you know it could be a

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.669 
futuristic so you know it could be a
great<00:02:09.390> stage<00:02:09.660> right<00:02:09.899> here<00:02:10.110> because<00:02:10.320> you<00:02:10.470> know

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
since it does represent our futuristic

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.680 
since it does represent our futuristic
characteristics<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.160> future<00:02:15.150> black<00:02:15.450> ops

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
characteristics of a future black ops

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.010 
characteristics of a future black ops
you<00:02:15.870> know<00:02:15.930> they<00:02:16.890> really<00:02:17.070> really<00:02:17.400> looks<00:02:17.670> like

black ops 2 you know they can design
maps<00:03:31.709> out<00:03:31.920> of<00:03:32.100> those<00:03:32.220> places<00:03:32.580> and<00:03:32.900> you<00:03:33.900> know<00:03:33.989> be

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
maps out of those places and you know be

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.960 
maps out of those places and you know be
exciting<00:03:34.739> to<00:03:34.830> know<00:03:34.860> to<00:03:35.250> know<00:03:35.280> first<00:03:35.640> you<00:03:35.820> know

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
exciting to know to know first you know

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.880 
exciting to know to know first you know
and<00:03:36.480> then<00:03:36.690> you<00:03:36.870> know<00:03:36.900> why<00:03:37.200> now<00:03:37.380> that<00:03:37.680> these

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
and then you know why now that these

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.550 
and then you know why now that these
numbers<00:03:38.370> up<00:03:38.489> huge<00:03:39.030> numbers<00:03:39.060> are<00:03:39.570> 30<00:03:39.780> 30

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
numbers up huge numbers are 30 30

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.729 
numbers up huge numbers are 30 30
million<00:03:41.130> and<00:03:41.660> the<00:03:42.660> 65<00:03:43.140> million<00:03:43.470> of<00:03:43.620> those

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
million and the 65 million of those

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.650 
million and the 65 million of those
numbers<00:03:44.100> or<00:03:44.400> la<00:03:44.850> longitudes<00:03:45.480> and<00:03:45.630> latitudes

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
numbers or la longitudes and latitudes

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.160 
numbers or la longitudes and latitudes
so<00:03:46.549> usually<00:03:47.549> I<00:03:47.610> type<00:03:47.880> it<00:03:48.060> in<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.209> makes<00:03:48.989> you

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
so usually I type it in and makes you

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.110 
so usually I type it in and makes you
make<00:03:49.350> sure<00:03:49.530> you<00:03:49.799> know<00:03:49.920> what<00:03:50.519> cities<00:03:50.820> they<00:03:50.940> are
