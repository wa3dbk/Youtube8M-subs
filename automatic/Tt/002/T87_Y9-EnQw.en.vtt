to<00:01:38.700> avoid<00:01:39.060> death<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.750> maintain<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.079> position

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
to avoid death and maintain a position

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.249 
to avoid death and maintain a position
here<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.009> let's<00:01:41.549> talk<00:01:41.700> about<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.970> AEK<00:01:42.360> burst

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
here so let's talk about the AEK burst

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.670 
here so let's talk about the AEK burst
fire<00:01:43.970> microburst<00:01:44.970> not<00:01:45.509> as<00:01:45.689> much<00:01:45.960> as<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.350> AS

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
fire microburst not as much as the AS

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.960 
fire microburst not as much as the AS
VAL<00:01:47.390> but<00:01:48.500> you<00:01:49.500> do<00:01:49.710> have<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.950> burst<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.549> at<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
VAL but you do have to burst it at the

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.330 
VAL but you do have to burst it at the
long<00:01:51.180> range<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:51.840> two<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.439> five<00:01:52.619> round<00:01:52.920> bursts

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
long range in two to five round bursts

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.710 
long range in two to five round bursts
if<00:01:53.759> somebody's<00:01:54.210> going<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.390> bring<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.689> a

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
if somebody's going to bring you a

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.719 
if somebody's going to bring you a
Christmas<00:01:55.200> gift<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.649> might<00:01:55.890> as<00:01:56.040> well<00:01:56.189> open<00:01:56.369> it

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
Christmas gift you might as well open it

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.819 
Christmas gift you might as well open it
so<00:01:56.909> why<00:01:57.270> not<00:01:57.479> get<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.869> little<00:01:58.079> support<00:01:58.619> bag

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
so why not get that little support bag

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.440 
so why not get that little support bag
out<00:01:59.070> because<00:01:59.399> we're<00:01:59.640> going<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.880> be<00:02:00.000> here<00:02:00.240> for<00:02:00.270> a

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.120 
out because we're going to be here for a
little<00:02:00.540> bit<00:02:00.689> today<00:02:00.930> this<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.740> probably<00:02:01.979> the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
little bit today this is probably the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.550 
little bit today this is probably the
best<00:02:02.670> spot<00:02:03.060> on<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.869> left<00:02:04.110> side<00:02:04.290> because

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
best spot on the left side because

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.230 
best spot on the left side because
you've<00:02:04.710> got<00:02:04.829> some<00:02:05.040> elevation<00:02:05.430> you've<00:02:06.060> got

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
you've got some elevation you've got

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.910 
you've got some elevation you've got
some<00:02:06.450> protection<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.200> here's<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.890> best

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
some protection and here's the best

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.619 
some protection and here's the best
thing<00:02:08.310> there's<00:02:08.610> only<00:02:08.789> one<00:02:08.940> way<00:02:09.270> these<00:02:09.420> guys

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
thing there's only one way these guys

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.050 
thing there's only one way these guys
can<00:02:09.690> push<00:02:10.050> up<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.259> get<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.800> right<00:02:11.489> they<00:02:12.030> can

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
can push up to get you right they can

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.340 
can push up to get you right they can
push<00:02:12.330> far<00:02:12.540> right<00:02:12.780> so<00:02:13.200> you

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
push far right so you

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.080 
push far right so you
keep<00:02:13.590> an<00:02:13.680> eye<00:02:13.740> on<00:02:13.770> that<00:02:13.980> but<00:02:14.490> there's<00:02:14.640> only<00:02:14.790> one

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
keep an eye on that but there's only one

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.700 
keep an eye on that but there's only one
way<00:02:15.240> they<00:02:15.390> can<00:02:15.570> come<00:02:15.750> up<00:02:15.780> all<00:02:16.350> right<00:02:16.530> actually

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
way they can come up all right actually

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.990 
way they can come up all right actually
theres<00:02:16.980> two<00:02:17.130> now<00:02:17.160> because<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.520> walls<00:02:17.730> getting

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
theres two now because I walls getting

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
theres two now because I walls getting
blown<00:02:18.150> up<00:02:18.180> but<00:02:18.390> they're<00:02:18.480> both<00:02:18.630> in<00:02:18.750> front<00:02:18.840> of

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
blown up but they're both in front of

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.720 
blown up but they're both in front of
you<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:19.770> that's<00:02:19.950> another<00:02:20.220> tuck<00:02:20.460> we're<00:02:20.610> going

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
you so that's another tuck we're going

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.070 
you so that's another tuck we're going
to<00:02:20.790> have<00:02:20.910> when<00:02:21.180> you're<00:02:21.270> using<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.840> piece<00:02:22.050> of

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
to have when you're using a piece of

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.850 
to have when you're using a piece of
cover<00:02:22.640> know<00:02:23.640> where<00:02:23.910> you<00:02:24.000> can<00:02:24.120> get<00:02:24.240> rushed<00:02:24.510> from

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
cover know where you can get rushed from

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.410 
cover know where you can get rushed from
is<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:26.070> you're<00:02:26.220> right<00:02:26.430> is<00:02:26.610> it<00:02:26.790> your<00:02:26.940> left<00:02:27.120> is

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
is that you're right is it your left is

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.120 
is that you're right is it your left is
it<00:02:27.540> both<00:02:27.780> obviously<00:02:28.740> it's<00:02:28.860> going<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:29.070> be

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
it both obviously it's going to be

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.820 
it both obviously it's going to be
behind<00:02:29.310> more<00:02:29.790> than<00:02:29.970> likely<00:02:30.180> right<00:02:30.750> is<00:02:31.560> it<00:02:31.740> in

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
behind more than likely right is it in

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.040 
behind more than likely right is it in
top<00:02:32.040> of<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:32.400> this<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.120> one<00:02:33.270> of<00:02:33.300> those<00:02:33.450> Maps<00:02:33.780> all

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
top of you this is one of those Maps all

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.380 
top of you this is one of those Maps all
these<00:02:34.230> aftermath<00:02:34.710> maps<00:02:35.010> are<00:02:35.250> very<00:02:35.640> classic

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
these aftermath maps are very classic

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.380 
these aftermath maps are very classic

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
bursting two to three round bursts as

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.270 
bursting two to three round bursts as
quick<00:02:47.910> as<00:02:48.120> you<00:02:48.600> can<00:02:48.630> lay<00:02:48.960> on<00:02:49.170> it<00:02:49.410> now<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:49.980> hard

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
quick as you can lay on it now the hard

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.100 
quick as you can lay on it now the hard

thing with the a AK is keeping that
crosshair<00:02:53.070> down<00:02:53.610> because<00:02:54.330> this<00:02:54.480> thing<00:02:54.660> does

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
crosshair down because this thing does

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.660 
crosshair down because this thing does
have<00:02:55.020> kind<00:02:55.200> of<00:02:55.350> an<00:02:55.500> aggressive<00:02:55.950> recoil

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
have kind of an aggressive recoil

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.260 
have kind of an aggressive recoil
compared<00:02:57.060> to<00:02:57.240> an<00:02:57.330> m16<00:02:57.870> m4<00:02:58.080> 16<00:02:58.680> AK<00:02:59.130> and<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:00.060> lot<00:03:00.240> of

compared to an m16 m4 16 AK and a lot of

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.380 
compared to an m16 m4 16 AK and a lot of
guns<00:03:00.570> in<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.930> assault<00:03:01.230> tree<00:03:01.590> but<00:03:02.280> it's<00:03:02.940> still

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
guns in the assault tree but it's still

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.850 
guns in the assault tree but it's still
a<00:03:03.630> great<00:03:03.810> gun<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.380> because<00:03:04.620> I'm<00:03:04.740> in

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
a great gun and because I'm in

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.960 
a great gun and because I'm in
competitive<00:03:05.400> mode<00:03:05.520> my<00:03:06.120> two<00:03:06.180> kits<00:03:06.600> m16<00:03:07.700> AEK<00:03:08.700> I

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
competitive mode my two kits m16 AEK I

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.360 
competitive mode my two kits m16 AEK I
gotta<00:03:09.450> stay<00:03:09.690> sharp<00:03:09.720> on<00:03:10.170> both<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.650> AEK<00:03:11.010> is<00:03:11.070> more

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
gotta stay sharp on both the AEK is more

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.580 
gotta stay sharp on both the AEK is more
of<00:03:11.490> a<00:03:11.580> close-range<00:03:12.090> gun<00:03:12.420> for<00:03:12.660> me<00:03:12.810> but<00:03:13.350> as<00:03:13.440> you

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
of a close-range gun for me but as you

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.050 
of a close-range gun for me but as you
can<00:03:13.680> see<00:03:13.860> it<00:03:13.950> could<00:03:14.040> still<00:03:14.280> be<00:03:14.340> effective<00:03:14.940> at

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060

get to see these little symbols that let

get to see these little symbols that let
you<00:03:41.520> know<00:03:41.550> where<00:03:41.880> people<00:03:42.870> are<00:03:42.930> dead<00:03:43.110> at<00:03:43.290> so<00:03:43.890> the

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
you know where people are dead at so the

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.650 
you know where people are dead at so the
question<00:03:44.310> is<00:03:44.430> do<00:03:44.640> they<00:03:44.730> get<00:03:44.880> killed<00:03:45.090> close<00:03:45.330> do

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
question is do they get killed close do

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.850 
question is do they get killed close do
they<00:03:45.780> stick<00:03:46.080> their<00:03:46.230> head<00:03:46.350> out<00:03:46.500> are<00:03:46.710> they

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
they stick their head out are they

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.350 
they stick their head out are they

threat why because it'd be smart he was

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.760 
threat why because it'd be smart he was

finish a kill and die in the process
whether<00:04:21.180> you<00:04:21.330> get<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.600> killer<00:04:21.810> now<00:04:22.049> because

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
whether you get the killer now because

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.700 
whether you get the killer now because
the<00:04:22.470> chance<00:04:22.740> of<00:04:22.919> you<00:04:22.979> pushing

the chance of you pushing

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
back up to this point with the tank

back up to this point with the tank
sitting<00:04:25.419> there<00:04:25.630> are<00:04:25.810> slim<00:04:26.560> to<00:04:26.590> none<00:04:26.740> and<00:04:27.400> again

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.159 
sitting there are slim to none and again
I<00:04:27.729> think<00:04:28.000> you<00:04:28.060> can<00:04:28.210> see<00:04:28.389> how<00:04:28.569> effective<00:04:29.139> that

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
I think you can see how effective that

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.980 
I think you can see how effective that
this<00:04:29.500> little<00:04:29.800> area<00:04:30.039> can<00:04:30.340> be<00:04:30.600> and<00:04:31.600> don't<00:04:31.780> forget

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
this little area can be and don't forget

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.680 
this little area can be and don't forget
people<00:04:32.259> can<00:04:32.560> push<00:04:32.770> a<00:04:32.800> wide<00:04:33.190> wide<00:04:33.490> left<00:04:33.910> almost

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
people can push a wide wide left almost

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.409 
people can push a wide wide left almost
behind<00:04:34.990> actually<00:04:35.680> they<00:04:35.770> can<00:04:35.949> push<00:04:36.220> behind<00:04:37.090> and

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
behind actually they can push behind and

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:38.610 
behind actually they can push behind and
there's<00:04:37.539> one<00:04:37.630> of<00:04:37.720> those<00:04:37.810> reactions<00:04:38.080> get<00:04:38.530> to

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
there's one of those reactions get to

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.589 
there's one of those reactions get to
cover<00:04:38.800> right<00:04:39.160> they<00:04:39.729> can't<00:04:39.940> push<00:04:40.120> beyond<00:04:40.449> this

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:40.599 
cover right they can't push beyond this

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:42.180 
cover right they can't push beyond this
behind<00:04:41.199> this<00:04:41.259> construction<00:04:41.680> site<00:04:41.949> so<00:04:42.069> I'm

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
behind this construction site so I'm

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.980 
behind this construction site so I'm
taking<00:04:42.430> a<00:04:42.490> peek<00:04:42.699> there<00:04:42.910> because<00:04:43.509> I<00:04:43.630> see<00:04:43.810> some

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
taking a peek there because I see some

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.659 
taking a peek there because I see some
stuff<00:04:44.199> going<00:04:44.349> on<00:04:44.560> now<00:04:44.830> there's<00:04:45.039> a<00:04:45.130> tugs<00:04:45.370> down

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
stuff going on now there's a tugs down

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
that container probably gixxer just to

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.379 
that container probably gixxer just to
kill<00:05:38.680> me<00:05:38.889> that's<00:05:39.130> a<00:05:39.219> nasty<00:05:39.610> little<00:05:39.789> spot<00:05:40.090> so

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
now I got to be mindful of that so it's

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:43.529 
now I got to be mindful of that so it's
another<00:05:42.490> thing<00:05:42.759> you<00:05:42.849> want<00:05:43.000> to<00:05:43.060> keep<00:05:43.180> in<00:05:43.300> mind

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539 
another thing you want to keep in mind

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:45.270 
another thing you want to keep in mind
is<00:05:43.719> when<00:05:43.960> you<00:05:44.080> start<00:05:44.139> taking<00:05:44.680> fire<00:05:44.949> from<00:05:44.979> a

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
is when you start taking fire from a

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.670 
is when you start taking fire from a
nasty<00:05:45.490> spot<00:05:45.880> like<00:05:46.090> that<00:05:46.270> where<00:05:46.930> exactly<00:05:47.349> was

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
nasty spot like that where exactly was

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.990 
nasty spot like that where exactly was
that<00:05:47.710> hit<00:05:48.009> marker<00:05:48.310> that's<00:05:48.550> going<00:05:48.699> to<00:05:48.759> tell<00:05:48.909> you

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
that hit marker that's going to tell you

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.140 
that hit marker that's going to tell you
where<00:05:49.210> it<00:05:49.330> came<00:05:49.479> from<00:05:49.539> right<00:05:50.500> so<00:05:50.909> peak<00:05:51.909> and

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
where it came from right so peak and

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.200 
where it came from right so peak and
expect<00:05:53.110> that<00:05:53.259> shot<00:05:53.590> to<00:05:53.620> come<00:05:53.949> or<00:05:54.190> drop<00:05:54.759> back<00:05:55.000> to

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
expect that shot to come or drop back to

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.659 
expect that shot to come or drop back to
give<00:05:55.360> a<00:05:55.389> different<00:05:55.780> head<00:05:55.930> level<00:05:56.349> but<00:05:57.190> mix<00:05:57.490> it

00:05:57.659 --> 00:05:57.669 
give a different head level but mix it

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:00.300 
give a different head level but mix it
up<00:05:57.789> and<00:05:58.060> I'm<00:05:58.990> really<00:05:59.530> focusing<00:06:00.009> on<00:06:00.159> not

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
up and I'm really focusing on not

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.499 
up and I'm really focusing on not
getting<00:06:00.520> picked<00:06:00.849> off<00:06:00.940> because<00:06:01.270> that's<00:06:01.419> a

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:01.509 
getting picked off because that's a

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:04.409 
getting picked off because that's a
pretty<00:06:01.659> gross<00:06:01.900> spot<00:06:02.169> so<00:06:02.830> the<00:06:03.190> third<00:06:03.460> up<00:06:04.120> top

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:04.419 
pretty gross spot so the third up top

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:06.300 
pretty gross spot so the third up top
spot<00:06:04.750> this<00:06:05.259> is<00:06:05.409> actually<00:06:05.740> another<00:06:05.889> spot<00:06:06.190> you

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310 
spot this is actually another spot you

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.550 
spot this is actually another spot you
can<00:06:06.520> get<00:06:06.669> breached<00:06:06.880> from<00:06:07.060> right<00:06:07.240> here<00:06:07.560> it's

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 
can get breached from right here it's

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.379 
can get breached from right here it's
not<00:06:08.860> a<00:06:08.889> bad<00:06:09.130> idea<00:06:09.159> to<00:06:09.460> take<00:06:09.729> a<00:06:09.759> peek<00:06:10.060> up<00:06:10.210> there

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:10.389 
not a bad idea to take a peek up there

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:12.300 
not a bad idea to take a peek up there
as<00:06:10.599> well<00:06:10.900> but<00:06:11.440> of<00:06:11.530> course<00:06:11.560> if<00:06:11.919> you're<00:06:12.070> getting

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.410 
to three variant give it a little

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:42.620 
to three variant give it a little
variance<00:06:40.890> it's<00:06:41.100> not<00:06:41.250> three<00:06:41.610> every<00:06:41.850> time<00:06:42.060> you

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:42.630 
variance it's not three every time you

can get away with five at closer ranges
you<00:06:44.520> can't<00:06:44.700> get<00:06:44.820> away<00:06:44.880> with<00:06:45.240> six<00:06:45.480> or<00:06:45.600> seven<00:06:45.960> if

you can't get away with six or seven if

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.410 
you can't get away with six or seven if
they're<00:06:46.740> point-blank<00:06:47.100> and<00:06:47.370> get<00:06:47.490> away<00:06:47.550> 10<00:06:47.970> 12

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:48.420

they're point-blank and get away 10 12
15<00:06:48.620> so<00:06:49.620> learn<00:06:50.190> the<00:06:50.370> weapon<00:06:50.730> and<00:06:50.910> master<00:06:51.600> the

15 so learn the weapon and master the

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.210 
15 so learn the weapon and master the
weapon<00:06:52.020> and<00:06:52.200> that's<00:06:52.500> kind<00:06:52.770> of<00:06:52.860> my<00:06:52.980> thought

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:53.220 
weapon and that's kind of my thought

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.190 
weapon and that's kind of my thought
process<00:06:53.730> here<00:06:53.760> that's<00:06:54.480> why<00:06:54.660> I'm<00:06:54.810> only<00:06:54.960> using

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:55.200 
process here that's why I'm only using

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.260 
process here that's why I'm only using
two<00:06:55.440> kits<00:06:55.830> competitively<00:06:56.430> because<00:06:57.000> they<00:06:57.120> can

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270 
two kits competitively because they can
