00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 I greet you my sport I am glad 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.670
 am simon your muscle maker theme in 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.340
 this video is the fiber and 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.750
 how much dietary fiber are necessary 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.980
 and above all, I want you like this 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.660
 give a little insight we have 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.009
 just made something delicious here 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.990
 namely a fiber today 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.970
 dessert the video that will be tomorrow 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.170
 or the day after tomorrow and therefore have 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.640
 I thought we were talking first 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.400
 exactly about this important topic 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.080
 about 30 grams of fiber should be 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.090
 take in the day 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.590
 many people take too little 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.500
 fiber to yourself and the whole 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.730
 was about the national consumption study 2 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.430
 detected 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.989
 according to the dge of the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.940
 german society for nutrition as 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.379
 optimally where the halt also say 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.610
 at least 30 grams 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.010
 there are, for example, the 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.680
 Harvard University from different US 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.780
 the indication should be at least 25 grams 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.030
 Overall, we can say that in Europe 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.899
 already eat more fiber than the 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.370
 American 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.140
 Fiber is included in 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.059
 natural form saw here in china 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.649
 otherwise, of course, there are as well 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.899
 food supplement here for 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.850
 There is an example of optimum nutrition 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.290
 Also here in the muscle maker shop here 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.479
 are different sources of fiber 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.920
 in there if you have a problem with it 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.330
 to eat fiber 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.890
 I would suggest we just look 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.479
 let's just go in here like sarah 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.689
 do and I'll tell you there 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.450
 little informative on the topic 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:20.040
 Dietary fiber comes 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.170
 mostly in different plant 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.689
 food forms are mostly 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.189
 polysaccharides, for example, here in fruit 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.100
 which are included but also in 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.140
 vegetable legumes and so on and on 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.600
 Of course you also see her in the 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.979
 thrifty here are very many 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.810
 ballaststoffe I look at times included 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.640
 shortly after or you can have a look 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.070
 You see her as well as many 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.540
 So fiber is included 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.670
 you are extremely high 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.189
 always high fiber content also still 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.600
 sometimes very interesting in small 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.460
 quantities of fiber are also found in 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.619
 animal products or for example 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.070
 in cuba and social determine and so 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.899
 a stuff 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.850
 But I think you should definitely 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.469
 Be careful that you are in the diet 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.810
 just these fibers in 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.340
 sufficient measure leads to just 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.960
 It can always happen at the beginning 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.790
 that is then to any flatus 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.950
 or something comes just when you have one 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.330
 low- fiber diet has sarahs 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.099
 right now we're doing that 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.960
 again as a video here his 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.360
 prepare delicious desserts 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.100
 just together and indeed already 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.200
 then it glows quite differently than 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.820
 if you have the here in natural condition 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.740
 just has a bit of almond milk 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.210
 substances then tilts the whole thing yes 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.980
 I'm curious if our guests 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.050
 therefore at the barbecue party any 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.640
 get problems from the fiber 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.350
 just who is not used to it can 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.540
 quite get dammer flatulence 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.910
 By the way, fiber is carbohydrate 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.460
 polymers with three so at least three 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.080
 or more units in the small intestine 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.390
 not metabolized so not 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.920
 digested will not be absorbed 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.600
 Of course there are different ones 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.310
 Fiber is here for example 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.200
 six or seven different ones 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.420
 Contain fiber sources See you 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.490
 here again as I said so what can 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.960
 one is currently supplementing in the usa 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.910
 You are happy to do something like that 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.320
 from an American company but it 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.610
 is ultimately not necessary if 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.320
 you can do it through nutrition 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.730
 enough fiber to be 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.320
 to take 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.910
 you definitely see how you look at that 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.070
 whole can also make delicious 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.980
 So, always be honest 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.270
 30 grams of fiber a day are whole 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.070
 especially important not only for the 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.440
 digestion but also to 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.510
 Preventing coronary heart disease 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.980
 and various other things there are 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.720
 meanwhile many interesting ones 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.640
 The studies also influence the important ones 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.500
 of fiber on our diet 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.660
 I can gladly pack a few for you 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.760
 swell underneath this video the 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.350
 infobox purely otherwise I can still 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.390
 Give a good tip to fiber 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.610
 always drink plenty of it 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.380
 up to a hundred times their own 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.690
 Therefore, the weight of water binds 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.280
 always drink a lot but we should 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.080
 anyway, as an athlete , heed it 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.640
 Of course, there is so much tomorrow 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.470
 interesting video is looking forward to it 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.470
 see you all greetings your simon
