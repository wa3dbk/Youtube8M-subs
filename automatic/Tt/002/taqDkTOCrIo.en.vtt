 Today we have a meeting with your number 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.309
 7 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.849

 the path of any person is his life 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.110
 script calculate the number of life on the way 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:23.050
 very simple is a date of birth 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.390
 man namely the day month and year of his 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:29.189
 rotations roll a prime number from 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:35.680
 one to nine for example check born 1 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:39.729
 4 1970 we add 1 plus 4 plus 1 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.240
 plus 9 plus 7 will be 22 2 plus 2 will be 4 

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:45.670
 that is, we have 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:49.450
 number life on the way 4 what does 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:52.480
 number life on the way 4 foursome it 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:55.060
 general reliability is persistence this 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.580
 hard work and naturally this these 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.850
 qualities distinguish people with number life 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:04.150
 on the way 4 you know about 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.380
 the fact is that people from the mkii life 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.960
 on the way and 4 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.930
 came not just like that into this life but it 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.110
 many of them face the challenge 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.880
 control 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:17.470
 not just for example 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.510
 enterprises for their business or 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.090
 occupation for not occupying high 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.180
 government positions 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.420
 but for some the main task is to become 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.960
 tom to govern the state and 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.780
 many of them 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:36.760
 they are the salt of the earth 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:39.070
 they determine the lives of people on earth and 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.050
 If these people did not have that many of 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.990
 tops we would not have reached 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:48.540
 Here are these people garlic life path 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:51.190
 4 except that these people are hardworking 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.500
 have very by the way strong physical 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:57.000
 endurance and strong and health 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.340
 they are ambitious and 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.840
 are constantly focused on success and for 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:08.880
 it's very important for them to have it all 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:12.000
 achieved by proven methods 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:16.050
 step bye step and that is slowly but 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.010
 reliably but of them succeed for 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.790
 score 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:24.260
 very long time but they 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:26.310
 stocking up on this patience and aggressively 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.319
 gradually the answer is moving in this 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:36.030
 direction people number life path 4 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:38.400
 very careful they do not track 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.860
 only these kids who don't but 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.319
 are very strong administrators 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.680
 and leaders and for them is very important 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:50.150
 so that these goals and objectives are not 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.299
 set replenished in accordance with 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.540
 accepted 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:57.889
 they use the solution very much 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.269
 strongly consultants and not always 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:02.639
 I insist only on the decision which 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:05.220
 did not accept often compromise 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:08.280
 the main thing is that common tasks are 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.650
 set solved correctly very 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.780
 takes your privacy seriously 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.510
 they have the choice of a marriage partner 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.170
 strategic reason why 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.019
 that not only the quality of a person is important 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.209
 which you can rely on but interesting 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.800
 and things it concerns sexual 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.580
 component 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.380
 but in the end most of them 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.770
 acquire or get a squirrel yourself 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.740
 life partners if it's a man then 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:42.320
 weak tender woman who is ready 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:45.930
 obey and strongly personality and very 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.720
 clearly adhere to the position which 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.390
 laid down as family values ​​because 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.700
 that children and family for people number life 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.360
 on the way are of strategic importance and 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:00.330
 implementation in the family is very important to them 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.760
 The main thing that was reliable rear if 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.650
 woman number life but ways 4 then she 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.140
 also very strict choice 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.040
 partner is desirable that their views 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.130
 matched 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.680
 why because it is very important not to 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:17.370
 there were disputes by the way people number of life 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:20.130
 on the way 4 is very hot-tempered and they can 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.480
 in hot heat of the moment to burn very much 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:26.460
 what then will regret but the fact itself 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:30.270
 will happen this applies as workers 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:33.180
 moments like business like participation 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.570
 state leadership and family 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.820
 life so if you work cheeks 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.040
 the number of life on the way 4 remember that 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.300
 getting them out of yourself is highly undesirable 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:47.069
 however their wisdom and 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:50.220
 dedication and desire to make peace 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:53.220
 better he deserve not only respect 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.930
 and and worship and most importantly it 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.659
 allows those who work under their 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.039
 start to achieve success too 

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:00.060
 selective attitude to people bonfire 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:02.129
 recruitment 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.310
 very tough if you failed 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:07.849
 the task will come those who can do this 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.979
 the task to perform this position is very 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:16.289
 head of life number of the way 4 they 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:18.960
 very clearly build their teams 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:23.250
 there must be a rigid vertical therefore 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:25.909
 if you are by nature tea which is prone to 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:30.659
 change and you don't like 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:32.460
 hard work schedule then this is chika number 

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:35.779
 life on path 4 is not your head 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:39.419
 believe me it will be very difficult therefore 

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:42.300
 let's just be glad that there are 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:46.310
 people and we can learn from them i wish 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.310
 Good luck to everyone and see you soon
