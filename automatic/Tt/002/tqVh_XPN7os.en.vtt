00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.390
 have it one hundred percent 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.680
 no university occasion we have gone from 22 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.420
 we trust that in 2010 he will be 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.840
 35 36 where we have advanced the most is 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.700
 in technological and vocational technical education 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.340
 we have passed one million 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.510
 one hundred thousand children per year 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.710
 in that formation to shell millions of Colombians this year with great support 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.180
 virtual training 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.180
 and doing all the tests of tolosa quality support 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.390
 we have come to the conclusion that these coverages are the most effective factor 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.530
 retention 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.190
 so that childhood and youth one are linked to criminality 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.069
 problem of training encourage tilke against both the region 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.479
 of juvenile crime and the world 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:18.759
 have there 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:22.069
 the principality 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.959
 that levitates 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.989
 Among the factors missing a lot 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.989
 we still have many difficulties in schools 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.339
 many 

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:36.449
 about student population 

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:38.599
 we have advanced in connectivity 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.299
 but we still have rural areas where 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:43.209
 the connectivity is very bad 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.589
 one to one arrives 

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:47.959
 we are have one 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.729
 great advance 

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:53.509
 in very childish 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:55.749
 we have gone from 

00:02:55.749 --> 00:03:00.069
 support three million 300 thousand children are now supporting 10 million 

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:03.809
 but we're missing millions of children 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:07.889
 two million children we have to reach the 11 million children in the 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:11.289
 child nutrition programs 

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:15.009
 after having the certainty of the can have your companions in front 

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:20.909
 d these witnesses so important that Colombia your homeland that loves you and that 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:21.959
 admire 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.449
 notio make shakira look bad 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:26.569
 in this endeavor 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.969
 yesterday a very important discussion here on the causes of the crisis and 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:33.909
 the consequences of the crisis 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:36.169
 so as not to repeat it 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:38.979
 and if it simply 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:41.639
 the children and the poor 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.639
 they are not guilty of the causes of this crisis 

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:49.569
 that's why we can not charge them the bill for this crisis 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.579
 your country chac irán 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.109
 will do all the efforts 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.109
 so that social programs and childhood programs 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:04.049
 in this crisis keep advancing 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.399
 because what is indicated is to protect the weakest 

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:10.379
 in times of greatest risk 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:13.760
 The most vulnerable are the most vulnerable 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.549
 at this moment it's the poor sectors and the children 

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:20.590
 and at the time of 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.249
 in which to increase 

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:25.249
 the difficulty in taking risks is when you have to 

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:26.599
 move along 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.189
 move along 

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:29.949
 in protection 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.340
 we have hour after hour 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.210
 in the massive reduction for children under five 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.559
 we aspire that at the end of the coming year with the help of God 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:44.050
 You can find 400 thousand poor children in your country 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.980
 that or are receiving nutrition where we have advanced a lot but that you can 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:50.360
 find also 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.639
 in massive programs 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.590
 of early childhood education 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.240
 when our government expressed president pastrana there were five for a 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.520
 program families in action 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.520
 I had motorcycle feel 20 thousand families in an experimental program 

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:07.749
 we turn it into a permanent program 

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:10.749
 today we have million seven hundred thousand families in action 

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:15.379
 with the help of God next year will be 3 million some tell me not 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:17.430
 advance so much that we are in crisis 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.889
 and there is no way to tell resources and we have said for children 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:23.610
 you have to find them 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.939
 They are the poorest family in the country 

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:28.600
 that are receiving a subsidy support 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.439
 to ensure nutrition education 

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:34.439
 I stress health in their little children 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:38.689
 we have traced non-distributive subsidies 

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:42.180
 like the gasoline face subsidy 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.529
 to 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:47.349
 finance supports that if they are distributive that can improve it 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.089
 structure in income equity 

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:55.109
 as you see the support to the poorest families to guarantee the education of 

00:05:55.109 --> 00:05:56.529
 their children 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:57.779
 for what 

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:59.469
 those families 

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:03.189
 Do not be condemned to your children to be poor so that through the 

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:06.929
 education can open the doors to social advancement 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:10.480
 that are the essence of democracy a final point 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.879
 the theme the drug 

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:16.369
 Colombia 

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:18.669
 has foot the tests 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:22.110
 that the permissiveness of drug use 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.470
 is a way of linking children of adolescents and young people to the 

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.449
 criminality 

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:31.970
 the world has proposed the debate that in my opinion does not touch 

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:35.909
 debate that is proposed is to study legalize the drug 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.889
 the government of colombia we think 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:40.960
 which is legalized 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.289
 perversely legalized in the most delicate phase that is the consumption 

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:49.319
 and that is inducing little children and young people as we see it 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:53.490
 in many sectors of Colombia to criminality 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.259
 that's why we're asking you 

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:59.499
 the world make a debate on the subject 

00:06:59.499 --> 00:07:00.899
 and that 

00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:04.439
 we sanction criminal and we will be as an accompanying policy 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.589
 to apprehension in rehabilitation 

00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:09.729
 the consumption of the drug 

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:13.110
 it can not be that while we have extradited nine hundred people 

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:16.529
 this year mos mosh 

00:07:16.529 --> 00:07:19.529
 one hundred thousand hectares manually with a great cost in lives 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.869
 we fumigate 130 thousand hectares of drug 

00:07:23.869 --> 00:07:27.079
 every day we are in the fight against corruption that understand 

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:28.849
 drug trafficking 

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:32.000
 it can not be that when in the last three years 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.289
 in Colombia, 10 thousand assets have been confiscated 

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:36.849
 of illicit wealth 

00:07:36.849 --> 00:07:40.089
 we have permissiveness in drug use 

00:07:40.089 --> 00:07:41.770
 I just wanted 

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.919
 make that reflection 

00:07:44.919 --> 00:07:47.990
 congratulate you to say in the presence of this one 

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:51.899

00:07:51.899 --> 00:07:53.389
 the heads of state 

00:07:53.389 --> 00:07:56.369
 that we Colombians are very proud of you 

00:07:56.369 --> 00:07:59.550
 and that we're going to honor that with facts 

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:02.779
 so that you feel supported in your country thank you very much 

00:08:10.679 --> 00:08:12.319
