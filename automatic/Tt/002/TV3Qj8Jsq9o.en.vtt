00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.690 
full-on so meaning not just sighs
specific<00:01:47.359> geometry<00:01:47.619> but<00:01:48.619> and<00:01:49.100> not<00:01:49.429> just

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
specific geometry but and not just

out any contamination then this
particular<00:02:36.069> bike<00:02:36.609> we<00:02:37.030> made<00:02:37.269> for<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:37.569> specific

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
particular bike we made for a specific

particular bike we made for a specific
clients<00:02:38.680> who<00:02:39.040> very<00:02:39.700> lightweight<00:02:39.969> clients<00:02:40.829> who

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
clients who very lightweight clients who

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.000 
clients who very lightweight clients who
was<00:02:42.010> looking<00:02:42.340> for<00:02:42.609> a<00:02:43.420> little<00:02:43.840> more<00:02:44.010> compliance

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
was looking for a little more compliance

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.789 
was looking for a little more compliance
almost<00:02:45.639> a<00:02:45.790> little<00:02:46.030> bit<00:02:46.120> of<00:02:46.239> flex<00:02:46.510> so<00:02:47.200> this<00:02:47.560> is<00:02:47.769> a

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
almost a little bit of flex so this is a

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.429 
almost a little bit of flex so this is a
prototype<00:02:48.189> for<00:02:48.519> us<00:02:48.939> if<00:02:49.150> you<00:02:49.269> will<00:02:49.480> but<00:02:50.079> we<00:02:50.230> used

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:50.439 
prototype for us if you will but we used

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:53.250 
prototype for us if you will but we used
five-eighths<00:02:51.040> inch<00:02:51.400> chain<00:02:52.269> stays<00:02:52.629> so<00:02:53.230> a

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
five-eighths inch chain stays so a

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.409 
five-eighths inch chain stays so a
little<00:02:53.439> bit<00:02:53.590> thinner<00:02:53.919> and<00:02:54.310> you<00:02:54.730> can<00:02:54.909> see<00:02:55.180> we

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:55.419 
little bit thinner and you can see we

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:58.349 
little bit thinner and you can see we
braced<00:02:55.780> up<00:02:56.109> on<00:02:56.379> the<00:02:56.560> discs<00:02:56.859> side<00:02:57.069> we<00:02:57.459> braced<00:02:58.090> up

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
braced up on the discs side we braced up

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:01.979 
braced up on the discs side we braced up
the<00:02:59.099> the<00:03:00.099> chainstays<00:03:00.609> and<00:03:00.909> it's<00:03:01.030> all<00:03:01.329> all

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
the the chainstays and it's all all

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.899 
the the chainstays and it's all all
about<00:03:02.469> getting<00:03:02.739> that<00:03:03.040> compliance<00:03:03.579> in<00:03:03.790> that

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:03.909 
about getting that compliance in that

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:06.089 
about getting that compliance in that
feel<00:03:04.180> right<00:03:04.689> then<00:03:04.959> we'll<00:03:05.139> do<00:03:05.349> little<00:03:05.650> cosmetic

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
feel right then we'll do little cosmetic

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.189 
feel right then we'll do little cosmetic
things<00:03:06.519> that<00:03:06.909> I<00:03:06.939> also<00:03:07.150> have<00:03:07.419> functioned<00:03:07.900> the

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:08.199 
things that I also have functioned the

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:11.099 
things that I also have functioned the
seed<00:03:08.469> staybridge<00:03:09.040> in<00:03:09.459> titanium<00:03:09.969> is<00:03:10.359> curved<00:03:10.840> as

seed staybridge in titanium is curved as

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.879 
seed staybridge in titanium is curved as
you<00:03:11.769> can<00:03:11.919> tell<00:03:11.980> it's<00:03:12.849> a<00:03:13.030> Kurd<00:03:13.329> seats<00:03:13.719> a<00:03:14.019> bridge

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:14.889 
you can tell it's a Kurd seats a bridge

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:17.300 
you can tell it's a Kurd seats a bridge
but<00:03:15.669> it's<00:03:15.819> that<00:03:16.090> level<00:03:16.449> of<00:03:16.629> customization

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
but it's that level of customization

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.580 
but it's that level of customization
from<00:03:18.310> a<00:03:18.400> paint<00:03:18.669> perspective<00:03:19.449> will<00:03:20.260> do
