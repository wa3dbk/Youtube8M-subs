 wonderful sight of the watery 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.720

 around in this wonderful tears heart 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.320
 to be able to show is a bit 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.570
 contradictory that one so a bit 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.850

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.300

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.950

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.620
 march you have almost 20 days ago 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.230
 nothing seen from the plant and now 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.199
 she is already 40 centimeters high and 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.750
 starts to bloom 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:03.949
 the watery heart botanical the central 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.380
 spectaris is one of the most beautiful 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:10.159
 springtime blooms from an onion 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.080
 or come from the tuber 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.150
 they are now blooming about three 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.580
 for weeks to depending on yes we are 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.130
 This year is an early middle of March 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.080
 until mid- april 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.810
 slowly back again pulls back 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.700
 in the ground and from june actually 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.620
 no longer available so you can see 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.230
 Here too it is between the bushes 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.360
 we planted to the left and right of me 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:37.180
 have another down here, for example 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.540
 then stagnate in the later yes the 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.550
 take over here in the beet if the 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.710
 the watery heart has withdrawn 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.810
 how many years can you get 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.800
 also gets used to strange things and why 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.580
 the hearts are falling 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.630
 they are long-time companions of the long 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.280
 heart-watering 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.350
 They get a little bit more each year 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.570
 wide one sees I have a big one 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.520
 plant planted that was a three 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.370
 liter pot last year and you see 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.860
 she has already become pretty wide 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.840
 It should become wider every year 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.630
 maybe after five-six-seven 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.610
 years of digging in the autumn dig up 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.040
 pierce with the spade and you have 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.480
 then two or three plant that 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.570
 it rejuvenates the plants, too 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.100
 vital well so in my opinion, too 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.630
 many heart drives are there 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.760
 maybe a bit too much 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.890
 that is maybe possible 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.010
 you too, there is also a white bloody 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.840
 maybe you should go white 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.520
 Watery heart may have got up 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.080
 red if you share the neighbor 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.480
 Give away and a white one for that 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.860
 plant it 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.010
 thanks maierhofer for 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:45.510

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.510
