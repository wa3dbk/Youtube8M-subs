00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
this out it's a lot of fun to make this

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:53.290 
this out it's a lot of fun to make this
first<00:00:50.329> one<00:00:50.600> I've<00:00:51.020> made<00:00:51.910> wanted<00:00:52.910> to<00:00:52.969> make<00:00:53.120> one

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
first one I've made wanted to make one

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.510 
first one I've made wanted to make one
for<00:00:53.510> awhile<00:00:53.629> but<00:00:54.050> if<00:00:54.440> I<00:00:54.590> like<00:00:54.770> folding<00:00:55.340> the

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
for awhile but if I like folding the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.849 
for awhile but if I like folding the
brass<00:00:55.899> for<00:00:56.899> the<00:00:56.960> handle<00:00:57.379> might<00:00:57.649> be

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
brass for the handle might be

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:00.430 
brass for the handle might be
complicated<00:00:58.760> or<00:00:58.879> something<00:00:59.359> and<00:00:59.600> just<00:01:00.289> kind

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
complicated or something and just kind

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.170 
complicated or something and just kind
of<00:01:00.469> found<00:01:00.590> a<00:01:00.769> like<00:01:01.219> a<00:01:01.250> little<00:01:01.579> low-tech<00:01:01.760> way

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
of found a like a little low-tech way

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.359 
of found a like a little low-tech way
that<00:01:02.570> you<00:01:03.050> know<00:01:03.170> I<00:01:03.379> did<00:01:03.710> that<00:01:03.890> and<00:01:04.070> turn<00:01:04.250> out

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
that you know I did that and turn out

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.719 
that you know I did that and turn out
turned<00:01:05.000> out<00:01:05.089> pretty<00:01:05.210> good<00:01:05.420> so<00:01:05.479> check<00:01:06.200> it<00:01:06.289> out

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
turned out pretty good so check it out

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.770 
turned out pretty good so check it out
so<00:01:07.729> as<00:01:07.820> you<00:01:07.910> can<00:01:08.030> see<00:01:08.179> it's<00:01:08.300> basically<00:01:08.420> a

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
so as you can see it's basically a

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.820 
so as you can see it's basically a
friction<00:01:09.259> folder<00:01:09.649> and<00:01:10.869> the<00:01:11.869> blade<00:01:12.229> steel<00:01:12.500> is

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
friction folder and the blade steel is

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.200 
friction folder and the blade steel is
1095<00:01:13.460> and<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:16.070> handles<00:01:16.369> just<00:01:16.490> brass<00:01:16.789> I<00:01:17.060> had<00:01:17.149> a

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
1095 and the handles just brass I had a

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.510 
1095 and the handles just brass I had a
sheet<00:01:17.479> that<00:01:17.810> cut<00:01:18.410> a<00:01:18.440> piece<00:01:18.619> out<00:01:18.830> of<00:01:18.890> and<00:01:19.190> fold

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
sheet that cut a piece out of and fold

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.840 
sheet that cut a piece out of and fold
it<00:01:19.729> over<00:01:20.410> so<00:01:21.410> you<00:01:21.890> can<00:01:21.950> see<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.280> handles<00:01:22.579> one

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
it over so you can see the handles one

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.730 
it over so you can see the handles one
piece<00:01:23.240> and<00:01:23.630> then<00:01:24.560> I<00:01:24.920> had<00:01:25.790> a<00:01:25.850> couple<00:01:26.150> wrinkles

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
piece and then I had a couple wrinkles

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.109 
piece and then I had a couple wrinkles
to<00:01:27.740> this<00:01:27.829> one<00:01:28.009> I<00:01:28.040> like<00:01:28.250> the<00:01:28.369> blade<00:01:28.610> shape<00:01:28.880> of

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
to this one I like the blade shape of

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:30.819 
to this one I like the blade shape of
this<00:01:29.299> it's<00:01:29.540> not<00:01:29.780> I<00:01:29.990> guess<00:01:30.290> super<00:01:30.650> traditional

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
this it's not I guess super traditional

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.460 
this it's not I guess super traditional
in<00:01:31.430> any<00:01:31.610> way<00:01:31.820> but<00:01:31.930> really<00:01:32.930> like<00:01:33.110> how<00:01:33.320> this

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
in any way but really like how this

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:40.179 
in any way but really like how this
blade<00:01:33.740> looks<00:01:34.540> and<00:01:38.799> yeah

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
blade looks and yeah

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.310 
blade looks and yeah
you<00:01:40.340> can<00:01:40.490> see<00:01:40.700> there's<00:01:41.000> a<00:01:41.119> tamper<00:01:41.899> line<00:01:42.049> in<00:01:42.229> the

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
you can see there's a tamper line in the

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.929 
you can see there's a tamper line in the
blade<00:01:44.770> my<00:01:45.770> home<00:01:46.040> own<00:01:46.189> is<00:01:46.369> actually<00:01:46.700> a<00:01:46.729> little

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
blade my home own is actually a little

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.300 
blade my home own is actually a little
low<00:01:47.210> on<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.659> blade<00:01:47.899> but<00:01:48.170> it's<00:01:48.320> still<00:01:48.590> you<00:01:49.280> know

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
low on the blade but it's still you know

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.630 
low on the blade but it's still you know
pretty<00:01:49.939> nice<00:01:52.540> so<00:01:53.540> I<00:01:54.409> did<00:01:54.920> add<00:01:55.130> a<00:01:55.159> couple<00:01:55.460> of

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
pretty nice so I did add a couple of

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.020 
pretty nice so I did add a couple of
things<00:01:55.880> that<00:01:56.119> are<00:01:56.299> maybe<00:01:56.840> not<00:01:57.049> so<00:01:58.030> traditional

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
things that are maybe not so traditional

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.300 
things that are maybe not so traditional
but<00:01:59.810> I<00:02:00.020> think<00:02:00.380> helped<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.770> function<00:02:01.130> of<00:02:01.250> the

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
but I think helped the function of the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.260 
but I think helped the function of the
knife<00:02:01.460> I<00:02:01.759> put<00:02:02.000> a<00:02:02.030> stop<00:02:02.390> pin<00:02:02.719> for<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.200> blade<00:02:03.409> so

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
knife I put a stop pin for the blade so

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.949 
knife I put a stop pin for the blade so
that<00:02:05.270> when<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.539> blade<00:02:05.719> closes<00:02:07.690> the<00:02:08.690> sharp

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
that when the blade closes the sharp

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.550 
that when the blade closes the sharp
part<00:02:09.170> doesn't<00:02:09.470> hit<00:02:09.649> in<00:02:09.769> the<00:02:09.860> bottom<00:02:10.250> you<00:02:10.789> know

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
part doesn't hit in the bottom you know

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.690 
part doesn't hit in the bottom you know
so<00:02:12.560> you<00:02:12.650> can<00:02:12.769> see<00:02:12.890> that's<00:02:13.100> the<00:02:13.250> little<00:02:13.400> pin

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
so you can see that's the little pin

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.990 
so you can see that's the little pin
right<00:02:13.730> there<00:02:14.299> and<00:02:15.400> yep<00:02:16.400> I<00:02:16.549> just<00:02:16.760> think<00:02:16.910> that

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
right there and yep I just think that

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.300 
right there and yep I just think that
keeps<00:02:17.239> the<00:02:18.109> blade<00:02:18.260> from<00:02:18.590> getting<00:02:18.890> dulled<00:02:19.160> by

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
keeps the blade from getting dulled by

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.940 
keeps the blade from getting dulled by
the<00:02:19.459> handle
