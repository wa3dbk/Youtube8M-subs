reason<00:01:24.990> there's<00:01:25.770> about<00:01:25.890> 5<00:01:26.190> trillion<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.789> here

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
reason there's about 5 trillion in here

reason there's about 5 trillion in here
I<00:01:26.940> don't<00:01:27.119> know<00:01:27.179> a<00:01:27.390> lot<00:01:27.630> but<00:01:28.819> so<00:01:29.819> then<00:01:29.940> you<00:01:30.030> have

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
I don't know a lot but so then you have

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:33.800 
I don't know a lot but so then you have
been<00:01:30.330> here<00:01:30.860> after<00:01:31.860> or<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:31.979> week<00:01:32.220> or<00:01:32.459> so<00:01:32.810> two

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
been here after or a week or so two

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.290 
been here after or a week or so two
weeks<00:01:34.050> maybe<00:01:34.580> you<00:01:35.580> can<00:01:35.729> grab<00:01:35.910> some<00:01:36.149> of<00:01:36.179> the

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
weeks maybe you can grab some of the

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.400 
weeks maybe you can grab some of the
bedding<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.630> then<00:01:36.780> put<00:01:36.959> it<00:01:37.050> like<00:01:37.140> into<00:01:37.289> a

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
bedding and then put it like into a

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.260 
bedding and then put it like into a
piece<00:01:37.679> of<00:01:37.800> plastic<00:01:38.280> glass<00:01:38.520> or<00:01:38.789> something<00:01:38.970> and

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
piece of plastic glass or something and

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.969 
piece of plastic glass or something and
you<00:01:39.750> can<00:01:39.869> once<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.319> start<00:01:40.590> seeing<00:01:40.860> little

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
you can once you start seeing little

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.460 
you can once you start seeing little
microscopic<00:01:41.789> mealworms<00:01:42.420> it's<00:01:43.050> time<00:01:43.319> to

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
microscopic mealworms it's time to

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.630 
microscopic mealworms it's time to
switch<00:01:43.679> them<00:01:43.890> off<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.220> bedding<00:01:44.429> because

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
switch them off this bedding because

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.520 
switch them off this bedding because
that<00:01:44.880> means<00:01:45.060> there's<00:01:45.330> baby<00:01:45.959> mealworms<00:01:46.410> in

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
that means there's baby mealworms in

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.080 
that means there's baby mealworms in
there<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:46.739> there's<00:01:46.860> also<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.190> lot<00:01:47.580> of<00:01:47.610> eggs<00:01:47.819> so

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
there and there's also a lot of eggs so

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.580 
there and there's also a lot of eggs so
what<00:01:48.179> we<00:01:48.330> do<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:49.140> we<00:01:49.229> take<00:01:49.349> these<00:01:49.530> little

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
what we do is we take these little

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.100 
what we do is we take these little
beetles<00:01:50.039> and<00:01:50.310> we<00:01:50.819> put<00:01:51.030> them<00:01:51.119> into<00:01:51.270> some<00:01:51.539> new

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
beetles and we put them into some new

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.139 
beetles and we put them into some new
bedding<00:01:52.319> and<00:01:53.039> we<00:01:53.099> take<00:01:53.399> all<00:01:53.610> this<00:01:53.789> bedding

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
bedding and we take all this bedding

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.820 
bedding and we take all this bedding
that<00:01:54.330> we<00:01:54.509> have<00:01:54.660> that<00:01:54.899> has<00:01:55.050> the<00:01:55.289> microscopic

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
that we have that has the microscopic

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
can you put it through a sifter pretty

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.120 
can you put it through a sifter pretty
easily<00:03:09.720> a<00:03:09.930> lot<00:03:10.140> about<00:03:10.260> people<00:03:10.620> will<00:03:10.739> keep<00:03:10.890> them

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
easily a lot about people will keep them

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.810 
easily a lot about people will keep them
on<00:03:12.320> oatmeal<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:13.560> big<00:03:13.739> chunks<00:03:14.250> of<00:03:14.340> oatmeal<00:03:14.580> and

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
on oatmeal the big chunks of oatmeal and

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.090 
on oatmeal the big chunks of oatmeal and
the<00:03:14.970> problem<00:03:15.239> with<00:03:15.330> that<00:03:15.360> is<00:03:15.630> it<00:03:16.530> doesn't<00:03:16.770> fall

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
the problem with that is it doesn't fall

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.770 
the problem with that is it doesn't fall
through<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.370> sifters<00:03:17.790> so<00:03:18.330> when<00:03:18.690> you're

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
through the sifters so when you're

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.949 
through the sifters so when you're
trying<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:19.020> scoop<00:03:19.260> out<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.770> poop<00:03:20.040> and

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
trying to scoop out the poop and

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.370 
trying to scoop out the poop and
probably<00:03:21.959> nonsense<00:03:22.739> you<00:03:22.980> can't<00:03:23.160> sift<00:03:23.970> it<00:03:24.150> so<00:03:24.959> I

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
probably nonsense you can't sift it so I

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.490 
probably nonsense you can't sift it so I
use<00:03:26.340> this<00:03:26.610> and<00:03:27.000> I<00:03:27.180> like<00:03:27.360> I<00:03:27.420> said<00:03:27.540> once<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:27.930> week<00:03:28.110> I

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
use this and I like I said once a week I

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.140 
use this and I like I said once a week I
will<00:03:29.010> get<00:03:29.160> my<00:03:29.250> sister<00:03:29.580> and<00:03:29.700> I'll<00:03:29.760> empty<00:03:30.000> this

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
will get my sister and I'll empty this

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.720 
will get my sister and I'll empty this
entire<00:03:30.450> bin<00:03:30.780> into<00:03:31.110> a<00:03:31.950> container<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:32.610> then

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
entire bin into a container and then

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.600 
entire bin into a container and then
I'll<00:03:32.910> sift<00:03:33.150> at<00:03:33.299> all<00:03:33.709> the<00:03:34.709> bigger<00:03:34.920> portions<00:03:35.489> of

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
I'll sift at all the bigger portions of

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:36.949 
I'll sift at all the bigger portions of
the<00:03:35.700> wheat<00:03:35.820> brand<00:03:36.239> that<00:03:36.299> haven't<00:03:36.600> been<00:03:36.660> eaten

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
the wheat brand that haven't been eaten

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
to use potatoes but for some reason here

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.830 
to use potatoes but for some reason here
the<00:04:23.340> potatoes<00:04:23.669> will<00:04:23.850> just<00:04:24.000> mold<00:04:24.270> I<00:04:24.540> don't<00:04:24.720> know

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840

these<00:04:25.110> carrots<00:04:25.850> work<00:04:26.850> fine<00:04:27.169> but<00:04:28.169> you<00:04:28.320> can<00:04:28.470> use

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
these carrots work fine but you can use

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.800 
these carrots work fine but you can use
potatoes<00:04:28.979> apples<00:04:29.280> you<00:04:30.090> know<00:04:30.210> lettuce

up<00:04:36.630> and<00:04:37.070> what<00:04:38.070> sucks<00:04:38.310> is<00:04:38.490> when<00:04:38.640> you<00:04:38.729> use<00:04:38.849> this

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:20.880 
he's head banging the beetles will eat
the<00:05:19.760> brains<00:05:20.030> of<00:05:20.210> these<00:05:20.360> guys<00:05:20.510> these<00:05:20.660> guys<00:05:20.810> are

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
the brains of these guys these guys are

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.470 
the brains of these guys these guys are
defenseless<00:05:21.890> and<00:05:22.040> they<00:05:22.100> can't<00:05:22.280> move<00:05:22.460> so<00:05:22.730> the

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
defenseless and they can't move so the

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.910 
defenseless and they can't move so the
beetles<00:05:23.780> will<00:05:23.900> hatch<00:05:24.110> and<00:05:24.530> then<00:05:24.650> they'll<00:05:24.800> come

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:24.920 
beetles will hatch and then they'll come

over<00:05:24.950> and<00:05:25.220> eat<00:05:25.430> the<00:05:25.610> brains<00:05:25.850> out<00:05:26.000> and<00:05:26.180> kill<00:05:26.360> him

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:26.390 
over and eat the brains out and kill him

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
over and eat the brains out and kill him
they<00:05:26.570> turn<00:05:26.720> black

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
they turn black

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.560

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:29.570 
I put carrot in here I put some oats in

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:31.360 
I put carrot in here I put some oats in
here<00:05:29.810> and<00:05:30.050> for<00:05:30.350> some<00:05:30.380> reason<00:05:30.830> they<00:05:30.950> decide

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
here and for some reason they decide

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.270 
here and for some reason they decide
that<00:05:31.400> beetle<00:05:32.180> brain<00:05:32.630> is<00:05:32.870> just<00:05:33.830> delicious

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
that beetle brain is just delicious

that beetle brain is just delicious
delicacy<00:05:35.030> and<00:05:35.180> they<00:05:35.270> won't<00:05:35.770> stop<00:05:36.770> eating<00:05:37.010> them

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
delicacy and they won't stop eating them

so<00:05:37.340> you<00:05:38.030> leave<00:05:38.210> the<00:05:38.390> beetle<00:05:38.660> in<00:05:38.720> your<00:05:38.840> for<00:05:38.960> too

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
so you leave the beetle in your for too

pupae<00:05:41.150> it<00:05:41.510> doesn't<00:05:41.750> really<00:05:41.840> bother<00:05:42.080> us

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
pupae it doesn't really bother us

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.960
