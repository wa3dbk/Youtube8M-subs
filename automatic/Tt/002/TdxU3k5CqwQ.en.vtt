the video I got emotional I was telling
up<00:02:06.930> not<00:02:07.860> because<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.310> was<00:02:08.610> almost<00:02:08.789> out<00:02:09.179> that

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
up not because I was almost out that

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.440 
up not because I was almost out that
path<00:02:09.720> but<00:02:10.709> because<00:02:11.400> there<00:02:11.670> are<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.120> many

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
path but because there are so many

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.229 
path but because there are so many
people<00:02:13.110> out<00:02:13.379> there<00:02:13.709> struggling<00:02:14.640> with

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
people out there struggling with

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.839 
people out there struggling with
depression<00:02:15.390> and<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.770> believe<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.459> depression

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
depression and I believe that depression

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.960 
depression and I believe that depression
is<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.510> disease<00:02:19.190> but<00:02:20.190> suicide<00:02:21.000> is<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.900> choice

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
is a disease but suicide is a choice

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.270 
is a disease but suicide is a choice
because<00:02:23.970> of<00:02:24.300> how<00:02:24.510> many<00:02:24.780> responses<00:02:25.050> there<00:02:26.040> were

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
because of how many responses there were

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.420 
because of how many responses there were
towards<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.180> ALS<00:02:27.870> ice<00:02:28.140> bucket<00:02:28.200> challenge<00:02:28.709> I

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
towards the ALS ice bucket challenge I

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.270 
towards the ALS ice bucket challenge I
also<00:02:30.209> believe<00:02:30.780> that<00:02:30.810> maybe<00:02:31.379> there<00:02:31.800> could<00:02:32.040> be<00:02:32.099> a

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
also believe that maybe there could be a

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.690 
also believe that maybe there could be a
way<00:02:32.580> for<00:02:32.970> us<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.930> join<00:02:34.290> together<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.920> support

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
way for us to join together and support

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.430
