00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
stops that you see that they've kept

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.650 
stops that you see that they've kept
that<00:02:27.220> continuity<00:02:27.700> throughout<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.269> symbol

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
that continuity throughout the symbol

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.839 
that continuity throughout the symbol
and<00:02:28.810> then<00:02:29.500> if<00:02:29.680> this<00:02:29.830> midpoint<00:02:30.099> down<00:02:30.610> to<00:02:30.760> the

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
and then if this midpoint down to the

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.150 
and then if this midpoint down to the
edge<00:02:30.970> you<00:02:31.299> got<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.900> pin<00:02:32.140> point<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.650> down<00:02:32.799> here

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
edge you got the pin point and down here

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.650 
edge you got the pin point and down here
it's<00:02:33.340> like<00:02:33.489> they<00:02:33.640> went<00:02:33.849> through<00:02:34.090> double<00:02:34.480> time

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
it's like they went through double time

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.630 
it's like they went through double time
to<00:02:34.780> make<00:02:34.930> sure<00:02:34.959> it<00:02:35.140> was<00:02:35.260> extra<00:02:35.620> thin<00:02:35.890> on<00:02:36.280> both

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
to make sure it was extra thin on both

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.890 
to make sure it was extra thin on both
the<00:02:36.819> 22<00:02:37.390> and<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:38.349> crash<00:02:39.209> now<00:02:40.209> just<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:40.870> show

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
the 22 and the crash now just to show

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.780 
the 22 and the crash now just to show
you<00:02:41.110> right<00:02:41.410> here<00:02:41.470> a<00:02:41.950> little<00:02:42.340> bit<00:02:42.519> sound

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
you right here a little bit sound

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.470 
you right here a little bit sound
quality<00:02:43.239> you<00:02:44.080> got<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.680> crash

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.460 

nice<00:02:49.480> impact<00:02:50.849> moderate<00:02:51.849> sustained<00:02:52.299> it<00:02:52.959> tapers

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
nice impact moderate sustained it tapers

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:14.170 
nice impact moderate sustained it tapers
out<00:02:53.620> nicely<00:02:53.950> then<00:02:54.670> you<00:02:54.790> got<00:02:54.909> the<00:02:55.060> ride

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.410 

so<00:03:14.720> as<00:03:15.140> you<00:03:15.230> can<00:03:15.349> see<00:03:15.590> you<00:03:16.250> have<00:03:16.280> three<00:03:17.000> tonal

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
so as you can see you have three tonal

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.750 
so as you can see you have three tonal
qualities<00:03:17.810> in<00:03:17.930> one<00:03:17.959> symbol<00:03:18.409> and<00:03:18.680> like<00:03:19.430> I<00:03:19.549> said

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
qualities in one symbol and like I said

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.179 
qualities in one symbol and like I said
this<00:03:20.299> is<00:03:20.540> supposed<00:03:20.870> to<00:03:20.930> be<00:03:21.049> crash<00:03:21.470> more<00:03:22.040> of<00:03:22.129> a

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:22.189 
this is supposed to be crash more of a

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:39.179 
this is supposed to be crash more of a
crash<00:03:22.489> ride<00:03:22.849> the<00:03:23.629> crash<00:03:23.930> itself

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:39.189 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:42.059 

and<00:03:40.189> the<00:03:40.459> sustain<00:03:40.819> just<00:03:41.030> goes<00:03:41.239> on<00:03:41.420> forever

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
and the sustain just goes on forever

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.559 
and the sustain just goes on forever
means<00:03:43.069> it's<00:03:44.060> gone

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
means it's gone

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.030 
means it's gone
even<00:03:45.260> though<00:03:45.319> you<00:03:45.379> might<00:03:45.560> not<00:03:45.620> hear<00:03:45.829> it<00:03:45.950> on<00:03:45.980> the

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
even though you might not hear it on the

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.509 
even though you might not hear it on the
mic<00:03:46.250> it's<00:03:46.849> still<00:03:47.120> going<00:03:47.390> so<00:03:48.310> looking<00:03:49.310> at<00:03:49.430> the

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
mic it's still going so looking at the

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.259 
mic it's still going so looking at the
hhx<00:03:50.150> Terry's<00:03:50.540> b20<00:03:51.379> bronze<00:03:51.650> from<00:03:52.129> Sabian<00:03:52.609> you

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
hhx Terry's b20 bronze from Sabian you

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.789 
hhx Terry's b20 bronze from Sabian you
have<00:03:53.510> again<00:03:54.700> innovation<00:03:55.700> at<00:03:55.849> its<00:03:55.970> finest
