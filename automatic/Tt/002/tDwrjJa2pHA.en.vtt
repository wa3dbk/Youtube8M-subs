00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:19.370 
shot some video last time I think was

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.340 
shot some video last time I think was
back<00:00:19.550> at<00:00:19.730> the<00:00:19.760> 50s<00:00:20.240> had<00:00:20.420> just<00:00:20.660> preceded<00:00:20.780> this

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
back at the 50s had just preceded this

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.580 
back at the 50s had just preceded this
and<00:00:22.420> did<00:00:23.420> not<00:00:23.450> have<00:00:23.779> the<00:00:23.869> wire<00:00:24.080> wheels<00:00:24.350> on<00:00:24.560> it

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
and did not have the wire wheels on it

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.290 
and did not have the wire wheels on it
then<00:00:24.890> so<00:00:25.190> figure<00:00:25.460> we<00:00:25.550> take<00:00:25.730> a<00:00:25.760> couple<00:00:26.000> of<00:00:26.090> pose

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
then so figure we take a couple of pose

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.150 
then so figure we take a couple of pose
and<00:00:26.600> just<00:00:26.720> show<00:00:26.869> you<00:00:26.930> how<00:00:27.050> the<00:00:27.110> old<00:00:27.290> girls<00:00:27.680> come

and just show you how the old girls come

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.460 
and just show you how the old girls come
alone<00:00:28.430> most<00:00:29.180> obvious<00:00:29.599> change<00:00:29.900> here<00:00:30.140> the<00:00:30.290> wire

and just in case everybody is wondering
those<00:02:08.379> are<00:02:08.679> real<00:02:08.950> wires<00:02:09.250> and<00:02:09.640> you<00:02:09.849> do<00:02:10.060> have<00:02:10.209> to

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
those are real wires and you do have to

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.030 
those are real wires and you do have to
actually<00:02:10.539> knock<00:02:11.230> them<00:02:11.410> off<00:02:11.590> using<00:02:11.950> the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
actually knock them off using the

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.380 
actually knock them off using the
knockoff<00:02:12.400> so<00:02:12.519> I've<00:02:12.610> got<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.819> let<00:02:12.970> hammer<00:02:13.239> in

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
knockoff so I've got to let hammer in

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.500 
knockoff so I've got to let hammer in
the<00:02:13.480> trunk<00:02:13.780> that<00:02:13.989> I<00:02:14.049> do<00:02:14.110> that<00:02:14.410> with<00:02:18.329> looks<00:02:19.329> like

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
the trunk that I do that with looks like

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.020 
the trunk that I do that with looks like
signaling<00:02:19.840> all<00:02:19.989> we<00:02:20.140> got<00:02:20.290> going<00:02:20.650> on<00:02:20.769> here
