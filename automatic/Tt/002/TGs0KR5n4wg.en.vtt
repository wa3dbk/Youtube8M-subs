right back in the game he still has some
production<00:00:21.960> here<00:00:22.260> but<00:00:23.250> his<00:00:23.369> main<00:00:23.490> entirely

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
production here but his main entirely

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.060 
production here but his main entirely
mind<00:00:24.269> out<00:00:24.449> so<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.720> honestly<00:00:25.470> if<00:00:25.560> he<00:00:25.650> loses<00:00:25.859> this

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
mind out so I honestly if he loses this

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.189 
mind out so I honestly if he loses this
nexus<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.580> would<00:00:26.670> only<00:00:26.849> hurt<00:00:27.000> as<00:00:27.869> far<00:00:28.170> as

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
nexus it would only hurt as far as

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.169 
nexus it would only hurt as far as
supply<00:00:28.500> goes<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.890> secondary<00:00:29.340> still

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
supply goes the secondary still

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.089 
supply goes the secondary still
producing<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.929> yeah<00:00:31.140> in<00:00:31.289> control<00:00:31.590> might<00:00:31.890> get

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
producing and yeah in control might get

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.340 
producing and yeah in control might get
back<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:32.399> this<00:00:33.000> if<00:00:33.180> he<00:00:33.270> can<00:00:33.390> somehow<00:00:33.630> meet<00:00:34.230> your

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
back in this if he can somehow meet your

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.510

even upgrades with his at this point and

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.770 
even upgrades with his at this point and
it<00:01:29.820> looks<00:01:30.000> like<00:01:30.090> he's<00:01:30.210> going<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.390> go<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.659> and

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
it looks like he's going to go in and

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.240 
it looks like he's going to go in and

try to take out some of these expansions
that<00:01:32.340> are<00:01:32.520> undefended<00:01:32.880> but<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.509> think<00:01:33.750> in

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
that are undefended but I think in

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.660 
that are undefended but I think in

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
going to be enough looks like the ultras

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.899 
going to be enough looks like the ultras
are<00:01:58.770> in<00:01:58.950> fact<00:01:59.100> going<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.340> be<00:01:59.399> able<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.610> take<00:01:59.759> out

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
in control does manage to keep that but

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.680 
in control does manage to keep that but
what<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:07.920> did<00:02:08.069> do<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.489> bought<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.940> g5

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
what that did do is that bought you a g5

what that did do is that bought you a g5
a<00:02:09.750> bit<00:02:09.989> of<00:02:10.080> time<00:02:10.259> I'm<00:02:10.560> surprising<00:02:11.039> control

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
a bit of time I'm surprising control

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.440 
a bit of time I'm surprising control
still<00:02:11.520> has<00:02:11.640> an<00:02:11.760> attack<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.150> southern

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
still has an attack the southern

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.490 
still has an attack the southern
expansion<00:02:12.810> perhaps<00:02:13.050> he<00:02:13.140> didn't

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
expansion perhaps he didn't

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.980 
expansion perhaps he didn't
see<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:13.940> this<00:02:14.940> entire<00:02:15.120> force<00:02:15.450> wiped<00:02:15.690> out<00:02:15.840> now

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
see it this entire force wiped out now

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.620

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
it out at two templar at the southern

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.980 
it out at two templar at the southern
expansion<00:02:23.460> so<00:02:23.610> that's<00:02:23.790> basically<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.840> I'm

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
expansion so that's basically and I'm

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:26.240 
expansion so that's basically and I'm
still<00:02:25.170> worried<00:02:25.380> about<00:02:25.410> these<00:02:25.680> overlords<00:02:26.100> here

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
still worried about these overlords here

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.740 
still worried about these overlords here
as<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.430> can<00:02:26.460> see<00:02:26.550> rien<00:02:26.940> controlling<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.570> in

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
as you can see rien controlling and in

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.630 
as you can see rien controlling and in
control<00:02:27.900> also<00:02:28.260> expanding<00:02:28.950> one<00:02:29.070> more<00:02:29.220> time<00:02:29.430> and

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
control also expanding one more time and

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.840 
control also expanding one more time and
has<00:02:30.120> basically<00:02:30.390> taken<00:02:30.510> over<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.959> entire<00:02:31.050> map

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
has basically taken over the entire map

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.890 
has basically taken over the entire map
and<00:02:32.850> we'll<00:02:33.000> see<00:02:33.090> what<00:02:33.209> g5<00:02:33.450> does<00:02:33.600> from<00:02:33.750> here

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
and we'll see what g5 does from here

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.970 
and we'll see what g5 does from here
looks<00:02:34.050> like<00:02:34.080> he<00:02:34.230> has<00:02:34.320> a<00:02:34.350> couple<00:02:34.440> more<00:02:34.650> corsair

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
looks like he has a couple more corsair

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.490 
looks like he has a couple more corsair
has<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.280> couple<00:02:35.459> more<00:02:35.610> Dark<00:02:35.820> Templar<00:02:35.910> now<00:02:36.500> has

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
has a couple more Dark Templar now has

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.680 
has a couple more Dark Templar now has
basically<00:02:38.040> yeah<00:02:38.430> has<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.760> decent<00:02:39.180> sized<00:02:39.450> force

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
basically yeah has a decent sized force

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.090 
basically yeah has a decent sized force
of<00:02:39.810> Coursera<00:02:40.140> decent<00:02:40.440> sized<00:02:40.560> force<00:02:40.800> of<00:02:40.920> Dark

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
of Coursera decent sized force of Dark

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.560 
of Coursera decent sized force of Dark
Templar<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:41.880> could<00:02:42.000> be<00:02:42.120> very<00:02:42.150> effective

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
Templar and it could be very effective

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.890 
Templar and it could be very effective
with<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:43.370> but<00:02:44.370> if<00:02:44.700> he<00:02:44.910> plays<00:02:45.120> his<00:02:45.150> cards<00:02:45.420> just

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
with that but if he plays his cards just

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.360 
with that but if he plays his cards just
right<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.350> we'll<00:02:46.530> see<00:02:46.709> if<00:02:46.770> he's<00:02:46.920> able<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.190> do

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
right and we'll see if he's able to do

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.250 
right and we'll see if he's able to do
that<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:47.700> but<00:02:48.360> in<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.510> meantime<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.840> lot<00:02:49.140> of

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
that and but in the meantime a lot of

pushing those old Phyllis in when he

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.960 
pushing those old Phyllis in when he
didn't<00:04:13.799> have<00:04:13.829> an<00:04:14.010> overlord<00:04:14.370> and<00:04:14.430> I<00:04:14.640> guess<00:04:14.790> that

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
didn't have an overlord and I guess that

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.420 
didn't have an overlord and I guess that
was<00:04:15.030> to<00:04:15.260> gonna<00:04:16.260> try<00:04:16.470> to<00:04:16.530> bring<00:04:16.859> them<00:04:17.010> in<00:04:17.190> delay

to come ahead in this match that was
some<00:04:24.390> brilliant<00:04:24.810> micromanagement

managed and managed to take out those
overlords<00:04:28.470> that<00:04:28.620> was<00:04:28.740> some<00:04:28.860> beautiful

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
overlords that was some beautiful

overlords that was some beautiful
micromanagement<00:04:30.080> staying<00:04:31.080> in<00:04:31.289> this<00:04:31.470> game<00:04:31.530> and

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
micromanagement staying in this game and

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:34.820 
micromanagement staying in this game and
at<00:04:32.069> that<00:04:32.340> Wow<00:04:32.729> no<00:04:33.600> flaw<00:04:33.870> to<00:04:33.900> in<00:04:34.319> control<00:04:34.680> on

at that Wow no flaw to in control on

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.650 
at that Wow no flaw to in control on
that<00:04:34.979> but<00:04:35.190> that<00:04:35.310> was<00:04:35.460> just<00:04:35.490> some<00:04:35.880> brilliant

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
that but that was just some brilliant

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.469 
that but that was just some brilliant
micro<00:04:37.039> from<00:04:38.039> g5<00:04:38.430> basically<00:04:38.970> bringing<00:04:39.210> up<00:04:39.360> that

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
micro from g5 basically bringing up that

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.080 
micro from g5 basically bringing up that
Templars<00:04:39.960> I<00:04:40.139> storming<00:04:40.560> the<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:41.490> hydrolysis

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
Templars I storming the the hydrolysis

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
Templars I storming the the hydrolysis
and<00:04:42.180> then<00:04:42.330> bringing<00:04:42.569> up<00:04:42.660> the<00:04:42.750> coarse<00:04:42.930> hairs

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
and then bringing up the coarse hairs

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.779 
and then bringing up the coarse hairs
take<00:04:43.470> down<00:04:43.650> the<00:04:43.770> overlords<00:04:44.220> just<00:04:44.460> letting<00:04:44.669> the

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
take down the overlords just letting the

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:46.550 
take down the overlords just letting the
Dark<00:04:44.970> Templar<00:04:45.120> do<00:04:45.900> the<00:04:45.990> rest<00:04:46.169> of<00:04:46.259> the<00:04:46.349> work<00:04:46.470> and

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
Dark Templar do the rest of the work and

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.839 
Dark Templar do the rest of the work and
we'll<00:04:46.680> see<00:04:46.830> if<00:04:46.860> he<00:04:46.979> can<00:04:47.039> continue<00:04:47.220> to<00:04:47.520> do<00:04:47.699> that

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:47.849 
we'll see if he can continue to do that

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:49.400 
we'll see if he can continue to do that
here<00:04:48.060> I'm<00:04:48.419> going<00:04:48.660> to<00:04:48.720> push<00:04:48.870> up<00:04:48.990> with<00:04:49.110> all<00:04:49.289> his

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
here I'm going to push up with all his

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.140 
here I'm going to push up with all his
units<00:04:49.710> up<00:04:49.830> here<00:04:50.009> kind<00:04:50.370> of<00:04:50.490> on<00:04:50.610> this<00:04:50.759> secondary

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
units up here kind of on this secondary

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.909 
units up here kind of on this secondary
and<00:04:51.419> I<00:04:51.780> think<00:04:52.139> he<00:04:52.229> might<00:04:52.349> go<00:04:52.500> and<00:04:52.650> be<00:04:52.830> going

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
and I think he might go and be going

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.550 
and I think he might go and be going
straight<00:04:53.220> for<00:04:53.370> in<00:04:53.669> controls<00:04:54.030> tech<00:04:54.410> while<00:04:55.410> he's

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
straight for in controls tech while he's

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.230 
straight for in controls tech while he's
kind<00:04:55.800> of<00:04:55.860> while<00:04:56.220> yeah<00:04:56.580> while<00:04:56.819> he's<00:04:56.970> losing

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
kind of while yeah while he's losing

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.490 
kind of while yeah while he's losing
overlords<00:04:57.690> and<00:04:57.780> looks<00:04:57.930> like<00:04:58.050> he<00:04:58.139> does<00:04:58.349> have

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
overlords and looks like he does have

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.320 
overlords and looks like he does have
kind<00:04:58.680> of<00:04:58.770> a<00:04:58.889> count<00:04:59.340> production<00:04:59.940> trying<00:05:00.180> to<00:05:00.240> get

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
kind of a count production trying to get

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.540 
kind of a count production trying to get
a<00:05:00.360> sport<00:05:00.660> colony<00:05:00.930> up<00:05:01.050> and<00:05:01.380> I<00:05:01.410> think<00:05:01.500> g5<00:05:02.280> very

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
a sport colony up and I think g5 very

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.640 
a sport colony up and I think g5 very
intelligently<00:05:03.090> realizing<00:05:03.750> that<00:05:04.199> right<00:05:04.530> at

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
intelligently realizing that right at

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.140 
intelligently realizing that right at
that<00:05:04.770> moment<00:05:04.830> he<00:05:05.220> needed<00:05:05.460> to<00:05:05.520> push<00:05:05.669> up<00:05:05.849> before

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
that moment he needed to push up before

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.210 
that moment he needed to push up before
we<00:05:06.389> before<00:05:07.229> in<00:05:07.560> control<00:05:07.830> could<00:05:07.949> get<00:05:08.070> some

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
we before in control could get some

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.770 
we before in control could get some
static<00:05:08.520> detection<00:05:08.940> down<00:05:09.060> it's<00:05:09.539> going<00:05:09.690> to

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
static detection down it's going to

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:10.999 
static detection down it's going to
manage<00:05:10.050> to<00:05:10.139> take<00:05:10.289> out<00:05:10.440> the<00:05:10.530> expansion<00:05:10.949> right

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:11.009 
manage to take out the expansion right

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:12.110 
manage to take out the expansion right
here<00:05:11.190> but<00:05:11.310> really<00:05:11.490> what<00:05:11.610> he<00:05:11.669> needs<00:05:11.849> to<00:05:11.880> do<00:05:12.030> is

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:12.120 
here but really what he needs to do is

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.909 
here but really what he needs to do is
he<00:05:12.180> needs<00:05:12.360> to<00:05:12.539> flood<00:05:12.720> his<00:05:12.840> units<00:05:13.110> in<00:05:13.229> and<00:05:13.440> take

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
he needs to flood his units in and take

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:15.170 
he needs to flood his units in and take
down<00:05:14.099> the<00:05:14.250> tech<00:05:14.430> and<00:05:14.580> this<00:05:14.669> is<00:05:14.820> going<00:05:14.940> to<00:05:15.000> be<00:05:15.090> an

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
down the tech and this is going to be an

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.800 
down the tech and this is going to be an
amazing<00:05:15.449> comeback<00:05:16.110> if<00:05:16.830> g5<00:05:17.340> could<00:05:17.699> could<00:05:18.630> get

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
amazing comeback if g5 could could get

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.330 
amazing comeback if g5 could could get
this<00:05:18.960> unprotected<00:05:19.530> tech<00:05:19.710> back<00:05:19.949> here<00:05:20.159> looks

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
this unprotected tech back here looks

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.409 
this unprotected tech back here looks
like<00:05:20.370> he's<00:05:20.550> going<00:05:20.699> for<00:05:20.820> the<00:05:20.880> ultralisk<00:05:21.240> ever

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
like he's going for the ultralisk ever

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.779 
like he's going for the ultralisk ever
now<00:05:21.800> really<00:05:22.800> what<00:05:22.949> in<00:05:23.310> control<00:05:23.550> needs<00:05:23.699> to

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
now really what in control needs to

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:25.640 
now really what in control needs to
start<00:05:23.970> doing<00:05:24.180> this<00:05:24.270> is<00:05:24.449> is<00:05:24.599> putting<00:05:25.319> down<00:05:25.470> some

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
start doing this is is putting down some

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.230 
start doing this is is putting down some
of<00:05:25.710> the<00:05:25.889> buildings<00:05:26.190> in<00:05:26.250> the<00:05:26.699> background<00:05:26.729> see

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
of the buildings in the background see

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.189 
of the buildings in the background see
if<00:05:27.300> he's<00:05:27.419> doing<00:05:27.569> that<00:05:27.690> doesn't<00:05:28.020> look<00:05:28.110> like

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 
if he's doing that doesn't look like

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:30.020 
if he's doing that doesn't look like
he's<00:05:28.319> managing<00:05:28.620> to<00:05:28.740> get<00:05:28.830> any<00:05:29.550> buildings<00:05:29.909> down

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
he's managing to get any buildings down

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.580 
he's managing to get any buildings down
the<00:05:30.150> background<00:05:30.479> to<00:05:30.599> basically<00:05:31.169> continue

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
the background to basically continue
