00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.030
 Another episode of Spike Reasoning 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.310
 I thought about it now 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.529
 what to do if you do not have a wizard 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.910
 but you do not need it 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.810
 hold resp 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:28.109
 For the first time, this is a very reflective one 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.420
 daring version of a one man show 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.160
 made 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.260
 you need a lot to do that 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.540
 Politics one spans a book as well 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.489
 You can reckon and you can do without 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.960
 Another use a backpack because 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.600
 you can tell pretty well 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.030
 it is correct that one should not form 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.620
 a pole so mutate that they over 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.940
 the head is as soon as you have the thailand 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.980
 At this pole is at the top 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.030
 in photos a part if you have another 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.270
 city can assemble 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.860
 that should be this , it is a special one 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.170
 that we often have a strong one 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.199
 is mounted in the penultimate of our 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.479
 all chrome series from the ranger series 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.520
 a 90 centimeter deep softbox man 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.869
 But this venture series can be too 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.820
 leave home and easy to normal 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.340
 climb with use the whole 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.990
 things much easier and then necessarily 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.000
 Softbox will be over four milligrams too 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.070
 quite a white reflector or 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.939
 Silver and Rector already use everything 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.580
 no problem 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.450
 to attract that part and 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.220
 adjust 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.520
 follow a little skill and look 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.880
 a lot of crap but both are too 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.880
 still 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.610
 Not 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.420
 one of these bernd fischer but that 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.340
 whole is actually pretty fix on me 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.490
 be careful watching what you are doing 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.350
 so mounted that the bible 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.730
 could in love or what 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.770
 I should be out of the cross all the time 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.300
 that's why the whole lives find this 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.730
 just as attached so you should 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.240
 really make sure that you se 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:48.260
 the body tenses with my all 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.810
 Samples freiburg needs cable com 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.790
 photograph wirelessly and have now 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.200
 about my softbox 100 meters from me 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.470
 removed what the mercurius was now 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.970
 i can say my words from ours 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.950
 photograph location without them 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.940
 I need someone to do that 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.940
 Let's introduce you shortly 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.600
 and here show what is especially cool 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.830
 from 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.260
 the cool thing about a whole thing is very 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.819
 flexible because you are with the morning constantly 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.129
 I like that it does not work all the time 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:46.790
 one with 100 approximately 150 distance from 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:48.230
 walk a value of motto german 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:54.260
 money 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:56.530
 switched is optimal imagine 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.530
 could 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:03.370
 which material and there is not 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.370
 so undivided ladder step 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.840
 Super 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.950
 our way 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.030
 fervor 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.970
 we go 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.150
 around 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:35.519
 Jan 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:40.829
 more 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.570
 the photos are sensational but build 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.780
 must admit that's something 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.670
 exhausting was the current sugar but 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.060
 She also says you can not settle anything 

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.410
 do 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.540
 well, I'll use the connection one more time 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.640
 few photos of us are all from the 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:14.690
 Camera without processing that is 1 1 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:16.760
 just as thought but cool and ask 

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:19.330
 See you next time 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:22.930
 from swiss I think a lot of fun and 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.930
 people over it neighbors
