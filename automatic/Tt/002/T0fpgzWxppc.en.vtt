technical<00:01:38.250> difficulties<00:01:39.500> there<00:01:40.500> we<00:01:40.650> go<00:01:40.829> I

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
technical difficulties there we go I

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.190 
technical difficulties there we go I
can't<00:01:41.909> really<00:01:42.090> point<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.479> speed<00:01:42.780> like<00:01:42.990> any

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
can't really point to speed like any

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.630 
can't really point to speed like any
lower<00:01:43.409> than<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.100> I'm<00:01:44.189> kind<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.520> like

spill<00:05:56.740> it's<00:05:57.160> not<00:05:57.370> just<00:05:57.610> concentrated<00:05:58.270> like<00:05:58.450> on

00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.170 
spill it's not just concentrated like on

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:00.930 
spill it's not just concentrated like on
the<00:05:59.380> edges<00:05:59.770> like<00:05:59.920> a<00:05:59.950> softbox<00:06:00.520> well<00:06:00.790> this

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
the edges like a softbox well this

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.820 
the edges like a softbox well this
lights<00:06:01.180> kind<00:06:01.510> of<00:06:01.570> coming<00:06:01.870> out<00:06:02.020> and<00:06:02.230> and<00:06:02.710> it's

so therefore those are some quick tips
and<00:06:08.080> about<00:06:08.590> the<00:06:08.740> umbrella<00:06:09.040> I<00:06:09.400> use<00:06:09.790> this<00:06:10.030> all

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
and about the umbrella I use this all

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.850 
and about the umbrella I use this all
the<00:06:10.300> time<00:06:10.660> because<00:06:10.930> it's<00:06:11.110> easier<00:06:11.650> actually

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
the time because it's easier actually

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.400 
the time because it's easier actually
