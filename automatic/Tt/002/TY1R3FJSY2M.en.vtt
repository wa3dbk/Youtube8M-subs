00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.180
 airports mother and 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.440
 the largest 1 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.369
 he serve more than 30 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.779
 2 annually and more than 80,000 daily 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.860
 airplanes take off and land every two 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:26.029
 minutes and about 700 dress per day 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.060
 average per aircraft service 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.500
 about 40 minutes 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.240
 Naturally such a busy schedule 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.510
 implies a huge amount 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.250
 staff and extensive machine park we 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.230
 tell about a small part of the airfield 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.230
 vehicle operating longtime 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.870
 winter is the hardest time in tight 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.010
 ground service schedule added 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.720
 still handling airplanes 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.159
 anti-icing world agents and 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.470
 here comes first 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.989
 scania p340 special machine 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.030
 wheel formula 6 by 2 and elongated 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.610
 three tank highway with anti-icing 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.040
 fluid manipulator to the processing and 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.659
 separate closed cab this 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.850
 the machine can handle aircraft 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.170
 any types interesting that the plane 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.970
 processed immediately before 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.170
 departure and passengers bastard 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.060
 fantastic picture 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.610
 the car turns into a working 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.680
 position and operators turns on 20 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.990
 meter height 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.100
 starts in mechanical ballet 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.650
 nozzle arm can advance 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.049
 11 meters up 13 meters ahead 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.200
 this is enough to try the plane 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:31.729
 any type 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.610
 even the biggest today 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.770
 airbus a380 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.060
 fluid reserve of 8000 liters in 3 tanks 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.460
 mixture formation occurs 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.939
 immediately before spraying consumption 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.590
 fluid 220 250 liters per minute on 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:50.020
 full processing of the aircraft depending 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.020
 from their size goes from 20 to 40 minutes 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.520
 that you will eat fish or chicken 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.229
 this phrase was heard only by all 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.599
 the plane we are in order to 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.860
 stewardess or pronounced necessary 

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:06.080
 bring lunch to everyone 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.539
 passengers and crew and for this 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.340
 serve as ketter you and machines 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.900
 catering machines scan uniquely on 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.630
 this moment is the only car 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.880
 which can service the airbus a380 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.549
 while the Domodedovo airport takes on 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.650
 two such flights a day and night 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.239
 but by the end of the year plans to take 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.000
 on 4 a380 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.860
 and next year the airbus a380 will appear 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.410
 in the fleet of domestic airlines 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.480
 on the scania p 250 three-axle chassis 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.250
 installed company autonomous module 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.930
 milaha scissor lift 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.450
 allows you to lift the body to a height of more 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.030
 six and a half meters maximum 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.680
 weight 5 and a half tons van special vehicle 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.299
 designed to provide fast and 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.920
 simple joints with the air door 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.540
 the vessel is provided 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.090
 maximum security for everything about 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.810
 Employee personnel and construction protection 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.810
 aircraft 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.959
 these cars see units though not all 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.330
 time is on duty 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.739
 airfield fire trucks it from here 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.450
 class cars are meant to 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.810
 pulled in the suggestions of the aircraft and 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.040
 using accustomed to curl and passenger 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.530
 Domodedovo used fire truck 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.900
 buffs on scania p400 80 chassis soon 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.840
 friend 6 on a pole and fire 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.129
 pink equipment 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.959
 Of course these machines have a constant 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:25.750
 four-wheel drive and automatic transmission 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.209
 gears and double cabin put 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.230
 six people fire brigade 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.290
 designs so providing fast 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.150
 fireman access 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.209
 water tank on the 9000 accounts and the capacity 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.980
 le pin of education on 1200 hands fore 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.870
 fire monitor provides flow 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.720
 two and a half thousand liters of foam in 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.519
 minute throw build up to 65 meters 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.650
 plus the ability to lead by example 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.180
 through is important 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.900
 curb weight tucked 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.879

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.200
 Engine power 400 hp 80 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.739
 with aggregation with automatic 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.989
 by the box 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.959
 Alison allows you to accelerate to a hundred 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.590
 twenty five kilometers per hour 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.390
 permanent four-wheel drive 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.189
 guarantees movement not only 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.189
 hard surface for a friend 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.010
 Of course we told far from about 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:17.859
 all types of airfield transport 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.389
 there are more than 80 of them and work on 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.850
 there are more than a thousand people 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:24.430
 you have a very tight schedule 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.729
