in<00:00:00.060> this<00:00:00.960> lesson<00:00:01.319> I<00:00:01.560> will<00:00:01.740> continue<00:00:02.340> on<00:00:02.490> with

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
in this lesson I will continue on with

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.329 
in this lesson I will continue on with
the<00:00:02.730> blood<00:00:02.970> vessels<00:00:03.000> of<00:00:03.810> the<00:00:04.259> upper<00:00:04.770> extremity

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
the blood vessels of the upper extremity

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.770 
the blood vessels of the upper extremity
and<00:00:05.370> look<00:00:05.730> at<00:00:05.879> it<00:00:06.000> in<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.240> forum<00:00:06.750> now<00:00:07.410> we<00:00:08.130> had

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:08.780 
and look at it in the forum now we had

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.440 
and look at it in the forum now we had
continued<00:00:09.780> on<00:00:09.840> with<00:00:10.290> the<00:00:10.590> Philippine<00:00:11.580> here<00:00:12.240> on

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
continued on with the Philippine here on

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.289 
continued on with the Philippine here on
the<00:00:12.630> medial<00:00:13.110> side<00:00:13.410> so<00:00:13.830> let<00:00:14.009> me<00:00:14.099> draw<00:00:14.400> basilic

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
the medial side so let me draw basilic

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.410 
the medial side so let me draw basilic
here<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:16.070> then<00:00:17.070> on<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.430> other<00:00:17.640> side<00:00:18.000> we<00:00:18.210> had

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
here and then on the other side we had

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.359 
here and then on the other side we had
the<00:00:18.630> cephalic<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.650> we<00:00:19.710> came<00:00:19.980> by<00:00:20.130> it<00:00:20.189> with

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
the cephalic and we came by it with

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.759 
the cephalic and we came by it with
cephalic<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.119> we'll<00:00:21.270> take<00:00:21.630> these<00:00:21.840> guys<00:00:22.170> and

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
cephalic and we'll take these guys and

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.189 
cephalic and we'll take these guys and
trace<00:00:23.039> them<00:00:23.250> on<00:00:23.539> downward<00:00:24.539> now<00:00:25.099> the<00:00:27.199> basilic

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
trace them on downward now the basilic

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.030 
trace them on downward now the basilic
vein<00:00:28.230> will<00:00:28.949> continue<00:00:29.609> on<00:00:29.820> all<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.599> way<00:00:31.410> down

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
vein will continue on all the way down

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.930 
vein will continue on all the way down
to<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.120> end<00:00:33.239> of<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.480> arm<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:34.460> cephalic<00:00:35.460> will

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
to the end of the arm and cephalic will

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.920 
to the end of the arm and cephalic will
continue<00:00:36.420> on

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
continue on

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.049 
continue on
thusly<00:00:37.460> now<00:00:38.460> once<00:00:39.239> they<00:00:39.780> are<00:00:39.989> here<00:00:40.940> and<00:00:41.940> I

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
thusly now once they are here and I

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.910 
thusly now once they are here and I
would<00:00:42.239> usually<00:00:42.450> use<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.780> different<00:00:43.320> color<00:00:43.680> but

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
would usually use a different color but

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.900 
would usually use a different color but
I'm<00:00:44.010> going<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.250> use<00:00:44.520> orange<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:46.670> they<00:00:47.670> would

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
I'm going to use orange and they would

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.189 
I'm going to use orange and they would
unite<00:00:48.350> to<00:00:49.350> form<00:00:49.680> Palmer<00:00:50.610> arch<00:00:51.090> veins

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
unite to form Palmer arch veins

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.250 
unite to form Palmer arch veins
now<00:00:52.800> these<00:00:52.980> Palmer<00:00:53.340> arch<00:00:53.699> veins<00:00:54.180> may<00:00:55.079> go<00:00:55.230> a

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
now these Palmer arch veins may go a

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.760 
now these Palmer arch veins may go a
little<00:00:55.379> further<00:00:56.129> here<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.230> I'll<00:00:58.230> draw<00:00:58.559> two

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
little further here and I'll draw two

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.979 
little further here and I'll draw two
different<00:00:59.039> ones<00:00:59.399> out<00:00:59.760> for<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.359> Palmer<00:01:00.600> arch

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
different ones out for the Palmer arch

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.399 
different ones out for the Palmer arch
means<00:01:01.440> now<00:01:02.160> secondly<00:01:03.149> we<00:01:03.359> had<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:03.960> orange

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
means now secondly we had in orange

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.859 
means now secondly we had in orange
before<00:01:04.559> but<00:01:05.129> really<00:01:05.670> we<00:01:06.090> are<00:01:06.330> limited<00:01:06.840> with

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
before but really we are limited with

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.440 
before but really we are limited with
colors<00:01:07.350> on<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.650> iPad<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.970> we<00:01:09.090> had<00:01:09.299> our

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
colors on the iPad that we had our

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.250 
colors on the iPad that we had our
brachial<00:01:10.110> vein<00:01:10.140> our<00:01:10.700> brachial<00:01:11.700> vein

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
brachial vein our brachial vein

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:19.210 
brachial vein our brachial vein
bifurcates<00:01:13.260> into<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:15.080> radial<00:01:16.080> vein<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:17.780> an

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
bifurcates into a radial vein and an

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.719 
bifurcates into a radial vein and an
owner<00:01:20.220> vein<00:01:21.030> now<00:01:21.360> we<00:01:21.420> use<00:01:21.869> grey<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.619> show<00:01:23.400> the

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
owner vein now we use grey to show the

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.340 
owner vein now we use grey to show the
owner<00:01:25.490> here<00:01:26.490> or<00:01:27.090> rather<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.659> grave<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
owner here or rather the grave of the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.780 
owner here or rather the grave of the
radial<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.640> blue<00:01:30.329> for<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.110> owner<00:01:31.350> and

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.880 

when<00:01:35.790> these<00:01:36.060> guys<00:01:36.420> unite<00:01:37.049> they<00:01:37.320> will<00:01:37.500> form<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
when these guys unite they will form the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.749 
when these guys unite they will form the
other<00:01:38.070> Palmer<00:01:38.430> arches<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.750> we<00:01:39.900> do<00:01:40.049> have<00:01:40.320> both

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
other Palmer arches so we do have both

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.550 
other Palmer arches so we do have both
superficial<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:41.880> deep<00:01:42.000> palmar<00:01:42.329> arches<00:01:42.840> now

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
superficial and deep palmar arches now

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.889 
superficial and deep palmar arches now
coming<00:01:43.950> off<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.250> our<00:01:44.520> Palmer<00:01:44.850> arch<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.689> want

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
coming off of our Palmer arch is I want

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.780 
coming off of our Palmer arch is I want
to<00:01:45.960> use<00:01:46.110> Ratigan<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.369> show<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.610> guys

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
to use Ratigan just to show you guys

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.389 
to use Ratigan just to show you guys
that<00:01:48.210> they<00:01:48.509> will<00:01:48.840> give<00:01:49.079> off<00:01:49.350> veins<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.369> the

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
that they will give off veins to the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.069 
that they will give off veins to the
fingers<00:01:51.090> called<00:01:52.049> Digital<00:01:52.740> veins<00:01:53.750> all<00:01:54.750> those

as<00:02:12.370> seen<00:02:12.940> here<00:02:12.970> but<00:02:13.569> for<00:02:14.170> our<00:02:14.410> position<00:02:14.709> most

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
as seen here but for our position most

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.910 
as seen here but for our position most
diagrams<00:02:15.910> don't<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.239> pick<00:02:16.480> them<00:02:16.690> too<00:02:16.959> well<00:02:17.260> but
