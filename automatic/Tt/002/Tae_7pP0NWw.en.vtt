00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:09.030
 hello everyone is a little restaurant 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.240
 today we are doing our second 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.630
 video so on montano smooth green at 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.510
 kitchen so the police and a lizard of 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.640
 tropical type so in nature he lives 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.449
 in the united states in the southeastern 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.019
 united states the species as those having 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.330
 from virginia to florida 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:35.430
 so first of all i'm going to show you 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:40.680
 my breeding space so here but 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.329
 cricket means so 2 to 3 2 to 3 times 2 to 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.399
 3 crickets every two to three days 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:50.730
 so according to their hunger see mine he 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:54.090
 hiring of 3 so there a container for 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.500
 water so to moisten a box 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.829
 to mix the crickets with the 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.680
 calcium so use a box in 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.830
 which buys nothing and that in 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:10.979
 down so my material and the moults of 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:14.430
 words the arts here so we use a 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:18.180
 vivarium of this are cm of length on 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.950
 45 of width and 45 of the authors therefore 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.909
 perfect for an elvis even for 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:27.299
 several years so for my point 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.030
 hot i use and bleach fox 35 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:33.840
 right so the woodcut sun must be 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:38.070
 located between 32 to 35 degrees for 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.340
 novices and here the cold point so with 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.520
 a container the cold cold owes him 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:49.799
 to be the temperature must be between 22 to 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.780
 24 degrees so but the fucker so but 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.320
 three uv lamps with mirrors for 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.320
 reflect the light 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:03.580
 flash a bit like a comedy what so 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.319
 that you can see the white mont 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:10.750
 loop that I bought not long ago 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:12.910
 so what about chips then 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.110
 yes we use reptile chips tray 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.600
 so it absorbs moisture and 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.840
 of the guard is so perfect for 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:26.200
 arts of this type because it is really 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.320
 moisture so good humidification it 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.660
 about humidify two 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.680
 Probable of us once if you 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.080
 do not have too much time but 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.200
 humidify so we will not do it because 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.709
 that we have already done earlier but 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.709
 in another video 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:55.000
 so I'm going to debate introduce you to my 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:59.410
 the arts will be presented so here's in water 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.440
 plants were not in phase so 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.790
 which really changes color when it 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.450
 is a guide to pia chou etc and on 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.640
 green plants 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.190
 he really comes to verses at 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.190
 almost but it can also become very 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.320
 very brown or even very gray will be 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.829
 without pain it can be this lot too 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.220
 remember me it's a shame and a 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.220
 week 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.770
 so as we said in the 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:29.069
 first video our goal is to buy 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:31.190
 two others and all his so a male and 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:35.400
 a female but even an evil remembers 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:39.330
 and have them reproduced and you 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:42.120
 will follow because for analysts it's 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.220
 better really to buy them by 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.680
 two or three because he was doing 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.660
 really the company but especially do not 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.420
 never buy for example harm 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.330
 together because they will fight and it's going 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.160
 end up with a death of a biker so has 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:02.250
 the ideal is really a male and two 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:03.810
 females really awesome so here's bah 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.959
