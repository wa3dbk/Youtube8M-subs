 maintaining since losing it is like 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.410
 lose everything from the large amount of 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.170
 organs that exist in our body 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.530
 there are particularly two vital organs 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:38.040
 that united are the mother cause of the most 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.680
 of 90% of the diseases ie the 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.780
 malfunction of these bodies are 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.690
 the true origin of most of the 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.660
 diseases we are talking about the colon 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.180
 and the liver the detoxification system 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.399
 who is responsible for cleaning these two 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.579
 vital organs is known as 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.710
 hepatic cleansing this system is so 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.289
 well that has been the title and theme of 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.110
 several books and of course theme 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.260
 this video since it is very easy and above 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.510
 everything is 100% natural the greatest 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.520
 we do not know how to clean and 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.860
 keep our colon healthy and a lot 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.810
 least our liver is why we 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.840
 we usually have them full of 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.180
 sediments that hinder their work without 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.640
 that we realize, we blame 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.190
 anything but actually the root 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.850
 of all the pathologies usually 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:32.580
 The liver is in the silent liver 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.290
 is the great forgotten the medicine as 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.530
 it hardly manifests itself in 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.860
 ie clinical analysis is invisible 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.680
 to doctors however it is the origin 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.010
 of our poor health that undoubtedly we 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.350
 bitter life something amazing is that 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.690
 comparatively with the little liver 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.940
 people have stones in the gallbladder but 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.510
 thousands of people go through the operating room 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.550
 to remove the gallbladder this operation is 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.310
 one of the most common in our country 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.920
 the funny thing is that if they have so many 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.830
 stones in the gallbladder imagine how 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.190
 will have the liver what doctors do not 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:14.040
 they tell us is that when extracting the gallbladder 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.860
 in years and above all quality of life 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.440
 this is because the bile is left without 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.170
 reservoir to accumulate and remember 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.450
 that his end was expelled expelled when 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.180
 food goes in with what to do the 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.360
 digestion have to settle for the 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.630
 drop by drop that the liver makes what 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.640
 which is ten times less concentrated than 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.640
 bile from the gallbladder 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.520
 that is, we are left with the digestion 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.140
 deteriorated forever almost nobody knows 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.510
 that most people 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.970
 we develop stones in the liver at 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.370
 long of life we ​​do not know why 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.160
 nobody has told us then medicine 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.920
 only extracts them in extreme cases when 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.110
 they are calcified and can be seen in 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.110
 the ultrasounds but before 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.030
 calcify are invisible because they have 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.520
 the same consistency as the fabric 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.430
 hepatic to these small stones of 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.370
 dark green color science calls them 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.840
 gallstones and if you follow our 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.020
 advice to perform this cleaning 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.870
 hepatic will see them leave your own 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.940
 body 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.920
 let me explain this to you with other 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.200
 words and an example that you can 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.750
 relate more easily the 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.599
 The functioning of the liver affects 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.420
 everything is responsible for maintaining 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:34.569
 healthy your body can be said that 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:37.150
 your internal doctor is your liver to have the 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.220
 liver stuck with stones is like 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.140
 have a car that you have never done 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.709
 the maintenance of the oil filter and 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.560
 of gasoline that is to say with jobs and 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:50.590
 it consumes a lot until it stops because 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.599
 can not anymore the body is the same or worse 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.209
 than a vehicle because if the filter is 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:57.670
 clogged blood circulation and 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.799
 lymphatic ones get stuck they accumulate 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.200
 deposits everywhere that are not 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.599
 filtered producing for example 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.970
 hemorrhoids due to blood congestion 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:09.849
 coming from the portal vein that goes towards 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.220
 the liver and whose blood is not capable 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:14.739
 of absorbing what makes it stagnate in 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.139
 form of piles and toxic clumps 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:20.169
 by all the organs and systems 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:23.210
 on the other hand overload or congestion 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:25.520
 derived from the jamming obliges to perform 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.860
 greater effort to the heart because it forces 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.020
 to suck harder from the vein 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.660
 Cava from the liver because of 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.720
 being stuck the liver behaves 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:38.300
 like a filtering sponge receives and gives 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.849
 blood but when it is very dirty not 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.220
 drains well so the blood does not flow 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:45.849
 with ease and the hundreds of functions 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.220
 liver diseases progressively deteriorate 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:51.319
 causing the diseases the waste 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.690
 of what is not able to take charge 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:56.599
 the liver are accumulated by the 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.669
 body where least bother this 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:01.009
 causes the jam of the lymphatic system 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:04.430
 which is something like the sewer system 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:06.710
 of the body forcing it in the extreme 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.800
 to the cells to be left without 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.500
 oxygen from so much garbage that surrounds them and 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:16.070
 in their attempt to survive they develop 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.780
 that defensive effort called cancer the 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.360
 cancer that is one of the diseases 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.300
 most common today is the effort 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:26.539
 of the body to be cleaned is why 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.580
 fighting against him will never heal everything 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:29.289
 it owes to the intoxication of our 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.669
 cells 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:34.419
 usually due to a liver that does not 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:37.370
 filtering does it very little or does it badly 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:40.460
 believe me that cleaning your liver so 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:42.440
 less once a year is undoubtedly the 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.720

 bile in the liver contribute to the 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.470
 appearance of virtually any 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.960
 kind of disease and by taking some 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.419
