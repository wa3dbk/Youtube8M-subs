00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 
clips in there these clips basically

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.050 
clips in there these clips basically
hold<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:39.480> front<00:01:39.780> top<00:01:40.050> on<00:01:40.640> so<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.700> just<00:01:41.880> kind

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
hold the front top on so you just kind

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.270 
hold the front top on so you just kind
of<00:01:42.120> push<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.690> and<00:01:43.080> you're<00:01:43.770> going<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:43.920> feel<00:01:44.130> it

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
of push in and you're going to feel it

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.500 
of push in and you're going to feel it
go<00:01:44.430> up<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:44.970> almost<00:01:45.420> into<00:01:45.690> the<00:01:45.720> corner<00:01:46.229> there

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
go up and almost into the corner there

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.719 
go up and almost into the corner there
don't<00:01:48.510> you<00:01:48.630> do<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:49.250> you<00:01:50.250> should<00:01:50.430> be<00:01:50.550> able<00:01:50.610> to

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
don't you do that you should be able to

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.960 
don't you do that you should be able to
get<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.060> front<00:01:51.330> frame<00:01:51.630> off<00:01:51.900> the<00:01:52.470> front<00:01:52.740> bezel

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.550 

so<00:01:56.970> it<00:01:57.240> comes<00:01:57.540> off<00:01:57.810> pretty<00:01:58.170> easily<00:01:58.950> now<00:02:00.560> what

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
so it comes off pretty easily now what

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.219 
so it comes off pretty easily now what
you<00:02:01.650> want<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.070> do<00:02:02.190> is<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.460> want<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.729> watch<00:02:02.880> out

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
you want to do is you want to watch out

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.750 
you want to do is you want to watch out
for<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.350> wires<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:05.040> connect<00:02:05.490> the

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
for the wires that connect the

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.060 
for the wires that connect the
microphone<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.920> your<00:02:07.920> camera<00:02:09.679> so<00:02:10.679> they<00:02:10.890> are

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
microphone and your camera so they are

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.430 
microphone and your camera so they are
right<00:02:11.310> here<00:02:11.910> and<00:02:13.700> basically<00:02:14.700> if<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.440> it's

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
right here and basically if you it's

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.560 
right here and basically if you it's
easier<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:16.950> do<00:02:17.100> well<00:02:17.280> it's<00:02:17.459> lying<00:02:17.730> down<00:02:18.060> so

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
easier to do well it's lying down so

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.509 
easier to do well it's lying down so
that's<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.470> best<00:02:19.650> way<00:02:19.769> to<00:02:19.800> disconnect<00:02:20.400> that

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
that's the best way to disconnect that

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.570 
that's the best way to disconnect that
if<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:20.910> wanted<00:02:21.239> to<00:02:21.890> so<00:02:22.890> what<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.160> want<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.489> do

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
if you wanted to so what you want to do

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.699 
if you wanted to so what you want to do
now<00:02:23.790> is<00:02:23.820> kind<00:02:24.269> of<00:02:24.390> peel<00:02:24.600> back<00:02:24.630> this<00:02:25.080> foil<00:02:25.410> tape

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
now is kind of peel back this foil tape

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.729 
now is kind of peel back this foil tape
that's<00:02:26.010> on<00:02:26.130> each<00:02:26.370> side<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:26.970> LCD<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.840> then

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
that's on each side of the LCD and then

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.680 
that's on each side of the LCD and then
you'll<00:02:28.980> be<00:02:29.130> able<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.400> see<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.850> little<00:02:30.000> Torx

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
you'll be able to see the little Torx

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.140 
you'll be able to see the little Torx
screws<00:02:30.989> that<00:02:31.260> are<00:02:31.410> in<00:02:31.560> each<00:02:31.769> corner<00:02:32.280> of<00:02:32.580> the

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
screws that are in each corner of the

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.610 
screws that are in each corner of the
screen<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:33.750> should<00:02:33.930> have<00:02:34.050> forward<00:02:34.440> them

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
screen so you should have forward them

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:45.199 
screen so you should have forward them
all<00:02:34.769> together<00:02:35.630> I<00:02:42.560> want<00:02:43.560> to<00:02:43.620> kind<00:02:43.800> of<00:02:44.000> peel<00:02:45.000> that

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
all together I want to kind of peel that

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:45.960 
all together I want to kind of peel that
off

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970
