00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.630
 Hi all 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.369
 from flight tutor in this session 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.810
 we will review in a simple way the 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.149
 basic concepts that explain a 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.829
 simple way how what is generated is generated 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.829
 we call the sustentation 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.700
 the lift is a generated force 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.430
 by the fuselage and various parts of the 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.200
 plane but we will not be able to focus 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.420
 in all the components that generate 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.329
 this effect but let's focus on 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.950
 the main one that are the wings and also 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.320
 in two basic principles that give us 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.170
 a simple explanation of how it is that 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.300
 generates this effect there are currently two 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.610
 theories that explain the sustainability the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.559
 first is the bernouilli theorem and the 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.110
 second is the well-known third law of 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.790
 Newton do not worry that the idea is 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.039
 explain these two concepts of a 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.050
 very simple and basic way to be able to 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:15.770
 understand how they relate to the 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.770
 lift 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.850
 first we will review the theorem 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.530
 bernouilli for this we imagine a 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.880
 water hose that we found in 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.700
 the house with which we water from time to time 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.710
 when the garden we know that inside 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.479
 this hose we have water and the water is 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.310
 a fluid just like the air so 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.960
 both of them behave very 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.000
 Similary 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.710
 now what happens if we press the 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.659
 hose somewhere slightly 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.010
 let's say for the middle part as 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.010
 we show in the figure 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.930
 if we take that water is a fluid that 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.550
 the same amount can not be compressed 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.310
 of water that passed through the hose 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.220
 original will now want to go through a 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.680
 with a smaller area and at the same time and 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:03.220
 so this can happen the water is going to 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.220
 speed up 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.730
 but not a canvas experiment measured the 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.680
 pressure in the two sections and concluded 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.990
 that the pressure decreased where the 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.240
 fluid was therefore accelerated to 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.650
 moment that we accelerate a fluid we do 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.900
 that its pressure decreases 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.480
 now imagine this seeing the cut of 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.110
 profile of some plane and we change the 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.110
 water by air 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.700
 let's see that because of the curvature 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.740
 existing on the surface above the 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.150
 wing that is similar to the tube that 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.270
 I use bernouilli for your experiment 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.550
 the air is going to accelerate and therefore 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.800
 the pressure in this part will decrease 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.680
 and it's going to be less than the air pressure 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.930
 that goes under the wing this 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.740
 difference of pressures is what generates 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.740
 the sustentation 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.260
 now let's see what Newton tells us 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.150
 Newton's third law tells us that all 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.730
 action has a reaction with it 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.310
 force but in the opposite direction a 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.320
 very simple example is a rocket when 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.350
 start the rocket combustion this 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.810
 combustion generates a downward force 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.420
 and the opposite reaction this action is that 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.310
 the rocket go up 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.770
 now we are going to apply this concept in 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.260
 a wing and for this we imagine the wing 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.180
 like a wall 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.129
 the air molecules that come by 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.980
 under the wing they will hit this 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.540
 wall and the air is going to be reflected towards 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.879
 down as you can see in the animation 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.439
 in a slightly exaggerated way but 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.409
 to give us a better idea of ​​how 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:42.549
 this would happen this deflection towards 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:42.549
 below is the action 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.140
 On the other hand, if we see how the 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.570
 air above and below the wing 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.130
 let's see what the curved shape of the wing 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.460
 makes the air that is given by the 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.290
 part of above follow said curve 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.660
 the air molecules when they reach the 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.970
 back of the wing are deflated 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.360
 down along with the air that arrives 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.670
 below the wing this reflection is the 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.920
 action 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.690
 according to Newton's third law the 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.180
 result of these forces that of flec 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.980
 so the air down the wing are going to 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.320
 have a reaction of the same strength 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:21.510
 but in the opposite direction this is what 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.510
 we would call the sustentation 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.000
 in this session we have seen in a way 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.410
 very basic and simple the explanation of 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.460
 the two main theories that explain 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.979
 the sustentation 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.750
 the first was the bernouilli theorem that 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:41.910
 showed us that a higher speed we're going 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.319
 to have less pressure and this 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.729
 difference of pressures that exists between 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:46.470
 the air that passes above and below 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.350
 of the wing is what produces the 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.840
 lift 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.400
 then we saw the third law of newton that 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.840
 tells us that every action has a 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.000
 reaction of the same forces but in 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.490
 opposite direction and therefore the air 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.020
 that affected down produces the 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.020
 reaction that is the sustentation 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:10.900
 although both definitions are based 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.939
 in physical theories currently valid 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.469
 there is a great discussion in which has 

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:18.689
 a better contribution to the explanation of the 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:18.689
 What do you think?
