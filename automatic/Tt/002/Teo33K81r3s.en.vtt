00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.090
 this new video along with the rhodes 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:21.080
 we are on battlefield 4 today I make you 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.660
 see a new weapon of the new dlc 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.340
 naval strike that has yet to come out though 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.669
 the weapons certain weapons can already be 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:32.570
 unlock one of these is the gun that 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:34.430
 i am using this time the sw 40 and vi 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.390
 I say guys that it's a weapon really 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:41.800
 really over power then this 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.800
 doing shit 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.320
 let's get this up here 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.070
 this guys weapon reminds me so much 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:58.059
 the battlefield rex 3 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:02.440
 but it's really something exaggerated 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.440
 as firepower i mean 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.840
 and what the fuck does not die web 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.180
 I can't believe it 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.160
 no madonna but I can't believe it 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.390
 once the kick now but it's not 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:54.090
 dead 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:54.090
 out a lot of shit ok 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.670
 then I recently used it so I don't have 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.160
 a fucking accessory if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:10.259
 only the torch but there is the torch in the 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.259
 user and even under torture 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.280
 where he went 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.540
 ok 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.540
 I would love to unlock a new sight 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:46.420
 because the standard one you see that 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:54.599
 pretty enough shit no cock 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:54.599
 that shoots madonna created to infinities 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.140
 and let's go over here 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.159
 no fucking finished shots 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.700
 guys I told you that the dlc still has to 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.459
 come out however as they did also with 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:36.520
 second assault the weapons were 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:40.239
 unlockable much earlier if I 'm not mistaken 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.980
 for naval strikes there are 45 names not 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.349
 but I remember there is a machine gun 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.470
 heavy is an assault rifle one 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:49.090
 gun a new grenade 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.220
 I have unlocked the gun for now 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.280
 because the truth was not there anyway 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:58.989

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.670
