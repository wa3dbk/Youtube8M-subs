00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.420 
I think it took like 15 minutes to twist
up<00:02:02.850> my<00:02:03.060> entire<00:02:03.600> head<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.530> that's<00:02:04.920> that's<00:02:05.219> not

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
up my entire head and that's that's not

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.580 
up my entire head and that's that's not
long<00:02:05.790> considering<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:07.140> know<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.439> other

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
long considering you know the other

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.020 
long considering you know the other
styles<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.069> I've<00:02:08.190> done<00:02:08.399> where<00:02:08.610> it's<00:02:08.729> taken

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
styles that I've done where it's taken

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.790 
styles that I've done where it's taken
like<00:02:09.149> an<00:02:09.270> hour<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:09.989> just<00:02:10.020> want<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.410> cry<00:02:10.619> and

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
like an hour and I just want to cry and

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.370 
like an hour and I just want to cry and
sit<00:02:10.979> down<00:02:11.009> somewhere

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.720 

so<00:02:14.380> when<00:02:14.500> you're<00:02:14.620> all<00:02:14.650> done<00:02:15.069> twisting<00:02:15.640> you

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
so when you're all done twisting you

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.970 
so when you're all done twisting you
have<00:02:15.910> these<00:02:16.120> josei<00:02:16.900> looking<00:02:17.349> twists<00:02:17.830> and

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
have these josei looking twists and

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.290 
have these josei looking twists and
again<00:02:18.310> don't<00:02:18.459> worry<00:02:18.670> about<00:02:18.790> that<00:02:19.030> product

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
again don't worry about that product

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.210 
again don't worry about that product
that<00:02:19.569> you<00:02:19.690> see<00:02:19.870> because<00:02:20.110> overnight<00:02:20.739> it<00:02:20.920> dries

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
that you see because overnight it dries

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.820 
that you see because overnight it dries
I<00:02:21.640> like<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.360> sleep<00:02:22.569> on<00:02:22.750> a<00:02:22.840> silk<00:02:23.380> pillowcase

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
I like to sleep on a silk pillowcase

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.400 
I like to sleep on a silk pillowcase
because<00:02:24.670> I<00:02:24.700> don't<00:02:25.060> have<00:02:25.239> to<00:02:25.450> wrap<00:02:25.660> my<00:02:25.840> hair<00:02:26.140> and

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
because I don't have to wrap my hair and

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.590 
because I don't have to wrap my hair and
it's<00:02:26.860> like<00:02:27.040> my<00:02:27.190> hair<00:02:27.400> dries<00:02:27.670> super<00:02:28.330> super

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
it's like my hair dries super super

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.290 
it's like my hair dries super super
quick<00:02:28.920> so<00:02:29.920> it's<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.100> next<00:02:30.280> morning<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:30.760> I

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
quick so it's the next morning and I

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.190 
quick so it's the next morning and I
have<00:02:31.540> on<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:32.080> sweater<00:02:32.440> for<00:02:33.239> some<00:02:34.239> reason<00:02:34.510> I<00:02:34.660> okay

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
have on a sweater for some reason I okay

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.590 
have on a sweater for some reason I okay
so<00:02:35.680> it<00:02:36.400> was<00:02:36.520> like<00:02:36.640> a<00:02:36.670> laundry<00:02:36.940> day<00:02:37.239> and<00:02:37.569> I

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
so it was like a laundry day and I

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.570 
so it was like a laundry day and I
didn't<00:02:37.780> have<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:37.930> clean<00:02:38.110> shirt

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
didn't have a clean shirt

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.699 
didn't have a clean shirt
don't<00:02:39.580> judge<00:02:39.730> so<00:02:40.239> I<00:02:40.269> had<00:02:40.810> to<00:02:40.959> end<00:02:41.140> twist<00:02:41.500> the

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709
