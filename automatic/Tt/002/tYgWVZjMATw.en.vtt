 Russia has a lot of families 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.779
 where the search for relatives missing in the war has become 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.039

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.419
 share information post photos 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.059

 Looking for a positive result big 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.930
 rarity 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.629

 it gets harder to do it and yet 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.969
 it happens sometimes with very 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.890
 unusual circumstances in 2003 in 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.930
 Latvian criminal news was you 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.330
 a black digger report is shown 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.790

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:16.040
 including medal for bravery plot 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.560
 saw the search engines from the squad 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.630
 legend they managed to get a date with 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.750
 under investigation and sent a request to 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.830
 archive of the ministry of defense of russia there by 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.380
 award number 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.310
 should have established whom she 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.210
 belonged to 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.700
 soon the answer came medal number 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.619
 so the fighter was awarded red 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.229
 Army Pavel Semenovich 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.270
 Deer by the time the search engines 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.000
 found the place where it was discovered 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.040

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.439
 the deceased 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.960
 it seemed that for half a century they 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:53.810
 unsuccessfully tried to find the grave of her husband 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.740
 and the father this case is certainly not 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.850
 only 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.540
 There is reason to hope not the last yet 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.540
 search continues 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.140
