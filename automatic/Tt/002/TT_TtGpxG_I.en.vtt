when Dominique Ansel was creating this

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.780 
when Dominique Ansel was creating this

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
recipe he was inspired by Oreos which is

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
Oreo before he actually had his first

Oreo before he actually had his first
Oreo<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> couple<00:01:31.530> months<00:01:31.740> ago<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.310> he<00:01:32.460> thought

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
Oreo a couple months ago and he thought

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.179 
Oreo a couple months ago and he thought
it<00:01:32.729> was<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.060> bizarre<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.509> Americans<00:01:34.470> dipped

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
their Oreos and milk and that's kind of

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.840 
their Oreos and milk and that's kind of
when<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.680> light<00:01:37.920> bulb<00:01:38.159> went<00:01:38.400> off<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.729> he

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
when that light bulb went off and he

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.520 
when that light bulb went off and he
thought<00:01:39.060> huh<00:01:39.390> what<00:01:39.720> if<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.930> could<00:01:40.110> have<00:01:40.140> both

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530

at the same time so that's how the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.490 
at the same time so that's how the

now we're gonna coat the inside with

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.880 
now we're gonna coat the inside with
melted<00:03:27.220> chocolate<00:03:27.900> this<00:03:28.900> is<00:03:29.230> so<00:03:29.470> imperative

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
melted chocolate this is so imperative

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.440 
melted chocolate this is so imperative
to<00:03:30.220> this<00:03:30.310> chocolate<00:03:30.700> chip<00:03:30.820> cookie<00:03:31.060> milk<00:03:31.210> shot

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
to this chocolate chip cookie milk shot

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.490 
to this chocolate chip cookie milk shot
because<00:03:31.660> if<00:03:31.870> you<00:03:31.930> just<00:03:32.110> put<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.380> milk

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
because if you just put the milk

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.590 
because if you just put the milk
directly<00:03:33.010> in<00:03:33.130> there<00:03:33.340> it<00:03:33.790> would<00:03:33.880> get<00:03:34.000> soggy<00:03:34.270> all

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
directly in there it would get soggy all

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.910 
directly in there it would get soggy all
the<00:03:34.690> milk<00:03:34.900> would<00:03:34.960> fall<00:03:35.170> out<00:03:35.320> so<00:03:35.350> this<00:03:35.650> is<00:03:35.710> gonna

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 
the milk would fall out so this is gonna

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.250 
the milk would fall out so this is gonna
prevent<00:03:36.340> any<00:03:37.180> of<00:03:37.270> that<00:03:37.390> from<00:03:37.630> happening<00:03:38.080> but

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
prevent any of that from happening but

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.840 
prevent any of that from happening but
it<00:03:38.380> also<00:03:38.500> just<00:03:38.800> adds<00:03:39.010> a<00:03:39.100> really<00:03:39.130> yummy<00:03:39.460> flavor

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
it also just adds a really yummy flavor

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.200 
it also just adds a really yummy flavor
to<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:41.110> shot<00:03:41.380> so<00:03:42.280> all<00:03:42.400> I'm<00:03:42.490> gonna<00:03:42.580> do<00:03:42.820> is<00:03:43.090> just

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210 
to the shot so all I'm gonna do is just

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.420 
to the shot so all I'm gonna do is just
take<00:03:43.330> my<00:03:43.660> melted<00:03:44.020> chocolate<00:03:44.500> and<00:03:44.770> pour<00:03:45.370> it

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
take my melted chocolate and pour it

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.210 
take my melted chocolate and pour it
directly<00:03:46.180> in<00:03:46.480> there<00:03:46.720> and<00:03:47.080> I<00:03:47.650> have<00:03:47.830> found<00:03:48.040> that

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
directly in there and I have found that

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.220 
directly in there and I have found that
the<00:03:48.310> easiest<00:03:48.460> way<00:03:48.880> is<00:03:48.910> to<00:03:49.210> fill<00:03:49.450> it<00:03:49.570> up<00:03:49.750> about

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
the easiest way is to fill it up about

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.280 
the easiest way is to fill it up about
halfway<00:03:50.500> and<00:03:51.100> then<00:03:51.730> I'm<00:03:52.360> just<00:03:52.540> going<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:52.870> turn

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
halfway and then I'm just going to turn

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.640 
halfway and then I'm just going to turn
this<00:03:54.180> so<00:03:55.180> that<00:03:55.300> it<00:03:55.360> goes<00:03:55.480> right<00:03:55.780> to<00:03:56.230> the<00:03:56.440> edge

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
this so that it goes right to the edge

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.740 
this so that it goes right to the edge
and<00:03:58.140> then<00:03:59.910> you<00:04:00.910> don't<00:04:01.060> want<00:04:01.180> to<00:04:01.270> pour<00:04:01.510> this

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
and then you don't want to pour this

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:03.270 
and then you don't want to pour this
chocolate<00:04:02.290> back<00:04:02.530> into<00:04:02.800> your<00:04:02.920> chocolate<00:04:03.250> you

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
chocolate back into your chocolate you

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.440 
chocolate back into your chocolate you
might<00:04:03.460> get<00:04:03.580> some<00:04:03.760> crumbs<00:04:03.970> in<00:04:04.120> there<00:04:04.240> so<00:04:04.420> just

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
might get some crumbs in there so just

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.710 
might get some crumbs in there so just
have<00:04:04.720> another<00:04:04.960> bowl<00:04:05.340> and<00:04:06.340> as<00:04:07.210> soon<00:04:07.420> as<00:04:07.510> you're

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
have another bowl and as soon as you're

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.080 
have another bowl and as soon as you're
ready<00:04:08.040> really<00:04:09.040> really<00:04:09.370> quick<00:04:09.580> just<00:04:09.850> flip<00:04:10.000> it

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090

over<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:13.480> keep<00:04:13.660> in<00:04:13.810> mind<00:04:13.840> you<00:04:14.140> could<00:04:14.320> do<00:04:14.440> white

chocolate or hazelnut spread as long as

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.740 
chocolate or hazelnut spread as long as

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
you have some type of barrier to prevent
