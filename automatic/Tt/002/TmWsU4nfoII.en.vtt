 almost a quarterly a little bit

 the less it will be a little more often than 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.250
 quarterly then basically it's once 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.500
 every two months 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.149
 we aim once every two 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.379
 month so six times in the year for the 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.540
 magazine forssell gaulle you're with 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.860
 us tonight so for we said it the 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.590
 kicking off the elite league this was 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.690
 this weekend we will see the tops and the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.210
 flops of the weekend we will start with 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.949
 the reigning champion of the year 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.899
 last the spartan amiens who 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.730
 had won their title against thonon 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.809
 the Spartans of Amiens who played face 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.750
 facing a promoted 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.649
 to start the championship yes good 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.239
 it's true it was not 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.280
 extraordinarily well spent for 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.140
 amiens in the end on the result but that 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.210
 was a more than interesting match with 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.580
 a pretty tight match the score of any 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.110
 how and 14.21 which seems a score 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.189
 wide but knowing that a test 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.689
 transformed his 7 points 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.490
 in football us that means that it was 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.040
 really played on a test and that's the 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.540
 case to say it since amiens which is 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.680
 a team we will say a little in 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.770
 reconstruction since they lost 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.090
 11 of their 22 holders nine of 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.500
 incumbents in construction site eleven 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.060
 players that gives you an idea of ​​what 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.090
 that they have to go back up like like 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.100
 problematic has succeeded rather well 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.740
 resisted thanks to his cube and American 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.329
 joseph rey what rather well played and 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.650
 it was almost a victory 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.049
 amiens it could have played really 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.189
 not much and it took really 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.899
 a last minute intervention 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.640
 Templars can actually have it played 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.799
 on the line d of yards so yards that's 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.930
 you are about three meters tall and 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.000
 this just before passing the line the 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.829
 cube and who had been trying to improvise 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.530
 was stopped by the sacrifice 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.149
 Alex Bemba who jumped his head 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.369
 first to block it good as I 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.960
 you had it on the list he pulled it off 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.520
 a concussion so we hope 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.540
 that he will be able to 100 m but it's true 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.280
 that it was a stop really 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.879
 impressive in the last 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.470
 minutes of play 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.970
 thomas agrees that the cube and that's 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.810
 of course for the interac pole for the 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.700
 quarterback 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.430
 the favorite of the season maybe the 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.750
 black panthers of tuna that had been 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.340
 finalist last year 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.980
 very quickly the black panthers who 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.900
 play face to face to another promoted a 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.330
 promoted from elsewhere pessac in norway 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.920
 will give kangaroos of pessac and there 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:31.110
 also the black panthers so one of the 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.660
 favorites of the season were surprised 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.430
 quite so good it's true that the 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.360
 black panthers are difficulties that 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.340
 are also linked to the fact that they are at 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.500
 tuna and that all our ponds in a 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.120
 snowy district we will say of the 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.260
 la France 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.670
 it's true that thonon had a hard time getting 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.410
 prepare for the match they rather 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.000
 well started the second half was 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.590
 much harder we see it well on the 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.239
 difference in score they scored two 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.160
 first time for is seized period 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.260
 the second half they had more than 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.470
 difficulties it must be said that jimmy 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.120
 rosell the quarterback so sterle the 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.549
 master builder the conductor on 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.959
 will say the team jim russell has rather 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.700
 very well played kangaroos side of pessac 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.000
 he lined up a little not 300 yards to the 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.440
 past 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.959
 what is so a trait to 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.830
 numbers and the defense of pessac to do 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.810
 a big big game 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.150
 behind a kangaroo victory on 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.519
 will say a nice win for this promoted 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.340
 who still has goals this 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.380
 year we finish with the cardboard of the 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.820
 day then olive rival we had 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.310
 had last week which is also 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.799
 editor-in-chief of the website 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.030
 publishers blogspot had told us we 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.440
 could count on nice that there was 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.579
 had a strong youth team these 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.859
 past years we would see if this 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.359
 year he was going to perform a 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.769
 little bit among seniors dolphins 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.350
 of nice and the carton of the day 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.000
 thomas altogether and it's not a young 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.380
 who made the card is anthony 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.450
 couvin who is a player we know 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.600
 who went through the France team 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.980
 regularly who aims he went back there 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.150
 and it's true he put it hit 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.650
 strong since it just came from 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.889
 sign to the nice dolphins and they 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:57.060
 spend 3 td which gives an advantage 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:59.069
 23rd jones that gives a pretty good advantage 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.190
 consequent to nice centaurs side of 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.389
 grenoble we will say that the team had a 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.530
 little trouble what is more a little bit 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.389
 worrying for them is that gold 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.650
 quarterbacks loïc caruso who is a 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.060
 important player who is a substitute 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.799
 in France team was injured 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.720
 so we're waiting to see how it's going 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.579
 turn by cons we will say that nice has 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.019
 played his role of favorite and won 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.579
 quite easily on the match thank you 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.720
 many thomas and as we are a whole 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.250
 little bit pressed by the weather I you 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.750
 given 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.190
 I'm just asking to give the winner 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.330
 between the flash of the courneuve and the 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.010
 molosses d'asnières it was the derby 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.930
 between the seine saint denis and that 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.870
 92 quite so it's the flash that 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.400
 won in a match we will not say 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.690
 exciting a moment but it's normal 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.670
 we are at the beginning of the season and therefore 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.770
 teams rode thanks a lot thomas of
