liked<00:06:03.660> that<00:06:03.690> a<00:06:03.810> special<00:06:04.260> take<00:06:04.470> as<00:06:04.620> soon<00:06:04.770> as<00:06:04.860> you

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:04.980 
liked that a special take as soon as you

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:05.840 
liked that a special take as soon as you
bite<00:06:05.160> into<00:06:05.340> it

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
bite into it

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.180 
bite into it
and<00:06:05.940> I<00:06:06.540> really<00:06:07.020> like<00:06:07.260> the<00:06:07.380> fact<00:06:07.500> that<00:06:07.620> they're

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:08.190 
and I really like the fact that they're

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:10.430 
and I really like the fact that they're
not<00:06:08.340> overly<00:06:08.880> sweet<00:06:09.030> which<00:06:09.960> is<00:06:10.080> something<00:06:10.260> that

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 
not overly sweet which is something that

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.830 
not overly sweet which is something that

I love about Mexican desserts is that

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.900 
I love about Mexican desserts is that
the<00:06:12.990> sugar<00:06:13.170> never<00:06:13.470> overpowers<00:06:14.190> any<00:06:14.580> of<00:06:14.790> the

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
the sugar never overpowers any of the

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.340 
the sugar never overpowers any of the
other<00:06:15.090> ingredients<00:06:15.240> that<00:06:15.660> we<00:06:15.780> used<00:06:15.990> to<00:06:16.170> bake

other ingredients that we used to bake

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:18.980
