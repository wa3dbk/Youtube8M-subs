00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
I'm so happy so I've been thinking about

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.260 
I'm so happy so I've been thinking about
what<00:00:19.890> I'm<00:00:20.010> gonna<00:00:20.100> do<00:00:20.279> with<00:00:20.609> my<00:00:20.760> character

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
what I'm gonna do with my character

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.450 
what I'm gonna do with my character
because<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.900> looks<00:00:22.080> like<00:00:22.140> crap<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:23.220> cannot

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
because it looks like crap and I cannot

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.580 
because it looks like crap and I cannot
run<00:00:23.670> around<00:00:23.760> with<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.029> level<00:00:24.269> 5<00:00:24.420> shotgun<00:00:24.900> in<00:00:25.109> PvP

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
run around with a level 5 shotgun in PvP

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.429 
run around with a level 5 shotgun in PvP
nor<00:00:26.070> in<00:00:26.250> bosses<00:00:26.820> so<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.630> logical<00:00:28.199> alternative

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
nor in bosses so the logical alternative

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.569 
nor in bosses so the logical alternative
is<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.460> either<00:00:29.840> jump<00:00:30.840> up<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.080> clip<00:00:31.320> or<00:00:31.590> get<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.460> new

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
is to either jump up a clip or get a new
