00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.280 

do<00:05:26.220> you<00:05:26.370> generate<00:05:26.820> this<00:05:27.090> on<00:05:27.330> both<00:05:27.480> sides<00:05:27.840> to

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
do you generate this on both sides to

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.030 
do you generate this on both sides to
move<00:05:28.560> to<00:05:28.889> your<00:05:29.040> final<00:05:29.400> section<00:05:30.200> so<00:05:31.200> in<00:05:31.620> this

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040
