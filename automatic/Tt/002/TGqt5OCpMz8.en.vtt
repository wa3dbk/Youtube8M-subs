00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.170 
students practice their factor skills

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.959 
students practice their factor skills
it's<00:00:10.170> an<00:00:10.290> easy<00:00:10.620> game<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:11.040> learn<00:00:11.070> easy<00:00:11.580> game<00:00:11.849> to

and<00:00:16.049> as<00:00:16.199> said<00:00:16.560> this<00:00:17.039> is<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.250> family<00:00:17.760> reunion<00:00:18.060> for

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
and as said this is a family reunion for

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.439 
and as said this is a family reunion for
the<00:00:18.720> factors<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.560> so<00:00:19.830> it's<00:00:20.100> your<00:00:20.400> job<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.820> seat

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
the factors and so it's your job to seat

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.109 
the factors and so it's your job to seat
each<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.170> factors<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:23.400> they're<00:00:23.640> correct

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
each of the factors and they're correct

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.730 
each of the factors and they're correct
at<00:00:24.330> their<00:00:24.480> correct<00:00:24.810> table<00:00:25.019> so<00:00:25.380> here's<00:00:25.590> the

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
at their correct table so here's the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.099 
at their correct table so here's the
first<00:00:25.949> factor<00:00:26.550> as<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:27.390> see<00:00:27.599> doesn't<00:00:27.900> know

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
first factor as you see doesn't know

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.290 
first factor as you see doesn't know
where<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.349> go<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.650> says<00:00:28.830> eight<00:00:29.039> times<00:00:29.490> x<00:00:29.880> equals

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
where to go it says eight times x equals

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.590 
where to go it says eight times x equals
64<00:00:31.109> when<00:00:31.949> we<00:00:32.040> know<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.399> missing<00:00:32.759> factor<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.329> 8

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
64 when we know the missing factor is 8

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.950 
64 when we know the missing factor is 8
so<00:00:34.079> we<00:00:34.230> drag<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.890> drop<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:35.940> factor<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.780> one

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
so we drag and drop this factor to one

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.590 
so we drag and drop this factor to one
of<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.170> seats<00:00:37.440> at<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.649> 8<00:00:37.800> table<00:00:38.360> any<00:00:39.360> went<00:00:39.510> to

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
of the seats at the 8 table any went to

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.520 
of the seats at the 8 table any went to
a<00:00:39.660> four<00:00:39.899> tape<00:00:40.140> let's<00:00:40.290> put<00:00:40.500> him<00:00:40.590> there<00:00:41.270> 9x<00:00:42.530> times

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
a four tape let's put him there 9x times

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.459 
a four tape let's put him there 9x times
blank<00:00:44.070> equals<00:00:44.399> 54<00:00:45.180> it's<00:00:45.780> time<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.140> missing

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
blank equals 54 it's time the missing

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.139 
blank equals 54 it's time the missing
factor<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.070> 6<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:48.469> this<00:00:49.469> one<00:00:49.950> goes<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.700> six

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
factor is 6 so this one goes to the six

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.930 
factor is 6 so this one goes to the six
tables<00:00:53.120> 4x<00:00:54.120> times<00:00:54.510> blank<00:00:55.320> equals<00:00:55.559> 32<00:00:56.280> we<00:00:56.820> have

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
tables 4x times blank equals 32 we have

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.359 
tables 4x times blank equals 32 we have
another<00:00:57.239> 8<00:00:58.879> 5x<00:01:00.140> times<00:01:01.140> blank<00:01:01.770> equals<00:01:03.019> 36<00:01:04.019> and

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
another 8 5x times blank equals 36 and

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.640 
another 8 5x times blank equals 36 and
as<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.760> see<00:01:06.090> we<00:01:06.479> just<00:01:06.869> need<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.409> make<00:01:07.619> sure

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
as you see we just need to make sure

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.560 
as you see we just need to make sure
that<00:01:08.070> each<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.430> factors<00:01:08.760> goes<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.420> their

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
that each of the factors goes to their

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.340 
that each of the factors goes to their
correct<00:01:09.930> tables<00:01:10.470> nope<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.869> mean<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:12.990> do<00:01:13.170> this

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
correct tables nope I mean I do this

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.399 
correct tables nope I mean I do this
quickly<00:01:14.330> watch<00:01:15.330> what<00:01:15.540> happened<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.960> me<00:01:16.080> I'm

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
gonna purposely put one in the wrong

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.410 
gonna purposely put one in the wrong
place<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.540> 9<00:01:18.840> times<00:01:19.170> blank<00:01:19.650> equals<00:01:19.979> 36<00:01:20.610> I'm

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
place so 9 times blank equals 36 I'm

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.020 
place so 9 times blank equals 36 I'm
gonna<00:01:21.600> put<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.080> I'm<00:01:22.259> gonna<00:01:22.470> put<00:01:22.710> this<00:01:23.460> factor

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
gonna put that I'm gonna put this factor

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.609 
gonna put that I'm gonna put this factor
in<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.240> ninth<00:01:24.479> Abel<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:24.869> know<00:01:25.049> that's<00:01:25.290> wrong

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
in the ninth Abel I know that's wrong

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:30.980 
in the ninth Abel I know that's wrong
we'll<00:01:26.280> check<00:01:26.490> at<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.790> end<00:01:28.850> and<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.420> it's

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
we'll check at the end and so it's

press check and I get a family portrait

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.120 
press check and I get a family portrait
of<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.810> factors<00:02:12.290> all<00:02:12.530> at<00:02:12.769> this<00:02:12.920> family

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
of the factors all at this family

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.150 
of the factors all at this family
reunion<00:02:13.459> now<00:02:14.060> each<00:02:14.269> time<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:14.630> play<00:02:14.870> this<00:02:15.080> game

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
reunion now each time you play this game

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.550 
reunion now each time you play this game
the<00:02:16.160> factor<00:02:16.970> tables<00:02:17.690> will<00:02:17.870> be<00:02:17.989> different<00:02:18.470> and

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
the factor tables will be different and

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.720 
the factor tables will be different and
the<00:02:18.680> problems<00:02:19.040> will<00:02:19.130> be<00:02:19.220> different<00:02:19.580> so<00:02:19.610> it

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
the problems will be different so it

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.670 
the problems will be different so it
