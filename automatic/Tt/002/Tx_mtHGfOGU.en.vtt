00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.300
 Central American and Caribbean 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.280
 Sir, I think that 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.160
 failure in the attempt to win the 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.740
 games if I do not think it's been a bad 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.200
 result according to the amount of 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.510
 medals high efficiency that was missed 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.010
 efficiency in achieving that many times 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.270
 socks became golds because what 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.750
 what counts to win a few games 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.570
 Central Americans but yes if the goal was 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.420
 win the failure games was planned 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.989
 lamen the date was planned to have those 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.460
 disciplines that Cuban has of 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.680
 chocolate but but it is true that 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.230
 Cuba you do not put is because he has no 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.090
 money now if you do not do it while Cuba 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.920
 go compete with your Central Americans 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.920
 mexico hardly won them and it is that 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.600
 the difference between the forums are not 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.600
 Many 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.610
 [Music] 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.660
 Mexico is the only one that has more than 300 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.660
 medals 332 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.110
 by sports mexico failed miserably 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.890
 basketball baseball cases swimming or shooting 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.560
 with arch 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.300
 good and what you tell me in general is a 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.580
 decent result because they are more than 300 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.590
 medals me my water point caused 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.690
 with knit as always, even though 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.300
 your chocolate medals that the birds 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.460
 are your chocolate is fine I'm staying 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.930
 with the idea to the population that brings you 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.180
 this we have a country with a problem 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.940
 severe obesity is that you do not 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.600
 we need to encourage people to see 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.600
 sport 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:02:01.740
 the health and activation problem 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:02:01.740
 Physical sports and health is not a problem 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:28.730
 a boy looking for a salad in a 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.730
 restaurant 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:58.439
 it's a relationship, it will not have to do 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:03:11.299
 the goal in diversity what is 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:11.299
 saying because he has nothing else 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.400
 It is a public health problem heaven 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.170
 slopes are going to win the ball 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.760
 because I do not need anything 300 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.160
 medals there you will owe it according to 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.640
 see the truth if it should be created I'm 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.760
 in agreement with you a strategy in 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:34.010
 where athletes invite you to 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.010
 do sport to be active as you 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:43.790
 supports them we return to the subject 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.830
 the secretary public education already 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.830
 own sell chips 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:07.170
 businesses see occurred or that of 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.360
 pole but it should be a factor for 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.790
 eliminate the public health problem poly 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.740
 4 but the bad physical action the 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.590
 physical activity is what is going to 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:20.299
 solve the fair with the height of the 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.299
 feeding things by pulling alone 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:38.099
 if you're worried about that, it's not because 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.719
 we do not start because every father family 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:41.400
 worry about that to see your sports 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:43.259
 Blood that helps you helps you 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.819
 enough public spaces so that 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:47.490
 we three hundred and many medals 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:53.900
 it's good that they are cut it is clear that the 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:53.900
 problem in this country is more concerned 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.770
 in Mexico City 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.719
 of three thousand five thousand pesos there 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.580
 public places where you 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:13.080
 you find yourself because nothing else goes up 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.500
 your car takes you to your driver and not 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.500
 raisins 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:23.760
 in the morning and in the night 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:36.760
 do sport walking up stairs 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:39.130
 to do is to do sport is a system of 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.440
 rules with processes is something else the 

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.780
 sports development has to see a lot 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.660
 there is a public policy very father to the 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:49.000
 massive social public policy let me 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.170
 finish because then it is the secretariat 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.540
 of health the one that has to worry 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.760
 because the population is activated not the 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.920
 concede and it is the error that it has because 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.330
 zone or if who the budget can not 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.370
 impact on the 130 million 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:03.880
 inhabitants because with the 4 billion 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:06.220
 of pesos does not compare nor in 5% of 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.410
 health benefits because it is not convenient 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.150
 overcoming apples the technical things 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.100
 go with the elite of the development of 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.830
 sport this country that has to do with 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:17.410
 competition with the quality of 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.889
 sport did not count anything to do with the 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:24.629
 Obesity since nothing to do 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:30.369
 advertising and coming back he responds 

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:32.229
 27 minutes we return we carried out the 

00:06:30.369 --> 00:06:33.669
 end of athletics in the marathon from 

00:06:32.229 --> 00:06:36.069
 the adolfo lópez boulevard mateos in 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:38.499
 Veracruz starting and reaching the iconic 

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:41.229
 boardwalk where Cuba took the test 

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:43.689
 manly with richi pérez and in the feminine 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:46.389
 margarita hernández de mexico besides 

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:51.899
 take a record of the games with 241 

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:51.899
 16 presents me a lot since that victory 

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:57.350
 is the advance to the other victories that 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:59.930
 I think they wanted to come according to my 

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.400
 work and sacrifice and it represents a lot 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:04.390
 and a lot for my country 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.860
 also because in the medal table 

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:09.440
 We ratify the first position on 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:11.870
 first goal that we had not of the 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.370
 medal the second goal was they are 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.610
 break the record if you had the 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.780
 opportunity or depending on the dilemma 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:19.730
 unfortunately it could be, it's good 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.800
 very happy, it's been more than 20 years 

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:24.020
 this challenge was not broken 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:25.730
 margarida does it and is very satisfied 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:28.730
 I am demonstrating with facts that 

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:30.170
 I have the sporty quality and and I'm 

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.330
 winning the gold medal 

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:34.550
 breaking the Central American record and 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:36.560
 Well, there's no better, there's no better 

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:38.780
 foundation that this not for the 

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.460
 supports so they continue giving and that no 

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.170
 let's have pretexts that's why you can 

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.150
 situations to not have a good 

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.770
 preparation the last gold medal 

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:48.260
 He arrived for Mexico on dives with 

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:50.660
 Dolores Hernández being the third to 

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:53.210
 the now champion on three trampoline 

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.660
 meters the truth I really like to be in 

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.280
 my 

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.980
 be in my house with all my 

00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:00.470
 family watching me and I think that by 

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:02.870
 that's what I know much better medals is 

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:05.120
 something father that the 

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:07.340
 expectations that nailed and it's a 

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.530
 good sport and that in Mexico has the 

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:13.280
 level in this way ferron mexico the 

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:15.950
 games with 115 gold medals 14 less 

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:18.820
 of the budget after 16 days of 

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.820
 competition
