you'll<00:02:16.320> make<00:02:16.530> this<00:02:16.680> really<00:02:17.220> pretty<00:02:17.400> wave<00:02:17.700> in

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
you'll make this really pretty wave in

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.110 
you'll make this really pretty wave in
there<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:18.420> you<00:02:18.480> just<00:02:18.660> take<00:02:18.810> your<00:02:18.930> finger<00:02:18.990> and

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
there and you just take your finger and

there and you just take your finger and
dig<00:02:21.120> down<00:02:21.390> into<00:02:21.720> that<00:02:21.959> trough<00:02:22.290> that<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.680> made

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
dig down into that trough that you made

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.250 
dig down into that trough that you made
on<00:02:23.070> both<00:02:23.250> sides<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.970> smooth<00:02:24.420> out<00:02:24.720> your<00:02:24.780> edge

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
on both sides to smooth out your edge

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.880 
on both sides to smooth out your edge
and<00:02:25.800> then<00:02:26.430> make<00:02:26.670> another<00:02:27.000> wave<00:02:27.560> maybe<00:02:28.560> going

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
and then make another wave maybe going

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.470 
and then make another wave maybe going
in<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.069> opposite<00:02:29.489> direction<00:02:29.550> to<00:02:30.150> make<00:02:30.300> it<00:02:30.420> a

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
in the opposite direction to make it a

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.060 
in the opposite direction to make it a
little<00:02:30.630> bit<00:02:30.810> more<00:02:30.900> interesting<00:02:31.470> rocking<00:02:31.950> it

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
little bit more interesting rocking it

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.610 
little bit more interesting rocking it
back<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.310> forth<00:02:33.050> with<00:02:34.050> even<00:02:34.530> pressure<00:02:35.030> and

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
back and forth with even pressure and

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.720 
back and forth with even pressure and
then<00:02:37.620> taking<00:02:37.950> your<00:02:37.980> finger<00:02:38.430> through<00:02:38.670> the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
then taking your finger through the

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.000 
then taking your finger through the
trough<00:02:39.000> again<00:02:39.560> your<00:02:40.560> modeling<00:02:40.980> chocolate

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
trough again your modeling chocolate

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.430 
trough again your modeling chocolate
will<00:02:41.610> need<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.880> be<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.360> little<00:02:42.780> bit<00:02:42.900> cooler<00:02:43.110> than

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
will need to be a little bit cooler than

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.690 
will need to be a little bit cooler than
room<00:02:43.620> temperature<00:02:43.650> so<00:02:44.280> if<00:02:44.370> you're<00:02:44.489> working

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
room temperature so if you're working

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.250 
room temperature so if you're working
with<00:02:44.850> warm<00:02:45.300> modeling<00:02:45.750> chocolate<00:02:45.780> it<00:02:46.230> will

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
with warm modeling chocolate it will

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.500 
with warm modeling chocolate it will
make<00:02:46.470> your<00:02:46.590> job<00:02:46.650> a<00:02:46.950> little<00:02:47.190> bit<00:02:47.430> harder<00:02:47.880> when

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
make your job a little bit harder when

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.680 
make your job a little bit harder when
to<00:02:48.660> cool<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:49.019> off<00:02:49.170> in<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.410> fridge<00:02:50.420> to<00:02:51.420> get<00:02:51.600> it

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
to cool it off in the fridge to get it

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.440 
to cool it off in the fridge to get it
nice<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:51.930> cool<00:02:52.410> so<00:02:52.860> in<00:02:53.100> these<00:02:53.280> mid<00:02:53.640> sections

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
nice and cool so in these mid sections

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.420 
nice and cool so in these mid sections
I'm<00:02:54.840> just<00:02:55.080> coming<00:02:55.350> around<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:56.750> marking<00:02:57.750> more

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
I'm just coming around and marking more

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.600 
I'm just coming around and marking more
smaller<00:02:59.430> lines<00:02:59.880> with<00:03:00.180> my<00:03:00.330> wavy<00:03:00.600> tool<00:03:01.459> just<00:03:02.459> to

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
smaller lines with my wavy tool just to

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.740 
smaller lines with my wavy tool just to
make<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:02.970> little<00:03:03.209> bit<00:03:03.600> more<00:03:03.780> interesting

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.509 

and<00:03:09.750> so<00:03:10.440> let's<00:03:10.560> do<00:03:10.739> one<00:03:11.100> last<00:03:11.519> line<00:03:13.160> and<00:03:14.160> then

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
and so let's do one last line and then

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.729 
and so let's do one last line and then
we're<00:03:15.090> going<00:03:15.299> to<00:03:15.329> airbrush<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:16.350> add<00:03:16.500> some

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
we're going to airbrush to add some

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.990 
we're going to airbrush to add some
gradient<00:03:17.220> color<00:03:19.160> so<00:03:20.160> we've<00:03:20.310> got<00:03:20.519> some<00:03:20.730> pretty

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
gradient color so we've got some pretty

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.030 
gradient color so we've got some pretty
bright<00:03:21.360> green<00:03:21.720> modeling<00:03:22.170> chocolate<00:03:22.200> we've

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
bright green modeling chocolate we've

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.740 
bright green modeling chocolate we've
used<00:03:23.280> the<00:03:23.400> wavy<00:03:23.640> tool<00:03:23.820> to<00:03:23.940> make<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.209> waves<00:03:24.420> and

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
used the wavy tool to make the waves and

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.690 
used the wavy tool to make the waves and
I'm<00:03:24.870> going<00:03:25.079> to<00:03:25.110> airbrush<00:03:25.560> with<00:03:25.950> royal<00:03:26.340> blue

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
I'm going to airbrush with royal blue

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.870 
I'm going to airbrush with royal blue
airbrush<00:03:27.209> color<00:03:27.510> I'm<00:03:28.079> going<00:03:28.350> to<00:03:28.590> come<00:03:28.920> at<00:03:29.160> the

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
airbrush color I'm going to come at the

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.880 
airbrush color I'm going to come at the
modeling<00:03:30.239> chocolate<00:03:30.269> from<00:03:30.810> the<00:03:30.870> top<00:03:31.230> end<00:03:31.530> and

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
modeling chocolate from the top end and

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.800 
modeling chocolate from the top end and
just<00:03:32.519> giving<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:32.820> quick<00:03:33.060> motion<00:03:33.600> back<00:03:33.780> and

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
just giving a quick motion back and

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.140 
just giving a quick motion back and

forth and all of that pretty blue color

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.710 
forth and all of that pretty blue color
is<00:03:37.190> finding<00:03:38.190> its<00:03:38.310> way<00:03:38.430> on<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.030> top<00:03:39.299> part<00:03:39.630> of

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
is finding its way on the top part of

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.680 
is finding its way on the top part of
the<00:03:39.840> wave<00:03:39.989> and<00:03:40.380> the<00:03:41.250> green<00:03:41.610> is<00:03:41.910> same<00:03:42.180> deep

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
the wave and the green is same deep

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.720 
the wave and the green is same deep
inside<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.380> wavy<00:03:43.590> tool<00:03:43.890> and<00:03:44.040> this<00:03:44.160> is<00:03:44.280> a<00:03:44.310> great

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
inside the wavy tool and this is a great

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.470 
inside the wavy tool and this is a great
effect<00:03:45.269> for<00:03:45.540> water<00:03:45.900> or<00:03:46.760> wind<00:03:47.760> or<00:03:48.239> something
