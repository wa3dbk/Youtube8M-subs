00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 Today I show how to use his ipad 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.460
 set up a new apple if you have it 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.130
 just bought fresh I show it 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.710
 on an ipad mini it also applies to 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.350
 all other ipad models and this one 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.920
 tutorial will also work with an ipad mini 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.470
 recorded as the first should if the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.630
 Select language German in this case 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.880
 is already raked at I press 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:31.189
 here on the arrow top right for 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.050
 further then the language is changed 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.270
 So now we have such a world map here 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.460
 and we should be our country and ours 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.469
 select region that is in this case 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.950
 Germany and I drink right again 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:47.309
 on top of next now the wlan is looking for 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.200
 networks and also finds some me 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.780
 want to mainzer outlook trick easy 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.329
 it thus is the have the password 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.710
 baby quickly 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.870
 I have the password for my wifi 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.180
 entered and through the networks 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.359
 this does not connect the password 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.470
 knows that stands on the dsl-router 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:11.640
 mostly in the back part as well 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:14.990
 wp or wpa key marked now 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.490
 I have to keep pushing 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.369
 Now it asks me the location services 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.439
 I want to activate that then I would like 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.810
 the ipad can be mine too 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.070
 current position eg on a map 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.320
 Show or I can one 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.829
 Search for an environment in a phone book app 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.950
 do 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.229
 Now I want to know that means I mean 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.159
 configure new carey or want 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.210
 I do that from a backup 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.470
 restore 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.430
 I judge now as a new device 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.020
 take that on a backup 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.360
 restore I show in one 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.180
 another video to find my channel 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.810
 viva la mexico 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:54.509
 so now i would need an apple id if 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.149
 I have no apple id of what I have now 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.619
 in this example go out then press 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.119
 I'm here on it if I have a kind 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.210
 Of course I can press on it 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.759
 that is quite easy I do 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.429
 create it now with free apple id 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.330
 further what I need in each case 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.180
 is one 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.160
 the e- mail address first I should 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.770
 now specify the date of birth that is 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:22.050
 I can wheel here with these 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.400
 set the date of birth to do that 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.950
 I just go fast and push 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.690
 then on the top right on next in the next 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.670
 I should then step the first name and 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.380
 Enter the last name I do 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.610
 now too 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.100
 Of course I have the right one 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.150
 first names he will not 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.010
 released 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.620
 it's just that he's too 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.840
 bills will be sent if you 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.580
 Buying something in the app store and that should 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.950
 then, of course, a real name 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.400
 so now the ipad wants to be used 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.670
 I know if I have a free e-mail address 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.340
 from iCloud or if i want one 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.290
 I would like to use the current address 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.790
 would like to use a current one and go 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.320
 on further and now I give mine here 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.680
 e-mail address 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.380
 I have entered everything now and want 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.100
 Apple still security questions from me 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.890
 I have to choose from later press on 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.739
 then this will be reset 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.080
 the password needed are so 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.900
 How was her mother born in 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.860
 cetera here you have the license agreement 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.860
 still accept 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.680
 then apple would like to know if he has one 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.170
 We would like to use cloud 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.300
 there are automatically backups so 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.300
 fuses from the device and the 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:46.050
 Settings on the apple servers 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.880
 we can do this too 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.890
 Again, we choose that extra too 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.510
 create the backup in the iCloud 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.630
 would like or rather on our computer 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.430
 that's also what you have to do then 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.110
 of course the ipad again and again 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.120
 connect to the computer I want that 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:06.709
 rather have the icloud and press 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:09.360
 On then so the question is whether you 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.950
 turn on this ordinal function 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.880
 would like to be pleased by one 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.560
 intern can happen from 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.630
 if you look at it for example 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.729
 lost or if it stole one 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.140
 has been 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.720
 we want to use go to 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.400
 continue 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:28.560
 then they still want to know if he's her 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.569
 So want to use this digital 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.520
 assistant in the end a 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:34.710
 Speech recognition is what I want and 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.830
 go on further diagnosis and 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:42.090
 Usage behavior I'll go 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:48.630
 broadcast continue and now go 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:51.750
 there it is already and now have fun with it 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.599
 the ipad who is unsure of the first 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:57.240
