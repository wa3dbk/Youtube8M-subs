00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.170 

essentially<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:03.240> idea<00:00:03.270> is<00:00:03.720> that<00:00:03.750> you<00:00:05.180> can

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
essentially the idea is that you can

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.570 
essentially the idea is that you can
check<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.540> locations<00:00:07.080> for<00:00:07.410> example<00:00:07.919> I<00:00:08.160> want

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
check the locations for example I want

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.530 
check the locations for example I want
to<00:00:08.700> go<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:08.820> the<00:00:08.970> thumb<00:00:09.150> new<00:00:09.360> stadium<00:00:11.360> and<00:00:12.360> there

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
to go to the thumb new stadium and there

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.110 
to go to the thumb new stadium and there
you<00:00:12.630> have<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:13.500> possibilities<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:14.400> i<00:00:14.580> have<00:00:14.759> 6

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
you have the possibilities that i have 6

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.090 
you have the possibilities that i have 6
37<00:00:15.809> minutes<00:00:16.109> there's<00:00:16.560> not<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.710> particularly

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
37 minutes there's not a particularly

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.490 
37 minutes there's not a particularly
interesting<00:00:17.720> in<00:00:18.720> or<00:00:18.840> out<00:00:18.990> because<00:00:19.289> you<00:00:19.350> don't

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
interesting in or out because you don't

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.990 
interesting in or out because you don't
have<00:00:19.560> multiple<00:00:20.039> options<00:00:20.130> that<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:20.640> try<00:00:20.820> one

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
have multiple options that you try one

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.519 
have multiple options that you try one
later<00:00:21.240> but<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:21.539> can<00:00:21.750> just<00:00:21.900> click<00:00:22.080> on<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.380> now

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
are basically long to you know the

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.160 
are basically long to you know the
routing<00:00:57.989> in<00:00:58.140> over<00:00:58.500> five<00:00:58.680> mins<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.690> I<00:01:00.690> think

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
routing in over five mins and I think

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.700 
routing in over five mins and I think
how<00:01:02.010> many<00:01:02.190> will<00:01:02.430> have

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
how many will have

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:09.750 
how many will have
static<00:01:03.550> schedules<00:01:03.910> /<00:01:07.920> /<00:01:08.920> AP<00:01:09.100> with<00:01:09.340> schedules

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
static schedules / / AP with schedules

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.600 
static schedules / / AP with schedules
and<00:01:10.090> and<00:01:10.420> two<00:01:11.409> we<00:01:11.590> have<00:01:11.740> with<00:01:11.979> right<00:01:12.250> but

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
and and two we have with right but

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.100 
and and two we have with right but
that's<00:01:12.729> going<00:01:12.909> to<00:01:12.970> go<00:01:13.090> up<00:01:13.240> so<00:01:13.479> one<00:01:13.600> more<00:01:13.840> than<00:01:14.080> I

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
that's going to go up so one more than I

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.920 
that's going to go up so one more than I
have<00:01:14.260> life<00:01:14.670> updates<00:01:15.670> and<00:01:15.970> one<00:01:16.479> more<00:01:16.690> going<00:01:16.869> to

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
subways you know prams everything and

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:25.770 
subways you know prams everything and
then<00:01:24.909> again<00:01:25.149> you<00:01:25.270> know<00:01:25.360> you<00:01:25.479> can<00:01:25.630> of<00:01:25.750> course

station so you click on this and it will

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.940 
station so you click on this and it will
actually<00:01:30.399> now<00:01:30.700> to<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.990> know<00:01:32.110> calculate<00:01:32.710> the

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
actually now to you know calculate the

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.139 
actually now to you know calculate the
pedestrian<00:01:33.729> route<00:01:33.880> in<00:01:34.570> here<00:01:34.960> to<00:01:35.910> you<00:01:36.910> know<00:01:36.970> the

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
pedestrian route in here to you know the

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.690 
pedestrian route in here to you know the
train<00:01:37.330> station<00:01:37.750> at<00:01:37.869> possibility<00:01:38.770> convenience

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
train station at possibility convenience

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.880 
train station at possibility convenience
you<00:01:39.820> can<00:01:39.880> see<00:01:40.119> we<00:01:40.869> would<00:01:41.020> walk<00:01:41.170> acting<00:01:41.619> ear

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
you can see we would walk acting ear

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.310 
you can see we would walk acting ear
right<00:01:42.220> to<00:01:42.490> the<00:01:42.759> tickets<00:01:43.420> an<00:01:43.539> x<00:01:43.720> value<00:01:43.840> to<00:01:44.259> it

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
right to the tickets an x value to it

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.440 
right to the tickets an x value to it
here<00:01:44.860> and<00:01:45.039> then<00:01:45.130> you<00:01:45.610> know<00:01:45.700> if<00:01:45.820> it's<00:01:45.970> okay<00:01:46.270> now

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
here and then you know if it's okay now

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.450 
here and then you know if it's okay now
that<00:01:46.570> you<00:01:46.690> see<00:01:46.840> how<00:01:47.530> I<00:01:47.560> move<00:01:47.800> from<00:01:47.979> there<00:01:48.220> and

that you see how I move from there and

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.969 
that you see how I move from there and
then<00:01:48.580> how<00:01:48.759> do<00:01:49.690> I<00:01:49.750> get<00:01:49.929> to<00:01:50.110> the<00:01:50.229> stadium<00:01:50.470> on<00:01:50.920> the

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
then how do I get to the stadium on the

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.730 
then how do I get to the stadium on the
other<00:01:51.280> side<00:01:51.610> when<00:01:52.450> when<00:01:53.080> I<00:01:53.200> get<00:01:53.410> out<00:01:53.530> of<00:01:53.560> the
