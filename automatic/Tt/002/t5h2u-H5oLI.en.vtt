00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.609
 yes what people I am those and again 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:09.390
 Today I show you boys very easily 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.330
 that best suits a hi tape 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.800
 with band and one 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:21.509
 toilet paper tinker a column 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:29.460
 then you have to first have a house 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:30.720
 still cut when you go through it so 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.000
 the shipping and here one more 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:40.050
 opening has what you do that 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:49.340
 take toilet paper then you have to 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:52.920
 just that is just this week 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:56.339
 continue to open and then die over 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.670
 and if we fell on it over 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:58.670
 Has 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.799
 then you can actually just 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.619
 still with the painter then tied here and so 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.369
 were gentlemen and then you are telling yourself 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.430
 no matter how much tape you should take 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.259
 just make a good stop 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.149
 so it looks at the conclusion sitting 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.030
 the tape is still love and now 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:24.720
 I tell you again powerfully 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.820
 ammunition that were I can do anything 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.350
 I prefer to use 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:34.259
 pebbles around this often this often 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.280
 then you have to ball 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:41.070
 then do the beadball in the distance and 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.159
 Shoot some food like you do 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.049
 here it is allowed to see easily 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.920
 a few equality and equality 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.159
 yes that is actually paper 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:02:04.439
 that could just be so loose flaky 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:02:07.350
 through and then to shoot it 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:15.480
 Just take the child to the back 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:18.390
 pull and then shoot and that's one 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.760
 new hole and the ball remained and 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.650
 went through the paper 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.940
 and yes I hope we see each other 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.940
 next time until then
