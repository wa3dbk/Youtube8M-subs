00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.700
 particular that the skin can have and 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.500
 well then to see if I wait but 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.939
 Of course you liked me who has 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.490
 that has from here our is fifth 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.950
 video consists 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.119
 and good I will explain you but 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.000
 explains I'm going to take advantage and I'm going to 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:40.630
 explain how you did it not because it's a 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 but as it is like once done 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.159
 install it in google to play 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.899
 with him good so what you have to 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.509
 do to make a skin so that world 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:53.289
 you almost have to have fingers 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.000
 programitas one is the asset browser that 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.009
 is this I will leave the description still 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.830
 so what do you do that what you have to 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.720
 do is give file open and give 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.759
 search where you have installed 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.270
 our your club the one that I have it 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:10.149
 what to put in game football to accept 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.489
 so then what I do is pose 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.540
 for example get off because I want 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:20.319
 modify the food head I look for 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.180
 human human head example a courier 1 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.530
 valley with and if you want to extract the 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.780
 file to be able to modify it with the 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.150
 another program like teaching simply 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.980
 the selection eyes right button extract 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.860
 and you say for example desktop 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.680
 places with the desk 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.590
 we invite this is that we have it here to 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.390
 15 and then in the other program that 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.240
 you need is this I have it here I have 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.460
 open that is the box the editor 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:48.180
 basically with the one I made the skin 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:54.120
 and nothing then file open search the 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:55.670
 location with the head of this one seems 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.660
 what is he 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.140
 I think it's him 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.780
 the race of dwarves I do not know which one is good and 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.110
 here, basically, it modifies it is that 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.520
 basic controls for basics so that 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.520
 has more the editor 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:18.020
 ok you have the cee by pressing ce and 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.080
 clicking on a color for example in 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:24.720
 this is worth what you do is you see here 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.460
 which puts him take a sample of 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.750
 color of color that pinchase faith and 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:33.060
 you click and with the f filled jce field 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.710
 you press efe and as we already have the color 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.030
 click before we give to the efe not 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:41.940
 fill in beige the in this case we are 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.530
 few but here in it will be seen again may 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.430
 fill in the color that you want so 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.470
 if you have to fill flat colors 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.540
 Well, with this quick shortcut, 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.820
 you can do it if you want 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.330
 change a specific color you press f3 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:04:00.570
 you give f3 and you will get the color palette and 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.540
 according to use photoshop or some program that 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.770
 have color in photos or basically 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.810
 photoshop illustrator photos men what 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.220
 which it is what most everyone knows 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.660
 then you will hear the color palettes and 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.880
 simply by selecting the with 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.220
 that we want we can save samples 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.020
 personalized I say then I friendship pink 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.090
 I liked it because it was selected and 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.750
 said he has a box first like 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.460
 the color 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:26.770
 and added we have a red chestnut this and 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:29.040
 added him good adds you under control 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.040
 this 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:35.190
 it's already there because we add it here and 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.080
 we paint the color we want pink 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.850
 and the most important thing to model when 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.050
 we want to add and remove a color is 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.080
 as simple as 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.960
 with left button we add juice 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:50.650
 there you see it left button and with button 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.060
 right we remove has no greater 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.090
 complication and it's a matter of 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:58.419
 creativity and going to have vision for 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:00.250
 power to be able to model the ticket 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.949
 or what you are doing is worth 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.949
 right we remove and with left we put 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:07.150
 and it has no major problem then the 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:09.400
 next step would be to save our 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.380
 model for example I'm going to do it I'm going 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.810
 to do the test so you can see 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.120
 with what we have done for our 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.910
 nike friend's friends 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.370
 here we have I have a rogge folder 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:24.040
 I've put it good breaks nothing happens and 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.920
 what we have to do to put 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.950
 our corner in wordpress file there is no 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.780
 no pardon edit seat tab we're going to 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:35.200
 data 1 which is where we have to be 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:38.290
 the models because the others are have 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.930
 and dated has sound data 3 has the 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:43.690
 pennies of the images of the icons and 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.130
 the data 4 that does not marry 500 files 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.810
 point xml 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.780
 we do not go to data 1 we give to editing 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.010
 share and we search where we have the 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.770
 location where we have saved others 

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.780
 files here in rogue and the only thing the 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.520
 only pain in the ass that does not let you select 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.650
 all the files at once you have it 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.630
 to go one by one is a tostÃ³n 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:04.270
 well then good to have then in this case 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.070
 Well there are not many parties or come to the 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.270
 head we go to the head already I have it 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.600
 but I'm going to do it for you to see 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.440
 same editing be the next and give 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:17.480
 same the order 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:19.160
 feet the hand the see that also what 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.430
 change that is where they keep the 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.430
 arrows 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:28.169
 and the arrow of course and that's it and 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:32.430
 once here and once we have 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:35.490
 important step important step not 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.629
 we run the launcher we do not execute the 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.520
 piggy bank because if we run the launcher 

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:42.330
 we are stuck with the traffic jams 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.740
 taught before they are going to fuck and we are 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.940
 Hump and we can not we can not play 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:47.490

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:51.810
 open our cue world folder and 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:54.330
 execute the one that puts your exe point what 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:56.699
 soon that but the application point s what 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:59.069
 we execute and we can play with 

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:00.960
 our with our corner well 

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:03.270
 and only only I have left I wanted 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:06.030

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:08.270
 video that if you want like the 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:10.700

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:16.640
 thing as for any way I know what 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:18.080
 we put anything to be a 

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.840
 It would be for call of duty and any 

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.520
 moved from any weird game of all 

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.320

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.900

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.620
 to do what we're doing for that 

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.620
 entertain them to make life a 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:35.000
 a little bit easier and happier 

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:37.940
 especially for the times that are running 

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.890
