00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:13.350 

you

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.220 

and<00:05:14.069> virtually<00:05:15.069> no<00:05:15.250> strongest

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
and virtually no strongest

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.020 
and virtually no strongest
mishaps<00:05:16.770> there<00:05:17.040> that's<00:05:17.280> my<00:05:17.520> new<00:05:17.670> controller

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
mishaps there that's my new controller

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.240 
mishaps there that's my new controller
so<00:05:18.210> it<00:05:18.330> looks<00:05:18.480> like<00:05:18.660> with<00:05:19.590> the<00:05:19.710> other<00:05:19.890> tickets

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250
