00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.240
KLM and WWF-The Netherlands are partners.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.120
We combine our efforts for an innovative airline industry...

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.880
and the development of an international market
for sustainable biofuels.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.680
KLM also financially supports nature conservation initiatives…

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.480
for example the WWF Coral Triangle project.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.800
The cooperation between a nature conservation organisation
and a major airline demands some explanation.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.280
After all, flying is a burden on the environment.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.280
Flying can and must be more sustainable,
with less CO2 emission per passenger or freight unit.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.520
KLM and WWF-The Netherlands join forces...

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.520
in the development of an international market
for sustainable biofuels...

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.560
that can be cultivated without sacrificing
the food chain, or high grade nature.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.240
KLM's operations span the globe.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.720
Sustainability is a top priority for us.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.360
That is why we're proud of our record as
the most sustainable airline in the world.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.240
For the 7th consecutive time we lead the
Dow Jones Sustainability Index.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.640
KLM was the world's first airline to
extensively use biofuels on commercial flights.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.360
Flying on biofuel is still in it's infancy...

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.560
but we are well underway and will continue on this path.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.600
KLM also works on other sustainability initiatives.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.400
We strive to minimize our kerosine usage.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.560
That's important, because using less kerosine,
means less CO2 emissions.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.800
KLM also strives to reduce the weight of our airplanes.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.960
Together, KLM and WWF-The Netherlands are investing
to preserve an important part of the ocean...

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.520
between Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.000
The Coral Triangle.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.480
A nursery of sea life.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.880
Three quarters of all tropical corals can be found here.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.640
But there are big threats...

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.200
Together we work on a network of protected sea-area's...

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.640
trying to stop illegal fishing and prevent overfishing.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.840
We also try to prevent accidental by-catch of beautiful,
but endangered sea turtles.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.960
Preserving such a remarkable area
is essential for future generations.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.400
We gladly support WWF-The Netherlands
in the preservation of nature like this.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.960
The Coral Triangle might seem far away,
but overfishing is very close.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.120
That is why we advise KLM about the fish served onboard.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.400
We make sure that the fish on your plate
meets a responsible standard.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.800
We can't protect nature on our own…
Together, we strive for a living planet.
