00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.060
 a hall where nine nests another 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.620
 strategy vgc to 2014 and good in this 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.380
 I bring you a strategy of the 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.200
 four pokemon itself and a quartet 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:18.349
 complete that is necessary for a 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.349
 vgc battle and good because we're going to 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:23.170
 see these strategies to see how we 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.750
 they work and well here you can see that 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.310
 we have a organize a hook with total 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.590
 washing machine and a play 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.040
 and well let's see how it goes 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.790
 is 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.600
 the strategy ok but we put it in 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:43.200
 taiwan and turn with the assault armor that 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.760
 increases in 15 the special defense the 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.220
 skill its sand that makes 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:52.010
 rock type pokemon increase your defense 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:55.080
 in equal 15 and apart it hits all the 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.260
 of the field except for the pokemon of 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.880
 type of rock steel and earth the 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.140
 nature that we would put it will be firm 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:07.080
 the sets that we will put will be 252 a hp 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.640
 252 to attack and 4 to special defense the 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.670
 movements that we will put on it will be fist 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.770
 fire or acuaco the avalanche crush and 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.810
 clear protection if we wear the armor 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.490
 of assault we will not be able to use 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.890
 movements as protection since only 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.470
 we can attack so for example if 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.420
 we bring the jump armor instead of 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.070
 of protection we could put to 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.229
 Coca Cola 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.210
 since if we want protection since it is 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.390
 a movement practically 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.950
 indispensable in the doubles well you 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.600
 we could put the fence that makes 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.910
 the fight type movements look 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.850
 reduced by half since that 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.260
 this graph would be quite good but 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.690
 with the armor you jump a pokemon 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.270
 pretty pretty good since apart from 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.240
 tend good defenses to conserve in wings 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:56.190
 we multiply by 1.5 the physics and with the 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.040
 hard assault the 1.5 the special 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.530
 and well now let's see the second one because 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.140
 will be the workshop we will bring with 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.430
 fence row or the fence if it flies 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.200
 go rowing I know that the movements 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.640
 of ice type are diminished and the 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.700
 fence if they fly dark of any 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.740
 state to garzon has weakness for two 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.260
 to the 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.670
 to ice type attacks so 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.930
 it's quite good for us, just like the 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.000
 berry is flies since it is one of the 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.480
 pokemon that is most often burned with 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.220
 fatuous fire or things like that 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.310
 to the skill that we will put 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.319
 veil sand that makes those who does that 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.269
 this pokemon does not buy 20% of 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.430
 evasion 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.980
 when the jet skill is activated 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.720
 sand then if we take out a hook that 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.780
 already be because world pretty well already 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.080
 what 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.420
 since with veil sand we increase our 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.510
 evasion and this work is who puts 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.849
 is 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.849
 the sandblaster the cheerful nature 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:03:01.980
 that increases the speed the sets that you 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:04.560
 we would put would be 4 hp 252 attacks 252 a 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.659
 pretty fast speed the 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.659
 movements will be the basic earthquake 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:11.360
 dragon claw avalanche or substitute 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:15.080
 protection 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.780
 that does not have much explanation you assume a 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.650
 pokémon used since 2009 the nvfc 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.900
 it's so it's a pretty good Pokémon 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.239
 to the second we can close button washing machine 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.879
 that goes pretty well in conjunction with 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.730
 garzon since this pokemon can have 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:32.959
 the ability to levitate and garzon can 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.569
 use the earthquake without any 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.189
 problem without fear of being hit by the 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:41.989
 object that we will put on it or fence 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:44.480
 cider that heals 3% I think I do not say not yet 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.500
 as it is called a third of life when 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.020
 we are a third of life 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.940
 and also remains that some dreams 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.350
 preferable sometimes with remains the 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.840
 skill will be the room the only 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:59.239
 that nature has will be modest 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.599
 the special attack increases the facts 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:05.989
 that we will give you will be 122 hp of 252 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:07.819
 special attack and 144 speed the 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.700
 movements will be lightning hydro pump 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.500
 protection and fire willful fire although the 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.950
 truth instead of protection I preferred 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.530
 put him for example I know 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.739
 a download that downloads the blow to all 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.840
 of the field including our rival but 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.850
 it goes pretty well with garzon since it does not 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.350
 we can touch and link can touch 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.730
 us with the earthquake so these 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.889
 two also get along pretty well 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:32.560
 only that for example if we are in 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:35.860
 the field with our heel swing we 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.350
 we charge to him too so only 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.389
 without feeling that they will use it 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.690
 just hang chema is broken in 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:45.400
 washer put on you pump hydro discharge 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:48.880
 part has this protection a 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:51.220
 indispensable movement in vgc is the 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.690
 double fatuous fire that evil rival the 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.090
 part of going down by 13 percent in 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.530
 each turn then makes his attack 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.530
 physical is diminished by half 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:03.860
 to another in the last pokemon will be such a 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.249
 I'm sorry, but I'm a little 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.619
 cold dale play we will put life is 

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:11.749
 outside or sky table the skill will be the 

00:05:09.619 --> 00:05:14.689
 hidden ability to gale the 

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:18.949
 nature will be firm the bosses that will 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:21.619
 we will be four hp 252 attack 252 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:23.449
 skills speed movements 

00:05:21.619 --> 00:05:25.999
 that we will put on it will be wind to end straw 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:27.949
 Pink envy ism and protection avoid and 

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:30.520
 I if I say something happens to wind 

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:33.060
 always it is doing pretty well since 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.229
 how it has priority and we see that our 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.699
 Queen heel was about to fall 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:39.580
 we can put the wind in order to make 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:42.009
 that all our pokémon of our 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.199
 field of our team have a bonus 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:45.789
 pretty generous in speed so 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:47.470
 this pokemon although it will fall by 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:49.240
 some attack or anything always 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.099
 can leave the field leaving something 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.969
 pretty good pretty good for the 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:56.419
 team 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:59.509
 and good if this strategy is to attack is 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:01.610
 full attack is a strategy that does 

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:03.829
 depends on the hook sandblast 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.650
 I say of such magnitude so that gastón 

00:06:03.829 --> 00:06:10.070
 have that evasion bonus 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:12.199
 choke good defenses thanks to 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:15.870
 the two things that I mentioned the jet 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:19.020
 of sand and the vest assault 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:21.270
 larsson bestial attack do not take garzon 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.220
 he would also get along pretty well and so 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.050
 a flame also always hits very 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:27.900
 strong and apart with priority as backhand 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.950
 which is going to luxury for our 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.110
 team and you can see that this is a 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:34.230
 very offensive strategy and the truth is 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:37.050
 something that looks too much on a Monday of 

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:40.560
 2014 since you do not usually see so many 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:43.350
 strategies compromis is or more 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.690
 things now the most what you see the most are 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.550
 because we have offensive levels of 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:49.500
 vgc strategy of this occasion I hope 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.150
 that they liked it and if they liked them 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.440
 would much notice a layman a comment and 

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:53.880
 a subscription 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.810
 well it would be all thanks for watching 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.810
 this video goodbye
