00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello everyone and welcome to spying 

00:00:02.219 --> 00:00:06.180
 electro let's talk about the new vessel 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.480
 badge of a 13 its code name is 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.320
 iron if who knows if it is the next htc 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.379
 one m 10 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.200
 the fact is that htc needs to get another 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:18.240
 new flagship in this 2015 for 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.890
 to make their accounts add up and 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.230
 than in the second quarter of 2015 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.210
 they had losses and partly they were for 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.740
 its flagship one m 9 attention 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.020
 that did not give the results they wanted 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.970
 since although it had the best 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.530
 designs of all smartphones your layer 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.600
 sense is one of the most fluid of all 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.329
 android the speakers are simply 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.679
 surprising were the fact that 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.870
 your camera does not render correctly in 

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:42.210
 small spaces or low light that your 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.429
 which with this one with 810 gets hot 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.559
 quite easily and that you have 

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:47.879
 the annoying robot band type of htc 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.230
 below the screen that you want 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.969
 size to the same one that makes the 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.710
 smartphone is bigger than normal and 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.390
 its high price makes users 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.249
 decide to lean towards another smartphone 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.600
 with a better quality price and so that 

00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:59.760
 Clients regain confidence 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.350
 in the 13 new position the next the 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.110
 three most powerful companies of all the 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.500
 htc mobile phone has decided to take a 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.990
 second vocation and specifically this one 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.030
 Htc hero key to the dimensions 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.470
 practically equal to the unique treasure 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.060
 that improving the screen percentage 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.890
 the speakers have moved towards 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.810
 the sides and eliminate the band so 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.690
 annoyed I had will have a solution 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.880
 that hd will have an effect of 2.5 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.250
 dimensions the glory resistance 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.710
 glass 4 your main camera of a dragon 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.690
 focal of 1.9 what does it mean that 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.520
 would have to suppress the errors of the 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.369
 anterior chamber and its front chamber 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.530

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.399
 inside will have a ram memory of 4 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.080
 gb specifically with the model lp ddr4 and 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.610

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.290

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.080
 present or have submitted 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.759

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.220

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.020
