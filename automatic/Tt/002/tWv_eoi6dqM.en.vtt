he's trying to stay in the box it be
good<00:00:28.260> against<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.560> run<00:00:28.650> he<00:00:29.340> simply<00:00:29.730> can't<00:00:29.939> get

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
good against the run he simply can't get

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
out in time to cover that flat zone so

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.340 
out in time to cover that flat zone so
until<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.520> defense<00:00:32.880> lines<00:00:33.540> him<00:00:33.780> up<00:00:33.809> over<00:00:34.110> that

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
until the defense lines him up over that

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.049 
until the defense lines him up over that
wide<00:00:34.500> receiver<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:34.980> shut<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.280> down<00:00:35.399> we're

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
wide receiver to shut it down we're

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.400 
wide receiver to shut it down we're
going<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.270> keep<00:00:36.420> hitting<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.750> consistently

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
going to keep hitting that consistently

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.049 
going to keep hitting that consistently
and<00:00:37.680> picking<00:00:37.890> up<00:00:37.950> yards<00:00:38.370> until<00:00:38.579> they<00:00:38.790> slide

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
and picking up yards until they slide

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.720 
and picking up yards until they slide
out<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.450> take<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.690> away<00:00:40.309> once<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.520> happens

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
out and take it away once this happens

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.280 
out and take it away once this happens
we're<00:00:42.000> going<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.180> have<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.450> curl<00:00:42.930> on<00:00:43.200> the

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
we're going to have the curl on the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.040 
we're going to have the curl on the
outside<00:00:43.739> sit<00:00:44.160> behind<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.700> flat<00:00:45.090> zone<00:00:45.360> flood

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
outside sit behind that flat zone flood

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.750 
outside sit behind that flat zone flood
it<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.320> just<00:00:46.620> drop<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.039> ball<00:00:47.219> in<00:00:47.399> right<00:00:47.550> there

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
it and just drop the ball in right there

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.819 
it and just drop the ball in right there
so<00:00:47.879> as<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.210> can<00:00:48.329> see<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.989> flats<00:00:49.260> on<00:00:49.469> slides

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
so as you can see the flats on slides

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.860 
so as you can see the flats on slides
out<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.190> shuts<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.579> down<00:00:50.610> however<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.629> curl

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
out and shuts it down however the curl

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.840 
out and shuts it down however the curl
route<00:00:52.050> sits<00:00:52.410> underneath<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:53.129> deep<00:00:53.399> zone<00:00:53.610> and

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
route sits underneath that deep zone and

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.610 
route sits underneath that deep zone and
it<00:00:54.270> gives<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.570> great<00:00:54.750> window<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.199> complete

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
it gives you a great window to complete

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.610 
it gives you a great window to complete
passes<00:00:56.039> fats<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.460> curl<00:00:56.640> flats<00:00:56.879> concept<00:00:57.620> this

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
passes fats to curl flats concept this

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.900 
passes fats to curl flats concept this
is<00:00:58.770> how<00:00:58.859> we<00:00:58.920> can<00:00:59.160> beat<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.430> defense<00:00:59.730> with<00:00:59.879> a

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
is how we can beat the defense with a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.729 
is how we can beat the defense with a
horizontal<00:01:00.300> concept<00:01:01.050> by<00:01:01.109> spreading<00:01:01.440> them<00:01:01.649> out

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
horizontal concept by spreading them out

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.709 
horizontal concept by spreading them out
but<00:01:02.219> let's<00:01:02.399> look<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.699> go<00:01:02.820> vertical<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.539> really

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
but let's look to go vertical and really

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.080 
but let's look to go vertical and really
flood<00:01:04.019> those<00:01:04.199> deep<00:01:04.500> zones<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.100> pick<00:01:05.729> up<00:01:05.880> big

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
flood those deep zones and pick up big

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.280 
flood those deep zones and pick up big
yards<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.689> how<00:01:06.780> we<00:01:06.840> would<00:01:07.049> get<00:01:07.140> our

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
yards this is how we would get our

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.310 
yards this is how we would get our
vertical<00:01:07.590> passing<00:01:07.860> attack<00:01:08.720> so<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:09.900> cover<00:01:10.110> 3

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
vertical passing attack so this cover 3

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.109 
vertical passing attack so this cover 3
only<00:01:10.530> has<00:01:10.650> three<00:01:11.010> deep<00:01:11.280> zones<00:01:11.549> yet<00:01:11.820> we<00:01:11.970> have

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
only has three deep zones yet we have

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.609 
only has three deep zones yet we have
four<00:01:12.420> receivers<00:01:12.689> going<00:01:13.110> deep<00:01:13.260> with<00:01:13.380> four

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
four receivers going deep with four

four receivers going deep with four
verticals<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.189> is<00:01:14.310> going<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.490> leave<00:01:14.640> one<00:01:14.880> guy

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.670 
verticals this is going to leave one guy
open<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.570> we<00:01:15.630> simply<00:01:15.960> make<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.170> read<00:01:16.439> and

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
open and we simply make the read and

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.609 
open and we simply make the read and

deliver the football down field now it's

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.109 
deliver the football down field now it's
nearly<00:01:19.860> impossible<00:01:20.009> for<00:01:20.400> this<00:01:20.580> defense<00:01:21.000> with
