I'm not sure you know that combo and the
ultra<00:05:00.050> wouldn't<00:05:00.290> have<00:05:00.380> done<00:05:00.500> that<00:05:00.560> much

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
ultra wouldn't have done that much

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.230 
ultra wouldn't have done that much
damage<00:05:01.070> I<00:05:01.400> almost<00:05:01.550> think<00:05:01.760> it's<00:05:01.940> better<00:05:02.120> than

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
damage I almost think it's better than

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.300 
damage I almost think it's better than
that<00:05:02.510> he<00:05:02.630> has<00:05:02.810> it<00:05:02.960> as<00:05:03.050> a<00:05:03.080> weapon<00:05:03.350> right<00:05:03.770> now<00:05:03.980> but

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
that he has it as a weapon right now but

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.060 
that he has it as a weapon right now but
I<00:05:04.610> think<00:05:04.820> flow<00:05:05.150> might<00:05:05.360> have<00:05:05.450> just<00:05:05.570> wanted<00:05:05.810> to

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
I think flow might have just wanted to

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.320 
I think flow might have just wanted to
work<00:05:07.070> up<00:05:07.190> from<00:05:07.370> flow<00:05:07.550> that's<00:05:07.760> not<00:05:08.030> the<00:05:08.180> way<00:05:08.270> you

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
work up from flow that's not the way you

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.570 
work up from flow that's not the way you
want<00:05:08.540> to<00:05:08.600> end<00:05:08.720> a<00:05:08.780> tournament<00:05:09.400> putting<00:05:10.400> it<00:05:10.460> all

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
want to end a tournament putting it all

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.400 
want to end a tournament putting it all
on<00:05:10.610> the<00:05:10.730> line<00:05:10.820> with<00:05:11.210> one<00:05:11.390> uppercut<00:05:11.810> that<00:05:12.050> is

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
on the line with one uppercut that is

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.720 
on the line with one uppercut that is
the<00:05:12.530> sort<00:05:12.740> of<00:05:12.770> situation<00:05:13.250> that<00:05:13.280> creates

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
the sort of situation that creates

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.190 
the sort of situation that creates
second-guessing<00:05:14.570> when<00:05:14.810> you<00:05:14.900> get<00:05:15.020> home<00:05:15.140> you

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
second-guessing when you get home you

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.200 
second-guessing when you get home you
say<00:05:15.560> should<00:05:15.770> I<00:05:15.860> have<00:05:15.980> done<00:05:16.010> that<00:05:16.310> yeah<00:05:16.850> and<00:05:17.120> I

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
say should I have done that yeah and I

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.620 
say should I have done that yeah and I
really<00:05:17.630> that's
