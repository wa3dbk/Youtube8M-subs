00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
20 30 rounds and they're going to be

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.830 
20 30 rounds and they're going to be
relatively<00:02:14.980> accurate<00:02:15.460> especially<00:02:16.120> with<00:02:16.570> you

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
relatively accurate especially with you

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.590 
relatively accurate especially with you
know<00:02:16.960> the<00:02:18.150> some<00:02:19.150> of<00:02:19.240> the<00:02:19.270> more<00:02:19.450> accurate

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
know the some of the more accurate

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.390 
know the some of the more accurate
weapons<00:02:20.290> there<00:02:20.410> are<00:02:20.530> more<00:02:20.740> accurate<00:02:20.890> in<00:02:21.220> real

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
weapons there are more accurate in real

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.120 
weapons there are more accurate in real
life<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:21.940> for<00:02:22.300> m16<00:02:22.930> and<00:02:23.050> stuff<00:02:23.170> like<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.320> so

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
life and for m16 and stuff like that so

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.900 
life and for m16 and stuff like that so
I<00:02:24.490> think<00:02:24.940> that<00:02:25.420> is<00:02:25.930> a<00:02:26.050> big<00:02:26.470> big<00:02:27.190> improvement

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
I think that is a big big improvement

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.730 
I think that is a big big improvement
the<00:02:28.060> scopes<00:02:28.480> everything<00:02:29.080> else<00:02:29.320> look<00:02:29.500> very

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
the scopes everything else look very

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.880 
the scopes everything else look very
realistic<00:02:30.160> it<00:02:30.820> really<00:02:31.270> works<00:02:31.630> in<00:02:31.960> a<00:02:32.500> lot<00:02:32.710> of

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
realistic it really works in a lot of

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.000 
realistic it really works in a lot of
ways<00:02:33.100> um<00:02:33.460> I<00:02:34.210> think<00:02:34.510> that's<00:02:34.900> good<00:02:35.170> i<00:02:35.380> think<00:02:35.860> that

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
ways um I think that's good i think that

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.280 
ways um I think that's good i think that
they<00:02:36.130> also<00:02:36.370> does<00:02:36.820> some<00:02:37.330> nice<00:02:37.540> mix<00:02:37.840> up<00:02:38.020> you<00:02:38.140> get

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
they also does some nice mix up you get

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.900 
they also does some nice mix up you get
some<00:02:38.440> vehicle<00:02:38.860> stuff<00:02:39.070> you<00:02:39.430> get<00:02:39.550> to<00:02:39.730> laser

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
some vehicle stuff you get to laser

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:40.980 
some vehicle stuff you get to laser
sight<00:02:40.240> as<00:02:40.360> you<00:02:40.450> get<00:02:40.570> some<00:02:40.660> different<00:02:40.959> things

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
sight as you get some different things

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.830 
sight as you get some different things
like<00:02:41.170> that<00:02:41.440> i<00:02:41.680> think<00:02:42.640> overall<00:02:43.270> it's<00:02:43.720> a<00:02:43.810> great

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
like that i think overall it's a great

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.300 
like that i think overall it's a great
game<00:02:44.230> but<00:02:44.470> let<00:02:44.620> me<00:02:44.650> show<00:02:45.010> you<00:02:45.390> some<00:02:46.390> of<00:02:46.570> the

or<00:04:59.660> a<00:05:01.030> modern<00:05:02.030> warfare<00:05:02.330> I<00:05:03.340> don't<00:05:04.340> think<00:05:04.430> so<00:05:04.790> I

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
or a modern warfare I don't think so I

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.750 
or a modern warfare I don't think so I
don't<00:05:05.419> think<00:05:05.480> it<00:05:05.720> quite<00:05:05.990> gets<00:05:06.770> to<00:05:07.340> that<00:05:07.700> level

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
don't think it quite gets to that level

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.050 
don't think it quite gets to that level
that<00:05:08.570> in<00:05:09.320> my<00:05:09.500> personal<00:05:09.830> opinion<00:05:11.080> but<00:05:12.080> it's

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
that in my personal opinion but it's

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:20.530 
that in my personal opinion but it's
very<00:05:14.320> close<00:05:15.340> what<00:05:16.340> I<00:05:16.370> didn't<00:05:16.669> like<00:05:16.760> is<00:05:17.390> the<00:05:19.540> you

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:20.540 
very close what I didn't like is the you

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.740 
very close what I didn't like is the you
know<00:05:20.600> sort<00:05:20.810> of<00:05:20.930> narrowness<00:05:21.530> and<00:05:22.750> constriction

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
know sort of narrowness and constriction

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.659 
know sort of narrowness and constriction
of<00:05:24.200> some<00:05:24.560> of<00:05:24.620> the<00:05:24.710> levels<00:05:24.890> and<00:05:25.250> some<00:05:25.400> things

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
of some of the levels and some things

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:27.090 
of some of the levels and some things
you<00:05:25.790> could<00:05:25.940> do<00:05:26.030> or<00:05:26.150> what<00:05:26.270> not<00:05:26.300> there's<00:05:26.900> a<00:05:26.960> lot

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
you could do or what not there's a lot

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.610 
you could do or what not there's a lot
lot<00:05:28.100> lot<00:05:28.370> to<00:05:28.910> like<00:05:29.090> about<00:05:29.300> this<00:05:29.600> game<00:05:29.930> but<00:05:30.560> I

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
lot lot to like about this game but I

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:35.010 
lot lot to like about this game but I
think<00:05:30.919> there<00:05:31.130> was<00:05:31.340> some<00:05:33.280> limitations<00:05:34.280> there

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
think there was some limitations there

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.100 
think there was some limitations there
on<00:05:36.020> that<00:05:36.470> I<00:05:36.620> just<00:05:36.890> feel<00:05:37.160> like<00:05:37.330> like<00:05:38.330> you<00:05:38.990> know

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
on that I just feel like like you know

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.490 
on that I just feel like like you know
modern<00:05:39.440> warfare<00:05:40.000> it<00:05:41.000> has<00:05:41.180> a<00:05:41.210> lot<00:05:41.570> more<00:05:41.600> sort<00:05:42.410> of

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
modern warfare it has a lot more sort of

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.580 
modern warfare it has a lot more sort of
to<00:05:42.770> it<00:05:42.950> that<00:05:43.250> works<00:05:43.550> well<00:05:44.000> within<00:05:44.840> the<00:05:45.140> game<00:05:45.350> I

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
to it that works well within the game I

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.310 
to it that works well within the game I
think<00:05:45.770> it's<00:05:45.890> a<00:05:45.980> really<00:05:46.250> really<00:05:47.060> solid<00:05:47.480> first

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
think it's a really really solid first

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.600 
think it's a really really solid first
