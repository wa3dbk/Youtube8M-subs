00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.759
 Once upon a time, three cats lived in the attic in this barn 

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:14.229
 If there are about 20 or more, nobody knows that Willi shy cats 

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:18.970
 which uncontrollably proliferate unobserved and undisturbed by all 

00:00:18.969 --> 00:00:19.739
 People 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:22.109
 what are we going to do now? 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.730
 I have 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.999
 confusing 

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:28.869
 According to one expert, another one will keep the online access 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.220
 he can do that very well because he considers crime genocide 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.670
 a gripping duel for sure 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.720
 the return for Vettel is needed 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.020
 Susan Smith is a professional animal rights activist 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.680
 she and her fellow project Kitty take care of the 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.330
 cats 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.330
 in the last few days they usually have the animals falling 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.860
 Today they are in focus 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.960
 They try to get as many cats out of this barn as possible 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.960
 from Paderborn 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.320
 go alone in the morning in the fall per bed are almost for castration 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.010
 Motorsport keep Ben Bernanke just the usual stuff 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.010
 Then bring it to sleep and PC come to mind 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.880
 castrate the solutions to control the cat plague 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.280
 Paderborn was the first city in Germany to decide that all 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.610
 free-roaming cats have to be castrated for several thousand wild ones 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.950
 Street cats have long become a problem 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.310
 confirmed by the overpopulation of cats 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.590
 for us the concrete danger 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.780
 that diseases are transmitted not just diseases 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.710
 In the pets or in the cats rodents on humans can do that 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.030
 skip 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.060
 specifically to do so, for example, children's playgrounds 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.180
 be displaced 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.180
 Worms or the dangerous especially for pregnant women toxoplasmosis 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.620
 cats can transmit to humans through their feces 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.080
 no matter if wild roads cat or free-running domestic cat the animals 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.080
 Many cat owners are rapidly multiplying their work as well 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.760
 most expensive the people 14 he is getting educated early on 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.119
 castrate 

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:15.039
 To most people also calls understanding and understand that too 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:18.039
 Problem Foto Â«I think we are well prepared 

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:20.670
 on a farm near Paderborn 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.160
 These wild cats are already castrated regularly Susen Smith comes over 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.450
 and feed the animals when there is not enough food for all of them 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.510
 is happy and that these cats can not multiply anymore 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.169
 Stefan Haupt l lacks profit as if in the next corner 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:39.290
 Willemsen stars are the vindictive 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.980
 and wants to continue to multiply, of course, the offspring is ill again 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.450
 when these diseases get back to other cats, even to domestic cat 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.080
 next to the pictures and can party so that's just a problem without end though 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.579
 That's not a reason 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.209
 The group wants to neuter over 650 per year 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.970
 Still not to the Smith that the cats would be less 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.790
 probably take a few more years until most cats around Paderborn 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:03.849
 are castrated Â»
