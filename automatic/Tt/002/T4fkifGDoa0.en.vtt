00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600

being down by someone's knees with the
sound<00:01:10.649> all<00:01:10.890> around<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.490> encompasses<00:01:11.789> of

00:01:12.169 --> 00:01:12.179 
sound all around it encompasses of

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:13.550 
sound all around it encompasses of
viewer<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.600> like<00:01:12.719> I<00:01:12.750> said<00:01:13.020> gives<00:01:13.259> a<00:01:13.350> much

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
viewer and like I said gives a much

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.529 
viewer and like I said gives a much
fuller<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.070> richer<00:01:14.100> sound<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:14.969> the<00:01:15.000> TV<00:01:15.299> looks

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
but I've also realized the value of

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.609 
but I've also realized the value of
360-degree<00:01:33.479> beauty<00:01:33.780> which<00:01:34.109> is<00:01:34.259> why<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.409> may

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
360-degree beauty which is why you may

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.529 
360-degree beauty which is why you may
notice<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.069> back<00:01:35.219> of<00:01:35.399> the<00:01:35.490> TV<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.939> also<00:01:36.270> red

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
notice the back of the TV is also red

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:37.969 
notice the back of the TV is also red
and<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:36.990> gives<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.319> the<00:01:37.439> opportunity<00:01:37.649> to

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979
