showing<00:00:03.300> you<00:00:03.449> how<00:00:03.570> to<00:00:03.689> make<00:00:03.870> a<00:00:03.899> super<00:00:04.410> simple

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
showing you how to make a super simple

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.039 
showing you how to make a super simple
minecart<00:00:05.370> storage<00:00:05.819> system<00:00:06.180> so<00:00:06.720> here<00:00:06.930> I<00:00:06.960> have

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
minecart storage system so here I have

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.900 
minecart storage system so here I have
some<00:00:07.230> my<00:00:07.770> carts<00:00:08.099> with<00:00:08.220> chess<00:00:08.400> in<00:00:08.519> them<00:00:08.639> there

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
some my carts with chess in them there

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.110 
some my carts with chess in them there
are<00:00:09.059> five<00:00:09.599> in<00:00:09.870> here<00:00:10.170> total<00:00:10.980> so<00:00:11.700> when<00:00:11.880> I<00:00:11.910> click

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
are five in here total so when I click

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.060 
are five in here total so when I click
this<00:00:12.240> button<00:00:12.450> it<00:00:13.170> will<00:00:13.290> cycle<00:00:13.590> through<00:00:13.799> the

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
this button it will cycle through the

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.180 
this button it will cycle through the
minecarts<00:00:14.670> thus<00:00:15.480> adding<00:00:16.020> more<00:00:16.260> chests<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.920> one

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
minecarts thus adding more chests to one

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.420 
minecarts thus adding more chests to one
simple<00:00:17.580> area<00:00:17.970> for<00:00:18.449> all<00:00:18.630> your<00:00:19.039> goods<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.220> guess

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
simple area for all your goods I guess

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.439 
simple area for all your goods I guess
as<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:21.359> can<00:00:21.570> see<00:00:21.660> what<00:00:21.779> minor<00:00:21.980> goods

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
as you can see what minor goods

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:25.790 
as you can see what minor goods
alright<00:00:24.449> so<00:00:24.570> when<00:00:24.930> before<00:00:25.140> we<00:00:25.410> build<00:00:25.619> this

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
alright so when before we build this

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.800 
alright so when before we build this
keep<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:26.730> mind<00:00:26.880> you<00:00:27.000> can<00:00:27.119> only<00:00:27.300> build<00:00:27.599> this

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
keep it in mind you can only build this

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.830 
keep it in mind you can only build this
towards<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.470> south<00:00:28.769> or<00:00:29.550> towards<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.599> east

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
towards the south or towards the east

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.500 
towards the south or towards the east
it's<00:00:31.140> just<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.500> way<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.710> minecarts<00:00:32.189> work<00:00:32.510> so

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
it's just the way the minecarts work so

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.850 
it's just the way the minecarts work so
those<00:00:33.690> are<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.870> only<00:00:34.020> two<00:00:34.260> directions<00:00:34.770> you

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
those are the only two directions you

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.750 
those are the only two directions you
can<00:00:34.950> build<00:00:35.160> this<00:00:36.920> so<00:00:37.920> for<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:38.460> build<00:00:38.670> we're

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
can build this so for this build we're

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.299 
can build this so for this build we're
gonna<00:00:38.850> need<00:00:39.120> at<00:00:39.210> least<00:00:39.239> six<00:00:39.660> powered<00:00:40.050> rails

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
gonna need at least six powered rails

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.840 
gonna need at least six powered rails
one<00:00:41.309> torch<00:00:41.690> one<00:00:42.690> piston<00:00:43.170> three<00:00:44.129> minecart<00:00:44.640> send

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.630 
more the resources will become so we're
gonna<00:00:54.960> we're<00:00:55.469> gonna<00:00:55.559> need<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:55.980> dig<00:00:56.219> out<00:00:56.430> at

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
gonna we're gonna need to dig out at

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.410 
gonna we're gonna need to dig out at
least<00:00:56.879> four<00:00:57.300> blocks<00:00:58.609> come<00:00:59.609> up<00:00:59.730> two<00:00:59.910> blocks<00:01:00.180> and

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
least four blocks come up two blocks and

least four blocks come up two blocks and
then<00:01:00.780> dig<00:01:01.020> out<00:01:01.170> one<00:01:01.440> more<00:01:01.620> block<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.160> is

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
then dig out one more block so this is

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.910 
then dig out one more block so this is
gonna<00:01:02.340> be<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> one<00:01:02.820> by<00:01:02.969> seven<00:01:03.359> spacing<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.799> we're

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
gonna be a one by seven spacing so we're

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.810 
gonna be a one by seven spacing so we're
gonna<00:01:05.010> turn<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.400> way<00:01:05.840> put<00:01:06.840> a<00:01:06.960> piston<00:01:07.500> down
