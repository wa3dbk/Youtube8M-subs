00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:13.560 

truck<00:01:11.659> took<00:01:11.840> about<00:01:12.110> a<00:01:12.170> month<00:01:12.409> with<00:01:13.009> fabtech

they<00:01:14.570> had<00:01:14.659> to<00:01:14.750> order<00:01:14.960> parts<00:01:15.229> for<00:01:15.619> it<00:01:15.650> since<00:01:16.430> I

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580 
they had to order parts for it since I

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:17.889 
they had to order parts for it since I
guess<00:01:16.729> they<00:01:16.880> don't<00:01:17.030> keep<00:01:17.149> them<00:01:17.299> in<00:01:17.420> stock<00:01:17.540> even

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
guess they don't keep them in stock even

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:31.690 
guess they don't keep them in stock even
though<00:01:18.080> they're<00:01:18.290> the<00:01:18.320> manufacturer<00:01:21.430> I<00:01:30.700> did

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
though they're the manufacturer I did

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.310 
though they're the manufacturer I did
get<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:32.000> better<00:01:32.180> coil<00:01:32.479> overs<00:01:32.810> and<00:01:32.960> everything

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
get the better coil overs and everything

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.300 
get the better coil overs and everything
since<00:01:33.590> it<00:01:33.799> kit<00:01:34.009> was<00:01:34.220> pretty<00:01:35.030> much<00:01:35.180> free<00:01:36.310> I

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
since it kit was pretty much free I

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.910 
since it kit was pretty much free I
figured<00:01:38.119> why<00:01:38.299> not<00:01:38.330> I<00:01:38.750> shouldn't<00:01:39.140> get<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:39.439> the

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
figured why not I shouldn't get the the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:50.410 
figured why not I shouldn't get the the
basic<00:01:40.399> stuff<00:01:48.429> good<00:01:49.429> shots<00:01:49.670> of<00:01:49.819> the<00:01:49.909> truck<00:01:50.060> like

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
basic stuff good shots of the truck like

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.809 
basic stuff good shots of the truck like
it's<00:01:50.539> it's<00:01:50.750> a<00:01:54.130> lot<00:01:55.130> of<00:01:55.310> you<00:01:55.369> didn't<00:01:55.610> like<00:01:55.729> the

00:01:55.809 --> 00:01:55.819 
it's it's a lot of you didn't like the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:57.999 
it's it's a lot of you didn't like the
front<00:01:56.060> end<00:01:56.149> until<00:01:56.509> they<00:01:56.659> saw<00:01:56.899> it<00:01:56.959> lifted<00:01:57.860> like

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
front end until they saw it lifted like

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.160 
front end until they saw it lifted like
this<00:01:58.250> it<00:01:59.240> doesn't<00:01:59.420> look<00:01:59.569> pretty<00:01:59.659> nice<00:01:59.929> I

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
this it doesn't look pretty nice I

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.630

didn't<00:02:00.380> like<00:02:00.470> the<00:02:00.590> front<00:02:00.799> end<00:02:00.890> on<00:02:01.069> a<00:02:01.100> stock<00:02:01.399> one

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
didn't like the front end on a stock one

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.609 
didn't like the front end on a stock one
but<00:02:02.630> when<00:02:02.750> it<00:02:02.840> looks<00:02:03.020> like<00:02:03.080> this<00:02:03.289> it<00:02:03.500> looks

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
but when it looks like this it looks

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:14.770 
but when it looks like this it looks
pretty<00:02:04.159> cool<00:02:12.190> it's<00:02:13.190> right<00:02:13.370> there<00:02:13.609> the<00:02:14.540> tires

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
pretty cool it's right there the tires

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.900 
pretty cool it's right there the tires
do<00:02:15.049> stick<00:02:15.260> out<00:02:15.410> a<00:02:15.440> little<00:02:15.560> bit<00:02:15.890> let's<00:02:16.820> say

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910
