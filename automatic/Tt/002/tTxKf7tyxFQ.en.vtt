00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 good people a few months ago I took for 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.259
 browse some clips the truth is that 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.960
 I saw several that were quite rare but 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.559
 the ones that are more of the pokemon 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.900
 especially those of the first 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.839
 generation and I decided to make a video with 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.330
 the weirdest I saw the first sperm 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.119
 Cry This unfortunately I did not find 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.100
 a lot but something is something this strange 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.930
 grip can be found in the pokemon 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.750
 yellow there are several ways to 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.490
 get one of them is doing the 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.890
 failure of mine another is doing 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.290
 exchanges with the blue red pokemon and 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.600
 green to yellow can also be 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.120
 taken with james art but that way not 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.270
 I see Legally if I tell the truth 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.219
 number of this supposed pokemon is the 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.039
 205 which means that this clip is 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.539
 occupy instead of running 3 when you 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.340
 find this Poker 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.469
 chances are you freeze 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.079
 screen due to the scream that you emit 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.149
 since it is too long it depends on the 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.370
 I find the duration of the scream varies 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.289
 there are people who decide to take out this glitch 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.899
 in emulators to increase the speed 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.280
 and see how it ends but it's a loop so 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.409
 seen it has no end 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.390
 very rarely the screen does not 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.420
 freezes but the movements of this 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.640
 pokemon glow are seen when this pokemon 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.610
 appears at the beginning you can hear 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.500
 many shouts of pokemon mixed and 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.420
 good here I leave the video and if you 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.149
 they ask why the name of this 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.430
 pokemon is because when it appears alone 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:28.320
 the female symbol and the music appear 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.619
 that sounds when it appears is like a 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.619
 crying 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.840
 and 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.049
 and 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.560
 in 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:04.009
 do not 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.009
 to 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.330
 and 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.319
 and 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.319
 m 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.010
 and excrement and katsuo the scream of 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.810
 pikachu this glitch is counted as a 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.110
 creepy pasta but I found it interesting 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.180
 having proof of its existence the 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.280
 story tells that a boy when starting 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.410
 the game in the yellow pokemon put 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.600
 some codes to make it ok it 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.700
 will face my sign at the beginning of 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.070
 game but the play went wrong because 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.170
 it came out a rather weird thing was a 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.170
 strange gray that did not stop ringing 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.210
 cry of epic tzu the funny thing is that it 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.060
 was changing to the screen according to this 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:20.340
 was the reason why this is possibly 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.100
 for exploiting the game with game arts by 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.420
 I do not like to use them here I leave you the 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.420
 video that demonstrates this 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.610
 the pokemon 731 this the truth is not known 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.380
 if it is real or such as this only happened 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.840
 in the red and green pokemon betas 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.970
 this supposed pokemon appeared when 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.850
 you came to the band where the 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.010
 syndrome the band was trying to get out of 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.140
 town and stepped on the grass this pokemon 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.550
 appeared and the music of the band was 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.310
 increased speed 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.320
 this glitch better said myth is pretty 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.470
 paranoia before for the simple fact that 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.030
 has to do with the unit 731 that 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.460
 it had to do with the second war 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.250
 world and it looked like game freak had 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.650
 what to do with this good topic if you want 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.600
 know more about this what you are looking for 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.250
 themselves and since on youtube there are thousands of 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.320
 videos about this 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.980
 this glitch showed the images of 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:20.250
 commander of unit 731 if you want 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.980
 know who you are looking for yourself 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.690
 human experiments buildings etc. 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:28.140
 Here I leave the video of this strange 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.140
 myth 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:54.640
 well this has been everything and I hope that you 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.640
 I liked it, see you
