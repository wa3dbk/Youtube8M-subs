00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720
 the game 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:12.309
 And there, people on twitter, the life of magill. 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.799
 for you and here is a special video 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:17.230
 for the series saints dei of our 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.510
 Little friend adolfo today I'm doing 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.510
 here something quite different that is analyzing 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.660
 a very good clean law however that one 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.970
 in law belongs to who is the adolf himself 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.430
 hitler he already has a car 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.770
 rubinho play slackers and for those who do not know 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.199
 who you will talk to is when you get a 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.239
 English without seeing any time in this case 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:39.460
 rhodolfo took a Sunday round 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.230
 left without dying once and almost got 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.480
 the sweat 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.839
 so let's do the analysis with tips from 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.640
 round that mtow boy observing 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:50.800
 the first in his class already has his 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.329
 main feature sub machine gun 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.389
 which is a type of water that is included 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:58.299
 on the rock player's personality as is 

00:00:55.389 --> 00:01:00.699
 the student if we are to observe his pacs 

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:02.409
 we notice that he is not using prix 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.290
 that match much with the game mode 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:07.090
 current the dominion pecs as the vest 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.979
 ballistic and mask the rate that are 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.720
 very good for me nation because in 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.039
 areas capture the enemy's flag 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.409
 always quite often they use 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:17.590
 equipment such as our grenades 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.060
 imbeciles shox stans flashes 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.399
 then we can see that the mentality 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.710
 of the adolf in this match is not to capture the 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.600
 flag said yes and to the rivers to 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.939
 help your team capture the 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.219
 flags and realize that all 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.149
 fish fit the rest of your 

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:33.850
 class 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.469
 starting with the ghost it fits 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.579
 You may well be using a weapon with 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:38.320
 silencer 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:40.810
 that is most of the time we will be 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.659
 off the radar since it makes the connection with r 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.600
 a break 2.3 the maximum conditioning 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.369
 which allows you to run for a longer duration 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.659
 and since goucher does not work with 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.670
 we are standing 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.439
 he is going to take more than I lost in 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.450
 It can help both stay talking and walk. 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.259
 with faster arrival to the flag of 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.210
 mines 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.729
 and to finish our profile well 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.340
 the hard line that makes a great 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.590
 combination with the type of school that 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.009
 Using alonso is using twix schools 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.789
 very high then the bonus points that sp 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.240
 which gives 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.970
 it will help a lot now the strong point 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.350
 the part of the litter can get 97 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.090
 that means your strategy is 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.670
 working well 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.560
 defended exits to where the enemy gave 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.940
 while his friends to a flag of 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.099
 a calmer way 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.349
 So is something is benefiting both 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.660
 both adolfo and managed to stay there in 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:35.489
 up on the score board with his team that 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.489
 got points to win the match 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.599
 here the student came the risk of assault 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.160
 in 8 to 1 of the floor 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:47.170
 if you do not have the name in your mouth it will 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.040
 end up becoming a very difficult weapon 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.220
 to use 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.690
 however as the pain was the player of 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.160
 competitive and this has made us a great 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:56.530
 problem out there 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.480
 rodolfo used the technique called junk shot 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.209
 When you have to kill someone giving 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.099
 a little jump and starts throwing a 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:05.079
 very good technique and using a player 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:08.079
 competitive some players the pilot already 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:10.480
 I saw this comes also the middle one radio 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:12.519
 great player that mines the fex 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.620
 if you do not know does not look that 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.780
 you will find it is one of the best 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.549
 code players I've seen almost every 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.510
 Sometimes I see him play. 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.670
 use this 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.829
 so it's the tip you already have with 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.130
 the drop shock and also the market leaving 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:29.049
 42 your aim she says shirt when you 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.200
 xque canal ducts 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:35.620
 then this technique is now shown by 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.510
 to be neither in English can perceive 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.060
 easily strategy used by the child 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.209
 received the team on the map in this way if 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.060
 eb captured 1 for positioning 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:48.459
 from the globe with friends since the time 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.340
 he played most advanced team was is 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.419
 catching the enemy players precisely 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.489
 on leaving the hospital 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:56.769
 then it circulates there in this line of 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.410
 front of the flag to see if it 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:01.359
 enemies and ends up taking some of that 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.760
 way to pain shape the majority of the team 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:05.889
 enemy and in case some guy goes through 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.470
 they will see it will come a way 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:09.970
 see almost alone and will be well 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.859
 It's difficult for him to do something. 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.889
 because behind there is guiding all 

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:17.019
 teammates thanks to the 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:20.019
 cuts made ontou the mining team 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.270
 could determine three ways on the way 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.580
 church which has a positive is a 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.960
 negative point the positive factor is that the 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.110
 team will win many points 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.270
 quickly but the downside is that 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.510
 the remaining thousand are all confused 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:37.960
 all mixed in the hard always v8 amg 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:40.720
 But you do not have a gate 7 1 to 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.030
 1 and 20 and also complicated and is more 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.750
 have no thigh muscles and no 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.070
 sex or the same r7 but as the team 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.870
 was completely dominating the match 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.480
 thanks to an escort xix 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.160
 the value of the transaction flags was not 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.260
 a major problem that only serves to 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.490
 to leave the most desperate enemies of the 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.590
 which was already 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.330
 I always say that a fashion girl 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.450
 mine would be in the first round you 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.520
 played their goal and try to accumulate 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.960
 maximum of constancy of cars in the 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.600
 according to you see that some who use 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.050
 here and pick up the constants that come back 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.750
 only schools cheats like hv 71 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.060
 dollars and it's just them that they will 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.250
 solve the game for you and it's easy 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:23.580
 is dominating two flags a soul b 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:27.780
 A sap and you end up winning. 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.780
 so the trick is there
