acting it's very shaky it's very shaky
sometimes<00:04:52.710> the<00:04:52.830> voice<00:04:52.950> acting<00:04:53.310> is<00:04:53.400> really

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
sometimes the voice acting is really

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.060 
sometimes the voice acting is really
great<00:04:53.850> but<00:04:54.420> most<00:04:54.600> of<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:54.780> time<00:04:54.960> it's<00:04:55.560> not<00:04:55.800> I

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
great but most of the time it's not I

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.920 
great but most of the time it's not I
was<00:04:56.220> actually<00:04:56.370> very<00:04:56.670> conflicted<00:04:57.450> as<00:04:57.690> to

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
was actually very conflicted as to

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.420 
was actually very conflicted as to
whether<00:04:58.080> I<00:04:58.140> should<00:04:58.290> mute<00:04:58.620> the<00:04:58.860> voices<00:04:59.220> or<00:04:59.370> I

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430 
whether I should mute the voices or I

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.710 
whether I should mute the voices or I
should<00:04:59.580> keep<00:04:59.700> them<00:04:59.880> in<00:05:00.330> the<00:05:00.420> end

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
should keep them in the end

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.180 
should keep them in the end
I<00:05:00.780> decided<00:05:01.140> to<00:05:01.260> keep<00:05:01.410> them<00:05:01.620> because<00:05:01.830> it<00:05:01.920> adds<00:05:02.070> a

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
I decided to keep them because it adds a

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.430 
I decided to keep them because it adds a
little<00:05:02.340> bit<00:05:02.460> of<00:05:02.640> extra<00:05:02.940> to<00:05:03.240> the<00:05:03.270> gameplay<00:05:03.720> but

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
little bit of extra to the gameplay but

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.290 
little bit of extra to the gameplay but
for<00:05:05.100> the<00:05:05.160> most<00:05:05.310> part<00:05:05.400> it's<00:05:05.640> really<00:05:05.670> overdone

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
for the most part it's really overdone

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.020 
for the most part it's really overdone
so<00:05:06.750> just<00:05:07.080> just<00:05:07.440> get<00:05:07.620> ready<00:05:07.770> for<00:05:07.980> that<00:05:08.130> now<00:05:08.790> if
