00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.160
 well let's talk now about some viral infections virus infections 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.760
 that could lead 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.399
 in a pericarditis 

00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:10.370
 dangerous 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.220
 We asked the doctor if his pericarditis could be dangerous in the 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:16.289
 classrooms 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.460
 a precarious one that could become one but there it is and several types of 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.349
 pericarditis and does not stick they look very little to each other 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.279
 the most frequent with a lot of difference the apply and typical that with which 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.769
 normally associated with flu-like processes 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.559
 what in some people especially young people especially men 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.480
 young percent 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.180
 inflame that cover to the heart a lot of people do not know what it is 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.100
 pericardium the pericardium is like a metal band to the venerated to sit and 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.200
 load with the heart and the mind an idea we have to choose the precarious 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.910
 It is a rubber case that completely envelops the heart 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.550
 impermeable so that inside there is a liquid 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.790
 that allows the heart to contract swimsuits the ikebana pc lubricant as 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.510
 the engine oil is to say that the heart in this organism are not 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.340
 only they were not paid that once a year and turned facing so hurt 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.469
 revolt d wrapped in that membrane that is the pericardium 

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:08.389
 efe this pericardium is the one that can be inflamed and the main reason is that 

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:12.560
 to that is he the the viruses that the department is looking for the graphic 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.430
 they are going to impose it here yesterday it must grow ficosa of very well the layer 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.850
 is covering the heart in black that yesterday is a liquid a liquid that 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.710
 called pericardial here is seen when the person's chest is opened this 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.420
 what we find we do not see the heart directly 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.580
 Well, if this pericardium is inflamed and usually moss for reasons 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.770
 biblical the pando 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.280
 begins that symptomatology that we say that the most frequent there I am going to 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.530
 two other processes that are even weirder is one this much mind the liquid 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.410
 that there is inside the heart this occurs in patients with renal insufficiency and 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:46.830
 some other processes 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.300
 tumoral process is fine everything that the liquid decompresses to the 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.420
 heart prevent the heart from opening so that between blood 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.130
 properly within it if that happens it starts a symptomatology that 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.450
 it's totally different that it's a lack of breathing and it's what we call a 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.830
 heart failure 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.250
 then there is a third pericarditis that this 10 percent extraordinarily 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.950
 rare but but another time was the most frequent because the 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.700
 tuberculosis is a problem that remains low or a lot especially because it is 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.890
 much better and it is that this is founded alÃ­ when inflamed it sticks to the heart and 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:19.479
 then 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:24.039
 it gets percent boosted and sometimes even calcifies as if it were a 

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:27.609
 bone and then yes that does not let the heart warn at all and that needs 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:29.900
 operate which would be a doctor in 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.439
 you take a pericarditis 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:36.040
 of the most frequent of the habilitation bird that are pains pains in the chest 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.749
 sometimes dizziness 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:41.649
 for one hundred years and as a consequence for example of some virus that has almost 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:43.749
 always and almost always started a cold 

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:47.510
 contrast between the most frequent but sometimes the first symptom because many 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:49.829
 Sometimes the colds do not go unnoticed, we do not even go 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.769
 realize that we have had a virus 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.180
 and the worst note is moss pain in the chest that scares us that the 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.489
 led to the hospital and above all it varies a lot with your breathing 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.650
 get up and that's what you have to basically treat it with rest and anti-inflammatory 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.430
 you do not need anything else you go alone and so it is exceptional that it has some 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.729
 nothing matters nothing good in full amount 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:13.509
 Well, the others are much rarer then he thinks he thinks the 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:16.529
 more common is she the one in which we are talking to the hariri qabun
