00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.270
 this part is the jukebox or box 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.820

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.710
 guys and the krafft eo is very but very 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.380
 simple so here we would have it 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.600
 let's go to the krafft eo that would be with more than 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.780
 nine years analyze here craft eo of the 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.700

 a milestone diamond to give you this 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.960
 succulent music box ok 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.300
 Well, if we touch it, we get these 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.369
 guys that would later be information from 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.640
 mode here says mode the jukebox or 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:43.520
 jukebox mod for 10 365 welcome to the 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:47.149
 juke box mod inside 5 this mode 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.770
 is a fort is a is a contribution of the 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.470
 jukebox that you can find in 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.780
 minecraft information from juke box or from 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.940
 the music box plays the music box 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.789
 with a disc to start playing 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.990
 the song says the further you go or 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.530
 the more distance 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.329
 and there in between you and the music box 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.520
 lower will sound ok this is because 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.590
 logic the farther the less it sounds and 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.260
 the leader of the box jukebox 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.849
 music would be 84 in case you do not want it 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.650
 put with him because he invites you hard that 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.420
 be ok the next one would be 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.780
 disk information that says there 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.610
 12 different discs with 12 different 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.410
 songs the songs are covers of 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.660
 minecraft sem and says that there is a 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.569
 very random possibility itself be very 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.060
 little chance of you finding a 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.750
 disk every time you kill 30 modes 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.690
 hostile 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.390
 so if you kill 3 kripper minus 30 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.549
 creepers forgiveness can be it can be that 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.230
 find an album this can be 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.540
 any disk the blue disk the disk 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.340
 mario this is completely random ok and 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.940
 well here says the and from the discs 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.100
 that would be from 415 to 426 so 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.690
 we will start with these guys the records 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.370
 are these that are here are very 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.739
 typical and that are not eaten here I go out 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.370
 of blogs disque because this one was known 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.129
 I think 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.090
 see how he joins pimp seriously is 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.090
 very well ported and everything 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.390
 the further away from less it sounds is 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:22.950
 to see here we put ourselves in this part 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.420
 and if farther less sound to see here 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.440
 we take it a little further than it is 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.440
 adding up quite in fact 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.670
 Well, it sounds a lot then 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.090
 of guys that would be with respect to 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:40.069
 red disk to take it out of disk and 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:44.799
 we will put for example this the disc 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.799
 not great, that's how I know what 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.720
 next disk here the best 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.609
 is ugly we go with the next guy in 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.609
 the 13 10 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.120
 and today with that 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:13.099
 if this one is as broken we will put it 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.099
 what is this 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.440
 the factories 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:34.050
 he knows that this album seriously 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.870
 because then you did not let me sleep because of 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.360
 disconfort disc good this so 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.740
 I recognized we will put this blue color 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.570
 They will say that they must be monsters of 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.770
 colors the best in the world because what 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:48.840
 we will put or so nothing is all 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.300
 guys with respect to the mode so then 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.980
 I hope you liked it you know that 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.750

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.790

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.550
 I want a lot of meiners nation they take care of me 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.320
 a kiss a hug and see you in a 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.990
 next video we will pass as always 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.850
 with the installation of the mode so 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:09.120
 let's see the boys in the 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.560
 installation well then we are already with the 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.450
 installation in this way guys and girls 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.490
 which is very, very simple, so 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.110
 please follow my steps so you do not 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.480
 have no problem so 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.910
 in this part we are with the file of the 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.650
 so it would be because jukebox rock dances 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.050
 not so then let's get it out we play it 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.820
 and we'll go with 'somewhere' and this 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.130
 folder we are interested in two things nothing more 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:31.380
 that would be because they come out here that are the 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.060
 songs and then we're interested in that 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.610
 it would be the way to say that you go then 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.200
 here we select this and this and what 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.430
 we extract in the part 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.840
 we want on the route that 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.910
 we want in this case I will do as 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.160
 always in the mods folder that you already create 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.980
 so here we would look for it in my 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.410
 case as always and we have here the 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:51.330
 folder, so here we extract it 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:54.120
 and after this we will go with that 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.730
 folder in which we have extracted that 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.580
 what would happen and this we will go with 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.290
 this folder that I have it here guys 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.140
 the folder mods and after this we 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.640
 so we will go with her not that she is in 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.520
 where is it here we see here 

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:11.070
 we select copy and then we 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.590
 we'll go to the minecraft game folder 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.870
 over here with very point and we are going to give it 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.580
 in pasting and we would have the songs 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.190
 added to say that here I am going to 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.990
 overwrite again very well so 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.180
 now we could go with block 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.830
 launcher pro that is around here guys to 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:30.090
 see about it opens me because I always 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:32.220
 makes wrong according to see if he wants 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:35.140
 open 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.060
 ok we're here then after 

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.580
 this we would go with the key if it is 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.790
 here we are going to manage mode of 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.050
 scripts and then we'll leave no matter 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:45.160
 local storage and we search here not 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.630
 I hope that is not important 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.640
 local storage and we look for the 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:52.180
 folder that then in this case is motor 

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:56.170
 let's go here and we would touch on what would be 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:58.240
 I box molds not 365 we select it 

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:00.250
 we activate and we would have in ball that yes 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.560
 that it thus does not require it 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.390
 a texture so simply with 

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.310
 the one of the dot point file this one already 

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:08.200
 we are done then these two guys 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:12.990
 with facilities they did not like 

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:12.990
 see you in the next video chao
