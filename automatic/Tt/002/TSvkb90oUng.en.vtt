00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.669
 friends welcome to a fanbus 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:18.400
 studio and welcome to another 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:20.260
 video again my little short update 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.290
 we have a few sheets here again 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.630
 angeles the codex we have in mind 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.420
 recently talked about it 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:32.860
 here in the studio would be so next to orks and 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:34.800
 grace with one of the oldest army 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.180
 Books are still available for forte 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.150
 let's see if he will soon something new 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.790
 yes we have a few leaf angels 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.680
 on the one hand up here design ruin straight 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.190
 the models are all on level 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.600
 5 painted our character level here 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.570
 the sangui is not great at the top 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.750
 with gold tint and also a whole 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.120
 Great last part here are these 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:02.200
 small flashes that darken over these 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.360
 marble sound at leighton looks absolutely 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.130
 Ingenious from then we still have the 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.690
 standard bearer also here the 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.240
 blade you can see beautiful lakes with 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.979
 this lightning effect is the standard 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.299
 by the way, the eyes are painted very nicely 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.580
 Here, which also fits very well with the 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:18.340
 I recommend is when you have such a bright 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:22.180
 shining green as a shade for the 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:25.180
 for the heroes are here and still 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:29.409
 some models also black 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:32.920
 character level 5 painted classic 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.409
 color scheme then the centurion it here in 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.409
 sheet angels color scheme the centurion it 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.470
 are not really intended for 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.520
 the blood and words but I guess 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.710
 That's just a matter of time 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.240
 the customer wanted the models on each one 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.860
 case in normal stays decided 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.110
 color scheme have because he just in 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.270
 one wants to integrate his army 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.850
 further special feature is here in the 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.150
 local shop in local games 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.280
 workshop wiesbaden he has seen that 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.720
 the local landscape models there 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.400
 a bit rebuilt what were the 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.290
 pose in terms of what the posture 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.579
 won bit dynamic especially at 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.079
 I think that is what comes with this model 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.260
 good to realize that he is here just like that 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:13.270
 a little bit walking moves just like him 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.770
 here is a bit diagonally there 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.390
 that's off the normal pose and 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.740
 The customer just wanted to have this conversion 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.330
 We did that for him and one 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.510
 Another special feature is that the 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.070
 entire models here almost throughout 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.910
 These are the magnetized ones 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.850
 weapons option 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:34.200
 we have meanwhile expert of the yes 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.280
 I'd say as far as the magnet option 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.500
 meanwhile a real expert 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.270
 The weapons option are continuous 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.070
 magnetized and a special feature 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.180
 You have to be careful that it is here 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.040
 behind the arm 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.290
 There are several connection points to 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.480
 a this cable as well as this one 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.520
 yes I'll say metal joint as well 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.070
 the glove that's just in all three 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.240
 score fits ago by magnets 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.530
 it is just possible to demonstrate 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.080
 then just reject the magnet it here 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.520
 installed above and then we try 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.660
 The whole time with a hand on 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.660
 bring 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:09.660
 of course, classic again 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:12.990
 is just there hangs 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.160
 it does not fit 100 percent at each 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.360
 point that is of course already one 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.270
 must be careful that the cables 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:23.140
 just really invests and the weapons 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:25.600
 is a tricky job because of it 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.860
 It also does not fit every one was for everywhere 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.660
 that's just what you have to do a bit 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.340
 pay attention to the magnet points 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.930
 but if you just the weapons 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.100
 assigns to individual models that would 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.770
 I also recommend you if you yourself 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.140
 that's what it's supposed to do 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.060
 without problems that you refer here 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.050
 on the weapon and this cable without 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.459
 problems with a nice 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:47.459
 magnetization can work 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.459
 yes that was the project and see you soon
