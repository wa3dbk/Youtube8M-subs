Hello Everybody, before we get to this series
of videos I think I need to explain a little

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.770
bit about the concept&nbsp;of these videos and
what you'll get on these videos. We've been

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.590
asked by some of our fans and friends to&nbsp;upload
some of our own songs and to explain how it

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.770
is played. So basically we assume that you
already know&nbsp;these techniques and you don't

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.540
need to learn the techniques. If you need
to learn the techniques, probably&nbsp;these videos

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.190
are not for you. There are hundreds and thousands
of beautiful videos on YouTube explaining&nbsp;how

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.990
to play technique. So these videos are about
a particular song from beginning to the end

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.640
section by&nbsp;section describing how to play
that. The first song we're playing is called

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.460
"Cafeteria by Vltava" which is a&nbsp;song I wrote
year back and we already played (probably

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.510
you see the link to that actual video in full
length).&nbsp;We played with Jan Urbanec on fretless

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:10.080
semi-acoustic arch top bass and me on flamenco
guitar. We'll keep&nbsp;posting other on triple-neck

00:02:10.080 --> 00:05:32.720
guitar and also on fretless bass. So... let's
get to that.
