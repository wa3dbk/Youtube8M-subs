00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 Hello dear friends, this is an express 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.810
 gta 5 optimization release today is ours 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.280
 the challenge will be to 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.190
 optimize gta5 smooth cutters also 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.289
 achieve maximum texture loading 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.980
 Immediately apologize for my little noise 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.990
 microphone 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.689
 for tomorrow you desktop was not 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.100
 time to prepare as i want everything 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.990
 do as quickly as possible so that you 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.699
 as quickly as possible 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.849
 customize and enjoy the beautiful 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.550
 playing a cat again literally came out yesterday 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.980
 patch that fixed some problems 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.559
 with loading and entering the game but he doesn't 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.160
 helped most of the players who 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:43.440
 texture is also badly loaded 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.770
 cutters appear after 10 or even 5 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.210
 minutes of the game is not important also this problem 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.000
 found on powerful personal 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.520
 computers in particular even with me 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.800
 16 gigabytes of RAM when 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.989
 7870 ppm video card 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.100
 I also met all these 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:05.760
 problems a whole bunch and for two 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:08.369
 days I tried as much as possible 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.189
 optimize I considered in the forums and 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.510
 Now I will tell you this pasta of the world 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.320
 bathroom information that was 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:20.009
 confirmed by tests 2 day tests 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.320
 painful tests here and in general and 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.080
 Overall, this should help you raise fps 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.030
 in the game and all the others that I have already said 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.350
 my first advice is for 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.030
 md rhodion video card 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.229
 naturally the first tessellation mode we 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.689
 paste use settings 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.170
 applications in the game 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:43.200
 set tessellation on standard or 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:47.060
 high on frame rate control 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.009
 oh oh angel we include since this 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.840
 feature will let us more loyally 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.210
 relate to vertical sync 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.700
 what is not so noticeable when turned on 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.110
 its in the game after setting md catalyst 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.780
 by the way the same settings can be 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.930
 use and in the form and but I will not 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.140
 claim what it did not check 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:10.200
 further important factor in all this 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.060
 porridge is a disk defragmenter a lot 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.160
 gave up questions helps not 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.970
 does the guys help me really 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.550
 helped 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.010
 I downloaded the simplest defragmenter from 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.640
 auslu jacks can be found in google easily 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.410
 download 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.900
 I will leave a reference in the description not 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.720
 problem you download pro defragments 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.410
 and completely your disk all partitions and 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.310
 I think this will also help you a lot further 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.989
 about the swap file 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.540
 I will not argue that it can 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.910
 make a big difference it won't change 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.510
 situation but in any case it is not 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.190
 hurt i experimented with different 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.629
 the size of the paging file disconnected and and 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:54.510
 at all that gave theft application but 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:57.540
 Found a less optimal way 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.230
 on the system disk on which you have 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.830
 Windows 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.540
 set the paging file is valid 4 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.750
 gigabyte a paging file for 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:11.010
 the logical drive on which gta rests 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.120
 5 exhibit 8 gigabytes is less 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.069
 best option 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.620
 it will not load a large system 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.060
 will be smooth i am good windows loading 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.680
 but because we know what it is 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.769
 bust with the swap file 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.980
 after which windows loads longer and 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.870
 in general, all sorts of things 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.870
 we changed the paging file we 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.549
 defragmented the disk set up md 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.859
 catalyst 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:39.870
 or same day form after which we 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:41.340
 sure to reboot the computer and 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.510
 go in the game 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.430
 game settings vertical 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.250
 synchronization we turn on 50 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.040
 percentage position this will help you 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.659
 faster immersing textures like fps 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.449
 will be lower accordingly your 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:58.449
 the video card will keep up 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:04:01.750
 immerse textures into the game but can 

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:03.669
 somewhere in the distance disappear slightly but it 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.010
 not as noticeable as when you have 

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:10.949
 just under the wheels start to disappear 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:14.349
 the road let's say more about 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:15.129
 we also settle in the game 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:18.430
 turn on 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:20.019
 mandatory either standard or 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.509
 high but the main thing that she was 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.479
 I don't know what it's connected with but 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:27.250
 only after inclusion in catalyst and 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.860
 use application strings after 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.639
 including it in gta 5 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:35.530
 cutters disappeared simply 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:38.080
 on account of changing the priority many 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.570
 they say they write here 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.289
 priority on real time is you 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.770
 will help 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:47.500
 Well, I do not know me personally, it did not help for 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:50.620
 people who have this problem 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.570
 that their mouse at a sharp left turn 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.509
 right up down starts 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.940
 slow down what I can advise 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:05:02.940
 it go in keyboard mouse settings and 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:06.400
 set mouse parameters in direct input 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.710
 this parameter will smooth the mouse movement and you 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.229
 will not feel any 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:13.969
 jerks and everything else 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:17.269
 Finally, I would like to say the front 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:19.669
 thrown windows style for people 

00:05:17.269 --> 00:05:22.459
 which 4 gigabytes of ram i 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:25.209
 highly recommend cleaning up all this 

00:05:22.459 --> 00:05:27.709
 beauty transparent windows by 

00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:29.389
 setting a tick in the menu panel 

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:33.099
 control system additional 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:35.449
 performance parameters there we expose 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:37.779
 maximum performance 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:41.360
 it will help you free some 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:45.289
 RAM size and allocate 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:48.349
 more space to play well, I will 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:50.329
 hope that after all these operations in 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:52.579
 we will list these to lose nothing 

00:05:50.329 --> 00:05:54.049
 The first is to change it in catalyst and 

00:05:52.579 --> 00:05:57.909
 open gl settings 

00:05:54.049 --> 00:06:02.319
 and tessellation the second is defragmentation 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:05.569
 disk paging settings 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:07.309
 the third is tessellation 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:10.669
 also vertical sync in 

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:13.009
 game settings this help with the mouse for 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:16.819
 In order to remove these twitches 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:19.479
 Well, in principle, thank you all very much 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:22.939
 I hope for your attention, I helped you, I hope 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:24.619
 each one helped this advice if you 

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:27.619
 there will be some suggestions leave 

00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:31.129
 comments watch videos like 

00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:35.529
 subscribe to the channel as well as waiting 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:35.529
 patch in general, all fun games
