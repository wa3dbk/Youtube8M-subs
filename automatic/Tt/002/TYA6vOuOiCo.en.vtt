00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:05.609
 so happy returns so today 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.680
 we will see how to make a 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.160
 aluminum bracket to make a 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.110
 necklace 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.540
 so we will obviously use the 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:20.539
 usual tongs and then here so a 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:25.230
 bustier a bust for to manufacture 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:27.900
 so we will see the base us before so 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:34.969
 here we will take the announced of 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:38.910
 rebellious like a robin like this 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:42.780
 it's a brown color takes a caramel 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:50.160
 like it takes a chocolate earlier so 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:51.840
 I'm going to open the wires I'm doing the same 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.910
 on the other side since I really 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:59.570
 the reels are presented this 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:02.370
 way here that's so I release in girl 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.790
 is then I'm going to take have that a 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:10.250
 end of the wire he simply wants 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:15.090
 to wrap it around my support 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:17.540
 of my bust so here a display all 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.540
 simply 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.640
 so I will still keep a 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:41.150
 certain language to be able to make 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.830
 td little volutes and I 'm going to do like 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.260
 usually it is to acquire more my 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:50.750
 son with my usual part this one 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:55.280
 so that's all in one 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:58.660
 pressure so here and so there you 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.660
 see this cut vialette 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.110
 after I'm going to go round my son 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.890
 simply because as for 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:17.880
 the moment he is not very far 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.080
 I'm going to go back here so I 'm going 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.450
 give them shape 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:26.850
 finally a little bit saw him so gave 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.920
 like these it's not difficult from 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.230
 both to work that is left 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.690
 easily go it's still 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.700
 much less flexible than 2 mm 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.430
 necessarily a sweater he was an idea witness 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.290
 flexible so here it is a lot 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.480
 rounder so I'll put back on the 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:50.400
 support and I will cross so if he goes 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.930
 really serve as a base for necklaces and 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.180
 so I will take my loaves will be 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.650
 above it too a big all the 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.410
 small matter that depends on what 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.840
 wanted to do it and then I will go 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.770
 to make volutes on the ends of the threads 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.770
 is here 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.219
 that's like these for example 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:21.060
 and then I'll go shoot once 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:23.879
 on himself this son so like like those 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.049
 for example, for example, we can 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:27.540
 really do all the forms we 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:32.579
 want some and then I'm going to make a 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:35.239
 loop here so I'm going to pick myself up 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.239
 new 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:46.760
 and I sell the coiled on itself as 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.760
 that's it 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:55.080
 so after geoffrey I had then after 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.940
 rounded receipts open their masters 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.440
 like me, I want it to be because 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.420
 that he is not quite quite 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.940
 round in group to present it 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.750
 obviously to put a little bigger 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.990
 and then I'll stick it to 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.610
 display stands moving here scrolls 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.910
 see there for that it's really the base 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.140
 to make a necklace 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.850
 normally it's pretty simple to do 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.450
 you see I did not use but 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.060
 like many others who no longer 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.830
 and then here after you can decorate 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.740
 sat with flowers either with farms 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.290
 so we'll see another time in a 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.720
 other party could obviously use 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.580
 aluminum wire to put pearls 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.430
 I showed you that in a second 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.050
 part a second video here at losc 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.260
 franck saltsis you call very good 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.260
 day
