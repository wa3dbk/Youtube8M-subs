and the extraordinary thing about

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.700 
and the extraordinary thing about
Stirling<00:00:58.030> engines<00:00:58.420> is<00:00:58.600> they're<00:00:58.780> so<00:00:59.020> efficient

it's<00:01:00.399> just<00:01:00.579> a<00:01:00.700> little<00:01:01.060> bit<00:01:01.210> of<00:01:01.329> hot<00:01:01.540> water<00:01:01.570> and

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
it's just a little bit of hot water and

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.429 
it's just a little bit of hot water and
look<00:01:02.680> how<00:01:02.829> fast<00:01:03.160> it's<00:01:03.460> making<00:01:03.850> the<00:01:03.940> wheel<00:01:04.149> go

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
look how fast it's making the wheel go

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.350 
look how fast it's making the wheel go
now<00:01:05.439> watch<00:01:05.650> what<00:01:05.860> happens<00:01:06.280> when<00:01:06.460> we<00:01:06.580> take<00:01:06.790> the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
now watch what happens when we take the

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.780 
now watch what happens when we take the
same<00:01:07.630> Stirling<00:01:08.140> engine<00:01:08.530> running<00:01:09.520> clockwise

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
same Stirling engine running clockwise

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.560 
same Stirling engine running clockwise
and<00:01:10.409> put<00:01:11.409> it<00:01:11.530> on<00:01:11.710> another<00:01:12.220> beaker<00:01:12.700> but<00:01:12.940> this

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
and put it on another beaker but this

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.370 
and put it on another beaker but this
one's<00:01:13.840> full<00:01:14.080> of<00:01:14.260> ice<00:01:14.890> water<00:01:15.340> in<00:01:15.990> just<00:01:16.990> a<00:01:17.140> few

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
one's full of ice water in just a few

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.910 
one's full of ice water in just a few
seconds<00:01:18.510> the<00:01:19.510> Stirling<00:01:19.960> engine<00:01:20.049> will<00:01:20.500> slow

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
seconds the Stirling engine will slow

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.490 
seconds the Stirling engine will slow
down<00:01:21.400> because<00:01:21.820> it's<00:01:22.510> lost<00:01:22.810> its<00:01:23.049> source<00:01:23.320> of

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
down because it's lost its source of

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.670 
down because it's lost its source of
heat<00:01:23.740> from<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.700> bottom<00:01:25.590> but<00:01:26.590> now<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:28.540> will<00:01:29.290> run

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
heat from the bottom but now it will run

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.899 
heat from the bottom but now it will run
the<00:01:29.950> other<00:01:29.979> way<00:01:30.490> from<00:01:31.450> the<00:01:31.659> ice<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:33.490> there's<00:01:33.790> an

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
the other way from the ice so there's an

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.200 
the other way from the ice so there's an
old<00:01:34.060> joke<00:01:34.659> in<00:01:34.930> science<00:01:35.320> a<00:01:35.850> thermos<00:01:36.850> bottle

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
old joke in science a thermos bottle

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.450 
old joke in science a thermos bottle
keeps<00:01:38.080> cold<00:01:38.290> things<00:01:38.619> cold<00:01:38.710> and<00:01:39.070> hot<00:01:39.190> things

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
keeps cold things cold and hot things

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.490 
keeps cold things cold and hot things
hot<00:01:40.290> how<00:01:41.290> does<00:01:41.500> it<00:01:41.680> know<00:01:41.890> oh<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:44.049> reason<00:01:44.200> it

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
hot how does it know oh the reason it

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.370 
hot how does it know oh the reason it
knows<00:01:44.710> is<00:01:45.100> because<00:01:45.460> in<00:01:45.640> a<00:01:45.820> sense<00:01:46.090> in<00:01:46.450> science

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
knows is because in a sense in science

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.820 
knows is because in a sense in science
there's<00:01:48.070> no<00:01:48.280> such<00:01:48.490> thing<00:01:48.790> as<00:01:48.939> cold<00:01:49.840> there's

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
there's no such thing as cold there's

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.929 
there's no such thing as cold there's
only<00:01:51.070> the<00:01:51.580> absence<00:01:52.240> of<00:01:52.390> heat<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:54.220> this<00:01:54.729> is

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
only the absence of heat so this is

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:57.359 
only the absence of heat so this is
still<00:01:55.150> a<00:01:55.210> heat<00:01:55.540> engine<00:01:55.869> and<00:01:55.960> it's<00:01:56.770> running<00:01:57.159> off

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
still a heat engine and it's running off

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.060 
still a heat engine and it's running off
of<00:01:57.580> heat<00:01:57.850> but<00:01:58.720> the<00:01:58.900> source<00:01:59.170> of<00:01:59.350> heat<00:01:59.590> now<00:01:59.799> is

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
of heat but the source of heat now is

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.899 
of heat but the source of heat now is
the<00:02:00.880> room<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.990> air<00:02:02.170> in<00:02:02.439> this<00:02:02.560> room<00:02:02.680> is<00:02:03.070> warming

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
the top plate and heat is now flowing

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.509 
the top plate and heat is now flowing
down<00:02:07.479> through<00:02:07.509> the<00:02:08.200> engine<00:02:08.619> instead<00:02:09.189> of<00:02:09.340> up

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:09.519 
down through the engine instead of up

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:11.580 
down through the engine instead of up
through<00:02:09.789> the<00:02:09.909> engine<00:02:10.209> as<00:02:10.359> it<00:02:10.479> was<00:02:10.659> over<00:02:11.319> on<00:02:11.469> the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
through the engine as it was over on the

now<00:02:13.389> Stirling<00:02:13.840> engines<00:02:14.230> have<00:02:14.379> been<00:02:14.469> proposed

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
now Stirling engines have been proposed

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.100 
now Stirling engines have been proposed
for<00:02:15.670> all<00:02:15.850> sorts<00:02:16.240> of<00:02:16.390> things<00:02:16.600> in<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.840> early

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
for all sorts of things in the early

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.050 
for all sorts of things in the early
1800s<00:02:17.560> they<00:02:17.890> were<00:02:17.980> used<00:02:18.190> to<00:02:18.310> pump<00:02:18.520> water<00:02:18.610> all

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
1800s they were used to pump water all
