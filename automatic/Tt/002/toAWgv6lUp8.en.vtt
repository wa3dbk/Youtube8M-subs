00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Good day, dear friends with 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.210
 perpetuum again 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.370
 or Alexander and today I want 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.389
 present to you very uniquely 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.639
 interesting mod 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.920
 especially for those people who love 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.590
 create redstone circuits 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.650
 I unfortunately a bit far from it, I 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.720
 not particularly roasted redstone's schemes 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.060
 mechanisms therefore found only one 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.480
 a way to apply this mod let's 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.830
 Immediately go to this method 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.309
 imagine such a situation as 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.950
 usually a beautiful girl goes but in this one 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.390
 the case is the skin of the girl although it is possible 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.430
 this skin will play and man 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.530
 some pervert but nonetheless 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.700
 we imagine that this girl is you 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.440
 she doesn't hear you don't you no no 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.480
 sound contact is not visual in 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.149
 Generally you can not communicate but 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.070
 suddenly she throws a look in your direction and 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.620
 you understand all is not possible 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.719
 attract attention and then comes into force 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.329
 This unit you have here is such a 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.160
 the middle construction is this 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.450
 block you approach the lever 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.869
 and op op op op op op op op she understands 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.310
 what do you think she's good and now 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.140
 you are not indifferent to her 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.240
 she will come to you you will start to play 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.030
 be friends have fun and you will have everything 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.070
 cool of course it looks a little bit 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.900
 strange you probably thought that I 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.180
 pervert but it's not this thing 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.640
 the simple thing that occurred to me when I 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.340
 saw this mod also this mod adds 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.250
 2 more interesting blocks or more precisely 3 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.610
 the first block is a snowman block when we 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.770
 activate it from above appears 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.720
 snowman second block is an iron block 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.880
 golem when we activate it from above 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.820
 iron golem appears 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.100
 why do you need it 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.560
 draw a line from redstone here and 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.840
 here is a line of redstone bet 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:55.049
 pressure plate or 2 pressure plates and 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.810
 when enemies sneak up your house they 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.540
 become on this plate and climbs 2 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.130
 the toughest toughest golem and start 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.070
 humiliate and punish your enemy 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.890
 I think he will be uncomfortable also 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.750
 block tree why do we need no idea 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.420
 I just activate 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.430
 and a tree appears maybe again 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.150
 it can be used in some 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.280
 mechanisms i don't know i didn't go deep and 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.680
 there is another interesting block block 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.959
 which forces the blocks to either leave 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.970
 either drive back the thing is that 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.700
 the usual block that showed in the 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.860
 the beginning works so when we serve on 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.250
 a signal from this block appears 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.110
 one block and the charges run out 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.239
 see now from above the arrow points 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.330
 up that is, when you press the block will 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:47.290
 appear on top when we put on 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:49.150
 bottom this block then the direction changes to 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.130
 In this case, see the arrow has changed 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.880
 down and we can return this charge 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.030
 back here so see the block disappeared in 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.860
 general let's now move on to crafting 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.840
 crafting everything is very simple to start 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.640
 we will need to craft a super box 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.950
 boxing 1800 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.380
 it is based on this boxing are created 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.109
 all other craft &amp; craft are very 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.340
 i need 4 oak boards well or 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.890
 any other 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.470
 and one red dust appears like this 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.900
 here's a box to make a snowman for us 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.420
 need one box and regular craft 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.239
 snowman it all adds up like this and 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.239
 appears again we fire boxing with iron 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:32.109
 golem still put 4 iron 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.690
 block one pumpkin box and appears rn 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:37.600
 golem box can be crafted further 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:41.440
 block that changes direction you and 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.480
 burning blocks from the block, he wow 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.430
 Here it is strange to craft 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.280
 this block is box reversing 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.709
 switcher we need three green 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.650
 wool and three yellow wool as well 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:56.049
 the usual boxing boxing switcher appears a 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.840
 now we still move craft 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.910
 most basic unit 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.269
 from which others will leave 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:05.970
 blocks kraft it is also very easy for us 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.370
 just need a side with which we 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.170
 created at the very beginning and any other 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.890
 block you would like him to 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:16.350
 out of this god of sand you see guys 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.989
 how much do you put around bricks 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.910
 well, or so much of the stone will leave 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.729
 this unit is no teaching all 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.590
 very clean honestly if you need 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:27.750
 more than one charge in this case 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.510
 we need one charge to put in a circle 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.479
 and then we will have 8 charges if 8 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.610
 charges you a little you take a block in 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:38.790
 which is already 8 charges and put around 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:42.210
 he has 8 more bricks turns 16 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.720
 charges of 16 charges is the maximum in general 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.280
 guys is all that today's mod gives 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.280
 use it as do not want to be 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.200
 perverts rejoice life was with you 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.139
 perpetuum or alexander 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:58.550
 thank you so much for watching golem 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.550
 Good luck to you!
