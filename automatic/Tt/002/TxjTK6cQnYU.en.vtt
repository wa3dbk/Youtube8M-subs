00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
whereby we first milk them then we

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.289 
whereby we first milk them then we
reward<00:01:30.780> them<00:01:31.280> one<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.549> advantages<00:01:33.150> of

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
reward them one of the advantages of

reward them one of the advantages of
doing<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.960> because<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.409> takes<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.740> shorter

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
doing that is because it takes a shorter

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.700 
doing that is because it takes a shorter
time<00:01:35.250> for<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.820> actually<00:01:36.290> harvest<00:01:37.290> the

like after we introduce the mattresses

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.859 
like after we introduce the mattresses
the<00:01:43.560> production<00:01:44.100> went<00:01:44.340> up<00:01:44.520> by<00:01:44.700> 4<00:01:44.939> or<00:01:45.149> 5<00:01:45.390> percent

the production went up by 4 or 5 percent
for<00:01:46.170> each<00:01:46.229> animal<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:47.640> that<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:48.060> one<00:01:48.299> plus

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
for each animal so that is one plus
