00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:03.059
 s 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.080
 as an amateur or thunderstorms 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.080
 but collect at a high level 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.760
 Hamburg entrepreneur Harald Falckenberg has been collecting for 15 years 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.360
 Contemporary Art 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.730
 especially the works of artists from Europe and the USA 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.210
 In principle, I'm interested in critical art 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.730
 come sometime 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.140
 Percent of themselves 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.909
 thus life situations and social situation 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.160
 apart sets 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.320
 around 2000 works of art owned by the 66-year-old 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.320
 including paintings by German painters such as Martin Kippenberger 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.150
 Daniel Richter or Jonathan Meeses 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.200
 Harald Falckenberg is not about prestige or long-term investment 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.200
 wants to deal with art 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.770
 his collection is private but visitors say that the 4 after 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.770
 Registration open 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.170
 this is about 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.910
 the artistic attitude 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:58.180
 around which is manifested by works of art 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.440
 and in the artistic attitude 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.920
 to get into the questions and problems of an artist in a certain time 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.580
 under certain circumstances 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.089
 and she this argument 

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:13.309
 to reject those on the artist can be meaningfully opened 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:19.029
 Percent first when she is not reclassified there should be times that cost 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.450
 once a year, the art world meets up in the Spanish capital Madrid 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.689
 the conference 

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:29.469
 the art fair was in addition to the lot was so could Art Colom to the 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:32.469
 most important meeting places in the industry 

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:36.879
 more than 200 galleries from all over Europe are represented at the fair 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:42.510
 For Harald Falckenberg it is a kind of hunting ground 

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:53.599
 Here he goes in search of new works of art for his collection 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.089
 So Wesel gives a photo BÃ¶sl best 

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:01.619
 because with that, besides, it's like that 

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:03.849
 a natural he too 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.589
 compared in price 

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:08.589
 something percent of the field is 

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:12.589
 paid the city and buy skylight about this or that 

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:16.759
 among the guests, the collector is a welcome guest 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:21.229
 but for what does this movement cost 

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:25.609
 it has hardly sold another for the many 375 thousand 

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:32.059
 some picture is more expensive than expected but Harald Falckenberg is considered 

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:34.449
 willing to buy and short-circuited 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:37.790
 Eick has accidents more than half of his pictures he has right on 

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:39.349
 Acquired art fairs 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.349
 Ounce okay he was 

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:46.029
 "If we were to say that, but also to another point 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.089
 where will the collection no longer be decisive 

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:53.689
 but expire though is probably the eighth 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:59.499
 Percent the working people are not really that good at break percentage 

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:02.189
 lie other position will then reinforce 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:03.759
 so 

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:05.579
 everything has its end 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.789
 or then it has to go just another ballot here 

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:11.949
 in the sense of a warning 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:15.149
 Harald Falckenberg regularly organizes new ones in Hamburg 

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:18.090
 Exhibitions in the rooms of his collection 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.880
 more than 1000 guests came to the opening of the current show 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.270
 Every year, around 17 thousand visitors visit its private museum 

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:31.909
 To inspire as many people as possible for contemporary art 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:34.919
 That's what the art collector Harald Falckenberg is all about
