00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:11.580
 fully built here again is like 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.980
 the choir hello thought so the whole 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.719
 Machine was rated at 99.9 percent 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.230
 xbox built i just blessed him 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.189
 supported and that's exactly what Luca is up to 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.010
 grown lukas mist 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.330
 He is a channel man of description 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.820
 In any case , there was still an abo da 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.320
 to let 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.849
 He is planning to join soon 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.890
 to start videos almost only redstone 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.219
 because they are savvy or too 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.500
 Not 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.390
 or even if it wanted to be 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.410
 if you stop you have to want to learn then 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.719
 also stop by them there will be one 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.230
 car not easy yes construction time about 20 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.640
 hours 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.340
 it's a bit like her 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.899
 Look and yes I did the trailer 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.890
 of how actually looks unnecessarily 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.300
 aluguss he said but I wanted 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.039
 just memc ma study myself 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.300
 Try it a bit and there it is 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.530
 actually a lot of work was in it 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.320
 I thought then I would 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.320
 make lukas too with the beautiful trailer 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.870
 yes yes this has indeed Lukas buck himself 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.799
 built so the whole display with too 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.900
 do i say okay or okay then yes 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.979
 not so easy around her you see that 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.960
 the whole is so big at the 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.610
 schneider sees everything anyway 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.110
 the whole display works like this 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.670
 that's pretty cool 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.310
 you have here the complete alphabet 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.460
 no pay 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.439
 to z and that works that way you can 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.759
 now choose here where what then 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.650
 It's like I 'm here now 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.650
 the single displays display as it 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.240
 here in front of this here and there 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.790
 then set it down so you can now 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.720
 for example, want that in display 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.479
 1 and 8, for example, the letter z 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.979
 then stands the rider and can 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.750
 then here at some point I would have 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.329
 times now and big m 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.460
 so you push it then it takes 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.890
 of course a bit and you see 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.899
 which one in the head at the first like 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.380
 we also wanted and then here too 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.960
 That's what I think Christmas was here 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.850
 So it works so easy 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.250
 display if you do not want it anymore 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.500
 then you can just enter here 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.909
 make state, law reset 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.200
 and yes there are the letters too 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.899
 disappear again accordingly 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.330
 so you can then different words 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.280
 stop there make a little gadget old 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.660
 stop 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.120
 what really new and completely 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.349
 controllable easily to this and yes if 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.700
 I would write my word now 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:25.590
 I just know for example now 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:28.140
 vec with here you have to have the abc it needs 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.940
 you know tempo press so wait then 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.310
 not always too fast because otherwise 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.140
 could you come to an error should you 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.569
 that's where it comes from 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.640
 otherwise ask old overwritten 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.849
 logged in is also always waiting 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:49.590
 so patience my loving just then 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:52.769
 I need to look in a l now 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.440
 why is this perfect? 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.420
 then always forget I was always 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.980
 do not forget forget here then 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.980
 again change then a nice one 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.940
 and then it's already white 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.440
 finished so great is a little gadget 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.360
 can you show your friends that 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.819
 here the devil who has built with 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:16.639
 mental support through me yes 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:18.269
 200 calm yes with middle chromite 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:20.370
 coded and so what have I there 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.380
 then you can support a little 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.709
 task you still have here we have 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.350
 a total of 56 built-in five wanders or 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:30.480
 The parking deck he is on about enough 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.280
 because you can know why look 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.200
 Only one time I show her son 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.500
 at graduation are when I myself still 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.870
 I think it was just like that somewhere 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.920
 soon as I myself inc are just 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.319
 who hid my prayers everywhere 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.690
 Looking around for all the technology here can 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.850
 one actually still wanted little now 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.569
 to say that we will become like us 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.459
 have promised 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.470
 a tutorial and the times do so 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.299
 I am glad that we make one to it 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.069
 but very early on bismarck but we 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.120
 have that make it harder and harder now 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.440
 then if anybody does that to me 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.030
 Of course, not what that is 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.220
 whole neighbors but then before 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.630
 make a display here 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.010
 and yes then we will show the whole 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.709
 we do that as it seldom works 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.290
 can go back and that 's it 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:13.380
 already fit so a small mini map 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.579
 For you it was for download times 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.750
 span why I because that one 

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:17.010
 Select trash in quotes 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.970
 can tidy the neat app is 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:22.079
 90 percent now finished and there 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.660
 there is still a little something missing at redstone 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.820
 around 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.670
 wax and is in two weeks on 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.040
 He could come out in any case 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:31.510
 On top of that , a cool map becomes the water 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.220
 Do not forget because Lucas and 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.200
 keep on watching then let me in 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.570
 Comment or rating of the eu 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.860
 but maybe an abo with me and 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.400
 then just say until next time 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.400
 already people
