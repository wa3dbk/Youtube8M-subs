00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:14.259
 greet you friends with you center 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.369
 Kartashov block Wi Fi 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:19.130
 Today we will be a video dedicated 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.529
 install windows 7 quite often 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.779
 we have such situations when 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.060
 the result of the work and the installation of the removal 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.670
 various programs happens that 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.230
 some windows files are damaged and he 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.269
 stops loading 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.980
 either it happens behind the actions of the virus in 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:36.559
 Generally some problems arise in 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.350
 operating system and accordingly 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.760
 one of the easiest ways to 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.489
 available to any newbie 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.000
 is it perry install by yourself 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:48.739
 windows 7 there are two ways to install 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.860
 Firstly we can do it with 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.480
 using remote cd 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.750
 insert and not at all used either we are 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.219
 can do with usb flash drive insert it 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.010
 respectively one-time trips to 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:04.910
 computer and pre-recorded where 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:08.060
 windows 7 image how to do 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.490
 flash drive with windows and I already 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.340
 told in one of the previous lessons 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.640
 link to this video will be in the annotation 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.250
 and I recommend using this one. 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.200
 way because windows flashes will 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.240
 install much faster especially 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.640
 if you have a flash drive and computer 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.390
 supports lesbian 30 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.430
 so in order to run 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:33.680
 reinstalling we have to restart 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.640
 computer and when booting immediately press 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.729
 the key 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.479
 either white or looking for some which 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:44.200
 will tell you your bios to 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.840
 enter BIOS settings and set 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:51.120
 priority is that boot method 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.810
 which you have chosen that is either we 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:58.290
 we will load the drive serbia for 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.910
 this we expose the flash drive as 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.760
 primary system boot source 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.560
 either we choose hidi 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.740
 de vega is private and accordingly too 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.940
 choose windows 7 as boot 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:15.240
 or 9 and so after you have chosen 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.750
 already required download source 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.860
 windows 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.290
 you will begin the process of extracting files and 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.510
 installing your own windows and yourself 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.220
 Now we see how it happens with 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.390
 flash drives it's fast enough all 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:33.120
 done because the download speed with 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.810
 flash drives a lot more here now we 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.360
 wait until podgoritsa all the files and 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:43.670
 start the installation process and so here we are 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:48.600
 a window appears to work with 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:52.770
 by setting here we choose our language and our 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:57.350
 country and click on the next button 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:59.730
 install the installation process has begun 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.989
 Now the system will copy to 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.620
 computer all necessary files 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:10.190
 Next window pops up 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:13.260
 agree to license terms 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.690
 Here we select the full installation if you 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.070
 install from scratch if you're talking about 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.950
 reinstall windows then 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.930
 accordingly we can choose 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.750
 updates and thus we will continue 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:29.160
 all files that were previously recorded 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:32.250
 on the disk we will all be preserved 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:38.040
 was used so we choose complete 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:40.140
 installation select the drive here and here 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:44.519
 You can configure the drive to 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:48.350
 more convenient to organize our 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.350
 let's create a disk here 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.070
 here we have created a disk of 100 megabytes 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:01.710
 reserved system and 59 runs with us 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:05.290
 will move and click it 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:09.490
 formatting in order for everything to 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:13.870
 we organically formatted the disk 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:18.690
 and then enrolled windows on clean 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:21.010
 drive so further push further 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.400
 copying files we have happened and 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.690
 it will now be unpacking the bond file and 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.520
 now you will need to wait a little 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.300
 until we have the following 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.300
 dialog window 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.040
 and so here we have come to completion 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.680
 installation now we have windows 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.270
 reboot in order to 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.460
 you can continue the installation by clicking 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.700
 reload button now if you don't 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:57.260
 want to wait 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:05:01.820
 reboot the computer we already 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.820
 runs in Russian we see 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.250
 so services are started 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.130
 here our dialog box appeared again 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:25.379
 and we have the computer again 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:29.599
 will reboot in order to 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:29.599
 finally apply all settings 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:37.129
 we are waiting again for another windows boot 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:39.929
 and now all will be made 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:41.580
