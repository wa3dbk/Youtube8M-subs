00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:42.300

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:47.340
 rg advertising campaign sports 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:50.610

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:04.740
 of 12 monstrously will face 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:08.180
 On Saturday, the two teams that 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.980
 they have their systems well dominated 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.940
 how many goals have you gotten tigers in 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:19.140
 four games one how many goals have you 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.400
 stuck to tijuana in four games 2 that 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.409
 goal 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.430
 is the difference for which tigers 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:29.780
 are first and second have this 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:34.409
 the golaveraje that Juan started in 3 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.580
 then continued on 3 repeated on 3 and 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:40.390
 just up to 2 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:43.690
 that is, they are consistent teams 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.540
 teams that play well within a 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:52.630
 style that the technicians have chosen 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:57.150
 this season look at tijuana in 54 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:04:00.390
 games has lost 6 matches 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:03.030
 six parties and I do not remember the 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.890
 last time they lost but the 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.750
 last time they lost right now 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:14.200
 I'm sure there are more than 15 games 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:20.359
 that they do not lose therefore it would be a 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:24.310
 praise a party a heroic act if the 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:27.610
 Saturday a match that smells equal 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:31.210
 could be in favor of tigers 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:35.360
 but if there is a tiger he has to lose 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:39.080
 dance meter we can still have time 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:42.260
 to recover and get ahead 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:46.190
 comes is playing all tigers 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:49.580
 well well respectable public its 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:52.700
 defensive with four their means of 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.560
 containment is that they vary a lot I think 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:58.520
 that in the navel of the team of tigers 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:01.550
 is how they are going to work 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:06.950
 that the opposing team marks it only 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:10.240
 you have finally pe tactically the 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:12.260
 team that best dominates a tiger style 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.390
 alone 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.210
 and it already comes with a lot of time 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:19.520
 advance playing the ball very well 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.060
 cut especially stealing the two 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.460
 teams are experts in removing the ball 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:28.640
 who knows how tigers bait clothes you 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:31.340
 with three and one of them one gives you the 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:35.000
 piquetito to the ball and leaves detached 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:38.060
 to start the advance mark well with 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.580
 effort with humility without staying 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.950
 standing as he stood the 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.680
 San Luis defensive defensive 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:48.130
 sandwich cascas I shouted you tops I'm not going 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.970
 to go to mark you I will not mark you 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:54.170
 follow the players of the monterrey 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:57.320
 they scored their three goals at ease, not here 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:06:01.820
 not here badgers because there are no hares 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:04.790
 here they mark you they hit you they squeeze you and 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:08.720
 tiger always goes forward playing the 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:11.060
 ball playing with solvency wearing 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.010
 the energies of the contrary go out there 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.120
 to michu what andele go and there goes the 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.890
 rival team 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.380
 then they change the game to the other side 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:23.360
 go go 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:27.080
 and he always brings us like this on Saturday he goes to 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:29.570
 be a fight between pacquiao against the 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:32.920
 What do you think is better than what you can play? 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:36.980
 who can box not a fight 

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:39.710
 very hard a fight of two talents that 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:42.590
 they are training like never 2 men 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:45.930
 worried about the good football that are 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:48.449
 talking on Saturday 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:54.590
 the one that loses 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:58.219
 the one I won 15 years ago is left behind 

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.219
 Holy mother 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:04.320

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:14.630
 problemÃ³n if I endure 15 or not very well 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:18.460
