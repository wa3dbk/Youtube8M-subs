00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.080
 hello my name is cristian and we are going to 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.879
 talk about science research and everything 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.070
 what surrounds this and sexual selection 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:18.590
 this time we are going to talk about an article 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.630
 published in the magazine 'nature' one of 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.669
 the most important magazines 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.189
 worldwide a very common behavior for 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:27.320
 get a couple during deployments 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.649
 courtship are the dances these are 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.899
 present in many animals and 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:34.880
 the first to say that the dances 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.219
 They were linked to the couple selection 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.020
 and therefore sexual selection was to give 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.780
 the dances they perform mainly 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.750
 the males to be chosen by the 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.370
 females are very complex and these can 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.980
 send many signals and be 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.780
 loaded with a lot of information in a 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.550
 In general, the dances can 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.440
 give the female the necessary information 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.420
 about the quality of the individual that can 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.249
 select as indicator partner of the 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.469
 quality of the individual in the symmetry of 

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:02.480
 it is known that in many groups of 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.339
 animals the symmetry is related 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.540
 with the good genes number of 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.310
 offspring that can leave a 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.530
 individual and the survival of 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.900
 individual himself and his offspring 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.150
 One way to perceive symmetry is to 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.860
 through locomotion this is already 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.810
 will study in several animals including 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.640
 animals a few years ago a group of 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.340
 researchers led by robert try 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.280
 bears investigated whether the dance in 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.470
 human reflects symmetry traits for 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.810
 the observers and know which of the 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.360
 sexes men or women get more 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.460
 information from observing a 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.259
 man to a woman dance for this the 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.600
 researchers left nothing more and nothing 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.610
 less than a Jamaican community 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.899
 where dancing has great importance to 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.580
 social level and a group of 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.320
 volunteers took several 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.270
 measures both men and women are 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.729
 they measured their wrists ankles 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.570
 knees elbows ears 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.319
 feet all this to evaluate its symmetry 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.060
 subsequently the individuals are 

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:58.220
 He started dancing but not only dancing 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.950
 put them under certain conditions to 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.069
 not have their identity and know if they were 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.319
 men women or the shape of their body 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:08.330
 they were put under cameras for only 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:11.120
 capture their movements as well as the 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.709
 used in sports in medicine or in 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.180
 movies this I catch all the 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.159
 movements records 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.480
 and could eliminate all the factors that 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:19.040
 could alter the decision of 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.780
 observer all the dancers were 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.670
 recorded for one minute with the same 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.040
 music the music that was fashionable in 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.629
 that moment based on the movements 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.069
 captured models were made in 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.230
 third dimension of all 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.629
 dancers all the videos were 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.950
 shown to 150 people both men 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.719
 as women two videos were 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.939
 submitted observers the 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:39.109
 Observers have to decide if the 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:41.840
 that the video that was being 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:43.430
 presenting was a man or a woman and 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.669
 if this was a good dancer or bad 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.409
 dancer as results obtained that 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:51.829
 women are slightly better 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:53.720
 evaluating to identify the sex of the 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.790
 video that was presented to them and they are also 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.530
 better by identifying the best 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.109
 dancers as the most individuals 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.669
 symmetrical if the women said this 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:03.290
 He is a good dancer and it turns out that 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:04.770
 he was part of the group of men 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.510
 more symmetrical 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.820
 this does not mean that men do not 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.680
 have evaluated well the women who 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.420
 they were more symmetrical from their dance 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.790
 if the men did too but 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.580
 the proportion of women was highlighted 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.320
 who made a correct identification 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.330
 in systems in which parents 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.820
 invest less in raising children 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.860
 compared to mothers mothers 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.110
 tend to be more selective and the 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.210
 parents to have more complex deployments 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.280
 to give more information to mothers 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.830
 about the quality of these to be 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.840
 elected the men evaluated as the 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.460
 best dancers were more symmetrical 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.710
 women are getting information 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.570
 of the symmetry of these from the 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.700
 dance for the case of women 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.250
 also the most symmetrical were 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.790
 evaluated as the best dancers 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.530
 but it was not so significant so 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.910
 important as the evaluation of 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.320
 women towards men through the 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.120
 dance are many messages that are 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.730
 send the energy the rhythm the 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.500
 dosage of the same energy the 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.210
 neuromuscular coordination the 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.710
 interaction of all these factors and in 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.110
 a future the researchers hope 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.600
 know what is the interaction between all 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.340
 these and that results in clear that 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.239
 they also want to know if in the end 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:18.060
 the dance has a direct correlation 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:21.739
 with reproductive success now dance and 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.739
 sure there is someone matching their symmetry 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.740
 and the final question is what will you think 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.740
 sergio of this 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.140
 it's not true years after the 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.890
 publication of this article the authors 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.300
 they send a comment saying that they 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.670
 they retract what was published in that 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.220
 article and well nobody knows exactly 

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:49.610
 what happened or at least I do not know until 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.110
 where I know and I could investigate 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.180
 some student took a bad one 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.610
 data then it is not entirely reliable 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:58.069
 but it does not sound so crazy too 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:02.689
 it's something that someone world does and 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:04.630
 ready is ratified or it will be but 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:06.940
 doing research 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.770
 you have to identify the articles that 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:12.460
 they are real and those that are not and if the authors 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:15.540
 they say their data is not 100% credible 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:18.680
 Well, the authors 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.680
 who else will know what
