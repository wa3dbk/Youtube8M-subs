00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
are so confident despite being dark and

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.630 
are so confident despite being dark and
I've<00:00:51.840> been<00:00:52.110> very<00:00:52.260> fortunate<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.010> was<00:00:53.460> in

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
I've been very fortunate that I was in

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.189 
I've been very fortunate that I was in
sort<00:00:53.850> of<00:00:53.910> pressure<00:00:54.120> with<00:00:54.420> these<00:00:54.570> complexes

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
sort of pressure with these complexes

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.750 
sort of pressure with these complexes
but<00:00:55.350> obviously<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.890> was<00:00:56.010> all<00:00:56.160> around<00:00:56.460> us<00:00:56.610> and

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
but obviously it was all around us and

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.819 
but obviously it was all around us and
we<00:00:56.850> can't<00:00:57.030> be<00:00:57.149> blind<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:58.410> that's<00:00:58.649> how<00:00:58.800> I

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
we can't be blind to it so that's how I

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.500 
we can't be blind to it so that's how I
got<00:00:59.129> into<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.730> think<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.180> way<00:01:00.329> these

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
got into it I think the way these

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.180 
got into it I think the way these
campaigns<00:01:01.020> help<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.590> they<00:01:01.770> trigger<00:01:02.160> a

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
campaigns help is they trigger a

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.609 
campaigns help is they trigger a
conversation<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.149> debate<00:01:03.510> people<00:01:04.170> like<00:01:04.470> you

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
conversation a debate people like you

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.440 
conversation a debate people like you
are<00:01:04.769> doing<00:01:04.860> programs<00:01:05.489> on<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.729> there<00:01:06.090> are<00:01:06.180> so

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
are doing programs on it there are so

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.350 
are doing programs on it there are so
many<00:01:06.659> people<00:01:06.960> who<00:01:07.200> are<00:01:07.229> writing<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.740> me

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
many people who are writing to me

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.450 
many people who are writing to me
sharing<00:01:09.360> their<00:01:09.630> stories<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.409> some<00:01:10.650> ways<00:01:10.920> it's

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
sharing their stories in some ways it's

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.520 
sharing their stories in some ways it's
a<00:01:11.729> it's<00:01:11.939> cathartic<00:01:12.510> for<00:01:12.540> them<00:01:12.869> for<00:01:13.140> some<00:01:13.320> it's

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
a it's cathartic for them for some it's

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.100 
a it's cathartic for them for some it's
a<00:01:13.650> validation<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.509> thoughts<00:01:15.509> some<00:01:15.930> it's

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
a validation of that thoughts some it's

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.320 
a validation of that thoughts some it's
just<00:01:16.200> giving<00:01:16.770> some<00:01:17.040> kind<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.369> confidence<00:01:18.030> so

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
just giving some kind of a confidence so

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.170 
just giving some kind of a confidence so
I<00:01:18.540> think<00:01:18.930> every<00:01:19.740> drop<00:01:20.009> helps<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.610> mean<00:01:20.790> no<00:01:20.939> one

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
I think every drop helps I mean no one

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.880 
I think every drop helps I mean no one
