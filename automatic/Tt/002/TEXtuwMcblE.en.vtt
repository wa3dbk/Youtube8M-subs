00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.090
 hello it's true that today I have the motorola with me too 

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:05.950
 as if drew heathrow usa 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.900
 which is strong enough it will bring with a physical keyboard and a touch screen 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.959
 so this is a format that is not very very unusual 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:15.179
 it's pretty cool 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.990
 but who has a 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.030
 hum of his qualities and his faults we're going 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.140
 we'll go on it pretty quickly then inside the bbc you 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.960
 have a gigahertz processor 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.189
 so that makes it better to go fast enough 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.189
 the worry is that he is often in a vacuum 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.760
 now 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.570
 because the concern 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.570
 jussi annila can of course 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.100
 it is that he is in promo he 2% 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.260
 two points of 6 I remember support these are points 2 who when 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.180
 even a good previous action so that's an attack that motorola 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.910
 do not go out with one of takes three points something for m 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.770
 it does not prevent applications from running right away 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.130
 especially pretty interesting thing knowing that the phone at m 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.670
 a screen to his little manias it's free three babies an inch 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.200
 a very small thing is sure what 300 pixels children by 480 go 300 douars 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.520
 4 euros 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.390
 m 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.880
 but the applications that might require 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.880
 large screen sizes works 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.240
 now this can come to fruition 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.750
 it does not sound bad that I tried others 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.340
 Well, not that 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.580
 I'm going to try 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.580
 because it's complicated too 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.970
 even it works so we get to have all the time 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.170
 all well despite the size of the screen eden power for spotify had the 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.930
 means 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.780
 art 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.780
 Action 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.100
 a little change their password as it works more 

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:11.999
 see 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:13.439
 here we are apart from that 

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:18.209
 what can generate 10 rebounds on the screen we do not have the responsiveness% 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.560
 of a traditional screen of that surely related to the technology that 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.879
 uses a lawsuit 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.279
 normal small 5 megapixel camera embedded in this 

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:29.929
 phone 

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:32.690
 with 1 1 me clash the debt 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.809
 at the ump do not expect much of the images 

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:37.159
 the world 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.159
 but I understand devices that have nothing to do with galaxy s2 is really 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:41.489
 impressive for the photos 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.439
 I'm here it's far from terrible 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:48.599
 for serge savard now I would lose my physical ride side of the device 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.959
 you have a jack jack layton aof 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.509
 on the side 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:55.519
 you have a button that directly launches the agenda is not bad 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.219
 damage anyway choose the application you want on the left 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:02:59.759
 volume 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:03.989
 micro went to swim and when will open if not the microphone 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:06.609
 me is rather to bend 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.959
 the impression that is small location for a score 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.679
 for samba 

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:14.209
 in the cornet 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.599
 you have a sim card space to space 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.759
 to fix it patrick 

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:21.759
 fond of individuals you do not 

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:24.759
 at this level 

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:27.589
 it's an interesting thing about his passes that has a keyboard that is 

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:31.319
 almost folds southern deanat with criteria that are targeted bevels 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.429
 % of each side douchy-the-mines each half of the left keyboard and 

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:36.999
 right came to visit different way 

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:39.349
 what is supposed to help 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.509
 without looking for a practical job k 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:45.509
 m will open to lead 

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:49.639
 the message 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:52.749
 during practice it is not bad because of the blow m 

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:56.159
 you always have lava instead of other screens that is not taken 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.799
 by the keyboard since he really jump percent I think the keyboard 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.509
 not extremely nice it's not worth a blackberry keyboard 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:05.969
 touching a little hard in French but it hurts the fingers in 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.149
 to type is a question of habit 

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:13.099
 after there are also things that seemed to me not very logical in euros 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.759
 the fact that it is impossible to type the character dollars per year m 

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:21.929
 directly since this one there is not a symbol either 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:26.569
 after I found it a bit short 

00:04:26.569 --> 00:04:28.749
 what to say otherwise 

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:31.709
 I do not have much to say particular about this mobile in India by the 

00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:33.240
 does it really have a shape 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.870
 different m 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.130
 an info it gives a feeling of a finish still pretty sturdy so 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.160
 it serves 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.259
 motorola who him 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:45.879
 aimed at professionals who have done a kids thing of these women who 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:48.909
 sell as being super secure underground but there is a whole system 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:50.309
 of 

00:04:50.309 --> 00:04:51.590
 because at home 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.819
 stella decryption 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:55.559
 recently they have copied 

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:58.899
 the shawl man what situation and security 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:01.509
 encryption 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:02.870
 data encryption 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.540
 so there it appears that all the data very well but it's a bit 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.199
 con why on the atrix they have good fingerprint reader and no 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:11.320
 on this one I found myself it's super convenient to be able to unlock 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.659
 how the streets the atrix 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:15.979
 so 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:19.360
 a few things of keyboard match that is not great 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.830
 the ump 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.740
 good men 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.879
 it's completely unreadable sun steinman 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:27.960
 a drama 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.699
 but it's on stage not at all managed to reach the level 

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:32.379
 blackberry screens 

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:36.020
 if not in terms of autonomy of the foot of the stadium favorites classic so alone 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.889
 discharge pretty fast but 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:41.240
 you who were a little more than the others what I could m 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.529
 spotted leaving it for 100 m 

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:47.289
 even without doing anything face faty not too fast while m but the galaxy s2 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:50.289
 by a rise in charges a little alone 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:54.379
 otherwise what did I drive 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:56.960
 he got me wifi 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.249
 wisely some more and more 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:03.550
 so all the features that allow to connect to a computer a 

00:06:03.549 --> 00:06:08.569
 telephone head taxons to display the quartet sms on the computer the 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:12.330
 sono which allows to control these speakers local reasoning 

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:17.429
 CCTV applications is with this weapon for it all 

00:06:17.429 --> 00:06:19.099
 it works very well 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:22.099
 multimedia side is better to forget the camera is to manage 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:27.569
 he is sold with a sound that is too old I rely on the plan there 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:28.830
 to make an idea the day 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.309
 we'll see what it gives banks it was bought by 

00:06:32.309 --> 00:06:33.400
 google 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.759
 so to the question is that in place of a blackberry I would say no 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:40.699
 but it's a good partner 

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:43.499
 this kind of notebook the format is very nice
