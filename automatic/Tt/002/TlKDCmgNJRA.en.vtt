00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.940
 according to your pointed to grief 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.540
 backstage in May 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.950
 meaning 12th year we developed 10 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.449
 priority direction of development 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.949
 republics and therefore if these 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:22.260
 priority programs will be implemented 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.590
 this program for one year for three years 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.429
 then for seven eight years we are actually 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.099
 we can arrange the volume of the economy 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.630
 republic of dagestan 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:37.590
 hence Dagestan should 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.300
 stop crisis him problems not for 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.100
 Russian Federation yeast and 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.570
 more effectively in some places are they directed 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.640
 main directions before it all 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.190
 security of the republic 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.610

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.170
 safe Dagestan the most with you and 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.750
 other structures 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.899
 this is also a completely new approach 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.229
 passed and gain and existence of military retard 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.689
 happy about this modern technology 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:08.790
 technicians to provide 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:12.720
 actual observation of the republic and 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.210
 analysis of the situation on a holiday the second is me 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.430
 call it a new industrialization 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.369
 industrial analysis 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.820
 enterprises this update is actually 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.290
 construction of new enterprises 3 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.470
 exemption from obsolete enterprise 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.990
 cities particular drums rachkov he 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.720
 overload on the sleeve that does not remain 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.049
 together for normal life means 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.030
 we must free sary and 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.490
 industrial sites and organized 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.079
 playground there park and so on 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.760
 then and 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.550
 one of the main ones 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.800
 we consider the conclusions of the loan pro 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.790
 industrial complex 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:56.280
 Dagestan to me.wav 380 and that grapes 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.270
 started on year 90 now the best 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.760
 whatever that is 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.680
 a hundred thousand grapes and besides 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.000
 virtually every hectare 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.740
 ohh spring will call 4 5 jobs 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.530
 the coming years have been planning over 5 thousand 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.570
 hectares of vineyards it means that 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.010
 more than twenty thousand people will be busy 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:22.350
 at work till remember 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.510
 so there is the possibility of creation 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.870
 greenhouse farms here I am talking to 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.160
 Defense Secretary 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.530
 food from Dagestan there 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.000
 productive shame then can if it 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.070
 will be around the year of cats 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.340
 so it is necessary year-round 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.470
 provides a variety of other 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.050
 direction amount eventually 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:46.230
 All these priority projects should 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.290
 lead to a new level of education on 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.370
 level of culture a new level of quality 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.370
 life and
