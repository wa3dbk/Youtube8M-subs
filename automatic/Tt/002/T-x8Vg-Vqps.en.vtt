00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
you would tell us you have a one long

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.059 
you would tell us you have a one long
and<00:02:56.160> one<00:02:56.430> short<00:02:56.640> flash<00:02:57.239> a<00:02:57.629> one<00:02:58.200> one<00:02:58.440> code<00:02:58.709> what

and one short flash a one one code what

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.069 
and one short flash a one one code what
it<00:02:59.160> would<00:02:59.250> work<00:02:59.340> out<00:02:59.519> fast<00:02:59.849> their<00:03:00.690> code<00:03:00.900> would

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
it would work out fast their code would

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.619 
it would work out fast their code would
be<00:03:01.140> maybe<00:03:01.470> six<00:03:01.980> flashes<00:03:02.670> that<00:03:02.849> are<00:03:03.000> long<00:03:03.209> and

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
be maybe six flashes that are long and

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.000 
be maybe six flashes that are long and
then<00:03:03.720> two<00:03:03.900> that<00:03:04.109> are<00:03:04.200> short<00:03:04.440> that<00:03:04.769> would<00:03:04.890> be<00:03:04.980> a

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
then two that are short that would be a

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.300 
then two that are short that would be a
six<00:03:05.370> two<00:03:05.609> flash<00:03:06.440> that<00:03:07.440> will<00:03:07.590> shut<00:03:07.799> it<00:03:07.920> off<00:03:08.040> and

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
six two flash that will shut it off and

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.490 
six two flash that will shut it off and
reconnect<00:03:08.849> everything<00:03:09.030> if<00:03:09.840> we<00:03:09.959> set<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.319> light

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
reconnect everything if we set the light

back<00:03:10.739> through<00:03:10.769> no<00:03:11.519> codes<00:03:13.340> okay<00:03:14.340> now<00:03:14.459> we've

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
back through no codes okay now we've

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.930
