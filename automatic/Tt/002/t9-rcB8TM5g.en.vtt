00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
between 35 and 50 okay so it's all

between 35 and 50 okay so it's all
reasonably<00:05:26.560> priced<00:05:26.919> that's<00:05:27.280> what<00:05:27.370> we<00:05:27.460> wanted

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:27.729 
reasonably priced that's what we wanted

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.659 
reasonably priced that's what we wanted
and<00:05:27.910> want<00:05:28.270> to<00:05:28.330> make<00:05:28.510> it<00:05:28.830> viable<00:05:29.830> for<00:05:30.220> anyone<00:05:30.550> to

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
and want to make it viable for anyone to

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:32.730 
and want to make it viable for anyone to
be<00:05:30.760> able<00:05:30.790> to<00:05:30.970> do<00:05:31.150> and<00:05:31.389> at<00:05:31.900> the<00:05:31.990> same<00:05:32.020> time<00:05:32.199> make
