00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.839
 the interior insulation of external walls is 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.509
 a safe alternative in particular 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.380
 then if not an external insulation 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:21.560
 is possible 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.420
 through the use of internal insulation 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.900
 change the damp conditions in the 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.369
 exterior masonry so for the 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.349
 certain building physics security 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.550
 Essential requirements to be observed 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:38.100
 to provide and safe for the 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.129
 existing masonry becomes its u value 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.719
 and as a result the 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.969
 dimensioning of the insulation thickness for the 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.489
 renovation determines the stock 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.140
 masonry must be free from building damage such as 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.489
 moist for example and its mold 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.829
 Building materials basically have the 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.879
 Property water through capillary 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.010
 to absorb and distribute cavities 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.649
 therefore it is imperative that the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.470
 Moisture content of the masonry already before 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:10.229
 the inside of the measure examined and 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.149
 if necessary, a refurbished one 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.429
 appropriate solution to avoid 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.200
 rising damp is that 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:18.390
 Subsequent contribution of one 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.110
 horizontal lock with the help of 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.110
 injection 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.680
 without sufficient impact rain protection 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.080
 can be too much moisture in the 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.930
 get masonry and possibly 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.009
 Build damaging damp accumulations 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.799
 cause 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.240
 a sufficient and sure blow 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.789
 rain protection prevents this 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.640
 For example, if the masonry a 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:48.070
 functional rendering or water 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.020
 repellent surface has as 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.740
 also safe impact rain protection 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:57.069
 a double - shell masonry resp 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.740
 masonry with a curtain wall one 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:04.289
 shielding the neighboring buildings or the 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.289
 south to east orientation of the facade 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.890
 through air convection can be room 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.940
 Humidity between masonry and 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.910
 get the insulation 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.460
 this results in heat losses and the 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.800
 Danger of condensation formation 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.930
 Prevention of structural damage is allowed 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.870
 no air circulation between insulation 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.180
 and existing wall convection will come 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.580
 in rigips systems through professional 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.930
 approaches to holst or the bed 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.930
 prohibited procedure 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.459
 through an increased heat flow and 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.920
 consequent low temperatures 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.019
 Adjacent surfaces can be found in the 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.299
 Area of ​​the thermal bridges to condensation 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.840
 and mold are the following 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:58.700
 Here are to pay particular attention 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:03.230
 window reveals radiator 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:06.269
 Integrate de covers incorporate the walls 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:11.760
 as well as ge 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:13.769
 beamed ceilings on a careful 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.959
 examination of the aforementioned advance payments 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.480
 for the inner insulation can now be a 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:22.430
 Professional and safe renovation in the 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.430
 building stock
