00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
mind is useless to me at this point and

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.780 
mind is useless to me at this point and
yeah<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:07.020> I<00:04:07.560> kind<00:04:08.040> of<00:04:08.100> figured<00:04:08.220> he<00:04:08.490> was<00:04:08.640> going

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
yeah and I kind of figured he was going

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.010 
yeah and I kind of figured he was going
to<00:04:08.880> either<00:04:09.060> explode<00:04:09.660> or<00:04:10.100> or<00:04:11.630> u-turn<00:04:12.630> here<00:04:12.840> at

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
to either explode or or u-turn here at

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.990 
to either explode or or u-turn here at
this<00:04:13.170> point<00:04:13.470> if<00:04:14.100> he<00:04:14.160> predicted<00:04:14.580> to<00:04:14.700> switch<00:04:14.880> I

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
this point if he predicted to switch I

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000 
this point if he predicted to switch I
knew<00:04:15.120> he<00:04:15.240> would<00:04:15.390> explode<00:04:15.750> even<00:04:16.350> if<00:04:16.620> he<00:04:16.739> didn't

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
knew he would explode even if he didn't

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.710 
knew he would explode even if he didn't
predict<00:04:17.250> this<00:04:17.340> switch<00:04:17.880> you<00:04:18.120> know<00:04:18.209> exploding

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
predict this switch you know exploding

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.570 
predict this switch you know exploding
on<00:04:18.810> a<00:04:18.840> rachi<00:04:19.080> you<00:04:19.440> know<00:04:19.530> that's<00:04:19.799> it's<00:04:20.100> good

it's<00:04:21.000> a<00:04:21.060> good<00:04:21.090> move<00:04:21.390> because<00:04:21.570> you<00:04:21.900> know<00:04:22.020> he

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
it's a good move because you know he

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.170 
it's a good move because you know he
basically<00:04:22.890> wants<00:04:23.400> a<00:04:23.460> trot<00:04:23.640> yet<00:04:23.850> here<00:04:24.030> so
