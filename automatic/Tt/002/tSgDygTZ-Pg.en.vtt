00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
have ADHD but that's only because they

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.209 
have ADHD but that's only because they
don't<00:00:13.139> know<00:00:13.349> what<00:00:13.469> it's<00:00:13.559> really<00:00:13.769> like<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:14.099> have

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
don't know what it's really like to have

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.709 
don't know what it's really like to have
as<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.429> little<00:00:14.639> kid<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:14.820> was<00:00:15.000> diagnosed<00:00:15.450> with<00:00:15.570> it

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
as a little kid I was diagnosed with it

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.029 
as a little kid I was diagnosed with it
but<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:15.870> never<00:00:15.960> took<00:00:16.230> any<00:00:16.379> meds<00:00:16.619> for<00:00:16.770> it<00:00:16.890> so<00:00:17.010> I

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
but I never took any meds for it so I

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.950 
but I never took any meds for it so I
never<00:00:17.160> knew<00:00:17.640> what<00:00:17.880> normal<00:00:18.480> people<00:00:18.720> thought

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
never knew what normal people thought

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.269 
never knew what normal people thought
but<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.170> can't<00:00:19.380> stand<00:00:19.710> when<00:00:19.830> people<00:00:19.859> say<00:00:20.160> that

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
but I can't stand when people say that

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.099 
but I can't stand when people say that
ADHD<00:00:20.580> is<00:00:20.850> not<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:21.029> real<00:00:21.240> thing<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:21.900> it's

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
ADHD is not a real thing and that it's

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.750 
ADHD is not a real thing and that it's
just<00:00:22.350> an<00:00:22.439> excuse<00:00:22.800> for<00:00:22.830> lazy<00:00:23.160> people<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.580> blame

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
just an excuse for lazy people to blame

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.130 
just an excuse for lazy people to blame
their<00:00:23.910> laziness<00:00:24.390> on<00:00:24.510> what<00:00:24.720> I<00:00:24.750> can't<00:00:24.990> stand

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
their laziness on what I can't stand

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.599 
their laziness on what I can't stand
even<00:00:25.500> more<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:25.949> when<00:00:26.070> people<00:00:26.099> actually

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
even more is that when people actually

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.400 
even more is that when people actually
do<00:00:26.970> use<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.330> as<00:00:27.420> an<00:00:27.539> excuse<00:00:27.869> even<00:00:28.170> when<00:00:28.289> they

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
do use it as an excuse even when they

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.660 
do use it as an excuse even when they
don't<00:00:28.500> have<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.949> just<00:00:29.070> because<00:00:29.310> they<00:00:29.429> didn't

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
don't have it just because they didn't

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.130 
don't have it just because they didn't
do<00:00:29.760> well<00:00:29.939> in<00:00:29.970> school<00:00:30.090> or<00:00:30.599> they're<00:00:30.750> bad<00:00:30.929> at

even<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.430> made<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.760> joke<00:00:56.820> but<00:00:57.149> only<00:00:57.300> as<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.539> joke

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
even I made that joke but only as a joke

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.299 
even I made that joke but only as a joke
because<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.410> such<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.620> huge<00:00:58.949> exaggeration

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
because that is such a huge exaggeration

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.279 
because that is such a huge exaggeration
it's<00:01:00.120> really<00:01:00.390> nothing<00:01:00.660> like<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.960> most<00:01:01.170> of

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
it's really nothing like that most of

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.990 
it's really nothing like that most of
the<00:01:01.379> time<00:01:01.530> if<00:01:01.710> they<00:01:01.859> sound<00:01:02.160> unrealistic<00:01:02.699> to

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
the time if they sound unrealistic to

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.039 
the time if they sound unrealistic to
you<00:01:03.090> it's<00:01:03.210> probably<00:01:03.329> just<00:01:03.570> because<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.899> don't

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
you it's probably just because you don't

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.719 
you it's probably just because you don't
have<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.350> trust<00:01:04.619> me<00:01:04.739> they're<00:01:04.920> all<00:01:05.100> real<00:01:05.369> they

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
have it trust me they're all real they

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.700 
have it trust me they're all real they
