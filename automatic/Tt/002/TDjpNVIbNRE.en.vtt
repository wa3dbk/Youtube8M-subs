00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.599
 and good hello to all and all 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.170
 friends these areas where poetry I hope that 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.330
 you are fine 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.460
 me in any case it's going nickel and 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.910
 today we find ourselves where a glitch 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.300
 on battlefield 3 on lamah pipeline from 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:26.730
 his ride so it's a glitch instinct 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.710
 it's a brief role simple enough to do 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.309
 so you just have to go 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.329
 on the map 1 is so here I would like 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.829
 you see I'm waiting for 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.010
 two players but hey you can 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.920
 to do in part partly also 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.930
 so you go on the map 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.600
 and then you take a helicopter from 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.579
 preference or a jeep or whatever 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.309
 what and you go on the right mountain 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.140
 in front of where there is the yes the pillar there 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.960
 so we'll be there right now 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:00.930
 so here we are in front of this pillar 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.489
 this famous foot then to make the break 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.460
 so at the beginning I wanted and I 'm going 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.799
 land on the top but lack of 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.799
 pot I did not get there I was going there 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.700
 to arrive but little bit short it's not 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:18.450
 obliged to land at all safe on the on 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.450
 the pillar for to get to do this 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:26.009
 break then you have to be fair 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:29.009
 land on the mountain you see 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.009
 was waiting is actually according to the brief you 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.659
 will allow you to be invisible 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.280
 invincible and able to shoot at 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.220
 enemies so see here I landed on 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.950
 the mountain and I went back into the 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.630
 match 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.310
 you see I'm in the mountain 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.360
 plainly see I'm trying to get out of 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.159
 there I left the aj resold so here 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.770
 I will show you right away when 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.880
 so we shoot yes roast shots 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.640
 outside the balls do not make 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.409
 while I hold on the outside the 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.880
 balls come out very well so we can 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.079
 to kill the enemies from the outside and the 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.460
 enemies did not see us from 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:07.640
 inside and can not touch us 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.819
 uh no this is it a little trick 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.140
 it's funny but it's true the odds 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.450
 contains a little bonus if I tell you 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.920
 see again I'm flying but there's more 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.370
 how it does to steal in fact it's 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.280
 also to a little lama game bug and is not 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.390
 very well done here because it's not 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.280
 made for people to come and see 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.600
 I'm flying here I'm suspended 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:33.220
 downright in the air look i'm 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.800
 in suspension altogether so cost 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:41.630
 it's just perfect far from saying 'here you go 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:44.470
 I'm falling here and that's because 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:48.920
 frankly he is he is still 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.540
 pretty well done so well I can drown 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.440
 shoot the bat quietly in the process of 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.420
 fly this it's just perfect so 0% of 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.300
 life I'm still in the air and that's it 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.000
 so I hope this video is 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.100
 glide you will be pleased do not hesitate to 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.500

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.180
