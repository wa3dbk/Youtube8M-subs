00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:10.910
 2004 bmw mini in 2004 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:16.470
 r 53 Cooper s received goods 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:21.430
 This cooper s 1 owner is in a very beautiful state 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:25.810
 It will be the late version of r 53 that has been upgraded to 170 hp 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:29.880
 It is also better in the headlights of the regulation of the standard here with minor changes 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.880
 It has been changed to the projector 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.770
 The body is a combination of black eye purple metallic and white roof 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:42.600
 This has become a manual shift six-stage 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:47.079
 It is genuine aluminum of this 16 inches There is almost no noticeable wound here 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:51.550
 Four and it has been also used in a very beautiful state 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:53.380
 It It is brake pad plant Rekara brake rotor is replaced here of better goods outside 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.410
 I will 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:01:01.450
 If you have a brake loader, there is a slit rotor in front and back 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:03.060
 Because more than half of the brake pads are still left, it may be necessary to replace them for the time being 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.330
 think 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:10.440
 Though there are a few wounds with use 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.640
 There are no big scratches or noticeable dents that break the image 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.400
 The body is also very beautiful 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:20.700
 Area of 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.700
 It is a spoiler, and this person is also in a very beautiful state 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.180
 This is the Province Cap of the person here This person is very serious 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.150
 Three glass side of the rear is film pasted 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.480
 The interior phase is an optional cockpit chronometer. 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.480
 I will 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.940
 It becomes three independent dials 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:50.800
 And cooper s standard 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.490
 It is a leather steering wheel that contains a gun grip type punching laser . 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.650
 Also 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.650
 It is in a very beautiful state without breakage of the stitch 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:05.010
 I think this is the shift knob specification, but there are a few threads around here, though 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.860
 I think that it is a level that hardly bothers 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:14.010
 The condition of the shifter is also very good 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.010
 Also Tokoro shift feeling towards the shifter also has become a good 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:21.270
 And this one's seat It is gray and silver fabric combination 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.850
 It has become the seat even more here 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:31.230
 Better of beautiful thread mileage in a large thread a very beautiful state does not there 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:35.200
 I'm running a little with 89,000 kilometers, but the condition of the interior is also very beautiful 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:39.760
 It has become a time when you can see what has been used very importantly 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:43.720
 It has become the weight salt non smoking vehicle cigarette lighter does not there ashtray 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:47.439
 There is no also unpleasant smell that there is no also be used traces of fragrances 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:53.230
 I think the next owner will be nice and comfortable 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:56.470
 This is the passenger side The passenger side is also very beautiful 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.780
 Because it is a four - seater, it can not be said that it is wide to flattering 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.760
 Also become quite possible that I am riding four adults 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:07.060
 I am 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.060
 It looks like the rear seat is also very beautiful 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.470
 Who is the heavenly person 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:17.420
 There is no dirt 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:20.349
 Meeting day visor of the driver's seat side which came from this later late type It is also here 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.349
 It is in a beautiful state 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:31.010
 This person is in the trunk room A little luggage in the trunk room 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.300
 There is enough space for putting 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:38.650
 And it is the lower side of this one 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:44.200
 r 53 cooper s is coming to this public offering 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:45.549
 There are many cars that are flooded here, but there is no flood of rainwater at all. 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:51.069
 Hmm 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:55.299
 This vehicle is a genuine key to be happy but we have attached two 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:56.290
 There is usually a combination of just one spare key per keyless one, but this one 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.799
 Is 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.470
 It is genuine key, but two things that work properly are attached 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:05.760
 I think this is a good point 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.760
 At the start of the engine 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.790
 It looks good at one end 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:22.639
 Idling is also stable properly 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:28.780
 There is no trap missing at all 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:28.780
 Currently, the meter reading is 89,0077 kg 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:37.509
 Torsion guarantee with meter reading and 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:38.050
 In line with the Central Authority's meter check and regular dealer check records 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.689
 I am 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:45.219
 It will guarantee the actual measurement 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:46.239
 It is a steering power steering on the right There is a little answer here too 

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:51.249
 But 

00:04:46.239 --> 00:04:55.620
 This car steering auto is also very quiet here 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:59.500
 There is no lamp lighting which shows abnormalities such as check lamps 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:04.409
 And this is the air conditioner of this one 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.900
 Also it has become a compressor condenser operation check ok person of air conditioning 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:09.560
 Border plane 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:13.160
 It is nice to have it very much, but the cooler has been properly asked 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:18.280
 Of course in this one 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:22.849
 It also becomes ok switching of switching cooling heating of the way towards the heating 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:29.270
 And it can be said only of serious disease more here 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:32.470
 Storage of the door mirror is also working properly now 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.470
 It is such a state 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.450
 Right side 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:43.980
 Rattling of the way motor also there is not any 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:47.580
 And as I mentioned earlier 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:51.660
 It is a shifter of this manual. 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:55.740
 I 'm back and the map shift feeling is good too 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:59.520
 Cormorant we ran Soko distance but is also a good state of the clutch 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.610
 I think that the owner in front also was good at how to ride a 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:06.449
 You are the clutch 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:13.060
 The release valve is also good. The condition is also good for the Marys valve . 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:18.600
 There is no big gap in the clutch meed timing or the clutch is extremely heavy . 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:18.600
 I think that you will be able to understand if you check it with this current car 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:29.590
 And here you shift boots 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:34.289
 Along with than to have some sharp here but I think that should not worry too much 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:40.550
 Since the state that is in this kind of wind when there is some sharp 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:40.550
 It is a report that I think whether it is a level that can not be a station that is hardly noticeable
