00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.190
 good if we are in the call of duty 

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:07.860
 advanced warfare I'm unnim play 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.660
 background on the rape map was that 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.490
 when congress rafita and Augustin states 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.889
 when foursome and does not reflect 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.240
 the clamp and put teams duel and not 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.920
 it is used to make four people 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.779
 they mention pretty good departure the 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.609
 you will see me I think it was the most 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.199
 I left the team in fact a moment 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.429
 they started telling me to pay for a 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.289
 against nobody is really reaching us 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.490
 I all so I hope you enjoy 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.009
 the background gameplay that pass four 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.449
 people are pretty good and that is 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:34.500
 all comment in the first place 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.120
 this to say that in this video we are going to 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.480
 talk about the purposes for this year 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.250
 on youtube I'll give my goal to 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.050
 that I plan to arrive this year on youtube and 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.199
 then what will I do for 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.270
 get it or what methods I'm going to try 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:49.949
 continue to get it or not so 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.390
 good if you see first before anything else 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.609
 with which axis 5 with red dot and 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.019
 hilt that commented rafita that was going 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:56.309
 great so I say as I'm going to 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.109
 try because he does not forgive either 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.519
 the host will see that it kills from afar 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.289
 Perfect hit the nougat is eaten 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.910
 I think that the truth is that 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.799
 I would be a bit freaked out but good 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.810
 come on, there are kids, I think 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.729
 this year I have the objective 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.020
 to reach 20,000 subscribers is 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.790
 a figure that I do not see at all 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.979
 difficult neither complicated nor much less 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.070
 I think one year a year is very long and 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.600
 I think it can be reached easily but 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.090
 well I 'm going to put 20,000 since 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.799
 I do not want here to scratch me to put a 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.780
 mega figure high when it's pretty 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.759
 complicated then 20 thousand I think that 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.060
 it can be a pretty pretty goal 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.320
 viable within as much as possible 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.360
 I can also hope to get a little more 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.799
 I can stay close to next year 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.200
 of having reached 20 thousand but I think 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.209
 Sincerely, I think it can 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.950
 easily reach the 20K and I 

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:42.360
 that it would be quite affordable to get this 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.470
 year to the 20 thousand books that we 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.700
 we will be in good position to 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.049
 start the next year but good still 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.670
 there is a lot of work to be done 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.830
 2015 and there is a lot of year left 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.479
 ahead and equal within three months it 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.390
 the pot goes and I leave youtube and the 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.530
 fuck all this or I decide to stay the same 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.450
 within three months imagine that 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.220
 I already have 18,000 imaginary ones 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.330
 new that this never youtube never 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.520
 he knows or is things change from a 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.049
 moment to another and it is already but good 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.170
 bear in mind that a year ago I had 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:10.140
 only 400 or 500 subscribers and now 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.030
 I have 6000 and that's the most expensive 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.740
 start because I think 20 thousand I think 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.910
 I can get to get them 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.370
 I think that is going to be the goal 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.620
 if really to get it I think that 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.690
 I'm going to try to be more constant. 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.300
 I have neither do not play either much 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.530
 but I think I can be more consistent 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.620
 at least three a video every two days 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.600
 very safe and that would indicate four videos 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.100
 a week really and I think it could 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.990
 be pretty good me with four days 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.110
 videos or the week are enough and the 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.940
 video of videos since a daily video 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.520
 I think it would be very repetitive 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.200
 sincerely I also as I say here 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.580
 go in spurts when I got really 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.960
 a season to upload daily video 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.700
 ever is that it has given me mostly 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.590
 last year, yes, it gave me some 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.050
 some piece and suddenly you had a 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.550
 week five or six videos and then there was 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.350
 weeks that you only had two then 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.900
 I want to keep a record within 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.120
 the possible a mean so to speak 43 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.680
 videos are the forecasts four times 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.080
 a week I think it can be 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.150
 pretty good at least so that and 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.280
 nothing simply go varying the call of 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.020
 duty call of duty pass warfare 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.090
 obviously upload them quite well 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.590
 warfare some white 2 also 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.870
 I want to go up in league mode now 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.220
 when they take it out because he forces me to 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.230
 its gameplay that I'm going to catch as 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.819
 a bastard in fact 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.260
 blackout 2 gave him a lot of cane 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:27.060
 white souvenir that gave him a lot 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:29.519
 a lot of cane league mode but they were not 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.440
 warfare I was playing a month ago or 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.840
 well and they burst the object to be me what 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.860
 they burst a lot and I said my mother 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.780
 I have to change the mentality 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.670
 when they leave league mode really give it 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.140
 a lot of cane because I used to be very freaky 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.760
 in 16 instead of counters before it was 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.400
 very freak to competitive or very much 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.620
 I black ops 2 melo me what dad goes all 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.040
 whole it looked a lot to a lot 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.030
 of Spanish teams and dinner 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.090
 intercontinental I do not know how to say it 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.530
 the world dinner I also saw it not by 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.690
 so to speak seville a lot of tournaments 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.450
 parties of people yes and a lot of 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.700
 rock but and I was pretty freaky in that 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.160
 look and do not leave it a little bit 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.519
 side in the ghost and the goal also I started 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.859
 to see it but I do not know how in the end I 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.150
 I was left halfway and barely 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.489
 I will follow competitive risks then 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.599
 I think that in league mode, I think that 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.340
 I have to give him a straw again and 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.169
 over with the subject of how they have taken 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.850
 now silver bronze and such that they are going to 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.530
 take it out I think it can be pretty good 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.610
 and I think I'm going to give it a lot of sugarcane 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.050
 also so sometime yes that 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.650
 you'll have from time to time so there's no 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.300
 wait 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.400
 and profitability handles because really 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.380
 there is impossible to burst there is played 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.389
 to go to death and win that is the 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.500
 main goal 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.210
 then kids at the end then started 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.100
 talk about one thing and I leave the topic 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.630
 as always but good what is it that 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.100
 I was commenting kids 20,000 subs 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.289
 this is going to be the goal this year if 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.139
 I am constant in YouTube this is going to be 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:47.850
 the goal if I do not get it I think that 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.199
 I could consider it as a failure 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.780
 I sincerely believe that yes I could 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:52.800
 consider as a failure why lie 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.050
 let's be realistic or for me 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.880
 20,000 sub is today I do not see it 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.229
 quite feasible we are really 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.090
 growing right now at a pace 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:03.600
 pretty good on the channel an average of 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.490
 50 60 subs daily or more or less 100 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.020
 subs every two days we really go for 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.460
 there a few days plus one less but 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.840
 it has really remained a good 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.120
 mean then if we continue like this 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.010
 obviously, we will have them but 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.199
 well you never know how I say the same 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:18.270
 Suddenly people get tired or suddenly 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:20.190
 a bad time comes and he starts to win 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.900
 very few subs but I believe that the 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.300
 target is 20,000 kids their I believe 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.310
 that we can we can get it 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:30.410
 easily so I hope you are 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.410
 here everyone to sack to get it
