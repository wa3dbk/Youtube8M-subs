you know yeah and no yeah Australia that
last<00:00:57.090> record<00:00:57.390> we<00:00:57.570> came<00:00:57.750> three<00:00:58.050> times<00:00:59.180> just

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
last record we came three times just

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.650 
last record we came three times just
because<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.320> was<00:01:01.379> really<00:01:02.090> fun<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.120> play<00:01:03.480> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
because it was really fun to play the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.710 
because it was really fun to play the
songs<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.199> crowd<00:01:04.500> was<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.890> best<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:06.119> I

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
songs and the crowd was the best so I

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.870 
songs and the crowd was the best so I
think<00:01:07.170> it's<00:01:07.380> really<00:01:07.500> hard<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.250> do<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.430> bad<00:01:08.640> show

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
think it's really hard to do a bad show

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.980 
think it's really hard to do a bad show
in<00:01:09.000> Australia<00:01:09.479> you'd<00:01:10.470> have<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.860> be<00:01:10.890> really

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
in Australia you'd have to be really

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.340 
in Australia you'd have to be really
something<00:01:13.070> would<00:01:14.070> have<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.280> go<00:01:14.520> really<00:01:14.760> wrong

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
something would have to go really wrong

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.160 
something would have to go really wrong

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.100 
and and you did come to Australia three
times<00:02:32.750> and<00:02:33.049> you<00:02:33.140> told<00:02:33.319> the<00:02:33.410> world<00:02:33.790> 25<00:02:34.790> so<00:02:35.510> you

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.259 
times and you told the world 25 so you
know<00:02:36.260> I<00:02:36.549> thinking<00:02:37.549> bankrupt<00:02:37.970> will<00:02:38.120> be<00:02:38.239> a

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
know I thinking bankrupt will be a

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.629 
know I thinking bankrupt will be a
smaller<00:02:38.989> cycle<00:02:39.590> he<00:02:39.769> wanting<00:02:40.280> to<00:02:40.370> get<00:02:40.489> back

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:40.639 
smaller cycle he wanting to get back

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:43.700 
smaller cycle he wanting to get back
into<00:02:40.819> the<00:02:40.940> studio<00:02:41.139> sooner<00:02:42.139> this<00:02:42.260> hunt

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
into the studio sooner this hunt

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.610 
into the studio sooner this hunt
I<00:02:43.790> think<00:02:44.790> we<00:02:45.090> tour<00:02:45.420> in<00:02:45.630> a<00:02:45.720> very<00:02:45.960> French<00:02:46.350> way

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
I think we tour in a very French way

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.760 
I think we tour in a very French way
which<00:02:47.250> is<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.490> very<00:02:47.850> lazy<00:02:48.440> you<00:02:49.440> know<00:02:49.560> it's<00:02:49.710> a

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
which is a very lazy you know it's a

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.830 
which is a very lazy you know it's a
long<00:02:50.010> period<00:02:50.430> of<00:02:50.520> time<00:02:50.580> but<00:02:51.410> it's<00:02:52.410> not<00:02:52.830> a

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
long period of time but it's not a

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.240 
long period of time but it's not a
intense<00:02:55.520> so<00:02:56.520> I<00:02:57.410> think<00:02:58.410> we<00:02:58.680> stopped<00:02:59.010> pretty

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
intense so I think we stopped pretty

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.190 
intense so I think we stopped pretty
much<00:02:59.520> when<00:02:59.700> we<00:02:59.820> are<00:02:59.880> bored<00:03:00.180> you<00:03:00.720> know<00:03:00.870> when<00:03:01.050> we

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
much when we are bored you know when we

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.850 
much when we are bored you know when we
feel<00:03:01.470> that<00:03:02.480> we've<00:03:03.480> reached<00:03:03.840> what<00:03:04.320> we<00:03:04.530> thought

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
feel that we've reached what we thought

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.600 
feel that we've reached what we thought
was<00:03:05.280> interesting<00:03:05.490> you<00:03:05.910> know<00:03:06.210> we<00:03:07.160> when<00:03:08.160> we<00:03:08.190> play
