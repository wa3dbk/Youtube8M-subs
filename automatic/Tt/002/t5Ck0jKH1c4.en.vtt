00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.690
Hey I'm Greg with Hoss Tools.

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.520
I want to show you what's going on in the
garden.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.760
Our corn is up pretty good size, about knee
high.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.400
We've laid it by with the Hoss plows.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.840
We've got a few weeds coming up in the middles
there that we need to take care of.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.050
Now at this point in the game, it's hard to
take that rototiller and put down through

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.000
there because you're going to get into the
feeder roots -- you really don't have room.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.100
So we're going to show you how you can take
a Hoss Wheel Hoe and clean that corn up for

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.850
the very last time.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.980
Our newest attachment for the Wheel Hoe is
the Disk Harrow.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.920
It attaches to the tool bar with these three
bolts and nuts.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.920
It has these holes right here so you can change
the angle of the disk.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.079
You can be as aggressive with them as you
like, or you can set them straight.

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.620
You want to set both the Disk Harrows at the
same angle.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.929
Today we're going to be setting them at an
angle just like this right here.

00:00:53.929 --> 00:01:05.040
Our 12" Oscillating Hoe is also a great tool
for shallow cultivation.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:37.090
The high carbon spring steel has a sharp edge
on it.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:56.320
It oscillates 20 degrees both ways.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:18.230
So if you're going down through there and
you miss a weed, it flips back and you can

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.629
come back and cut it off, and keep on going.

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:32.790
Here in the corn, we want to clean this corn
up.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:33.790
It's pretty good size.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:34.880
We don't want to get into the feeder roots.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:51.069
And that's the great thing about the oscillating
hoe.

00:02:51.069 --> 00:04:04.409
It cuts really shallow and cleans up those
weeds without getting into the feeder roots

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:14.309
and damaging the corn.
