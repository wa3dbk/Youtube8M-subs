 Are you going to make a survey that 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.140

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:48.330

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.739
 active in the hair and stirs you 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.470
 doing all this in our hair 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.760
 pause time in this treatment is 15 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.830
 20 minutes 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.860
 As I hydrate, I do every 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.049
 15 days I'll leave 20 minutes and 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.000
 then the hair is another my tip 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.489
 Friend for you is not combing your hair 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.140
 wet because the hair when he 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.080
 it was wet he became more susceptible 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.750
 to break and then become even more fragile 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.970
 so avoid doing that you can 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.220
 do after you apply your cream 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.370
 hydration is with the fingers gently 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.980
 separating the newborns but nothing to pass 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.810
 brush or comb if it is a 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.790
 with a wide-toothed comb and the 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.519
 result of this hydration people is a 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.959
 hair with much more shine a hair 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.459
 more disciplined 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.680
 for this when hair is hydrated and 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.230
 Are you happy already noticed that he even 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.630
 You can trim it until you can 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.190

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.320

 I feel that I really liked the 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.329
 Hydrations are what I realized that my 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.470
 kit is supposed to last about five 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.900

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.630
 So I already had enough cloth for my sleeve and for 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.720
