range well we've heard it before and I'm
sure<00:01:49.049> we'll<00:01:49.259> hear<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.560> again<00:01:49.829> but<00:01:50.460> it's

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
sure we'll hear it again but it's

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.670 
sure we'll hear it again but it's
starting<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.060> look<00:01:51.149> like<00:01:51.299> hydrogen<00:01:52.259> vehicles

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
starting to look like hydrogen vehicles

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.590 
starting to look like hydrogen vehicles
are<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.009> future<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.579> green<00:01:54.030> transportation

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
are the future of green transportation

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.840 
are the future of green transportation
so<00:01:55.380> will<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.710> really<00:01:55.860> all<00:01:56.070> come<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.460> be<00:01:56.610> well

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
so will it really all come to be well

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.459 
so will it really all come to be well
that<00:01:57.060> question<00:01:57.329> remains<00:01:57.869> there<00:01:58.079> are<00:01:58.200> still

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
that question remains there are still

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.499 
that question remains there are still
problems<00:01:58.649> with<00:01:59.009> fueling<00:01:59.729> infrastructure<00:02:00.240> and

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
problems with fueling infrastructure and

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.139 
problems with fueling infrastructure and
the<00:02:00.899> cars<00:02:01.110> are<00:02:01.320> still<00:02:01.590> pretty<00:02:01.920> expensive<00:02:02.399> with

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
the cars are still pretty expensive with

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.179 
the cars are still pretty expensive with
automakers<00:02:03.630> pouring<00:02:04.049> untold<00:02:04.469> resources<00:02:04.979> into

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
automakers pouring untold resources into

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.490 
automakers pouring untold resources into
projects<00:02:05.610> just<00:02:05.909> like<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:07.049> car<00:02:07.229> beside

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
projects just like this the car beside

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.380 
projects just like this the car beside
me<00:02:07.649> could<00:02:07.829> very<00:02:08.099> well<00:02:08.190> shape<00:02:08.550> up<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.910> be<00:02:09.119> one

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
me could very well shape up to be one

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.760 
me could very well shape up to be one
that<00:02:09.509> you'll<00:02:09.629> see<00:02:09.690> on<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.020> road<00:02:10.200> in<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.530> very

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
that you'll see on the road in the very

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.870 
that you'll see on the road in the very
near<00:02:11.009> future

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
near future

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:19.950 
near future
you

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960
