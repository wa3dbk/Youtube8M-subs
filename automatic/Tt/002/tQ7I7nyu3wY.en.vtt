back so um I bought my coroplast from

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.930 
back so um I bought my coroplast from
guinea<00:00:35.670> pigs<00:00:35.910> own<00:00:36.059> com<00:00:36.510> so<00:00:37.399> the<00:00:38.399> coroplast<00:00:38.640> is

it<00:00:46.350> my<00:00:47.219> cage<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:48.180> four<00:00:48.390> by<00:00:48.510> six<00:00:48.840> seen<00:00:49.530> seek<00:00:49.800> a

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
it my cage is a four by six seen seek a

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.450 
it my cage is a four by six seen seek a
cage<00:00:50.550> which<00:00:51.090> means<00:00:51.360> there<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.629> four<00:00:52.379> cubes<00:00:52.860> or

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
cage which means there is four cubes or

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.180 
cage which means there is four cubes or
grid<00:00:53.699> things<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.239> way<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.690> four<00:00:55.530> cubes<00:00:55.890> this

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
grid things this way and four cubes this

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.990 
grid things this way and four cubes this
way<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:57.230> mean<00:00:58.230> six<00:00:58.440> cubes<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:58.920> way<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.969> i

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
way I mean six cubes this way so i

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.889 
way I mean six cubes this way so i
started<00:01:00.600> with<00:01:01.430> connecting<00:01:02.430> six<00:01:03.120> grands<00:01:03.570> with

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
started with connecting six grands with

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.230 
started with connecting six grands with
connectors<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.710> sweat<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.339> as<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.090> can<00:01:06.210> see

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
connectors a sweat and as you can see

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.359 
connectors a sweat and as you can see
the<00:01:06.689> connectors<00:01:07.680> down<00:01:07.860> there<00:01:08.040> are<00:01:08.220> like

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
the connectors down there are like

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.030 
the connectors down there are like
facing<00:01:08.790> upward<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.930> then<00:01:10.170> i<00:01:10.200> just<00:01:10.290> did<00:01:10.619> that

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
facing upward so then i just did that

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.800 
facing upward so then i just did that
until<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:11.880> got<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.930> end<00:01:13.200> no<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.189> think<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.460> did

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
until I got to the end no I think I did

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.600 
until I got to the end no I think I did
one<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.900> those<00:01:16.020> things<00:01:16.380> yeah<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.009> then<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.400> put

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
one of those things yeah and then I put

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.359 
one of those things yeah and then I put
um<00:01:17.820> connectors<00:01:18.659> on<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.020> end<00:01:19.380> could<00:01:19.950> to

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
um connectors on the end could to

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.370 
um connectors on the end could to
connect<00:01:20.670> them<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.939> this<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.420> think<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.140> did<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
connect them to this I think I did the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.539 
connect them to this I think I did the
same<00:01:22.409> thing<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.890> other<00:01:22.920> side<00:01:23.040> di<00:01:23.369> did

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
same thing on the other side di did

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.539 
same thing on the other side di did
let's<00:01:24.180> really<00:01:24.390> messy<00:01:24.570> down<00:01:24.810> there<00:01:24.960> sorry<00:01:25.229> and

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
let's really messy down there sorry and

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.190 
let's really messy down there sorry and
then<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.759> took<00:01:26.970> another<00:01:27.330> connector<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.140> I

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
then I took another connector and I

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.770 
then I took another connector and I
connected<00:01:28.560> then<00:01:28.710> at<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.979> top<00:01:29.030> like<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.090> I

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
connected then at the top like this I

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.499 
connected then at the top like this I
put<00:01:31.590> them<00:01:31.799> like<00:01:32.100> facing<00:01:32.579> me<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:32.939> then<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.299> put

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
put them like facing me and then I put

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.230 
put them like facing me and then I put
four<00:01:33.869> cornered<00:01:34.409> into<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.890> four<00:01:35.640> sides<00:01:35.909> out

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
four cornered into the four sides out

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.929 
four cornered into the four sides out
here<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.869> then<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.650> put<00:01:37.860> another<00:01:38.159> grid<00:01:38.490> on<00:01:38.670> top

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
here and then I put another grid on top

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.149 
here and then I put another grid on top
of<00:01:39.210> everything<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.409> it's<00:01:40.619> two<00:01:40.950> grids

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
of everything so that it's two grids

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.460 
of everything so that it's two grids
tall<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.850> then<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.509> put<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.750> connector<00:01:43.200> on<00:01:43.409> the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
tall and then I put a connector on the

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.060 
tall and then I put a connector on the
top<00:01:44.070> facing<00:01:44.340> down<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:45.229> like<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.470> in<00:01:46.710> the

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
top facing down I like that in the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.560 
top facing down I like that in the
corners<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.700> put<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.740> zip<00:01:49.740> ties<00:01:50.180> so<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.270> can<00:01:51.390> see

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
corners I put on zip ties so you can see

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.850 
corners I put on zip ties so you can see
I<00:01:51.600> didn't<00:01:51.899> put<00:01:52.079> connectors<00:01:52.500> because<00:01:52.740> they

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
I didn't put connectors because they

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.980 
I didn't put connectors because they
wouldn't<00:01:53.040> fit<00:01:53.369> correctly<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.659> put<00:01:54.840> some

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
wouldn't fit correctly so I put some

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.170 
wouldn't fit correctly so I put some
ties<00:01:55.229> there<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.729> same<00:01:56.939> on<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.119> other

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
ties there and the same on the other

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.030 
ties there and the same on the other
side<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.750> then<00:01:58.710> on<00:01:59.719> this<00:02:00.719> side<00:02:00.780> this<00:02:01.439> side<00:02:01.500> and

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
side and then on this side this side and

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.910 
side and then on this side this side and
that<00:02:02.939> side<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.540> have<00:02:03.990> three<00:02:04.259> grids<00:02:04.530> because<00:02:04.799> my

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
that side I have three grids because my

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.770 
that side I have three grids because my
cat<00:02:05.130> obviously<00:02:05.610> can't<00:02:05.850> like<00:02:06.000> jump<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.540> that

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
cat obviously can't like jump in that

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.650 
cat obviously can't like jump in that
way<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.710> on<00:02:08.039> this<00:02:08.369> these<00:02:09.119> three<00:02:09.300> sides<00:02:09.509> are

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
way so on this these three sides are

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.809 
way so on this these three sides are
taller

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
taller

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.220 
taller
and<00:02:11.859> so<00:02:12.859> then<00:02:13.069> I<00:02:13.249> put<00:02:13.489> right<00:02:14.060> here<00:02:14.109> put<00:02:15.109> another

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
and so then I put right here put another

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.250 
and so then I put right here put another
good<00:02:15.590> up<00:02:15.799> I<00:02:16.040> just<00:02:16.280> um<00:02:16.549> zip<00:02:17.329> tied<00:02:17.540> it<00:02:17.689> there<00:02:17.959> and

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
good up I just um zip tied it there and

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.530 
good up I just um zip tied it there and
then<00:02:18.319> started<00:02:19.069> using<00:02:19.189> connectors<00:02:19.700> again<00:02:19.939> so

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
then started using connectors again so

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.119 
then started using connectors again so
it's<00:02:20.689> like<00:02:20.719> the<00:02:20.870> same<00:02:21.049> thing<00:02:21.079> I<00:02:21.349> put<00:02:21.829> four

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
it's like the same thing I put four

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.250 
it's like the same thing I put four
grits<00:02:22.310> together<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:22.999> the<00:02:23.719> little<00:02:23.840> connectors

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
grits together and the little connectors

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.589 
grits together and the little connectors
at<00:02:24.379> the<00:02:24.469> bottom<00:02:24.739> then<00:02:24.889> I<00:02:24.920> put<00:02:25.129> um<00:02:25.340> grids<00:02:26.299> there

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
at the bottom then I put um grids there

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.000 
at the bottom then I put um grids there
and<00:02:26.870> then<00:02:27.139> I<00:02:27.170> did<00:02:27.319> the<00:02:27.349> same<00:02:27.439> thing<00:02:27.620> where<00:02:27.980> I

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
and then I did the same thing where I

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.860 
and then I did the same thing where I
had<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.459> grid<00:02:28.609> facing<00:02:29.120> me<00:02:29.299> and<00:02:29.480> then<00:02:29.689> put

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
had the grid facing me and then put

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.149 
had the grid facing me and then put
another<00:02:29.900> great<00:02:30.319> up<00:02:30.439> there<00:02:30.590> and<00:02:30.799> then<00:02:30.920> have<00:02:31.069> the

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:31.159 
another great up there and then have the

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:33.009 
another great up there and then have the
grid<00:02:31.310> spacing<00:02:31.609> find<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.239> connectors<00:02:32.629> facing

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
grid spacing find the connectors facing

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.959 
grid spacing find the connectors facing
down<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.530> then<00:02:34.519> when<00:02:34.639> I<00:02:34.670> got<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:35.120> UM<00:02:36.310> this<00:02:37.310> like

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:37.969 
down and then when I got to UM this like

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:41.619 
down and then when I got to UM this like
the<00:02:38.450> side<00:02:39.459> what<00:02:40.459> are<00:02:40.519> you<00:02:40.639> guys<00:02:40.879> doing<00:02:41.510> in

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629 
the side what are you guys doing in

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.399 
the side what are you guys doing in
there<00:02:42.370> okay<00:02:43.370> so<00:02:43.430> then<00:02:43.700> when<00:02:43.819> I<00:02:43.849> got<00:02:43.909> on<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:44.959> this

part I kept tied it everything even the

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.619 
part I kept tied it everything even the
bottom<00:02:48.049> and<00:02:48.439> the<00:02:48.709> top<00:02:48.739> because<00:02:49.730> I<00:02:50.090> wanted<00:02:50.359> to

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629

like open and close like a door and they

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:55.929 
like open and close like a door and they
can't<00:02:54.079> move<00:02:54.260> when<00:02:54.650> you<00:02:54.769> use<00:02:54.980> connector<00:02:55.430> okay

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:55.939 
can't move when you use connector okay

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.569 
can't move when you use connector okay
sorry<00:02:56.180> about<00:02:56.269> that<00:02:56.419> my<00:02:56.750> camera<00:02:57.199> died<00:02:57.859> so<00:02:58.340> i<00:02:58.370> had

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
sorry about that my camera died so i had

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.240 
sorry about that my camera died so i had
to<00:02:58.669> go<00:02:58.819> and<00:02:59.060> get<00:02:59.180> more<00:02:59.419> batteries<00:02:59.930> so<00:03:00.650> yeah<00:03:01.069> it

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
to go and get more batteries so yeah it

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.729 
to go and get more batteries so yeah it
won't<00:03:01.370> die<00:03:01.609> again<00:03:01.879> so<00:03:02.629> yeah<00:03:03.139> look<00:03:03.319> what<00:03:03.500> i<00:03:03.620> was

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
won't die again so yeah look what i was

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.309 
won't die again so yeah look what i was
saying<00:03:03.949> is<00:03:04.129> i<00:03:04.370> put<00:03:04.400> zip<00:03:04.790> zip<00:03:05.629> ties<00:03:05.810> all<00:03:06.079> the<00:03:06.230> way

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
saying is i put zip zip ties all the way

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:08.679 
saying is i put zip zip ties all the way
down<00:03:06.709> so<00:03:07.129> that<00:03:07.159> it<00:03:07.849> could<00:03:08.060> move<00:03:08.209> open<00:03:08.540> like<00:03:08.659> a

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:08.689 
down so that it could move open like a

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:10.300 
down so that it could move open like a
door<00:03:08.810> because<00:03:09.199> the<00:03:09.560> connectors<00:03:09.949> won't<00:03:10.189> move

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
door because the connectors won't move

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.339 
door because the connectors won't move
like<00:03:10.549> that<00:03:10.579> and<00:03:11.000> then<00:03:11.599> i<00:03:12.129> started<00:03:13.129> again<00:03:13.669> with

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
like that and then i started again with

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.110 
like that and then i started again with
the<00:03:15.349> whole<00:03:15.590> connector<00:03:16.280> thing<00:03:16.519> so<00:03:16.849> then<00:03:16.970> it's

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
the whole connector thing so then it's

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.530 
the whole connector thing so then it's
like<00:03:17.299> a<00:03:17.329> connector<00:03:18.340> and<00:03:19.340> i<00:03:19.430> have<00:03:19.579> one<00:03:19.819> facing

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
like a connector and i have one facing

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.330 
like a connector and i have one facing
inside<00:03:20.689> then<00:03:21.500> another<00:03:21.709> one<00:03:21.859> facing<00:03:22.220> inside

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
inside then another one facing inside

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.129 
inside then another one facing inside
and<00:03:22.759> then<00:03:22.849> one<00:03:23.000> facing<00:03:23.359> down<00:03:23.599> and<00:03:23.840> i<00:03:23.959> did<00:03:24.109> the

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
and then one facing down and i did the

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:26.379 
and then one facing down and i did the
same<00:03:24.379> thing<00:03:24.439> all<00:03:24.859> the<00:03:24.949> way<00:03:25.159> down<00:03:25.370> there<00:03:25.609> so<00:03:26.299> it

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
same thing all the way down there so it

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.830 
same thing all the way down there so it
makes<00:03:26.569> these<00:03:27.069> two<00:03:28.069> things<00:03:28.939> right<00:03:29.389> here<00:03:29.419> and

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
makes these two things right here and

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.969 
makes these two things right here and
then<00:03:30.590> i<00:03:30.829> could<00:03:31.310> have<00:03:31.840> taken<00:03:32.840> a<00:03:33.229> connector<00:03:33.739> and

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:33.979 
then i could have taken a connector and

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:37.839 
then i could have taken a connector and
put<00:03:34.430> it<00:03:34.549> in<00:03:34.699> like<00:03:35.199> if<00:03:36.199> the<00:03:36.829> round<00:03:37.489> part<00:03:37.669> would

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
put it in like if the round part would

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.300 
put it in like if the round part would
be<00:03:37.879> facing<00:03:38.150> here<00:03:38.659> like<00:03:39.409> to<00:03:39.500> put<00:03:39.650> one<00:03:40.069> grid

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
be facing here like to put one grid

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.219 
be facing here like to put one grid
right<00:03:40.759> there<00:03:41.060> and<00:03:41.299> one<00:03:41.389> good<00:03:41.540> right<00:03:41.720> there<00:03:41.959> and

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:42.229 
right there and one good right there and

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:45.219 
right there and one good right there and
have<00:03:42.620> it<00:03:42.739> like<00:03:42.919> facing<00:03:43.879> that<00:03:44.060> way<00:03:44.120> but<00:03:44.870> I<00:03:44.930> just

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:45.229 
have it like facing that way but I just

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:48.640 
have it like facing that way but I just
um<00:03:45.500> zip-tied<00:03:46.430> it<00:03:46.609> kind<00:03:47.180> of<00:03:47.329> right<00:03:47.810> like<00:03:48.259> right

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
um zip-tied it kind of right like right

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.649 
um zip-tied it kind of right like right
there<00:03:48.829> kind<00:03:49.280> of<00:03:49.310> like<00:03:49.489> flops<00:03:49.790> down<00:03:50.000> but<00:03:50.449> I

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:50.659 
there kind of like flops down but I

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:54.550 
there kind of like flops down but I
don't<00:03:51.169> really<00:03:51.290> care<00:03:51.560> and<00:03:51.799> then<00:03:53.109> so<00:03:54.109> yeah<00:03:54.290> and

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
don't really care and then so yeah and

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.920 
don't really care and then so yeah and

that's what i did on this side to like

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.520 
that's what i did on this side to like
just<00:03:57.139> connected<00:03:57.650> zip<00:03:58.189> tied<00:03:58.370> the<00:03:58.489> ends<00:03:58.669> and

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
just connected zip tied the ends and

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.409 
just connected zip tied the ends and
then<00:04:00.530> I<00:04:00.620> did<00:04:00.769> the<00:04:00.919> exact<00:04:01.639> same<00:04:01.669> thing<00:04:02.090> here

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:02.419

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:06.159 
then I did the exact same thing here
except<00:04:02.810> I<00:04:02.930> messed<00:04:03.169> up<00:04:03.379> a<00:04:03.680> little<00:04:04.780> these<00:04:05.780> are

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
facing out like towards everybody and

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.229 
facing out like towards everybody and
these<00:04:09.469> are<00:04:09.530> facing<00:04:09.949> in<00:04:10.069> because<00:04:10.370> I<00:04:10.400> had<00:04:10.939> to<00:04:11.060> fix

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
these are facing in because I had to fix

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.209 
these are facing in because I had to fix
them<00:04:11.539> I<00:04:11.750> made<00:04:12.409> the<00:04:12.530> cage<00:04:12.709> and<00:04:12.919> these<00:04:13.069> were

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:13.219 
them I made the cage and these were

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:15.429 
them I made the cage and these were
facing<00:04:13.400> out<00:04:13.699> like<00:04:14.239> this<00:04:14.629> as<00:04:14.900> well<00:04:15.019> but<00:04:15.259> then<00:04:15.409> I

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:15.439 
facing out like this as well but then I

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:17.409 
facing out like this as well but then I
fix<00:04:15.799> them<00:04:16.070> later<00:04:16.099> and<00:04:16.430> I<00:04:16.639> didn't<00:04:16.909> want<00:04:17.120> to<00:04:17.180> fix

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
those so but it's basically the same

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.219 
those so but it's basically the same
thing<00:04:19.699> is<00:04:20.060> turn<00:04:20.419> them<00:04:20.539> on<00:04:20.570> their<00:04:20.750> side<00:04:20.959> and<00:04:20.989> put

thing is turn them on their side and put
all<00:04:21.260> four<00:04:21.590> goods<00:04:21.829> up<00:04:22.070> until<00:04:22.729> you<00:04:22.820> get<00:04:22.909> to<00:04:23.000> the

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
all four goods up until you get to the

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.510 
all four goods up until you get to the
top<00:04:23.150> which<00:04:23.659> is<00:04:23.690> my

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
top which is my

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.100 
top which is my
a total<00:04:24.759> of<00:04:24.970> three<00:04:25.000> grids<00:04:25.449> but<00:04:25.780> for<00:04:26.020> most

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
a total of three grids but for most

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.129 
a total of three grids but for most
bunnies<00:04:26.379> you<00:04:26.620> can<00:04:26.740> just<00:04:26.889> have<00:04:27.009> two<00:04:27.220> grids<00:04:27.460> and

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 
bunnies you can just have two grids and

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.129 
bunnies you can just have two grids and
um<00:04:29.699> yeah<00:04:30.699> and<00:04:30.940> this<00:04:31.060> is<00:04:31.180> the<00:04:31.300> same<00:04:31.509> thing<00:04:31.750> where

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
um yeah and this is the same thing where

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.320 
um yeah and this is the same thing where
I<00:04:32.379> just<00:04:32.710> have<00:04:32.889> tied<00:04:33.069> it<00:04:33.099> everything<00:04:33.699> so<00:04:34.000> this

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
I just have tied it everything so this

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.089 
I just have tied it everything so this
could<00:04:34.479> open<00:04:34.599> as<00:04:34.810> the<00:04:34.840> door<00:04:35.020> as<00:04:35.139> well<00:04:35.319> so<00:04:36.009> it

00:04:36.089 --> 00:04:36.099 
could open as the door as well so it

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:37.499 
could open as the door as well so it
makes<00:04:36.220> me<00:04:36.400> like<00:04:36.520> really<00:04:36.580> easy<00:04:37.000> cleaning

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:37.509 
makes me like really easy cleaning

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.290 
makes me like really easy cleaning
because<00:04:38.139> this<00:04:38.319> whole<00:04:38.560> thing<00:04:38.919> opens<00:04:39.370> up<00:04:39.550> but<00:04:40.210> if

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
because this whole thing opens up but if

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.969 
because this whole thing opens up but if
you<00:04:40.360> make<00:04:40.479> a<00:04:40.539> cage<00:04:40.870> look<00:04:41.139> exactly<00:04:41.560> like<00:04:41.650> mine

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
you make a cage look exactly like mine

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.760 
you make a cage look exactly like mine
don't<00:04:42.610> open<00:04:42.819> the<00:04:43.210> grid<00:04:43.569> like<00:04:44.259> the<00:04:44.379> grits<00:04:44.560> all

now or you can instead of if you don't
want<00:05:03.430> that<00:05:03.550> like<00:05:03.729> taking<00:05:04.000> up<00:05:04.060> so<00:05:04.180> much<00:05:04.240> room

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
want that like taking up so much room

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.820 
want that like taking up so much room
like<00:05:04.690> you<00:05:04.780> don't<00:05:04.930> have<00:05:05.020> as<00:05:05.169> much<00:05:05.289> room<00:05:05.500> you<00:05:05.620> can

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
like you don't have as much room you can

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.870 
like you don't have as much room you can
push<00:05:06.039> it<00:05:06.190> out<00:05:06.340> like<00:05:06.610> that<00:05:07.169> either<00:05:08.169> way<00:05:08.289> works

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
push it out like that either way works

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.640 
push it out like that either way works
looks<00:05:09.880> kind<00:05:10.120> of<00:05:10.150> weird<00:05:10.210> and<00:05:10.479> then<00:05:11.289> the<00:05:11.440> same

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
looks kind of weird and then the same
