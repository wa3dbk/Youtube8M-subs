00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:11.860
 look folks are going to talk about a subject that is very important above 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.549
 everything I think is more than ever worthwhile that you are finding the 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.990
 You're already forty or you're a teenager, mostly 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.170
 swedish detention when it comes to drugs everybody talks about it 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.689
 come on this Thursday 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.669
 It's very easy for us to play but I think the most difficult of all people 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:34.289
 understand or every parent each mother can contribute is what our children 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:39.370
 stay away says and if it happens in the family how to solve it, of course 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.890
 always welcome if they treat you well but in a way that will help you and not 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.940
 it hurts to do just this but for all of us we want to leave 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.180
 of the front of the bt cristina relax that the dependency specialist psychologist 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.530
 chemistry is welcome in mass also uses luiz carlos honÃ³rio catherine 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.890
 two boys who have been using drugs are welcome and the certain thing is that this year 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.880
 the fair of the coast that is one and dependents I want to start already grateful 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.070
 especially the two of you because we know how difficult it is 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.590
 to us that power what is before passed what is passed 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.590
 because more than ever severe testimonial silver 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.750
 and for children 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.870
 once thought of entering this world that they are already and think it is impossible 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.320
 To leave impossible, I never hope 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.700
 It's difficult but impossible is not 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.610
 What do we realize that 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.370
 there is greater fragility when taking drugs and early on 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.020
 of leave or not 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.500
 I think in fact weaknesses and without any time in any period 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.500
 because they are still addiction chemical alcoholism 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.490
 she has a very big prejudice and in fact nobody dreams of being a 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.180
 great success as we usually say neither aunt eliana dictu slave der 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.289
 Did not happen but they delivery 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:57.030
 means exactly the slave of 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.960
 slaves some substance 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.380
 and so with no one 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.710
 The family is prepared to deal with that situation, my God, my son. 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.429
 Are you doing drugs? 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.649
 My son is consuming too much alcoy and now what to do 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:16.919
 the first trend yes this I will hide no one can leave and say more 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:19.620
 that trend is not landing the migration 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.139
 certainly deny the sticker that many companies that they receive from their parents 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:28.089
 this is true the first fight the first reaction really to 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:30.540
 connection because they tried to invent the wheel 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.200
 I will no longer run without confidence in him, the idealized person falls as a reserve for 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.389
 each child 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.879
 and suddenly with the passing of the autarchy she has children for a 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.109
 adolescents like these to embark on the path of drugs and alcoholism is 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:49.239
 It is difficult for parents to recognize this and admit that it is a 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.249
 and it is extremely difficult, it is as if it were really a protection 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:55.869
 the world is abandoning the father, right? 

00:02:55.869 --> 00:03:00.169
 in relation to that can not be seeing this reality because it is 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:00.990
 very hard 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:04.490
 is very small but the gateway to large areas of drugs in the 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.840
 precisely the drug that is illicit that is the alcohol is exactly to which 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.040
 alcohol or tobacco walk well in the two races are drones airplanes what 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.040
 are legalized etc in our culture 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.180
 This can only be a poodle thing and it's fine. 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.800
 it's like you're a sign 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.100
 many parents ilna in the adolescence of the son founding you are now a man 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.479
 so are you going to drink with me? 

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:34.129
 henrique is leveled the issue of the deadline to get in to do 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.079
 it is really sometimes and an amateur people 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.709
 so it ends up using those indentations that are given metalized 

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:44.969
 including one of the jurors recalibrated legalized that we would have to comment 

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:48.979
 also are the medications that the idea is that is made in common kleber 

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:53.099
 introduction of non-tranquilizing areas and 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.229
 soothing to unite us 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:59.259
 that people use with a certain tendency is not to relax the athlete 

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:00.999
 Can sleep 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:05.629
 having a quieter sleep instead of using other methods is no longer 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:08.819
 easy to win at a pharmacy buying a medicine 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.609
 often without the medical prescription sandra need and so the child 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:17.409
 goes growing to see with that as being something often natural ' 

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:22.279
 Mandela is not perceived as a dependent chemist because the 

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:25.719
 dependence on medication is also a chemical dependency and often 

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:27.069
 metallized 

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:30.770
 now I do not know if you see your chips do not agree with me but I think 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:31.620
 which today 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:36.550
 there is a great appeal to pretend the same general way we live is people 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.070
 famous people often speaking in the media who made use of such exchange for 40 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.170
 years thirty years present and are people that today we see in the media 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.820
 successful the young man ends up with her just walking for drugging a thing is to be 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.409
 is not another 

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:56.719
 influencing in a negative way at least from my view 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:59.270
 do not agree with this. 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.189
 in place according to item 

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:06.020
 in the formation of adolescent opinion mainly of the adolescent 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.930
 everything starts at this stage of adolescence 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.800
 where there is a lake where there is a process of formation of 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.569
 personality 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:18.499
 is the mirror was nothing more than what you see in everyday life 

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:20.460
 it's the television 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.509
 p are successful people are the friends who are part of your color 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:28.050
 a matter of being here 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.479
 are the people 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:32.759
 the young man himself than the one who is also to be a person in question 

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:35.710
 started using the target 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.210
 men use their own cigarette 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.400
 an instrument 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.909
 to riverside 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:47.559
 a fragility inhibits his shyness and from there begins equilibrium 

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:50.629
 the barriers and breaking the shyness begins to drop more 

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:54.249
 and with it another gradual process 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:58.779
 the main 

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:01.779
 and what 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:06.539
 A little more service we do not 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:10.879
 Why do not you travel because the signs are all 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.900
 It's just that we did not want to arrive.
