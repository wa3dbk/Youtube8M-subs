00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.160 
260,000 you know and then you also have
a<00:03:52.890> rate<00:03:53.400> of<00:03:53.430> growth<00:03:53.820> our<00:03:54.360> economies<00:03:54.870> I<00:03:54.930> think

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
a rate of growth our economies I think

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.410 
a rate of growth our economies I think
it's<00:03:55.290> about<00:03:55.380> six<00:03:55.739> point<00:03:56.010> nine<00:03:56.120> percent<00:03:57.120> growth

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
it's about six point nine percent growth

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.810 
it's about six point nine percent growth
every<00:03:57.810> year<00:03:57.840> our<00:03:58.250> population<00:03:59.250> is<00:03:59.340> growing<00:03:59.550> at

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
every year our population is growing at

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.870 
every year our population is growing at
three-point-three<00:04:00.540> percent<00:04:00.570> and<00:04:01.700> so<00:04:02.700> if<00:04:02.820> you

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
three-point-three percent and so if you

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.490 
three-point-three percent and so if you
look<00:04:03.060> at<00:04:03.209> these<00:04:03.390> statistics<00:04:03.989> it<00:04:04.110> means<00:04:04.320> that

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
look at these statistics it means that

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.380 
look at these statistics it means that
our<00:04:04.650> economy<00:04:04.890> has<00:04:05.220> grown<00:04:05.250> like<00:04:05.700> three<00:04:06.030> times

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
our economy has grown like three times

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.650 
our economy has grown like three times
faster<00:04:07.019> so<00:04:07.769> like<00:04:08.340> nine<00:04:08.580> point<00:04:08.970> nine<00:04:09.060> percent

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
faster so like nine point nine percent

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.009 
faster so like nine point nine percent
to<00:04:10.290> be<00:04:10.440> able<00:04:10.560> to<00:04:10.800> absorb<00:04:11.720> this<00:04:12.720> sort<00:04:12.989> of

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
to be able to absorb this sort of

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.410 
to be able to absorb this sort of
population<00:04:13.799> growth<00:04:13.830> in<00:04:14.340> terms<00:04:15.000> of<00:04:15.090> creating

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
population growth in terms of creating

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.140 
population growth in terms of creating
economic<00:04:15.810> opportunity<00:04:16.820> there<00:04:17.820> those<00:04:17.970> who

economic opportunity there those who

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.390 
economic opportunity there those who
have<00:04:18.239> argued<00:04:18.479> that<00:04:18.840> governments<00:04:19.440> focus<00:04:20.130> on

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
have argued that governments focus on

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.120 
have argued that governments focus on
form<00:04:21.150> education<00:04:21.750> uh<00:04:21.930> not<00:04:22.380> so<00:04:22.680> much<00:04:22.710> on

that<00:04:32.530> yes<00:04:33.530> I<00:04:33.740> mean<00:04:34.130> I<00:04:34.160> think<00:04:34.460> it's<00:04:35.000> a<00:04:35.090> common

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:35.449 
that yes I mean I think it's a common

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:37.480 
that yes I mean I think it's a common
debate<00:04:36.440> that's<00:04:36.680> been<00:04:36.800> going<00:04:37.039> on<00:04:37.280> that

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
debate that's been going on that

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.909 
debate that's been going on that
government<00:04:37.849> policy<00:04:38.180> needs<00:04:38.270> to<00:04:38.449> be<00:04:38.569> changed

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
government policy needs to be changed

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.219 
government policy needs to be changed
and<00:04:39.919> I<00:04:40.310> think<00:04:40.580> government<00:04:41.360> also<00:04:41.479> recognizes

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
and I think government also recognizes

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:44.260 
and I think government also recognizes
that<00:04:42.259> but<00:04:42.919> you<00:04:43.009> also<00:04:43.130> remember<00:04:43.490> these<00:04:43.940> systems

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
that but you also remember these systems

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.570 
that but you also remember these systems
are<00:04:44.389> so<00:04:44.599> bureaucratic<00:04:45.130> changing<00:04:46.130> a<00:04:46.220> policy

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
are so bureaucratic changing a policy

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.390 
are so bureaucratic changing a policy
it's<00:04:46.729> something<00:04:47.030> that<00:04:47.150> takes<00:04:47.330> years<00:04:47.780> and<00:04:48.400> and

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
it's something that takes years and and

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.279 
it's something that takes years and and
so<00:04:49.880> many<00:04:50.030> processes<00:04:50.479> these<00:04:50.870> politics

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:51.289 
so many processes these politics

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:53.589 
so many processes these politics
involved<00:04:51.650> and<00:04:52.009> all<00:04:52.610> that<00:04:52.849> what<00:04:53.120> we<00:04:53.210> can<00:04:53.419> do

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:53.599 
involved and all that what we can do

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:54.850 
involved and all that what we can do
though<00:04:53.780> we<00:04:54.229> don't<00:04:54.349> have<00:04:54.560> to<00:04:54.680> wait<00:04:54.830> for

though we don't have to wait for

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.740 
though we don't have to wait for
government<00:04:55.340> to<00:04:55.370> do<00:04:55.520> that<00:04:55.699> you<00:04:55.970> know<00:04:56.150> we<00:04:56.630> don't

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
government to do that you know we don't
