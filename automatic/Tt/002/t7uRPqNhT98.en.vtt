00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
you grab your bowl back and a little

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.890 
you grab your bowl back and a little
smidge<00:02:25.390> of<00:02:25.480> olive<00:02:25.930> oil<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:28.390> reason<00:02:28.690> we<00:02:28.780> do

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
smidge of olive oil the reason we do

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.960 
smidge of olive oil the reason we do
this<00:02:28.930> is<00:02:29.110> so<00:02:29.350> that<00:02:29.500> it<00:02:29.830> while<00:02:30.220> it's<00:02:30.400> rising<00:02:30.670> it

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
this is so that it while it's rising it

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.990 
this is so that it while it's rising it
doesn't<00:02:31.239> form<00:02:31.450> a<00:02:31.540> dry<00:02:31.870> skin<00:02:32.380> on<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.620> top<00:02:33.000> so

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
doesn't form a dry skin on the top so

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.190 
doesn't form a dry skin on the top so
I'm<00:02:34.060> going<00:02:34.209> to<00:02:34.239> make<00:02:34.360> sure<00:02:34.390> that<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:34.900> get<00:02:35.050> it
