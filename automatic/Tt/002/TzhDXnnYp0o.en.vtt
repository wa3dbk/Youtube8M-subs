lures in the shallower water when you're
over<00:02:58.690> rocky<00:02:58.989> reef<00:02:59.290> and<00:02:59.560> you<00:02:59.620> can<00:02:59.739> bang<00:02:59.980> him

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
over rocky reef and you can bang him

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.310 
over rocky reef and you can bang him
into<00:03:00.310> the<00:03:00.400> bottom<00:03:00.700> get<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.299> attention<00:03:01.600> better

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
into the bottom get the attention better

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.740 
into the bottom get the attention better
quality<00:03:02.769> fish<00:03:03.010> and<00:03:03.790> now<00:03:04.120> a<00:03:04.150> lot<00:03:04.420> of<00:03:04.510> people

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
wouldn't get even get a bite they could

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.729 
wouldn't get even get a bite they could
spend<00:03:10.000> hours<00:03:10.330> here<00:03:10.480> for<00:03:10.660> nothing<00:03:11.020> you<00:03:11.470> change

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
over to a deeper diving bib and head

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.630 
over to a deeper diving bib and head
bottom<00:03:13.750> of<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:13.930> rocks<00:03:14.439> and<00:03:15.099> that's<00:03:15.189> a<00:03:15.370> sort<00:03:15.580> of

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
bottom of the rocks and that's a sort of

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.059 
bottom of the rocks and that's a sort of
fish<00:03:15.760> you're<00:03:15.909> going<00:03:16.030> to<00:03:16.090> pull<00:03:16.239> out<00:03:16.829> now<00:03:17.829> he's<00:03:17.980> a

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
fish you're going to pull out now he's a

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.600 
fish you're going to pull out now he's a
good<00:03:18.220> one

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
good one

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.949 
good one
but<00:03:18.819> I<00:03:18.879> reckon<00:03:19.180> there's<00:03:19.329> even<00:03:19.510> bigger<00:03:19.689> ones<00:03:19.870> in

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
but I reckon there's even bigger ones in

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.170 
but I reckon there's even bigger ones in
there<00:03:20.140> so<00:03:20.260> we<00:03:20.349> might<00:03:20.530> see<00:03:20.680> what<00:03:20.829> we<00:03:20.920> can<00:03:21.069> find

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.429 

best<00:03:25.180> part<00:03:25.480> about<00:03:25.599> catching<00:03:26.140> some<00:03:26.290> of<00:03:26.379> these

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:26.439 
best part about catching some of these

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.110 
best part about catching some of these
big<00:03:26.650> fellers<00:03:27.010> is<00:03:27.310> getting<00:03:27.640> the<00:03:27.700> opportunity

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
big fellers is getting the opportunity

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.780 
big fellers is getting the opportunity
let<00:03:28.269> them<00:03:28.360> go<00:03:28.480> and<00:03:28.629> catch<00:03:28.780> them<00:03:28.930> again<00:03:29.790> there

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
let them go and catch them again there

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.910 
let them go and catch them again there
we<00:03:31.030> go<00:03:31.180> right<00:03:31.629> down<00:03:31.780> to<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.019> bottom<00:03:32.140> come<00:03:32.769> back

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
we go right down to the bottom come back

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.299 
we go right down to the bottom come back
in<00:03:33.040> a<00:03:33.099> few<00:03:33.280> more<00:03:33.370> weeks<00:03:33.579> we'll<00:03:33.819> get<00:03:33.940> him<00:03:34.060> again
