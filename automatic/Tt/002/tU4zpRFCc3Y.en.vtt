00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.830
 let it all today we get 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.870
 found on a new episode type 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.870
 where I will teach you how to do it 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.290
 mini block but what are the mini 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.120
 block 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.100
 well it's about head with skins 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.720
 particular the heads of the players the 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.920
 heads of mobs as well as different 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.600
 items that were put to our 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.300
 arranged by Ms. Jiang during the 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.130
 last update that of the 1.7 and 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.939
 you see here everything you can 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.460
 get 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.660
 so how to make these mini block and 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.399
 well it's very simple it's a 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.630
 command line command line 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.460
 who is the next 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.860
 so we're going to do one age books for 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.120
 give us an item the and horan hayes of 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.480
 this is my nickname but you must 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.059
 heard replace it with your nickname 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.579
 397 this is the i10 of the item head huh 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.770
 that's the amount game with a single 3 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.100
 it's the damage and if you want to know 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.260
 why do we do 3 because here 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.320
 we will have all the heads 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.840
 celsis damages in 2002 matches 3 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.059
 can see it to the far right of the label 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.470
 and a match 4 so when we that 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.170
 that interests us is that the latter 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.630
 which can be customized then 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.610
 will have as property between hug 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.310
 this keylogger literally means 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.229
 the owner of the points skull on 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.850
 always put quotes it's for 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.619
 well delimit the nickname if you 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.810
 do not put it will not work and we 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.009
 puts the name of the person or item 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.140
 that we want here in this case 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.020
 I took my head I can put it here 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.869
 but I can completely replace the 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.579
 head you just saw through a skull 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.610
 who will be for example 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:42.270
 so if I replace and orane apart 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:44.100
 mhf and we will take the cake very 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.049
 attention with the capital letters and the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.880
 tiny because it's case- sensitive 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.070
 to say that you can not write 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.130
 some with only capital letters 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.280
 that's what it will give you next 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.590
 you have the list of all the items that 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.969
 you can find on the link that I 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.159
 will put you in the description and 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:05.070
 which is currently appearing on the screen so 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.439
 it's of course on the minecraft wiki 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.759
 now there is one nevertheless who 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.740
 do not appear I do so do you 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.810
 give right away and who is 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.670
 camera head that can be used 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.700
 for example if you make time 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.000
 lapse and want to have the 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.180
 head 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.720
 associated with that so here is the head of 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.720
 camera 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.660
 so to summarize you can use 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.690
 all the items that were created by the 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.100
