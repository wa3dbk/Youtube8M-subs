let's<00:01:27.509> get<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:28.189> I'm<00:01:29.189> going<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.369> show<00:01:29.430> you

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
let's get to it I'm going to show you

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.130 
let's get to it I'm going to show you
the<00:01:29.820> footwork<00:01:30.119> for<00:01:30.329> transitioning<00:01:31.049> from

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
the footwork for transitioning from

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.660 
the footwork for transitioning from
forwards<00:01:31.500> or<00:01:31.590> backwards<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:32.130> backwards<00:01:32.549> and

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
forwards or backwards and backwards and

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.490 
forwards or backwards and backwards and
forwards<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.119> do<00:01:33.180> have<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.420> nice<00:01:33.810> video<00:01:34.049> for

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
forwards and I do have a nice video for

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.990 
forwards and I do have a nice video for
transitioning<00:01:35.040> from<00:01:35.189> forwards<00:01:35.579> backwards<00:01:35.729> as

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
transitioning from forwards backwards as

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.090 
transitioning from forwards backwards as
well<00:01:36.170> so<00:01:37.170> remember<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.710> always<00:01:37.829> want<00:01:37.920> to

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
well so remember you always want to

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.859 
well so remember you always want to
rotate<00:01:38.220> towards<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.790> play<00:01:39.030> I'm<00:01:39.509> going<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.750> say

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
rotate towards the play I'm going to say

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.780 
rotate towards the play I'm going to say
that<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.079> play<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:40.950> left<00:01:41.220> there<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:41.729> I

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
that the play is to left there so I

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.370 
that the play is to left there so I
never<00:01:42.240> want<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.479> turn<00:01:42.630> my<00:01:42.750> back<00:01:42.869> on<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.200> play

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
never want to turn my back on the play

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.230 
never want to turn my back on the play
so<00:01:44.100> I'm<00:01:44.759> going<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.030> rotate<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:46.470> way<00:01:46.710> in<00:01:47.240> the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
so I'm going to rotate this way in the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.960 
so I'm going to rotate this way in the
transition<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.380> do<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.920> start<00:01:50.759> by

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
transition and to do that I start by

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.480 
transition and to do that I start by
putting<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.299> weight<00:01:51.509> onto<00:01:51.750> my<00:01:51.869> right<00:01:52.049> foot<00:01:52.490> by

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
putting the weight onto my right foot by

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.950 
putting the weight onto my right foot by
putting<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.850> weight<00:01:54.000> onto<00:01:54.180> my<00:01:54.329> right<00:01:54.479> foot<00:01:54.750> it

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
putting the weight onto my right foot it

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.719 
putting the weight onto my right foot it
allows<00:01:55.200> me<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.470> take<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:56.100> weight<00:01:56.250> off<00:01:56.280> my<00:01:56.579> left

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
allows me to take the weight off my left

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.060 
allows me to take the weight off my left
foot<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.060> open<00:01:57.630> that<00:01:57.750> foot<00:01:57.960> up<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.770> watch<00:01:58.920> what

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
foot and open that foot up so watch what

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.830 
foot and open that foot up so watch what
happens<00:01:59.399> their<00:01:59.549> weight<00:02:00.360> goes<00:02:00.540> on<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.750> right

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
happens their weight goes on the right

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.840 
happens their weight goes on the right
foot<00:02:01.110> opens<00:02:01.530> up<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.740> left<00:02:01.920> foot<00:02:02.100> I<00:02:02.310> rotate

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
foot opens up the left foot I rotate

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.060 
foot opens up the left foot I rotate
around<00:02:02.969> do<00:02:03.750> like<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.020> Mohawk<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.799> then

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
around do like the Mohawk and then

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.709 
around do like the Mohawk and then
rotate<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.549> right<00:02:05.610> leg<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.030> us<00:02:06.149> rest<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.630> way

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
rotate that right leg to us rest the way

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.630 
rotate that right leg to us rest the way
around<00:02:06.960> I'm<00:02:07.140> going<00:02:07.439> backwards<00:02:07.590> I'll<00:02:08.429> show<00:02:08.580> you

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
around I'm going backwards I'll show you

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
around I'm going backwards I'll show you
again<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.500> bit<00:02:10.500> faster<00:02:10.860> now<00:02:11.150> right<00:02:12.150> foot<00:02:12.420> open

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
again a bit faster now right foot open

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.070 
again a bit faster now right foot open
up

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
up

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.350 
up
left<00:02:13.230> lift<00:02:13.680> up<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.950> right<00:02:14.100> plant<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:14.790> and<00:02:14.940> that

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
left lift up the right plant it and that

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.640 
left lift up the right plant it and that
allows<00:02:15.570> you<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:15.930> maintain<00:02:16.170> your<00:02:16.500> speed

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
allows you to maintain your speed

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.490 
allows you to maintain your speed
without<00:02:17.580> doing<00:02:18.210> that<00:02:18.390> pivot<00:02:18.960> and<00:02:19.110> dragging

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
without doing that pivot and dragging

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.140 
without doing that pivot and dragging
your<00:02:19.560> foot<00:02:19.800> so<00:02:20.280> it's<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.490> bit<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.850> fancy

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
your foot so it's a bit of fancy

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.740 
your foot so it's a bit of fancy
footwork<00:02:21.300> think<00:02:22.020> of<00:02:22.110> it<00:02:22.170> as<00:02:22.350> one<00:02:23.190> two<00:02:23.970> three

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
footwork think of it as one two three

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.900 
footwork think of it as one two three
and<00:02:25.230> you're<00:02:25.380> going<00:02:25.410> backwards<00:02:25.710> and<00:02:26.130> you<00:02:26.730> want

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
and you're going backwards and you want

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.520 
and you're going backwards and you want
to<00:02:27.000> be<00:02:27.060> able<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.270> do<00:02:27.360> that<00:02:27.480> both<00:02:27.930> ways<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:28.410> if<00:02:28.470> I

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
to be able to do that both ways so if I

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.860 
to be able to do that both ways so if I
want<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:28.890> rotate<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.310> right<00:02:29.690> weight<00:02:30.690> goes

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
want to rotate to the right weight goes

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.930 
want to rotate to the right weight goes
on<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.050> left<00:02:31.230> foot<00:02:31.410> right<00:02:32.220> foot<00:02:32.250> opens<00:02:32.790> up

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
on the left foot right foot opens up

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.120 
on the left foot right foot opens up
plant<00:02:33.390> left<00:02:34.140> foot<00:02:34.350> plants<00:02:34.740> now<00:02:34.920> you're<00:02:35.040> on

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
plant left foot plants now you're on

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.710 
plant left foot plants now you're on
backwards<00:02:35.550> now<00:02:36.360> I'll<00:02:36.450> show<00:02:36.570> you<00:02:36.630> the

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
backwards now I'll show you the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.940 
backwards now I'll show you the
transition<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.230> going<00:02:37.440> forward

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
transition to going forward

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.250 
transition to going forward
so<00:02:38.160> we'll<00:02:38.520> say<00:02:38.670> I'm<00:02:38.760> skating<00:02:38.940> backwards

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
so we'll say I'm skating backwards

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.330 
so we'll say I'm skating backwards
weight<00:02:40.260> goes<00:02:40.440> on<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.650> left<00:02:40.770> foot<00:02:40.950> if<00:02:41.100> I<00:02:41.190> want

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
weight goes on the left foot if I want

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.280 
weight goes on the left foot if I want
to<00:02:41.430> rotate<00:02:41.550> this<00:02:41.790> way<00:02:41.970> right<00:02:42.690> foot<00:02:42.900> comes<00:02:43.140> up

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
to rotate this way right foot comes up

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.290 
to rotate this way right foot comes up
opens<00:02:44.160> up<00:02:44.310> like<00:02:44.430> this<00:02:44.640> you're<00:02:44.880> going<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.060> plant

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
opens up like this you're going to plant

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.300 
opens up like this you're going to plant
it<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.630> then<00:02:46.380> bring<00:02:46.560> that<00:02:46.590> left<00:02:46.860> foot<00:02:47.010> around

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
it and then bring that left foot around

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.700 
it and then bring that left foot around
and<00:02:47.550> your<00:02:47.850> skating<00:02:48.300> forwards<00:02:48.690> say<00:02:49.440> anything

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710 
and your skating forwards say anything

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.410 
and your skating forwards say anything
going<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.010> other<00:02:50.040> way<00:02:50.190> alright<00:02:51.090> so<00:02:51.240> I<00:02:51.300> can

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
going the other way alright so I can

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.000 
going the other way alright so I can
rotate<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.720> other<00:02:51.780> way<00:02:51.900> now<00:02:52.020> weights<00:02:52.709> on<00:02:52.890> that

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
rotate the other way now weights on that

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.100 
rotate the other way now weights on that
right<00:02:53.190> foot<00:02:53.400> lift<00:02:53.760> up<00:02:53.970> that<00:02:54.090> left<00:02:54.330> foot<00:02:54.510> plant

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
right foot lift up that left foot plant

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.020 
right foot lift up that left foot plant
it<00:02:55.260> this<00:02:55.380> way<00:02:55.620> right<00:02:56.310> foot<00:02:56.550> comes<00:02:56.760> around

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
it this way right foot comes around

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.000 
it this way right foot comes around
you're<00:02:57.690> going<00:02:57.810> forwards<00:02:58.260> really<00:02:58.650> important

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
you're going forwards really important

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.920 
you're going forwards really important
thing<00:02:59.130> to<00:02:59.190> remember<00:02:59.250> is<00:02:59.640> keep<00:03:00.540> a<00:03:00.660> good<00:03:00.780> knee

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
thing to remember is keep a good knee

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.090 
thing to remember is keep a good knee
bend<00:03:00.959> so<00:03:01.410> I'll<00:03:01.500> show<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:01.709> what<00:03:01.800> looks<00:03:01.890> like<00:03:02.010> a

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
bend so I'll show you what looks like a

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.790 
bend so I'll show you what looks like a
motion<00:03:02.340> by<00:03:03.120> keeping<00:03:03.390> good<00:03:03.570> knee<00:03:03.750> bend<00:03:03.780> when<00:03:04.770> I

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
motion by keeping good knee bend when I

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.949 
motion by keeping good knee bend when I
rotate<00:03:05.280> I<00:03:05.310> can<00:03:05.580> push<00:03:05.820> here<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.240> can<00:03:06.420> push<00:03:06.660> there

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
rotate I can push here I can push there

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.750 
rotate I can push here I can push there
so<00:03:07.590> then<00:03:07.709> you<00:03:07.800> keep<00:03:07.980> that<00:03:08.010> speed<00:03:08.459> through<00:03:08.700> the

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
so then you keep that speed through the

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.420 
so then you keep that speed through the
transition<00:03:09.450> so<00:03:10.020> I'll<00:03:10.080> do<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.230> again<00:03:10.350> go<00:03:11.280> on<00:03:11.340> the

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
transition so I'll do it again go on the

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.920 
transition so I'll do it again go on the
other<00:03:11.520> way<00:03:11.670> good<00:03:12.390> knee<00:03:12.570> bend

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
other way good knee bend

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.760 
other way good knee bend
push<00:03:13.860> push<00:03:14.490> right<00:03:15.180> you're<00:03:15.660> always<00:03:15.840> pushing<00:03:16.230> so

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
push push right you're always pushing so

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.020 
push push right you're always pushing so
you<00:03:16.860> don't<00:03:17.010> lift<00:03:17.190> your<00:03:17.370> leg<00:03:17.519> unless<00:03:17.820> you<00:03:17.940> get

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
you don't lift your leg unless you get

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.640 
you don't lift your leg unless you get
that<00:03:18.209> push<00:03:18.450> first<00:03:18.750> that's<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.380> good<00:03:19.500> way<00:03:19.620> to

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
that push first that's a good way to

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.410 
that push first that's a good way to
maintain<00:03:20.160> speed<00:03:20.459> through<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.760> transition<00:03:21.269> so

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
maintain speed through the transition so

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.640 
maintain speed through the transition so
you<00:03:21.450> don't<00:03:21.660> slow<00:03:21.900> down<00:03:21.930> when<00:03:22.230> you're<00:03:22.320> doing<00:03:22.560> it

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
you don't slow down when you're doing it

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.500 
you don't slow down when you're doing it
another<00:03:23.640> really<00:03:23.880> important<00:03:24.209> thing<00:03:24.239> here<00:03:24.480> is

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
another really important thing here is

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.250 
another really important thing here is
flexibility<00:03:25.080> so<00:03:25.769> if<00:03:25.890> you<00:03:25.980> can't<00:03:26.250> do<00:03:26.489> this<00:03:27.390> it's

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
flexibility so if you can't do this it's

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
flexibility so if you can't do this it's
going<00:03:28.380> to<00:03:28.470> be<00:03:28.530> hard<00:03:28.709> for<00:03:28.830> you<00:03:29.040> to<00:03:29.160> do<00:03:29.250> that

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
going to be hard for you to do that

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.280 
going to be hard for you to do that
transition<00:03:30.000> so<00:03:30.630> you<00:03:30.660> have<00:03:30.870> to<00:03:31.019> be<00:03:31.110> able<00:03:31.170> to

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
transition so you have to be able to

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.449 
transition so you have to be able to
practice<00:03:31.470> size<00:03:31.769> you<00:03:31.950> can<00:03:32.070> practice<00:03:32.370> at<00:03:32.430> home

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
practice size you can practice at home

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:33.590 
practice size you can practice at home
just<00:03:32.880> getting<00:03:33.120> your<00:03:33.209> heels<00:03:33.420> together

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
basically just think of it as heels
