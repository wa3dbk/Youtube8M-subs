00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Hello, welcome to MAXreportage for the new MAZDA 3 2.2 turbo diesel 150 PS test drive

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
a competitor to the VW Golf and Peugeot 308

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We've got an Elegance model with 16 inch aluminium wheels

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the seats are confortable but the passager can't adjust height

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
rear space is enough but we could hope more space with a so big compact car

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
the trunk offer 364 liters. This is just OK

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000
the dashboard design look like the Mazda CX5. It's inspired by the world of BMW

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and we can find the same iDrive system. Very easy to use.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
the screen looks like an iPad like in the Mercedes Classe A

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and you've got a Bluetooth connexion

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:29.000
instrumentation is close but if you chose the Dynamic model, it is much more readable

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
storages are tight you can just put a small bottle

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
No air conditionner in the gloves box. Shame !

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
there is too rigid plastics particulary at the knees

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
the finishing is not so good than a Golf or a 308.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
The engine is no shortage of power and can go at 6000 rpm

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
if staying in third you've got a lot of torque at the exit of turn

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
a very good engine with a very good gearbox

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
the frame with multilink rear arm is very well

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
but the Toyo tires are made for fuel save and they screech quickly

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
it will better with sports tires on Dynamic model with 18 wheels

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000
with 18 wheels it's more beautiful and sportive but more stiff

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
for more details you can read the french magazine AUTO MOTO

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
