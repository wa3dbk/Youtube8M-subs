00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.109
 hi friends welcome to facebook 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.330
 cooking so I have a great pleasure but 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.019
 really great pleasure to find for 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.910
 a recipe 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.250
 as you could see I I you 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.770
 presents the tree that of the darlings 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.510
 so this little treat you can 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.250
 find in carnivals or 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.619
 still at the beach it's downright 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.019
 delicious it's super simple it will take 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.449
 just little trick you'll see and 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.800
 now it's my daughter for the 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.990
 recipe that will require you two volumes of 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.360
 peanuts for a volume of sugar and a 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.190
 volume of water the first step is 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.140
 really super simple you will put 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.290
 peanuts in a pan 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:45.360
 we simply add sugar not 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:48.270
 received as well as the water so there the 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.629
 evaporates little by little eh ben you have 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.180
 nothing to do just to wait once 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.090
 that it constantly degrees the temperature 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.800
 we stop cooking is well 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.050
 mix well energetically during 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.520
 about 5 minutes 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.760
 so there when mixing we see that we 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.010
 gets a sand texture and once 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.409
 that this is done we will let rest 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.409
 preparation when twenty or so 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.930
 minutes after time expectations 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.180
 we will redo I make this preparation 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.790
 and you will see that little by little 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.189
 is going well caramelized here once 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.930
 it is well caramelized or have removed the 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.710
 preparing the fire we will leave 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.920
 cool 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.049
 so let's go for the tasting 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.960
 so at the level of taste I want to 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.700
 tell you a pure slaughter 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.990
 here are a lot of people waiting 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.090
 Thursday night said two sentences 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.490
 and that's the case because it's just 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.930
 too good then just a parenthesis for 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.250
 tell you that lately you 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.930
 may have seen 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.670
 that I could not get out so much of 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.020
 videos that I would have liked it all 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.300
 simply because I worked a lot 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.280
 market is so I went to paris to 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.770
 marseille before that I was at the number 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.450
 so when I travel it's really cool 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.550
 it's great but it's very very 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.200
 tiring we do a lot of things and 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.090
 then I still have a big surprise 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.760
 have unveiled so the big surprise 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.300
