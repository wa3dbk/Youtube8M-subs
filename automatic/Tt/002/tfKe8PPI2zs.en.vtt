Hi, this is John and I'm going to show you
an easy approach to Binary Conversion. Now

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.980
before we roll into the conversion process I'm going to teach you some of the basics.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:22.330
What is Binary? Well, binary is a number system
represented by two numbers, 0s and 1s and

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:28.070
used by all computers. You'll see it in the
forms of binary strings, such as this one

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:36.660
right here. Now to do the conversion process,
you have to understand the math behind it.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.500
If you have a good understanding of the powers
of 2, you can pretty much do any binary conversion.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:50.670
2 to the 0 equals 1, 2 to the 2 equals 4,
and so on. And if you can memorize at least

00:00:50.670 --> 00:01:00.570
these, and make them second nature to you,
you will be able to any conversion very quickly.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:09.109
Okay, let's look at the decimal to binary
conversion. This conversion, I think, is one

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:14.950
of more easier ones. The first you're going
to want to do is draw out a conversion table.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:31.159
You start from the right and work left. 1,
2, 4, 16, 32, 64, 128 and notice how there are

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:39.640
8 numbers here. That's 8 bits. When you're
speaking in computer terms, such as in subnetting.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:51.749
In an IP address we have 4 8-bit or 4 octets.
In our first example we will look at how to

00:01:51.749 --> 00:02:08.280
convert 132. Now, follow along with me. 128
goes into 132, yes, so we will put a 1. 128,

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:21.500
what other number here when combined with
128 equals 132? Well, that number is 4. And

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:40.320
you fill the rest in with zeroes. And that
is a decimal to binary conversion. Let's look

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:48.920
at one more example, 14. Very easy one. Does
128, 64, 32, 16, none of these numbers go

00:02:48.920 --> 00:03:05.730
in it. Does 8? Yes. 8 plus 4 = 12, 8+4+2=14.
Does 1? No. That would be 15. So far so good

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:16.560
right? Now let's look at some Binary to Decimal
Conversions. Same table, and if need to go

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:27.280
further, go further, 256, 512 and so on. This
is our first example. You just write it in

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:40.150
there. Draw out your table and write it in.
0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1. This is so easy, you

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:50.340
just add them up. 64 plus 16 = 80, plus 8,
88, plus 2, 90. That binary number equals

00:03:50.340 --> 00:04:09.320
90 in decimal. Next number. Just write it
in. 1, 1, 0, 1, 1. You add them up and what

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:19.650
do you get? 27. It's as simple as that. Well,
thanks for watching and don't forget if this

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.409
was even a little bit helpful to you to rate
