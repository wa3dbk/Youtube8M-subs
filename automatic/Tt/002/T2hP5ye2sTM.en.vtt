00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.830
 different and I want you to know these 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.560
 two drinks that are really 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.300
 very good in both countries for the 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.810
 Irish chocolate we just need 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.880
 chocolate in your country and for 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.710
 the Spanish chocolate if we need that 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.660
 be from Spain because you will see what 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.579
 peculiar that is to prepare it the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.710
 ingredients that we will need will be 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.070
 Spanish chocolate chocolate 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:49.490
 have at home a glass for each 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:52.520
 one and marshmallows now if doing it 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:55.310
 in one case we will put a glass of milk and 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.340
 two spoons of Spanish chocolate 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:02.380
 we will move all the time and what 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.910
 we will keep on medium heat 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.710
 finally this is the consistency that 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.550
 we have to stay after 10 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.350
 minutes 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.300
 this is the chocolate of Spanish if you 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.579
 they realize the consistency is very very 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:16.259
 very thick 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:18.329
 again we repeat the process but 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.340
 this time it will be with the chocolate that 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:23.030
 let's have two tablespoons at home and 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.220
 we will move very well until it is given 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:29.369
 finally in a glass we will put a little 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.189
 of hot water and let's dissolve there 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.640
 our chocolate that we have previously 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.640
 heated 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.200
 once we have this process the 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.840
 Irish chocolate and the peculiarity of it 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.869
 is that we put marshmallows can be 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.530
 four or five the ones you want and this 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.959
 It gives a flavor and a spectacular touch and 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.119
 if you do not already tell me I hope that both 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:02.579
 drinks like it or the Irish 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.219
 or the Spanish the truth is that to me in 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.190
 the personal both have their touch 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:12.049
