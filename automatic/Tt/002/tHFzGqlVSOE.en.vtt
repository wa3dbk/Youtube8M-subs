00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.690
 Hello 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.439
 today we show how you can 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:32.940
 make that kimono 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:37.800
 only he stayed and he's done a lot if 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.570
 You have to learn here. I just learned. 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.079
 for you to have a notion how he 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.079
 stay 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:53.030
 Let's finish him. He's 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:56.070
 basically a square square 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.970
 I put the fringes I just 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.320
 sew the fringes 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:09.409
 now what I'm going to do I'm going to come here 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.409
 and I'm just going to make a seam 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:21.810
 I'm going to make a stand here I'm going to close 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:25.770
 the bar and let's have a little speck here and 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.170
 another down there and then he's going to wear 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.899
 It shows you again. 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.729
 we then started preparing the fringe 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:36.229
 France is more or less 15 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:41.249
 centimeters we'll solder that part 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:43.049
 to weld use a match and take care 

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:45.389
 gently so it does not burn bright 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.359
 But only only him so that he does not parade. 

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:51.060
 Ideally, you should do this in the 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:52.229
 beginning and at the end of a 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.799
 what 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:59.490
 check if you really got a soldier and 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:02.039
 now you're going to get this fringe 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.490
 part at one of the two ends of the 

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:07.740
 scarf with sewing machine because I 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.280
 had machine but do not worry if 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.920
 you did not have sewing machine do 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.650
 delicately with thread and needle 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:20.760
 Manually with patience you can 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.640
 fasten the fringe so well jewelry 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.350
 and a detail is that she bangs 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.610
 company on both sides you are 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.490
 learning one of the ends of 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.040
 the other end in the sequence nodes 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.410
 We'll need to be releasing her to 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.600
 that the fringes are loose in 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:42.700
 movement right 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:46.570
 I would come back then I would finish 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:49.800
 Do not forget to weld the end of it. 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.800
 What did not I tell you? 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:58.660
 she is fixed now we take these 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:03:05.680
 chains that hold apart the other 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:07.690
 side of the fringe and it goes out 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.520
 automatic you will pulling it will get 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.680
 dismantling 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.370
 then the fringe was ready 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.370
 nailed there 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.890
 now we go to the second 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.050
 part of the process 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.239
 you will bend a bar up like 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:26.050
 shows there feedback bend a rod 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:28.959
 in the opposite direction of the fringe plus 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.480
 less than 1 30 of about 30 cm 40 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.549
 centimeters 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.810
 You will learn around 10 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:39.459
 centimeters more or less is this part 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:46.299
 Where are you going to get stuck where you 're going? 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:49.900
 enter your arm concludes that 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:52.049
 and you'll see where it goes 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.880
 to arm 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:58.290
 this same procedure to be done 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:01.510
 across the line leave and mouse 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:07.239
 and also attach that other side if you 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:12.150
 to take the hand make small dots 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.150
 which will also work the same way 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:20.560
 there is the kimono finalized in 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.479
 very little time if you do not have a 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.419
 square meter a square fabric too 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.800
 resolves to choose more cover than you 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.600
 like 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.810
 now I'll be wearing it for you 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.300
 see how it got practical 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.130
 This handkerchief of mine is one meter and twenty 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.539
 By one meter and twenty then you'll see 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.040
 More or less, where will it go? 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:47.169
 his greeting when he is clothed 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:50.350
 there is a good ranking finalized 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:54.310
 so the first process is you have a 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:57.130
 square scarf a square fabric nail 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:01.270
 the fringe at the bottom of Brazil in 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:04.660
 up and fix with some dots 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:07.690
 seam at 10 centimeters and this is 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:10.000
 where you go is putting your 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:14.520
 arms and wearing it on your body 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.520
 simple as you liked the tip
