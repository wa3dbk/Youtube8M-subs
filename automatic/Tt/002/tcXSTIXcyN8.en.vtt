00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
once you've made a knife you'll want to

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.870 
once you've made a knife you'll want to
put<00:00:15.809> as<00:00:15.929> keen<00:00:16.260> an<00:00:16.500> edge<00:00:16.710> on<00:00:17.010> it<00:00:17.160> as<00:00:17.250> possible

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
put as keen an edge on it as possible

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.269 
put as keen an edge on it as possible
there<00:00:18.570> are<00:00:18.720> as<00:00:18.869> many<00:00:18.900> ways<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.500> do<00:00:19.859> that<00:00:20.070> as

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
there are as many ways to do that as

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.370 
there are as many ways to do that as
there<00:00:20.490> are<00:00:20.520> knife<00:00:20.910> makers<00:00:21.449> so<00:00:22.050> I'm<00:00:22.199> going<00:00:22.350> to

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
there are knife makers so I'm going to

lump a whole bunch of tools together in
this<00:00:24.420> section<00:00:24.769> the<00:00:25.769> conventional<00:00:26.340> way<00:00:26.519> of

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
this section the conventional way of

this section the conventional way of
honing<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.090> knife<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.990> take<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.199> flat<00:00:28.590> stone

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
honing a knife is to take a flat stone

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.460 
honing a knife is to take a flat stone
and<00:00:29.340> rub<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.970> blade<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.420> an<00:00:30.539> angle<00:00:30.929> across<00:00:31.019> the

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
and rub the blade in an angle across the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.910 
and rub the blade in an angle across the
stone<00:00:31.769> like<00:00:32.430> so<00:00:32.960> that's<00:00:33.960> what<00:00:34.170> we'll<00:00:34.320> focus<00:00:34.350> on

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
stone like so that's what we'll focus on

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.299 
stone like so that's what we'll focus on
here<00:00:35.370> flat<00:00:35.969> bench<00:00:36.360> stones<00:00:36.950> there<00:00:37.950> are<00:00:38.070> three

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
here flat bench stones there are three

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.299 
here flat bench stones there are three
main<00:00:38.520> categories<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:39.239> stones<00:00:39.660> oil<00:00:40.170> water<00:00:41.129> and

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
main categories of stones oil water and

main categories of stones oil water and
diamond<00:00:42.149> stones<00:00:42.559> you<00:00:43.559> can<00:00:43.710> buy<00:00:43.860> little<00:00:44.100> bitty

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
diamond stones you can buy little bitty

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.369

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
ones and bigger bench top models I

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.860 
ones and bigger bench top models I
recommend<00:00:47.250> buying<00:00:47.430> larger<00:00:48.120> stones<00:00:48.450> they're

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
recommend buying larger stones they're

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.729 
recommend buying larger stones they're
faster<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.649> easier<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.370> use<00:00:50.579> accurately<00:00:51.739> the

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
faster and easier to use accurately the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.650 
faster and easier to use accurately the
traditional<00:00:53.280> Western<00:00:53.670> approach<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.449> use<00:00:54.480> a

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
traditional Western approach is to use a

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.319 
traditional Western approach is to use a
stone<00:00:55.050> such<00:00:55.440> as<00:00:55.590> natural<00:00:56.039> Arkansas<00:00:56.640> or<00:00:56.910> India
