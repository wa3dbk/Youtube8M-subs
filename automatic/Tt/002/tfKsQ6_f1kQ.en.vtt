00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hi, I counted the votes 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.520
 for the video ad or not able to move 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.830
 look a little bit at all your 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.630
 comments I made small of 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.219
 little lists of little crosses and so 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.990
 it's generally pleaded a plebiscite 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.490
 for the pub of the moment obviously that it 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.160
 allows to buy equipment that I can 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.680
 test for you here if I did the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.240
 counting actually we have two people who 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.310
 tell us no the pub is really 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.560
 rotten I do not want I 'll even look 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.260
 pathÃ© video if you put the ad we have 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.420
 overall a person who for the ad 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.640
 before the video but not too much for the 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.989
 little banners that gets up we have five 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.130
 people I was trying to do pretty much 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.930
 an average because there are some stuff 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.940
 little bit your boundaries between a little bit 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.739
 between them two actually five people 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.710
 who say I do not like the video 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.629
 before and then during there during during 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.610
 the ad during the video it bothers me 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.260
 no and twenty-one people who say 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.690
 yes yes go but the pub of the moment 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.969
 that it allows to have new 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.710
 material testing so I think that 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.840
 we are going to continue to put the 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.399
 pub I would have liked to remove the 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.559
 videos before the little videos that 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.059
 go ahead anyway but actually in 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.040
 looking at the statistics it turns out 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.939
 really that those pubs there that relate 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.780
 a little bit of money because the 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.920
 small banners bleeding has 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.720
 finally not many people who click 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.460
 above all as I put the links 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.909
 to the products I test in 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.409
 below the amazon links is often the 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.580
 the links that suit them small 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.009
 banners that get up during the video 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.140
 it's related to the product of the video so 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.720
 these are all his mill click 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.100
 link in the undergrowth and so yes 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.479
 actually it's a little video that 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.189
 go ahead that generates a little bit more 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.520
 of income so I think I'm going to them 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.079
 keep 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.970
 after again so really a 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.259
 day it bothers you really do not hesitate 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.490
 to say it in the videos here it starts 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.430
 to really stand out everywhere in the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.570
 comments I remove them true what 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.470
 that's it but for now we're going to 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.640
 keep and 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.610
 to give you a bit of an idea 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.230
 where we are sure about the ad on 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.200
 income on them so the material that I 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:53.470
 could buy on amazon there was a 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.060
 lag of two months between revenues 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.190
 that have been generated and the time 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.670
 the money is transferred to on my 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.820
 count what is so for now I 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.010
 received 40 euros 2 these are two cities of 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.660
 transfer but there was a very very good 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.580
 July with over 100 euros 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.660
 so that's going to work not too 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.070
 huh it's not a salary either, but 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.020
 it starts to buy a few 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.280
 stuff and so that money up 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.750
 the money of the month of July so you from 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.440
 September will happen at the end of September 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.330
 end of September 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.790
 I would normally have enough 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.230
 under to buy lightroom my version 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.770
 evaluation stops in ten days 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.660
 so it will be perfect in late September 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.400
 I buy lightroom and end of October 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.260
 normally to the muc and well not bad the 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.950
 income in August also 60 70 euros 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.950
 something like that late October so 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.500
 well, we're going on the 50 mm 1.8 as 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.170
 saab is not jealous we can test 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.820
 both and then it will be cool for everything 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.190
 the world and after the purchases that are going 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.330
 to follow then there we will see we will see a 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.769
 little bit later I know that 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.300
 I wish I had a goal 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.730
 wide-angle because for my pictures of 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.769
 landscapes it would be nice and as we have a 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.470
 mean sensors we'll tell the little ones 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.030
 sensors on the on six devices there the 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.950
 18 mm is not really a wide-angle 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.760
 what and so it would take more stuff 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:10.180
 like 8 10 12 mm but these goals 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.700
 listen in the 500 or 600 euros so that's 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.799
 is a little expensive 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.000
 there is also a very real case 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.489
 very well who came out he is pretty much 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.620
 near pretty much everything all that 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.630
 I like in a rango camera 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.160
 I had imagined pretty much the device 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.140
 ideal photo and that's about that one 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.850
 this is the case of year 70 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.910
 I will surely tell you about it in a 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.100
 other video but the same 1100 euros 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:37.930
 we go back the pay so what 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:39.849
 we put it a little bit later so 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.060
 so that's just to tell you that for 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:44.049
 the moment it rolls what to continue to 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.319
 continue to watch the videos if that 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:48.730
 please and then he goes thank you thank you to 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.200
 all in any case to watch the videos 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.180
 with the ads to click on the links 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.650
 amazon to buy products times 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.989
 I even have someone who has 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.609
 click on an amazon link for sue 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.530
 probably one of you is 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:01.689
 applied on the Amazon links for 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.939
 photo props so and who ended up 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:04.840
 buy a pair of sneakers and so on 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:05.920
 the pair of sneakers I touch a 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.500
 commission because no one was 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.950
 came via an Indian that I had put under 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.159
 videos 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.049
 so it's cool what to continue 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:15.310
 to buy sneakers is something else and 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:18.269
 beats so I tell you see you soon 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.269
 See you
