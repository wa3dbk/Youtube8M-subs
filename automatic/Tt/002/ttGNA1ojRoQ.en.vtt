00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
airplane fold and to do that we're going

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.959 
airplane fold and to do that we're going
to<00:00:59.930> fold<00:01:00.200> in<00:01:01.160> this<00:01:01.309> corner<00:01:01.610> we're<00:01:01.700> gonna<00:01:01.820> fold

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
to fold in this corner we're gonna fold

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:09.309 
to fold in this corner we're gonna fold
that<00:01:02.090> down<00:01:02.149> to<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:02.660> center<00:01:02.930> crease<00:01:08.139> let<00:01:09.139> me<00:01:09.200> do

00:01:09.309 --> 00:01:09.319 
that down to the center crease let me do

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:15.609 
that down to the center crease let me do
that<00:01:09.469> with<00:01:09.679> this<00:01:09.829> side<00:01:10.670> too<00:01:14.289> just<00:01:15.289> as<00:01:15.499> if

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
that with this side too just as if

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.270 
that with this side too just as if
you're<00:01:15.740> making<00:01:15.859> a<00:01:16.039> paper<00:01:16.159> airplane<00:01:18.280> and

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
you're making a paper airplane and

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.669 
you're making a paper airplane and
unfold<00:01:19.670> it<00:01:19.840> when<00:01:20.840> you<00:01:20.929> do<00:01:21.079> that<00:01:21.109> on<00:01:21.380> all<00:01:21.619> four

00:01:21.669 --> 00:01:21.679 
unfold it when you do that on all four

00:01:21.679 --> 00:02:10.060 
unfold it when you do that on all four
corners

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.670 

and<00:02:11.070> then<00:02:11.490> once<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:11.970> unfold<00:02:12.600> everything<00:02:13.020> the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
and then once you unfold everything the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.720 
and then once you unfold everything the
fourth<00:02:13.980> step<00:02:14.250> is<00:02:14.959> to<00:02:15.959> make<00:02:16.709> it<00:02:17.040> fold<00:02:17.400> up<00:02:17.580> the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
fourth step is to make it fold up the

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.150 
fourth step is to make it fold up the
right<00:02:17.880> way<00:02:18.030> put<00:02:18.900> your<00:02:18.990> fingers<00:02:19.350> on<00:02:19.560> here<00:02:19.950> like

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
right way put your fingers on here like

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.120 
right way put your fingers on here like
this<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:21.420> then<00:02:21.540> push<00:02:21.840> up<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.200> center<00:02:22.500> there's

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
this and then push up the center there's

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.949 
this and then push up the center there's
a<00:02:23.190> triangle<00:02:23.550> here<00:02:23.910> on<00:02:24.060> this<00:02:24.180> edge<00:02:24.420> that<00:02:24.720> you

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
a triangle here on this edge that you

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.740 
a triangle here on this edge that you
want<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.260> stick<00:02:25.530> up<00:02:25.740> and<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.790> do<00:02:27.180> that<00:02:27.330> on<00:02:27.480> each

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
want to stick up and you do that on each

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.400 
want to stick up and you do that on each
edge<00:02:29.180> so<00:02:30.180> that<00:02:30.209> you<00:02:30.360> get<00:02:30.510> the<00:02:30.660> same<00:02:30.870> triangle

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
edge so that you get the same triangle

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.000 
edge so that you get the same triangle
sticking<00:02:32.010> up<00:02:32.130> on<00:02:32.720> each<00:02:33.720> side<00:02:33.989> and<00:02:34.380> then<00:02:34.830> you

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
sticking up on each side and then you

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.890 
sticking up on each side and then you
can<00:02:35.220> go<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.239> center<00:02:36.360> of<00:02:36.450> that<00:02:36.540> triangle

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
can go to the center of that triangle

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.390 
can go to the center of that triangle
and<00:02:37.260> pinch<00:02:37.739> it<00:02:38.900> so<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:39.959> comes<00:02:40.140> up<00:02:40.340> like<00:02:41.340> this

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
and pinch it so it comes up like this

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.720 
and pinch it so it comes up like this
and<00:02:42.320> this<00:02:43.320> is<00:02:43.470> what<00:02:43.590> it<00:02:43.680> looks<00:02:43.860> like<00:02:43.920> but<00:02:44.550> we're

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
and this is what it looks like but we're

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.180 
and this is what it looks like but we're
not<00:02:44.850> quite<00:02:45.000> done<00:02:45.060> yet<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:46.200> next<00:02:46.350> step<00:02:46.739> is<00:02:46.950> to

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
not quite done yet the next step is to

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.620 
not quite done yet the next step is to
get<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:48.350> piece<00:02:49.350> of<00:02:49.620> ribbon<00:02:50.390> and<00:02:51.390> a<00:02:52.110> piece<00:02:52.410> of

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
get a piece of ribbon and a piece of

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:03.610 
get a piece of ribbon and a piece of
tape<00:02:56.269> and<00:02:57.269> loop<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:59.280> ribbon

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.430 

and<00:03:04.220> tape<00:03:04.489> it<00:03:04.670> inside<00:03:05.330> one<00:03:05.900> of<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.080> corners

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
and tape it inside one of the corners

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.300 
and tape it inside one of the corners
just<00:03:06.739> gonna<00:03:07.310> take<00:03:07.550> it<00:03:07.989> and<00:03:08.989> tape<00:03:09.260> it<00:03:09.349> in<00:03:09.530> so

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
just gonna take it and tape it in so

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.619 
just gonna take it and tape it in so
that<00:03:10.340> it<00:03:10.430> comes<00:03:10.670> to<00:03:10.849> that<00:03:11.000> if<00:03:11.120> you<00:03:11.209> fold<00:03:11.390> it<00:03:11.540> up

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
that it comes to that if you fold it up

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.800 
that it comes to that if you fold it up
again<00:03:11.750> it<00:03:12.050> comes<00:03:12.230> right<00:03:12.470> out<00:03:12.620> the<00:03:12.769> top<00:03:13.690> and<00:03:14.690> so

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
again it comes right out the top and so

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.259 
again it comes right out the top and so
you<00:03:14.900> just<00:03:15.050> need<00:03:15.200> to<00:03:15.610> tape<00:03:16.610> it<00:03:16.760> into<00:03:17.000> one<00:03:17.120> of<00:03:17.209> the

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
you just need to tape it into one of the

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.009 
you just need to tape it into one of the
corners<00:03:17.420> so<00:03:18.319> it<00:03:18.379> does<00:03:18.530> that<00:03:19.360> and<00:03:20.360> the<00:03:20.690> next

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
corners so it does that and the next

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:27.070 
corners so it does that and the next
step<00:03:21.290> is<00:03:21.560> to<00:03:21.890> take<00:03:22.750> glue<00:03:24.129> and<00:03:25.150> to<00:03:26.150> make<00:03:26.780> sure<00:03:26.959> it

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
step is to take glue and to make sure it

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.900 
step is to take glue and to make sure it
stays<00:03:27.290> shut<00:03:27.620> you<00:03:27.799> have<00:03:27.920> to<00:03:28.069> glue<00:03:28.370> all<00:03:28.730> the

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
stays shut you have to glue all the

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.890 
stays shut you have to glue all the
different<00:03:29.150> sides<00:03:29.470> so<00:03:30.470> you<00:03:30.560> want<00:03:30.739> to<00:03:30.830> get<00:03:31.010> a

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
different sides so you want to get a

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.270 
different sides so you want to get a
little<00:03:32.900> bit<00:03:33.080> of<00:03:33.170> glue<00:03:33.379> on<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:33.739> side<00:03:33.950> so<00:03:34.250> you

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
little bit of glue on the side so you

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.039 
little bit of glue on the side so you
want<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.519> make<00:03:34.610> sure<00:03:34.760> you<00:03:34.849> cover<00:03:35.120> the<00:03:35.870> inside

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
want to make sure you cover the inside

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.500 
want to make sure you cover the inside
the<00:03:36.170> triangle<00:03:36.489> you<00:03:37.489> don't<00:03:37.640> need<00:03:37.760> a<00:03:37.790> globs<00:03:38.269> of

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
the triangle you don't need a globs of

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.089 
the triangle you don't need a globs of
glue<00:03:38.750> you<00:03:39.260> just<00:03:39.440> need<00:03:39.590> to<00:03:39.650> make<00:03:39.829> sure<00:03:39.860> you

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
glue you just need to make sure you

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:53.110 
glue you just need to make sure you
cover<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:43.090> entire<00:03:44.090> side<00:03:44.480> of<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:45.730> triangle<00:03:52.120> we

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
cover the entire side of the triangle we

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.369 
cover the entire side of the triangle we
have<00:03:53.239> the<00:03:53.390> loop<00:03:53.510> so<00:03:53.720> to<00:03:53.780> make<00:03:54.079> sure<00:03:54.200> it<00:03:54.260> comes

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
have the loop so to make sure it comes

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.650 
have the loop so to make sure it comes
at<00:03:54.500> the<00:03:54.530> top<00:03:54.670> and<00:03:55.670> squeeze<00:03:56.000> it<00:03:56.269> back<00:03:56.390> shut

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
at the top and squeeze it back shut

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.430 
at the top and squeeze it back shut
again<00:03:56.870> just<00:03:57.110> like<00:03:57.230> it<00:03:57.379> was<00:03:57.500> a<00:03:57.530> few<00:03:57.769> minutes<00:03:57.860> ago

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
again just like it was a few minutes ago

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.170 
again just like it was a few minutes ago
and<00:04:00.440> you<00:04:01.220> need<00:04:01.370> to<00:04:01.459> hold<00:04:01.610> it<00:04:01.730> like<00:04:01.849> this<00:04:01.970> for

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
and you need to hold it like this for

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.440 
and you need to hold it like this for
about<00:04:02.360> an<00:04:02.829> for<00:04:03.829> a<00:04:03.860> minute<00:04:04.129> or<00:04:04.250> two<00:04:04.400> and<00:04:04.610> then

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
about an for a minute or two and then

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.259 
about an for a minute or two and then
you<00:04:05.810> can<00:04:06.049> find<00:04:06.319> somewhere<00:04:06.590> to<00:04:06.709> put<00:04:06.920> it<00:04:07.069> I<00:04:07.269> use

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
you can find somewhere to put it I use

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.569 
you can find somewhere to put it I use
my<00:04:08.450> spool<00:04:08.690> of<00:04:08.780> ribbon<00:04:08.900> and<00:04:09.230> that<00:04:10.130> will<00:04:10.280> hold<00:04:10.430> it

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
my spool of ribbon and that will hold it

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.340 
my spool of ribbon and that will hold it
shut<00:04:10.790> for<00:04:11.000> the<00:04:11.030> next<00:04:11.269> maybe<00:04:11.420> five<00:04:11.780> minutes<00:04:11.959> so

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
shut for the next maybe five minutes so

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:21.539 
shut for the next maybe five minutes so
it<00:04:12.500> can<00:04:12.530> dry<00:04:12.769> completely

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.609
