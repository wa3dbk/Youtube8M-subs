00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:05.229
 very good in this tutorial let's see 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.080
 how to place an antenna splitter 

00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:09.650
 television is to say if you have a TV 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.120
 you want to put 3 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.150
 so you have to put something like 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.150
 this 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.810
 so this is a delivery guy 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.849
 television antenna there are a thousand types 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.650
 different in the market but good yo 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:27.009
 I'm going to use this all work 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:31.640
 same so the concept is the same 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:34.010
 it's worth once we've opened it you'll see that 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.170
 there is a small scheme of the device here 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.510
 these little arrows mean an entrance 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.199
 antenna 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.089
 to be able to distribute and three outputs and 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.400
 this corresponds to this one entry 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:46.560
 antenna 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.630
 and three outputs normally the scheme is 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.410
 very simple that is quite related 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.570
 with the pins that there are 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:57.070
 then how it works very simple 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.540
 the only antenna you will have at home 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.239
 for because the floor is prepared for 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:03.850
 a television for example will be connected 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.130
 here surely the pin that already has 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.140
 it's male and it fits perfect because it's 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.210
 female pegs and these three are male 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.780
 so if you have a male here 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.130
 goes the male is worth then for each 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.409
 of the televisions you want to put 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.560
 will have to go to the hardware store and buy 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:23.979
 a female television pegs worth 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.110
 female peg and now I will teach you how 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.020
 place that plug in each of the 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.450
 cables and ready you just have to put 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.399
 here the entrance that already has of house and 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.990
 here you will have to bring each of the 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:36.510
 cables of new televisions that 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.120
 go to place 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.700
 and all this is connected with a cable 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:45.409
 that is already supplied by the device 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.869
 it was connected to a 220 socket 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.899
 and ready and will have a paperboy 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.039
 antenna placed let's see it by 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.750
 example I have divided it will 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:57.350
 use to place two televisions 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:59.540
 new is worth only not just 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.280
 that cable that you already see there if you are already 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.900
 placed already I have him put that the old 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.090
 ok and now let's proceed to this and 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.330
 I'm going to show you how to connect 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.920
 pin to the cable is about bringing all 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.020
 the televisions that we are going to place 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.440
 all the cables of those televisions to 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.310
 same point so that everything is 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.250
 centralized in a place that is where 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.370
 we will place the box is distributed 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.370
 now 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.299
 well I do not know if you have ever 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.689
 put to fight some cable 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:31.420
 antenna television but they are a bit 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:33.749
 peculiar as you see this is formed 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.980
 by several layers is worth a layer are 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:37.819
 a lot of copper hairs like that 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.129
 interlaced 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.560
 then there is another layer that is a 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:45.049
 another cable is rigid white and then it goes 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.810
 a copper cable through the center that is 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.020
 rigid 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.940
 well, this should not be touched, 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.430
 must touch the hairs with the rigid 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.480
 because then it causes interference 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.480
 placement is very simple 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.560
 the metal wires must touch all the 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.050
 metal surface of the apparatus 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.319
 and the cable cited rigid must enter by 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.800
 that little black hole that is in 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.330
 the center is worth 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.840
 this is very simple once we have it 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.840
 bare 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.700
 or to place the rigid part or not 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.070
 and place here a little inside so that 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.100
 the hairs remain in place but is 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.920
 just plug in the rigid part 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.160
 inside and we would already have it work 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.530
 it's okay because she's the rigid part 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.300
 only touching what interests you and 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.670
 the hairs are touching only the 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.610
 part of outside and now it is simply 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.980
 disconnect tighten the screws to 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.440
 that the cable is fixed and I do not know 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.390
 and us from the mountain 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.730
 it's quite simple what good this 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.830
 model is a bit complicated is that it 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.590
 they had another one at the hardware store but they usually 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:00.870
 be very simple to assemble this 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.150
 once it 's set so it's already put 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.900
 the cap but we're fine by which 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.900
 he calls us home 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:13.989
 and already place the screws in 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.989
 where stop 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.750
 we already have our plug 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:49.180
 set to connect to 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.670
 the television delivery guy we're going to 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.560
 proceed to place the dealer and good 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:56.080
 Look what I used to tell you is once 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.750
 they have the two female pins of the 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.270
 two new televisions in the same area 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.210
 that the male peg that is the one that you 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.470
 I already had on the farm 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.060
 and the power cord already has it 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.770
 plugged in there is some plug and now 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.620
 we have here the pin that goes under 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.390
 it is simply to mount and it would already be 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.600
 screwed good with a couple of 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:18.880
 phthalates on the wall nothing very simple 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.040
 there is a small section on tips 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.170
 useful that explains to the types of 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.060
 taco that is just in case does not catch them 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:28.820
 well on the wall is at a glance but 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:31.889
 good two 6 screws 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.860
 and I have them here done previously 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:36.060
 a bit is screwed to the apparatus 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.800
 set more than anything so 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.540
 we disconnected a cable one day because 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:46.090
 do not keep the pot in your hand 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:46.090
 and nothing and here goes to the other 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:05.840
 we would already have placed the dealer and 

00:05:59.629 --> 00:06:07.820
 nothing is to one television be to another 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.980
 TV 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.110
 we could close it here 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.680
 this is placed at the entrance of 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.680
 TV 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:22.070
 and this other to the current 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.280
 and ready 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:30.880
 theory would have to work cast a 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.610
 look at your televisions to see if everything 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:36.430
 it works and if any fails surely 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:38.410
 is because possibly the hairs of 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.840
 inside the cable are touching in some 

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:43.390
 point that they should not but good is 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.950
 issue of organizing the pegs by 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:47.820
 inside well and that the experts do not touch 

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:50.050
 in the rigid cable of the center and 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:52.880
 Problemitas are often the failures 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.890
 what can this cause 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:59.110
 I hope you followed them there 

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:59.110
 been very useful and thanks for following us
