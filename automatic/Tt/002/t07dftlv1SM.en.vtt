00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.250
 th 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.270
 The 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.870
 Well 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.430
 The 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.430
 What 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.120
 I will 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.120
 FOLLOW 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:24.890
 I b 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.990
 voodoo 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.990
 th 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.340
 eh 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.549
 Four 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.720
 voodoo 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:30.420
 deh 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.730
 Was it a gray? I dropped it from super high pitch but it was once 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.790
 Also 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:41.930
 I already say this piccolo 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:47.269
 That high sound snare drum like this I hit a 14-inch cheek here 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.080
 Ne When it came to the end of the 14th team, we worked to increase the pitch but after all 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.920
 like this 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:56.630
 It is Toka crisp of goodness or not only say that the pitch is high 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.310
 It is this thin goodness of that reaction is also firmly snappy when you have very low 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.160
 a 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.630
 This quick a 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:07.960
 It is wonderful 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:10.390
 Tteyuu properly this pig of the shell but I'm fast in the good features of this snare drum 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:14.260
 However, it is a device that can be heard 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:17.900
 In this way I'm pulling out the middle of the snappy 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:22.489
 The switch is also 4 inches properly 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:23.480
 It does not get in the way when you sponge it is this kind of switch Ne-it is devised 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.240
 It is Tattoka 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:30.600
 I thought it was recommended that really is a variety considered 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:37.020
 The snare of the wolf is Bedford here and 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:38.590
 Also, because it is the opposite here, for example 10 inches per floor tom 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:44.920
 Let's put in the position of 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:49.180
 It is in the original lump together without'm Toka mind that here a little You know different house 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:52.629
 Even in this bedhole there are two bed holes 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:56.860
 I think it is easy to get a good sound 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:58.580
 It is an honor to have introduced this time 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.990
 Maple 10th 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:06.520
