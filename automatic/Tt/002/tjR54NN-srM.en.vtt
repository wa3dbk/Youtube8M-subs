 you the recipe that I have 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.279
 it's just pork chops 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.630
 spicy for this recipe what are we going to 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.130
 need are the following 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.410
 ingredients 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.050
 slow trail of pig needle what 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.529
 equivalent for three people three 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.350
 Scoops of salsa word sense and a 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.930
 Chunk of Tabasco about 400 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.079
 milliliters of olive oil the juice 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.579
 squeezed out of a lemon and salt good let's go 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.579
 to start making this dish 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.020
 the first step to make this dish 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.790
 is to create the spicy marinade for it 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.770
 what we are going to do is catch the oil 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.910
 of olive pour it in a saucepan or 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:11.620
 big bowl in this perfect shape and 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:14.830
 another one above we have the 400 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:20.010
 milliliters of olive oil the juice 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:23.790
 of the lemon we give them also perfect 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:27.060
 the three tablespoons of shenzhen sauce 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.060
 how to know 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.080
 but it 's a bit of getting out 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.120
 two 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:43.900
 and three we're going to stop now the blasting of 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:49.890
 Tabasco 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.890
 a lot of rum goes out so the effect 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:02:00.190
 There goes with this, what's left and a bit 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.870
 of salt 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.260
 ah 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.240
 and effect and now we are going to remove everything 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.630
 very well until we see that it is 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.610
 well mixed once we have mixed 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.470
 and everything well inside the pan what 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.460
 what we are going to do is introduce the 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:22.090
 pork needle steaks in this way 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:26.170
 perfect one for one there that tie 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:30.930
 well in the perfect sauce and the other one that 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:33.370
 I will also go there that soaks well 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.550
 perfect and we're going to let it marinate 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.380
 for a couple of hours once they have 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.180
 past two hours since we put 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.890
 marinate the chops what we have done 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.470
 is to put it in the pan to heat and 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:48.910
 Now let's take one for chops 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:52.420
 one and we're going to go to the pan 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:55.270
 so that it is done 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.370
 good as we see this meat is already 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.569
 ready to serve so we're going to 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.159
 take out of the fire 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:06.590
 and we're going to serve it on a plate once 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:08.749
 already served the meat the dish will present 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.730
 this aspect as you see we have put 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:13.099
 a little salad as an accompaniment 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.409
 that is very good this dish is very 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.180
 easy to do and fast the only thing that we 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:18.859
 it will take a little more time is navy 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.359
 in the flesh but as the only thing 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:22.099
 we have to do is leave the meat in 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.060
 the pot for two hours we can be 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.310

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.579
