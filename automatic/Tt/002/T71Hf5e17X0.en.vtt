00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:07.440
 Hi guys, the tip of today is how to make a 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:12.530
 for party cakes with 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.530
 crepe paper stays that way 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.730
 I connected crepe paper 1 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.730
 I cut to the measure of these ideas 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:37.250
 I'll use the little pieces as an elite 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:37.250
 starts at noon - in mexico 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:48.710
 and here but soon will stay until here is the 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:52.160
 center where you will cut the other side 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.160
 thus 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:05.640
 when you open it like this in your people 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.000
 how does it make him stay with 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.340
 this aac format fundinho 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.280
 I got this little body that's measuring 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.560
 medicine meter 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.540
 there it may be necessary to develop here 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.409
 It's up to us to tighten up 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.650
 format that I liked the most 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.680
 packaging is that the enamel 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:36.360
 she looks good from being able to handle 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:38.280
 being the medicine can also have that 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.479
 here I prefer to play this way 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:48.990
 even with that side of the paper 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:55.729
 out of the two but it's in here is 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.729
 as the site centralizes here however 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.500
 Comes with packaging 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.450
 yea 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:10.040
 and then the paper up to format for people 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.040
 put the candy after 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:18.900
 now gives an image is competitive and I 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.580
 I'm going to make the first one of the effective one and then 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.580
 It's easy with tapes and ink 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.960
 thus 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.680
 then just play with the bridge 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.890
 anderson is wrong 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:12.660
 very simple and gets more called now will go 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:15.290
 make sense of the same process 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.290
 the 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.200
 based on campaign 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:29.060
 We're right to be conformed. 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:38.360
 Here I am going to use what hot you there 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.360
 whatever you want 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.870
 in the square that is in crisis 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.550
 here again 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:13.910
 Fontinha that'll put a bow only 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.910
 for life 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.340
 it's cuter 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
 ae 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.640

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:53.570

00:04:48.410 --> 00:05:01.460
 tv rba so done look I do not even know 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:05:04.060
 How long in the environment so that 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.060
 stayed 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.430
 no one in here either 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:26.039
 here the piece was here put back 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:29.789

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:33.089

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:35.789
