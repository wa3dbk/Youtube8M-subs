00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:13.190
 Hi, I'm going to teach today how to 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.889
 original shore bay says 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.130
 first let's take the measure of the tender 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:23.180
 with the meter measures two legs and 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:39.850
 marking with a very wide posture 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:39.850
 after launching the original line is fine 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.650
 like this 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.610
 and let's sign 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:06.699
 the pants like another maga well seam 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:19.060
 always controlled that is quite correct 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:31.330
 with very wide points just to fix 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:38.120
 the euro is ready i can start to 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.120
 to sew 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:46.010
 prepare my machine with a needle 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:51.560
 number 90 made for 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:54.409
 jeans and thick fabrics then put on a 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.650
 foot that comes as an accessory in my 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:03:00.049
 machine that is half a foot 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.230
 as we can note law has two holes 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:08.870
 for the passage of the needle a right 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:12.920
 left foot once and 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:17.629
 need not forget to change the 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:20.659
 our needle to the right 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:22.340
 so it can sew because if the 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:25.060
 people do not change the position of the needle she 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.060
 can break 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:37.840
 we take the arm that will help us to 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.840
 aa to bahia 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:54.019
 we put the trousers tucked into the arm of 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:04:00.620
 support use one own little foot 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:04:02.440
 supported in our original as an aid 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.819
 to the straight 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.819
 Let's do a straight stitching 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:32.070
 done that we will take the seam that 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:32.070
 we would have just not secured the bay 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:38.260
 with sharp scissors 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.710
 we will cut the excess tissue that 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.710
 left over 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:05:01.700
 now with the normal foot I do the 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:05.290
 finish from where we cut to 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:10.430
 finishing we will see the point h 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:12.820
 In this case, the trunk point should only 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.980
 new instruction from your machine 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:19.030
 I put my gold beats of the foot and 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.030
 begins to sew 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.590
 now with very hot iron 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:46.590
 I'm the boss of the 3rd 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:04.419
 our sheath is ready only one 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:07.830
 very careful posture you can see that 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:10.600
 it was a diminished pant 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:13.090
 Thank you for your attention and until the next 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:16.770
 with seam walking and recreating a stitch 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.770
