00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.170
 Speak beauty guys emerson right here we 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.509
 Let's make a video of this boxing. 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.439
 memory of the four- 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:22.490
 ddr3 gigas its frequency of 1,600 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.160
 mega-hertz compatible with amd phenom 2 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.810
 43 of the second core i5 and i7 of 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.939
 also from the second generation 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.460
 third and the first and only wants is 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.790
 corsan advertising does not mean that 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.739
 not showing the symbol of the 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.300
 amd fx processors that it is not that 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.100
 this memory is not compatible nor is it 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.890
 all marketing compatible memory 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.940
 since your motherboard fu ddr3 sewage she is 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.039
 compatible né 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.300
 here is a box that is sold as 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.670
 single slot 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.320
 and it is not because it is sold only one 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.780
 that I can not buy two boxes 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.820
 Do not work from the team. 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.010
 same way too much seller has a 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.480
 air argument, you'd better buy the 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.219
 kit that comes with two memories for 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.780
 do not have problems when making the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.580
 altino does not exist that 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.340
 The only problem with using two 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.200
 memories you can use the memory 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.880
 different brand with frequencies 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.939
 different with different trends 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.119
 if I put a memory of r 3,600 with 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.860
 the name 303 the two will be 1333 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.450
 and she has that I can also change the 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.119
 only thing that will imply for whom 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.979
 makes overclocking high right then it goes 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.170
 system instability 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.900
 but nothing prevents you from using memories 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.299
 with different capacities and the 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.320
 altino will not change a thing she's gonna stay 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.479
 patient no 15 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:42.329
 It's good, this back does not have a 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:48.560
 culture here which is acm z4 gt3 in 1 to 1 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.560
 1600 9b Let's open it here 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.470
 initially we are going to assemble the machine 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.140
 of flight nox is harrison 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.690
 we'll just put a rtv comb 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.060
 four gigs 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.260
 then we get one more there for 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.140
 make of article 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.330
 So this is the memory right now. 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.360
 I do not know if you can read the 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.600
 This is 8 gigas in case it would be the kit but 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:21.090
 it's a symbol she's coming in case four 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:25.890
 gigas 1600mhz the latency of 999 24 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:32.790
 cl 2 cr 2 and nené and his will of 1.5 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:34.740
 volts corsan bluejack review 7.12 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.850
 thigh comes from contented color memories 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.930
 different or blue yellow has red 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.580
 red usually says that it is 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.800
 recommended there gave me but that in the 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.090
 truth is only marketing is same color right 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.460
 generally you can buy your 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.200
 motherboard if user note the motherboard 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.700
 Do you can put the blue one if it is 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.790
 red and black you can buy the 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.330
 Minister, but it's a matter of color taste. 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.430
 even interferes because they score because 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.180
 She is red that she has is better or 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.370
 worse 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.600
 is what changes is valid for dominator 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.780
 for the rip of al x hip normal house there 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.040
 yes a question of overclocking 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.810
 speed these things now the vivendi 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.340
 in five different colors does not change 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.230
 absolutely nothing even because the price 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.750
 you can see the same thing from both the 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.310
 black red blue and yellow 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.720
 good, that's ok, people liked it 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.720
 big video hug to all and thanks
