this<00:00:01.020> is<00:00:01.230> your<00:00:01.410> brain<00:00:02.030> here<00:00:03.030> are<00:00:03.360> the<00:00:03.810> neurons

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
this is your brain here are the neurons

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.680 
this is your brain here are the neurons
that<00:00:04.290> produce<00:00:04.650> dopamine<00:00:05.120> when<00:00:06.120> these<00:00:06.330> neurons

in the frontal lobes dopamine is

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.690 
in the frontal lobes dopamine is
