00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.800
 Hello everyone 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.780
 welcome back for a new tutorial today 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.030
 I will try to explain how to build one 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:41.290
 very simple automatic pharma of 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:45.700
 pumpkins to build this farm we will have 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:49.090
 need the piston blocks 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:52.660
 normal of the land of the blocks of 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:55.750
 different color a double case 3 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:59.739
 hoppers 4 red stone repeaters 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.330
 of torches of the blocks to make light e 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.580
 of red stone 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:07.890
 let's start by building a platform 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.890
 on which to place our tower 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:17.980
 something like that once 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:21.340
 built our platform there 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:30.640
 we regulate for the measures positioning the 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:32.979
 land that we will need 4 and 4 positioned 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.500
 the triad we take our blocks that 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:39.030
 we will need to make us compensated 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.030
 positioning of the pistons 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.929
 here we build another plan 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.789
 let's start by placing new wool on you 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:58.130
 which will help us to facilitate the 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:02:00.890
 placement of other things here 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.659
 on the other hand idem 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.659
 and again our pistons 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.650
 this type of farmer produces well 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.300
 within 64 blocks of height then vi 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.700
 I suggest not to exceed this 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.620
 maximum height before forgetting 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.370
 so they immediately mark our home 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.970
 we must also understand the space 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.820
 to position our hoppers 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.340
 pointing towards the cash desk we are but 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.920
 place them 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.420
 here we go to the part a little bit 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.000
 more complicated 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:41.420
 or that of the red stone 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.380
 we place blocks in this way 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:49.750
 on this block yes 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.750
 place a red stone torch 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:58.190
 then we place another block in 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:06.320
 this way and on it we place 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:08.930
 another torch we repeat the same thing 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.370
 going upwards pointing towards the 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:16.100
 torch we position the block 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:20.050
 and here another beautiful torch 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.050
 obviously another block will go here 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.000
 we repeat the same operation from this 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.090
 side 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.370
 torch lock 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.370
 torch lock 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:41.560
 block 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.560
 finally torch one last block 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.599
 you have to repeat the same pattern on 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:48.580
 all sides of the tower 6 pistons 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.310
 they are open means that you have 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.569
 done a great job 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.840
 we conclude the part of the red stone 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:04:00.130
 connecting our tower to ours 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.250
 timer we position repeaters that 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:06.420
 they will feed this block 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.420
 we repeat the operation on all sides 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.420
 here we connect everything with the 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.420
 Red Rock 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:31.570
 most likely the signal from here 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.820
 it will be very weak so let's add a 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.160
 relay 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.550
 leave a block of distance between the 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.979
 red stone is the block to be activated 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.490
 we try to connect our tower to the 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.490
 timer 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:53.440
 it seems our tower is working 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.720
 very important to build a 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.009
 signal inverter something of the 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.800
 gender 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:02.050
 simply placing a block is 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.130
 a red torch we continue ours 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.930
 tower 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.729
 first of all we need to take care of one 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.039
 near the facade because we will go 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:12.280
 to insert water from above and not 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:14.440
 we want to ruin our paths of 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.289
 red stone then place two 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.410
 blocks and in their midst one 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:22.960
 fence so as to still be able to 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.500
 open the chest we place a block 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.500
 also behind 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:32.440
 in this way we pass now 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:35.290
 we place a block on lighting 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.760
 of gloss don to save you vi 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:40.090
 I suggest using another 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:43.600
 material alternating glock stone 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:50.540
 now in this way we repeat 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:55.810
 the operation also from the other party 12 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:55.810
 and we now turn to water 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:03.350
 personally I position in this 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:06.500
 so our tower almost over 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:10.500
 Let's now plant the pumpkins 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:22.050
 we arrived the earth let's not forget 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:25.130
 to do it his plan years finally we plant 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.130
 our darlings 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:33.020
 here is also below 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:41.810
 Let us now turn to the decorative part 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.220
 the opposition of the blocks 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:47.250
 colored in this way because I find that 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:50.310
 the effect on a large scale is a lot 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:55.580
 nice and also because the wool has a 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:07:00.710
 relatively low cost and the skybox 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.710
 saving is always a good thing 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:06.810
 well our farm of pumpkins e 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.350
 completed now we activate the 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:09.350
 timer 

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:18.160
 I usually turn it off when I work 

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:20.410
 because i'm laga too 

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.600
 as you can see even if the pumpkins are not 

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:26.590
 they are robbed the first time towards 

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:29.380
 the water when the timer goes over one 

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:32.790
 second time, it will still push them towards 

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.790
 the string of water 

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:37.960
 Well for this video, I hope so 

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:39.939
 having been useful enough if not 

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.159
 did you understand something leave a 

00:07:39.939 --> 00:07:46.050
 comment if the video is there instead
