00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
I think in sajid khan back and what he

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.720 
I think in sajid khan back and what he
does<00:02:41.650> best<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:44.500> I<00:02:44.560> think<00:02:45.010> I<00:02:45.310> mean<00:02:45.459> I've<00:02:45.549> seen

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
all his work and I think this is

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.780 
all his work and I think this is
definitely<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.709> most<00:02:47.799> challenging<00:02:48.280> I<00:02:48.459> want

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
like that during the shoot I think he

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.089
