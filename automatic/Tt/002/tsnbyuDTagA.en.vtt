00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:10.830
 Hello everyone, I will show you just 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.769
 pressing a finger out of chiffon can be said 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.940
 in the garage 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:20.189
 Necessary conditions are pussies 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:22.039
 surely everything else from improvised 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:28.109
 funds 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:30.980
 here we see the already successful experience here 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:35.730
 already a pressed product as we see 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:41.489
 that there is absolutely smooth leg is not bent 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.629
 and on the leg of the effort will not see one 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.370
 video where 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.899
 Minders came up with the whole there pulled out 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.539
 a form to press the fee 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:58.760
 if the piston is pressed into conformity 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:01:03.320
 men and not needed and so here's the old 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:05.189
 pressed piston sense in what 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:13.229
 what we insert it 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:15.930
 discs discs on one side will be here 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.920
 such a mandrel do not even know what it found 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.080
 but where 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.799
 diameter fits very well 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.799
 finger diameter 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.890
 respectively, on the one hand we insert 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.640
 this one 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:39.180
 amendment on the other side of the grip we 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:45.060
 insert I found from lerke just such 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:50.939
 Here is a thing that has a diameter of decent 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:53.189
 more than a finger inner diameter here 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:02:00.049
 accordingly we leave with the other 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:02:00.049
 side of the piston like that 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:11.190
 here we see the already assembled structure 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:15.390
 once again the mandrel piston dispatch gives in 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:18.060
 finger and here the mandrel in which should 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.520
 go out your finger accordingly for more 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:24.030
 diameter than the finger itself matter 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:28.370
 to tighten the grip of effort 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.970
 serious so i use 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:38.930
 additional 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:44.519
 lever yes oh if you swing then 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:46.850
 combine business with pleasure until soon 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.850
 meeting 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:56.950
 means after some effort we 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:00.110
 see that the mandrel is gone 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.690
 probably already almost to the rod then 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:07.760
 have squeezed more than half now i'm 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:19.100
 I will show you so to speak on the floor of the process as 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:25.040
 it looked was understandable then here it is 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:29.230
 our finger that came out almost to 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.760
 the end is our right thing 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:36.470
 I shot the beeps because all this 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:38.540
 the construction did not fit now 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:42.610
 get to the end accordingly i put 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.610
 one sponge and extrude to the end
