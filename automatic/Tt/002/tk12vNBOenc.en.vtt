- Hello, and welcome to today's
plumberparts.co.uk video.

00:00:03.757 --> 00:00:07.274
We are gonna have a look today
at siliconing down a toilet.

00:00:07.274 --> 00:00:08.563
Now, it's already been fixed down.

00:00:08.563 --> 00:00:10.351
We've already put it in and
we've tested everything.

00:00:10.351 --> 00:00:13.204
And usually, siliconing down
a toilet is the last bit.

00:00:13.204 --> 00:00:15.952
So, what I'm gonna do is
just do it in front of you

00:00:15.952 --> 00:00:18.157
and you can take away your own ways

00:00:18.157 --> 00:00:19.835
and methods from this video.

00:00:19.835 --> 00:00:22.249
A lot of people use a finger with um,

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:25.174
a little bit of fairy liquid
and water or just water.

00:00:25.174 --> 00:00:26.733
I tend to use a former.

00:00:26.733 --> 00:00:29.007
I find this a lot easier, a lot cleaner.

00:00:29.007 --> 00:00:31.914
But it does use up a vast
amount of toilet bowl.

00:00:31.914 --> 00:00:33.733
So, make sure you've got
plenty of that about.

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:36.221
So, I kind of want to just
do it, let's have a go.

00:00:36.221 --> 00:00:40.319
Firstly, cut our nozzle to a
decent size, at least 6 mil.

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:43.448
And then, run a decent bead,

00:00:43.448 --> 00:00:45.945
not too much though,
strait along and under

00:00:45.945 --> 00:00:48.459
the side of the toilet.

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:49.709
Just like that.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.547
This is now the time
to select what type of

00:01:00.547 --> 00:01:01.380
edge you're going to leave.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.179
We've got different size off-sets here.

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:05.760
Today, I'm just gonna do a cut,

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.522
which means I'm gonna
use a right angled side.

00:01:08.522 --> 00:01:12.272
Let's have a go at that
and see how it looks.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.867
If you have any bits left
then you need to clean it up.

00:01:38.185 --> 00:01:39.656
Just work your way around the toilet,

00:01:39.656 --> 00:01:41.136
clearing up as you go.

00:01:41.136 --> 00:01:44.194
And you should end up with a
nice, neat seal just like that.

00:01:44.194 --> 00:01:46.721
To be honest, it's very
difficult to tell you strait away

00:01:46.721 --> 00:01:49.846
and have you get great results
instantly from a video.

00:01:49.846 --> 00:01:51.609
Siliconing takes practise

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:53.717
and you do need to be patient, as well.

00:01:53.717 --> 00:01:55.728
But it is the best way
to finish off a bathroom

00:01:55.728 --> 00:01:57.625
and it usually looks really good.

00:01:57.625 --> 00:01:59.874
