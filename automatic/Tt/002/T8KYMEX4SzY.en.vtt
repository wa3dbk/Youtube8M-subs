00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.500
 I agree with the fly then before doing 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.240
 this however comes the cold and the voice 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.030

 and I greet you from gina that 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.719
 obviously he goes somewhere else 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:50.730
 because because it is there and to give it to me 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:53.670

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.460
 I talk about furniture shed has changed 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.579
 has practically expanded now 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.039
 in fact it became moby dick xl 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:05.280
 beautiful that I entered was immense 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.590
 there is everything from the lake to the ducks a 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.510
 from products for animals to 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.909
 animals themselves 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.680
 moby dick anagnina is very clean then 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.820
 I don't know the others what to say many that 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.210
 they told me they did anyway 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.850
 complained because other stores were not 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.580
 very efficient in terms of hygiene 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.009
 instead I have to say that moby dick to the mine 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.009
 close to the ikea is awesome it is 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.500
 beautiful there is everything and more than 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.790
 beautiful cages so I recommend you 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.820
 anyway to go there 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.280
 then what I bought had a 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.520
 Problem toenails 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.590
 jin euro were too long I wanted 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.040
 see if maybe a 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.540
 something we could say fix 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.310
 the thing to shorten the nails without 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.170
 traumatizing it is too much with bringing it 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.360
 doctor let her put on 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.070
 small table etcetera etcetera etcetera and 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.560
 I found a moby dick 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.290
 one thing I hope works is mine 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:07.229
 Once it was used then it is this 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:09.869
 here or this here practically then 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.420
 this one of the atrix in this what 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.170
 fa is a biological sandy perch for 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.060
 healthy nails 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.110
 in the sense that this is practically here 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.780
 we put it inside the perch though 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.000
 by the way I show for any 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.390
 size then see this you that 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.489
 do 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:31.410
 I don't know if you see it here anyway 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:34.830
 practically everything is raked, you take it 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.910
 he wraps it inside their perch 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.310
 walking on it 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.130
 in practice they scratch their nails 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.709
 bringing them back to the normal size for 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.510
 these types of cages are these layers 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.519
 coated with a special sand of 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.250
 quartz and make sure that the bird 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.110
 keep the nails short if replaced 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.579
 regularly avoid painful 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.100
 complications 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.350
 instructions for use open the roost 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.570
 sandy wraps the limb from the perch 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.430
 so your cage 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.959
 put they didn't leave us forever 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.510
 because I repeat if not long go 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.820
 leaving above them poor people yes 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.079
 they find no nails and no damage 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:15.600
 it's great I try it and then let you know if 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:19.440
 anyway it works then i took another one 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.140
 What this is it what this is 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.470
 Stone 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.510
 I find the part in Italian 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.700
 then it gives you dense zumbo mine 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.709
 contains vital mineral substances i 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.040
 natural microelements for a bone structure 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.959
 healthy the gastro quartz lite help 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.850
 also product management 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.000
 indispensable in every cage 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.040
 so this is practically necessary 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.590
 to force the bones and to help the 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:52.070
 digestion which is like a bar of soap la 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:53.840
 shape is not Manodori see gancia ta 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:56.750
 inside the cage they the 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.700
 they begin to gnaw and serve him both 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.860
 to repay the bones then the two be 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.130
 very rich in calcium and is still 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:06.650
 also for the intestine to give it a 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.140
 clean or these are the two products that 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.030
 I bought and wanted to share with 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:18.620
 I advise you to go to the furniture 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:21.290
 catarina because it is beautiful said this there is 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.630
 a project in progress so there it is 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.970
 advance before there is a project with 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.380
 christian will go Christian sent me 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.520
 a message you saw that I did 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.350
 primate the video regarding non 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.270
 the one before this where I do 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.150
 see how to remove the spins of 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.790
 sunflower and make the meal any longer 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.980
 better suited to our parrots without 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.050
 jump through hoops to find a 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.700
 shop that we were handing over to 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.180
 the previous one I spoke instead 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:52.340
 of the things I think they were in were 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.440
 out that is the things that according to good blackbird 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.380
 and those he doesn't impose then he has me 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.419
 contacted christian telling me that i 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.940
 thank you then I also say why 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.810
 telling me that this is how I pass you 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.800
 thing 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.810
 also the sticks with egg and honey 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.650
 they hurt are even more harmful 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.350
 cookies 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.150
 so I recommend returning back 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.750
 in fact, on the speech I told you before 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.400
 went even more and anyway I knew 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.320
 this thing, however, that type too 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.330
 of product is particularly bad 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.449
 speaking with christian remo he said one 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.319
 thing 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:30.210
 in the beautiful message the phrase that you 

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:32.249
 she loved it when she said that 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.839
 it is a passion word that one is 

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:37.229
 handed down from generation to generation 

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:39.059
 it started from her grandfather she came to 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:41.249
 his father and now he came to him 

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:43.020
 this thing is beautiful the sentence 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:45.029
 it really was beautiful and so 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.629
 speaking of this and that 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:50.129
 I asked him if he would send me 

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:52.680
 practically something for speed 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:55.680
 explain the speech of the 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:58.229
 mutation that is how you can understand 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.330

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.680
 what is the race that prevails because of 

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:06.180
 this thing I didn't understand anything 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.499
