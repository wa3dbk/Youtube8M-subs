number<00:03:43.090> two<00:03:43.390> and<00:03:44.290> then<00:03:44.440> go<00:03:44.560> into<00:03:44.590> widgets<00:03:45.220> and

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
number two and then go into widgets and

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.660 
number two and then go into widgets and
then<00:03:46.480> click<00:03:46.720> on<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:46.930> status<00:03:47.290> bar<00:03:47.319> and<00:03:47.739> then

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:48.670 
then click on the status bar and then

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.030 
then click on the status bar and then
that's<00:03:49.239> it<00:03:49.420> there<00:03:49.750> and<00:03:50.409> then<00:03:50.470> all<00:03:50.680> you<00:03:50.769> need<00:03:50.830> to

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
that's it there and then all you need to

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.860 
that's it there and then all you need to
really<00:03:51.220> do<00:03:51.459> is<00:03:51.700> just<00:03:51.909> select<00:03:52.209> yes<00:03:52.450> so<00:03:52.629> you<00:03:52.690> just

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
really do is just select yes so you just

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.420 
really do is just select yes so you just
want<00:03:53.049> to<00:03:53.110> override<00:03:53.379> whatever<00:03:53.709> was<00:03:54.220> there

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
want to override whatever was there

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.280 
want to override whatever was there
before<00:03:54.579> and<00:03:54.940> then<00:03:55.360> hit<00:03:55.510> that<00:03:55.659> alpha<00:03:55.989> button

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
before and then hit that alpha button

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.110 
before and then hit that alpha button
and<00:03:56.709> then<00:03:56.829> slide<00:03:57.099> it<00:03:57.129> all<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.340> way<00:03:57.430> down<00:03:57.549> so

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
and then slide it all the way down so

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.729 
and then slide it all the way down so
the<00:03:58.239> alphas<00:03:58.599> basically<00:03:59.019> the<00:03:59.140> transparency

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
the alphas basically the transparency

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.649 
the alphas basically the transparency
and<00:03:59.950> that's<00:04:00.099> how<00:04:00.250> you<00:04:00.310> get<00:04:00.459> it<00:04:00.610> to<00:04:00.790> be<00:04:01.480> more

00:04:01.649 --> 00:04:01.659 
and that's how you get it to be more

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:05.670 
and that's how you get it to be more
transparent<00:04:01.959> so<00:04:02.950> it's<00:04:03.159> as<00:04:03.879> easy<00:04:04.120> as<00:04:04.269> that<00:04:04.680> so

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
transparent so it's as easy as that so

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.380 
transparent so it's as easy as that so
the<00:04:06.040> HTC<00:04:06.549> One<00:04:06.700> guys<00:04:06.940> would<00:04:07.120> have<00:04:07.209> probably

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.390 
the HTC One guys would have probably

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.640 
the HTC One guys would have probably
seen<00:04:07.599> this<00:04:07.720> already<00:04:07.840> because<00:04:08.019> I<00:04:08.170> went<00:04:08.319> over<00:04:08.530> it

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
seen this already because I went over it

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.500 
seen this already because I went over it
again<00:04:08.739> but<00:04:09.400> for<00:04:09.609> the<00:04:09.849> people<00:04:10.239> that<00:04:10.390> were

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
again but for the people that were

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.640 
again but for the people that were
struggling<00:04:10.870> with<00:04:10.989> the<00:04:11.049> galaxy<00:04:11.349> note<00:04:11.500> 2

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
struggling with the galaxy note 2

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.670 
struggling with the galaxy note 2
tutorial<00:04:12.519> that's<00:04:12.730> how<00:04:13.090> you<00:04:13.150> do<00:04:13.329> it<00:04:13.450> and<00:04:13.680> then

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
tutorial that's how you do it and then

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.930 
tutorial that's how you do it and then
all<00:04:14.799> you<00:04:14.859> have<00:04:14.920> to<00:04:15.069> do<00:04:15.160> is<00:04:15.280> just<00:04:15.310> save<00:04:15.640> it<00:04:15.670> and

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
all you have to do is just save it and

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.509 
all you have to do is just save it and
then<00:04:16.510> that's<00:04:17.169> it<00:04:17.350> we<00:04:17.620> have<00:04:17.739> to<00:04:17.829> do<00:04:17.949> is<00:04:18.100> resize

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
then that's it we have to do is resize

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.509 
then that's it we have to do is resize
it<00:04:18.699> after<00:04:18.940> that<00:04:19.060> and<00:04:19.859> yeah<00:04:20.859> that's<00:04:21.130> pretty

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
it after that and yeah that's pretty

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.629 
it after that and yeah that's pretty
much<00:04:21.880> it<00:04:21.940> so<00:04:22.500> it's<00:04:23.500> quite<00:04:23.949> simple<00:04:24.400> and

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
much it so it's quite simple and

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.730 
much it so it's quite simple and
straightforward<00:04:24.970> and<00:04:25.449> just<00:04:25.840> if<00:04:26.440> you<00:04:26.590> still

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
straightforward and just if you still

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.439 
straightforward and just if you still
have<00:04:26.860> any<00:04:26.889> more<00:04:27.130> problems<00:04:27.250> just<00:04:27.729> let<00:04:28.240> me<00:04:28.330> know

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449 
have any more problems just let me know

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:29.820 
have any more problems just let me know
in<00:04:28.570> the<00:04:28.630> description<00:04:29.139> but<00:04:29.289> this<00:04:29.530> should<00:04:29.710> clear

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
in the description but this should clear

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.670 
in the description but this should clear
that<00:04:30.039> for<00:04:30.250> a<00:04:30.280> lot<00:04:30.400> of<00:04:30.460> people<00:04:30.850> and<00:04:31.350> also<00:04:32.350> some

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
that for a lot of people and also some

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.350 
that for a lot of people and also some
people<00:04:32.889> have<00:04:33.010> been<00:04:33.130> asking<00:04:33.310> will<00:04:34.000> this<00:04:34.150> work

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
people have been asking will this work

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.279 
people have been asking will this work
on<00:04:34.600> my<00:04:34.780> xperia<00:04:35.320> z<00:04:35.560> door<00:04:36.180> you<00:04:37.180> know<00:04:37.300> my<00:04:37.630> galaxy

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
on my xperia z door you know my galaxy

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.460 
on my xperia z door you know my galaxy
s3<00:04:38.740> or<00:04:38.770> galaxy<00:04:39.370> s2<00:04:39.600> the<00:04:40.600> a<00:04:40.870> good<00:04:41.139> rule<00:04:41.289> of<00:04:41.320> thumb

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
s3 or galaxy s2 the a good rule of thumb

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.460 
s3 or galaxy s2 the a good rule of thumb
to<00:04:41.680> go<00:04:41.919> by<00:04:42.160> is<00:04:42.190> the<00:04:42.940> screen<00:04:43.270> resolution<00:04:43.840> so<00:04:44.080> if

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
to go by is the screen resolution so if

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.150 
to go by is the screen resolution so if
you<00:04:44.800> have<00:04:45.010> a<00:04:45.570> latest<00:04:46.570> gen<00:04:46.810> phone<00:04:47.080> so<00:04:47.470> you<00:04:47.800> know

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
you have a latest gen phone so you know

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.300 
you have a latest gen phone so you know
a<00:04:48.190> 1080p<00:04:48.760> screen<00:04:49.479> phone<00:04:49.780> then<00:04:50.380> you're<00:04:51.099> better

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
a 1080p screen phone then you're better

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.000 
a 1080p screen phone then you're better
off<00:04:51.400> using<00:04:51.669> the<00:04:52.000> HTC<00:04:52.510> One<00:04:52.780> tutorial<00:04:53.349> because

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.010 
off using the HTC One tutorial because

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.860 
off using the HTC One tutorial because
well<00:04:54.190> most<00:04:54.550> likely<00:04:54.729> have<00:04:54.940> a<00:04:54.970> faster<00:04:55.360> processor

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
well most likely have a faster processor

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:56.940 
well most likely have a faster processor
as<00:04:55.960> well<00:04:55.990> so<00:04:56.349> it<00:04:56.410> can<00:04:56.530> deal<00:04:56.710> with<00:04:56.830> those

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
as well so it can deal with those

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.770 
as well so it can deal with those
animations<00:04:57.370> smoothly<00:04:57.880> and<00:04:58.180> are<00:04:58.360> elegantly

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
animations smoothly and are elegantly

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.580 
animations smoothly and are elegantly
and<00:04:59.169> if<00:05:00.039> you<00:05:00.190> have<00:05:00.370> a<00:05:00.720> phone<00:05:01.720> with<00:05:01.930> a<00:05:01.960> 720p

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
and if you have a phone with a 720p

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:03.990 
and if you have a phone with a 720p
display<00:05:02.889> then<00:05:03.340> you're<00:05:03.460> probably<00:05:03.610> better<00:05:03.880> off

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
display then you're probably better off

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.930 
display then you're probably better off
going<00:05:04.300> with<00:05:04.539> the<00:05:04.690> galaxy<00:05:05.260> note<00:05:05.440> 2<00:05:05.680> tutorial<00:05:06.340> so

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
going with the galaxy note 2 tutorial so

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.120 
going with the galaxy note 2 tutorial so
that's<00:05:07.870> a<00:05:07.990> good<00:05:08.110> rule<00:05:08.260> of<00:05:08.320> thumb<00:05:08.410> something<00:05:08.919> to

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
that's a good rule of thumb something to

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.310 
that's a good rule of thumb something to
go<00:05:09.280> by<00:05:09.310> so<00:05:09.849> just<00:05:10.330> if<00:05:10.479> you're<00:05:10.630> wondering<00:05:10.780> which

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
go by so just if you're wondering which

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.640 
go by so just if you're wondering which
phone<00:05:11.940> goes<00:05:12.940> with<00:05:13.120> what<00:05:13.270> Fox<00:05:13.930> are<00:05:14.110> set<00:05:14.349> up<00:05:14.440> so

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
phone goes with what Fox are set up so

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.680 
phone goes with what Fox are set up so
yeah<00:05:15.610> that's<00:05:15.729> pretty<00:05:15.849> much<00:05:16.090> it<00:05:16.150> for<00:05:16.330> now<00:05:16.630> guys

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
yeah that's pretty much it for now guys

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.659 
yeah that's pretty much it for now guys
