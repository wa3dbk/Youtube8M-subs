thing<00:00:13.920> I<00:00:14.070> found<00:00:14.370> about<00:00:14.549> this<00:00:14.759> game<00:00:15.000> initially

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
thing I found about this game initially

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.960 
thing I found about this game initially
was<00:00:16.199> that<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.440> was<00:00:16.560> really<00:00:16.800> really<00:00:17.460> hard<00:00:17.760> to

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
was that it was really really hard to

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.470 
was that it was really really hard to
get<00:00:18.119> money<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:19.310> really<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.460> really<00:00:20.490> did<00:00:21.150> put

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
get money and really it really did put

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.170 
get money and really it really did put
me<00:00:21.510> off<00:00:21.779> from<00:00:22.650> from<00:00:23.519> playing<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.910> game

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
me off from from playing the game

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.960 
me off from from playing the game
because<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.750> was<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:25.830> difficult<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.609> get<00:00:26.760> money

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
because it was so difficult to get money

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.330 
because it was so difficult to get money
especially<00:00:27.619> when<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.710> look<00:00:28.830> at<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.039> prices

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
especially when you look at the prices

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.640 
especially when you look at the prices
of<00:00:29.670> some<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.029> vehicles<00:00:30.510> like<00:00:30.929> three

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
of some of the vehicles like three

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.389 
of some of the vehicles like three
million<00:00:31.890> two<00:00:32.399> million<00:00:32.640> dollars<00:00:33.180> I<00:00:33.300> think

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
million two million dollars I think

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.860 
million two million dollars I think
that's<00:00:35.399> quite<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.940> lot<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.270> money<00:00:36.300> especially

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
that's quite a lot of money especially

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.990 
that's quite a lot of money especially
when<00:00:37.649> you're<00:00:37.800> only<00:00:37.950> earning<00:00:38.160> about<00:00:38.430> two<00:00:38.700> grand

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
when you're only earning about two grand

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.380 
when you're only earning about two grand
ago<00:00:39.360> it's<00:00:39.950> difficult<00:00:40.950> for<00:00:41.070> low<00:00:41.340> levels<00:00:41.790> but

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
ago it's difficult for low levels but

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.670 
ago it's difficult for low levels but
one<00:00:42.540> thing<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.780> need<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.020> keep<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.320> mind<00:00:43.530> if

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
helicopter it's really really really

easy<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.420> escape<00:02:33.659> the<00:02:33.900> cops<00:02:34.190> thing<00:02:35.190> is<00:02:35.310> if<00:02:35.430> you

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519 
easy to escape the cops thing is if you

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:36.920 
easy to escape the cops thing is if you
do<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.700> in<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.849> helicopter<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.450> have<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.720> start

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
do it in a helicopter you have to start

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.930 
do it in a helicopter you have to start
it<00:02:37.110> up<00:02:37.140> which<00:02:37.590> is<00:02:37.799> where<00:02:37.950> having<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.400> friend<00:02:38.700> can

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
it up which is where having a friend can

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.069 
it up which is where having a friend can
come<00:02:38.970> in<00:02:39.239> handy<00:02:39.590> so<00:02:40.590> with<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.310> friend<00:02:41.810> you<00:02:42.810> risk

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
come in handy so with a friend you risk

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.530 
come in handy so with a friend you risk
not<00:02:43.859> dying<00:02:44.250> while<00:02:44.700> you<00:02:44.790> start<00:02:45.030> in<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.150> chopper

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
not dying while you start in the chopper

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.330 
not dying while you start in the chopper
up<00:02:45.599> and<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:46.049> can<00:02:46.260> probably<00:02:46.500> do<00:02:46.739> it<00:02:46.769> quicker<00:02:47.099> to

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
up and you can probably do it quicker to

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.410 
up and you can probably do it quicker to
be<00:02:47.459> honest<00:02:47.760> but<00:02:48.390> yeah<00:02:49.970> filling<00:02:50.970> that<00:02:51.090> in<00:02:51.269> just

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
be honest but yeah filling that in just

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.059 
be honest but yeah filling that in just
using<00:02:51.780> vehicle<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.379> get<00:02:52.769> away<00:02:52.859> the

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
using vehicle and get away the

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.059 
using vehicle and get away the
traditional<00:02:53.579> way<00:02:53.609> on<00:02:53.909> foot<00:02:54.540> or<00:02:54.690> in<00:02:54.780> a<00:02:55.019> car<00:02:55.290> so

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
traditional way on foot or in a car so

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.770 
traditional way on foot or in a car so
that's<00:02:56.310> one<00:02:56.489> of<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:56.670> ways<00:02:56.790> another<00:02:57.299> way<00:02:57.480> it's

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
that's one of the ways another way it's

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.210 
that's one of the ways another way it's
probably<00:02:58.109> my<00:02:58.290> least<00:02:58.470> favorite<00:02:59.040> which<00:02:59.190> is

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
probably my least favorite which is

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.940 
probably my least favorite which is
racing<00:03:00.030> racing<00:03:00.989> in<00:03:01.109> this<00:03:01.230> game<00:03:01.470> earns<00:03:01.739> you

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
racing racing in this game earns you

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.119 
racing racing in this game earns you
quite<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.280> bit<00:03:02.400> of<00:03:02.639> money<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:03.650> it's<00:03:04.650> not<00:03:04.799> bad<00:03:05.010> if

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
quite a bit of money and it's not bad if

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.780 
quite a bit of money and it's not bad if
I'm<00:03:05.280> honest<00:03:05.579> it's<00:03:05.909> pretty<00:03:06.569> handy<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:07.790> racing

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
I'm honest it's pretty handy and racing

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.839 
I'm honest it's pretty handy and racing
in<00:03:08.940> particular<00:03:09.209> though<00:03:09.569> because<00:03:10.129> it's<00:03:11.129> quite

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
in particular though because it's quite

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.289 
in particular though because it's quite
fun<00:03:12.269> to<00:03:12.299> do<00:03:12.659> their<00:03:13.530> short<00:03:13.859> races<00:03:14.099> as<00:03:14.430> well<00:03:14.459> you

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
fun to do their short races as well you

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.089 
fun to do their short races as well you
can<00:03:15.510> get<00:03:15.690> quite<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:15.959> lot<00:03:16.169> of<00:03:16.260> money<00:03:16.290> from<00:03:16.650> racing

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
can get quite a lot of money from racing

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.030 
can get quite a lot of money from racing
so<00:03:17.629> there's<00:03:18.629> another<00:03:18.930> method<00:03:19.319> if<00:03:19.500> you<00:03:19.650> really

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
so there's another method if you really

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.020 
so there's another method if you really
do<00:03:20.190> need<00:03:20.310> some<00:03:20.549> money<00:03:20.730> in<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.780> game<00:03:23.030> another

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
do need some money in the game another

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.349 
do need some money in the game another
way<00:03:24.329> I<00:03:24.569> would<00:03:24.870> say<00:03:25.109> to<00:03:25.169> get<00:03:25.500> money<00:03:25.739> is<00:03:26.359> from

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
way I would say to get money is from

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:28.970 
way I would say to get money is from
just<00:03:27.780> doing<00:03:28.079> jobs<00:03:28.379> that's<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.829> obvious

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
just doing jobs that's the obvious

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.170 
just doing jobs that's the obvious
obvious<00:03:29.849> way<00:03:30.299> actually<00:03:30.780> just<00:03:31.019> go<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:31.319> do<00:03:31.440> jobs

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
obvious way actually just go and do jobs

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.479 
obvious way actually just go and do jobs
and<00:03:33.180> in<00:03:33.599> no<00:03:33.780> time<00:03:33.810> you'll<00:03:34.109> start<00:03:34.680> leveling<00:03:35.310> up

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
and in no time you'll start leveling up

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.220 
and in no time you'll start leveling up
and<00:03:35.730> from<00:03:36.150> there<00:03:36.359> you'll<00:03:36.540> start<00:03:36.840> getting<00:03:36.900> more

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
and from there you'll start getting more

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.740 
and from there you'll start getting more
and<00:03:37.410> more<00:03:37.500> money<00:03:37.919> now<00:03:38.579> just<00:03:39.150> keep<00:03:39.299> in<00:03:39.449> mind<00:03:39.480> i

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
and more money now just keep in mind i

and more money now just keep in mind i

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
it'll feel like you're making no

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.550 
it'll feel like you're making no
progress<00:03:43.879> but<00:03:44.879> it's<00:03:45.660> that<00:03:45.810> sort<00:03:46.019> of<00:03:46.169> game<00:03:46.349> it's

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
progress but it's that sort of game it's
