00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello everyone with you special ail and 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.710
 today will show you a small 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.420
 sweep chick i just came up 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:15.920
 and I decided to contact you immediately to share as 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.920
 here appreciate it 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:01.739
 and since it is easiest to disassemble this solo 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.739
 just breaking into pieces like any 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.500
 the other is just out of it i will do a little 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.180
 exercise 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.180
 for example at the very beginning we have 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:25.240
 usually 3 strings sweep farther we go 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.240
 use flasher technology 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.500
 and then two strings and light 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.070
 only 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.439
 and all together we and 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.630
 that 's the same myself in this position 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:07.280
 Well, at the end of the 6th page of the place I think 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.490
 there is nothing special to chew here 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.040
 that if we are not in fact there just for 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:17.260
 beginners 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.680
 newbie so so simple idea for 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.580

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.560

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.770

 Huskies sign up as it is now fashionable 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.530
 say this me very much by the way 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.650
 motivates to record the following videos 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.900
 so than you more than a certain phobia 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.670

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:49.070

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:53.480

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.280

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:02.440
