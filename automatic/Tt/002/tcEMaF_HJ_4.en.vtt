00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:11.520
 hello my love today i want one 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.400
 Try a new recipe and that is 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.320
 a kind of speck sauce and also you can 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.350
 you only 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.390
 and I think the recipe is great because that 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.180
 sounds super easy and fast times 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.009
 again and you can be frozen 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.230
 to use spinach leaves to have you 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.400
 actually always in the freezer and by 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.490
 That's why I think that's great 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.640
 So let's start first 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.379
 a clove of garlic and a shallot 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.860
 and I peeled them and as always 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:44.120
 comes the comes in the head and will 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:59.020
 first crushed and three 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:59.020
 second grade 7 was under 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:21.790
 then give it to the eyes and used up 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.790
 only ten grams of oil 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:37.590
 which has really something 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:44.299
 huhu huhu we leave otherwise 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.299
 two minutes roma steps 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.969
 then we should roll 75 grams 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:52.799
 add bacon 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:57.390

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.400
