00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.050
 have our friend thermomix in the 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.759
 table and make another recipe whose 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.070
 ingredient one of its ingredients is 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:26.950
 the wine in this case white wine we are going to 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.630
 make some calamari to the wine whenever 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.369
 I tell you, we make recipes with squid 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.140
 any type of squid serves us 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.090
 channel has a very broad family and does not 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.940
 would do it with sepia would not work 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.610
 Do it with young children with squid with 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.949
 red any of the varieties that 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.660
 exist could we be worth for this 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:46.059
 recipe in this case we are going to do it with 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.890
 squid legs is worth with which here 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.550
 we already have the legs cut and the 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.109
 we have cut and we need 400 grams 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.519
 perfect that we are going to need more then 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:57.640
 three cloves of garlic that we already have 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:59.170
 here peladitos 50 grams of onion that 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.390
 we have it here in this case I'm going to take 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.420
 a small onion a shallot a 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.270
 little bit of salt a little bit of parsley 50 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.790
 grams of oil oil that you already know 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.159
 than me when I use oil the more 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.960
 green better because the result is better 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.340
 cast 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.810
 our ingredient with which you have to 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.600
 use the good oil that we have in 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.600
 Spain we need 80 grams of 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.820
 white wine and 80 grams of fried tomato 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.590
 that you use at home you know that 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.330
 the wine I always said that when 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.979
 recipes carry wine the better the 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.020
 wine that we throw better is the result 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.630
 with which I recommend you to use 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.450
 a wine to cook but if it can be 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.340
 we can change it a little better 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.360
 and that will thank the result 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.130
 end of the plate 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.690
 nothing else we teach you the same thing 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.030
 how it's done because it's a recipe for 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.280
 truly excellent and any of the 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.399
 Let these squids eat wine 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.399
 love 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.030
 perfect then we open our thermomix 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.590
 that we already have it actually removed 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.209
 the spatula and the first thing we're going to 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.420
 to make is to crush the garlic and the onion 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:18.040
 you easily download that this is very fast 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.140
 we put the lid with the goblet and they are 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.330
 four seconds with which button of the 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.799
 right of time at speed 5 already 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.250
 you know what to make the noise but it's very 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.250
 little time 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.160
 You see that it has already practically changed 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.800
 I had it crushed because it changed us 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.050
 the sound we open and what we do is 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.700
 download all the pieces that we have 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.850
 stuck on the walls with the 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.560
 spatula down so that now with 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:46.530
 the oil is cold or you know that if 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.300
 they stay in the glass they are not offered 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.180
 perfect it for the next thing 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.980
 let's throw is the oil that were 20 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.970
 grams of oil with which weight at 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.040
 zero and we think 20 grams of oil 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.530
 and we've had a good time, you know that 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.120
 we have 510 error margin with what 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.120
 which we just closed 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:12.310
 we put the goblet and we are going to program 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:16.980
 4 minutes 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:19.500
 234 bar temperature or more 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.120
 spoon speed now we follow you 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.580
 teaching when the sofrito is done 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.440
 as the recipe continues well then nothing 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.659
 we are about to have the sofrito 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.290
 of garlic and onion our friend we 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:32.970
 let's put in a glass so we can open it 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.580
 cuidadito with steam you know that 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.349
 The culete shows the stage exactly 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.000
 same and here we have our wave and 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.670
 our onion that smells like 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.170
 what are we going to do now, throw the 400 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.810
 grams of squid that we already have 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.329
 heavy duty and then to the 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:52.230
 squid we're going to take out we put the 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:55.250
 scale to zero we will take 80 grams 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.250
 fried tomato 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.810
 perfect 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:04.250
 and we're going to pour 80 grams of white wine 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.250
 we put it back to 0 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.770
 come perfect 85 we have gone a little 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.480
 more generous we're going to add a 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.419
 little bit of salt although they are oscar pérez and 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.859
 to taste and you know that this is not a 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.019
 exact measurement 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.139
 now we pick it up and we are going to add a 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:27.130
 little bit of parsley in this case dry 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:32.120
 it's exactly equal to perfect taste 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:33.919
 we cover the step we put the steak and 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.810
 we program with the button on the left 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.810
 at 20 minutes minutes 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.699
 20 temperature is good 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.879
 left of the blades so you do not 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:51.409
 we are crushed and speed spoon now 

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:53.360
 we show you the final result of this 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:55.340
 recipe because nothing has happened in our 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.530
 time our thermos itself is warned 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.750

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.449
 Here you have some excellent calamari 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:05.090
 We have put a rice cube 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.949
 white rice with which a plate 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.629
 great and a dish that only
