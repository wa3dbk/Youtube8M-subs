00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.410
 alcohol 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:05.240
 what we knew, I found 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.870
 with a world that no longer knew little 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.870
 we went knowing 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:18.840
 then with a company user take 4 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:22.050
 it left me many satisfactions and then 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.210
 I did not know he writes 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.210
 and the first 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:44.060

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:47.350
 180 for several years but in the 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.520
 my projects keep working 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.859
 we live 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.960
 I do not pretend that nobody cares about what 

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:55.180
 we make 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.090
 it's just what my car does and 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.690
 I'm working because I want to go down 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.690
 more time 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:10.140
 my time in chile was 6 200 meters and 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.860
 760 250 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.170
 s 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.220
 that's all for more we are 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.220
 developing the car 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.560
 good here we are with the car that 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.710
 we are working that we are 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.710
 developing 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.500
 it has cost us a bit because the hp that 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.900
 we have it is not easy to put it on the floor but 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.880
 everything we do we do with chile 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.710
 we try to 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.760
 to invent as much as you can to 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.590
 be able to save money 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.110
 let's see the results this end of 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.970

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.280
 done with the car is practically 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.760
 armed 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:03:00.010

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:03.750

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.750
 of 1600 also so hard 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.570

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.570

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.989
