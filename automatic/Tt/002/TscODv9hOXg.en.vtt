00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:44.409
 April 7 I do not remember anything 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:47.079
 because they hit me on the side and I did not 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:49.629
 I never saw the other car or the person and 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.949
 after I was in shock I was a month 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:52.949
 with induced coma 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.890
 It was a quarter past three in the afternoon 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.570
 near the cinema hoyts of the queen where 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.480
 I had to attend the premiere of a movie 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.790
 the accident left him with fractures in the 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.520
 cervical spine but his left and a 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.470
 cranial trauma remained 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.900
 a month in a coma in the hospital of the 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.149
 catholic university I tried like a 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.940
 interested and I saw that he did not move his leg 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:19.490
 left and that the left arm 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.550
 neither then 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:27.080
 I do not know what happened 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:29.600
 horrible movie since it is wished 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.610
 more another month more hospitalized and now 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.040
 At home he follows a strict routine of 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.990
 exercises more than anything from the thing of 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.710
 balance of learning to walk again 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.050
 of being able to recover the left arm and 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.210
 the hand that hurts a lot hurts me 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.330
 much the doll always you in this 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.140
 Now you can walk, I do not have to 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.409
 do it accompanied by another person or 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.250
 move in a wheelchair 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.740
 as for you is 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.780
 It's horrible because it gives you a lot 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.970
 impotence implanted plates of 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.400
 titanium in the left arm and column 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.590
 despite everything and is rescues what 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:09.780
 positive especially to those who 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.120
 attended and visited him during his 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.370
 unknown recovery that you 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.610
 they sent gifts but mainly to 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:21.110
 who has been with him for 33 years 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.110
 he was there every day 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:32.230
 so for me that's unstoppable 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:34.890
 and to feel the love is to feel that you do not 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.890
 you were wrong 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.840
 with that support, he's working hard to 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.870
 daily in the hope of being able to return 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.630
 to work in September goal that 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:50.100
 is sure will help you more to overcome 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.100
 this terrible episode 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.060
 good is here I sent our 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.430
 Honey and troops to the water and the desire for 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.269
 assumption of a speedy recovery for 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.269
