lasts 10 to 12 minutes perhaps though I
can't<00:01:10.710> really<00:01:10.830> tell<00:01:11.070> because<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.610> game<00:01:11.820> in

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
can't really tell because this game in

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.120 
can't really tell because this game in
short<00:01:12.420> because<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.200> red<00:01:13.380> team<00:01:13.590> captures<00:01:14.010> all

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
short because the red team captures all

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
if a base is resupplied very interesting

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.950
