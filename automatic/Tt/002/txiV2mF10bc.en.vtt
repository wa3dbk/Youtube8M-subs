trailer x-men days of future past from
what<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:20.730> gather<00:00:21.240> from<00:00:21.390> from<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.990> trailer<00:00:22.230> and

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
what I gather from from the trailer and

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.900 
what I gather from from the trailer and
by<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.740> way<00:00:22.949> let<00:00:23.189> me<00:00:23.250> just<00:00:23.310> say<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:23.670> the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
by the way let me just say that the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.580 
by the way let me just say that the
trailer<00:00:24.180> looks<00:00:24.449> amazing<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.140> watched<00:00:25.380> it

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
trailer looks amazing I watched it

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.429 
trailer looks amazing I watched it
several<00:00:25.859> times<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.640> just<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:27.060> one<00:00:27.330> day<00:00:27.539> what

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
several times and just that one day what

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.410 
several times and just that one day what
I<00:00:28.470> think<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.039> overall<00:00:29.369> concept<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:30.240> it's

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
I think the overall concept of it's

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.420 
I think the overall concept of it's
going<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.840> be<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.199> we're<00:00:31.800> going<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.250> see

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
going to be is we're going to see

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.310 
going to be is we're going to see
something<00:00:32.700> like<00:00:33.090> if<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.660> are<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.870> dragon<00:00:34.200> ball

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
something like if you are a dragon ball

to prevent this from happening um I

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.680 
to prevent this from happening um I
think<00:00:53.160> that's<00:00:53.640> gonna<00:00:53.940> be<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.120> concept<00:00:54.570> I

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
think that's gonna be the concept I

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.470 
think that's gonna be the concept I
don't<00:00:54.840> think<00:00:54.989> we're<00:00:55.079> gonna<00:00:55.199> see<00:00:55.350> Halle<00:00:55.620> Berry

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
don't think we're gonna see Halle Berry

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.849 
don't think we're gonna see Halle Berry
clauses<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.629> don't<00:00:58.020> think<00:00:58.050> want<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.379> see<00:00:58.559> much

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
clauses I don't think want to see much

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.619 
clauses I don't think want to see much
of<00:00:58.890> any<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.489> those<00:00:59.609> characters<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.539> film

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
of any of those characters in this film

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.470 
of any of those characters in this film
I<00:01:01.230> think<00:01:01.859> it's<00:01:01.980> gonna<00:01:02.100> be<00:01:02.160> more<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.699> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
I think it's gonna be more of the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.250 
I think it's gonna be more of the
settles<00:01:03.989> have<00:01:04.140> taken<00:01:04.530> over<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.330> we<00:01:06.330> see<00:01:06.600> the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
settles have taken over and we see the

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.469 
settles have taken over and we see the
x-men<00:01:07.680> get<00:01:07.830> hunted<00:01:08.189> down<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.729> mutants<00:01:09.360> get

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
x-men get hunted down the mutants get

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.690 
x-men get hunted down the mutants get
hunted<00:01:09.900> down<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.470> they<00:01:10.650> said<00:01:10.950> Wolverine<00:01:11.460> back

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
hunted down and they said Wolverine back

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.640 
hunted down and they said Wolverine back
to<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:11.909> past<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.240> think<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.990> mean<00:01:13.260> if<00:01:13.350> we<00:01:13.470> see

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
to the past I think I mean if we see

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.410 
to the past I think I mean if we see
holly<00:01:13.830> berry<00:01:14.130> for<00:01:14.430> more<00:01:14.610> than<00:01:14.790> five<00:01:15.119> nights<00:01:15.360> in

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
holly berry for more than five nights in

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.390 
holly berry for more than five nights in
this<00:01:15.570> film<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.900> would<00:01:16.080> be<00:01:16.200> surprised<00:01:16.650> same

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
this film I would be surprised same

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.499 
this film I would be surprised same
thing<00:01:17.640> with<00:01:17.759> all<00:01:17.909> these<00:01:18.030> other<00:01:18.090> characters

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
thing with all these other characters

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.590 
thing with all these other characters
that's<00:01:19.049> why<00:01:19.500> road<00:01:20.460> originally<00:01:21.330> arose

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
that's why road originally arose

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.780 
that's why road originally arose
character<00:01:22.170> who<00:01:22.950> was<00:01:23.100> posed<00:01:23.340> to<00:01:23.430> appear<00:01:23.640> in<00:01:23.729> a

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
character who was posed to appear in a

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.520 
character who was posed to appear in a
film<00:01:23.909> they<00:01:24.150> said<00:01:24.360> got<00:01:24.630> cut<00:01:24.900> out<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.320> last

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
film they said got cut out the last

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.580 
film they said got cut out the last
second<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.570> it<00:01:27.570> was<00:01:27.720> only<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.990> few<00:01:28.350> minutes

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
second and it was only a few minutes

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.679 
second and it was only a few minutes
part<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.340> really<00:01:29.939> believe<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.450> lot<00:01:30.479> of

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
part so I really believe that a lot of

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.920 
part so I really believe that a lot of
the<00:01:30.840> older<00:01:31.710> x-men<00:01:32.130> cast<00:01:32.400> will<00:01:33.210> be<00:01:33.240> cut<00:01:33.540> out<00:01:33.570> of

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
the older x-men cast will be cut out of

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.310 
the older x-men cast will be cut out of
this<00:01:34.049> film<00:01:34.380> or<00:01:35.240> if<00:01:36.240> they're<00:01:36.450> not<00:01:36.630> cut<00:01:36.900> out<00:01:37.020> you

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
this film or if they're not cut out you

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.620 
this film or if they're not cut out you
don't<00:01:37.500> have<00:01:37.619> really<00:01:38.159> extreme<00:01:38.460> small<00:01:38.880> roles<00:01:39.329> in

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
don't have really extreme small roles in

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.810 
don't have really extreme small roles in
the<00:01:39.750> very<00:01:39.930> beginning<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.560> film<00:01:40.829> on<00:01:41.159> this

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
the very beginning of the film on this

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.880 
the very beginning of the film on this
is<00:01:42.030> basically<00:01:42.479> going<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.869> be<00:01:42.960> just<00:01:43.290> a<00:01:43.439> sequel

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
is basically going to be just a sequel

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.539 
is basically going to be just a sequel
to<00:01:43.920> data<00:01:44.280> feet<00:01:44.640> or<00:01:44.939> arm<00:01:45.210> first<00:01:46.140> class<00:01:46.590> but<00:01:47.340> just

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
to data feet or arm first class but just

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.999 
to data feet or arm first class but just
combining<00:01:48.000> all<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.810> films<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.380> trying<00:01:49.860> to

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
combining all the films and trying to
