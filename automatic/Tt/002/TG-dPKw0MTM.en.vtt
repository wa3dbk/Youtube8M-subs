which leaves it without any residue the

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.370 
which leaves it without any residue the
problem<00:02:12.239> I<00:02:12.330> had<00:02:12.480> with<00:02:12.629> those<00:02:12.810> bucket

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
problem I had with those bucket

residue<00:02:15.690> which<00:02:16.440> then<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.740> needed<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.100> use

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
residue which then you needed to use

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.950 
residue which then you needed to use
your<00:02:17.400> microfiber<00:02:17.910> cloth<00:02:18.210> which<00:02:18.420> kind<00:02:18.810> of

your microfiber cloth which kind of
seemed<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.260> defeat<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.680> purpose<00:02:19.860> now<00:02:20.580> you're

here's<00:03:17.070> a<00:03:17.130> really<00:03:17.640> good<00:03:17.820> quality<00:03:18.180> microfiber

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
here's a really good quality microfiber

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.170 
here's a really good quality microfiber
cloth<00:03:19.380> now<00:03:20.010> let's<00:03:20.250> just<00:03:20.430> give<00:03:20.670> that<00:03:20.850> a<00:03:20.880> wipe

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
cloth now let's just give that a wipe

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.820 
cloth now let's just give that a wipe
around<00:03:21.510> and<00:03:21.810> see<00:03:22.110> how<00:03:22.380> that<00:03:22.650> does<00:03:24.560> now<00:03:25.560> let's

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
around and see how that does now let's

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.070 
around and see how that does now let's
come<00:03:26.010> in<00:03:26.190> nice<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:26.640> close<00:03:26.700> on<00:03:27.090> that<00:03:27.300> okay<00:03:27.780> it's

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
come in nice and close on that okay it's

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.960 
come in nice and close on that okay it's
better<00:03:28.500> but<00:03:28.860> you<00:03:28.980> can<00:03:29.160> see<00:03:29.340> that<00:03:29.550> you<00:03:29.700> still

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
better but you can see that you still

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.810 
better but you can see that you still
residue<00:03:30.540> there<00:03:30.780> being<00:03:31.710> a<00:03:31.800> dry<00:03:32.100> process<00:03:32.460> it

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
residue there being a dry process it

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.610 
residue there being a dry process it
hasn't<00:03:33.240> completely<00:03:33.810> gotten<00:03:34.050> off<00:03:34.260> all<00:03:34.440> of

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
hasn't completely gotten off all of

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.040 
hasn't completely gotten off all of
those<00:03:34.710> little<00:03:35.040> dots<00:03:35.300> okay<00:03:36.300> so<00:03:36.540> let's<00:03:36.840> try<00:03:36.960> the

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
those little dots okay so let's try the

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.320 
those little dots okay so let's try the
two-step<00:03:37.590> process<00:03:37.830> it's<00:03:38.310> so<00:03:38.760> easy<00:03:39.030> they're

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
two-step process it's so easy they're

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.550 
two-step process it's so easy they're
marked<00:03:39.720> step<00:03:40.140> 1<00:03:40.350> wet<00:03:40.650> wipe<00:03:40.860> step<00:03:41.310> 2<00:03:41.550> dry<00:03:42.030> wipe

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
marked step 1 wet wipe step 2 dry wipe

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:46.250 
marked step 1 wet wipe step 2 dry wipe
opening<00:03:43.560> up<00:03:43.680> the<00:03:43.920> wet<00:03:44.250> wipe<00:03:44.660> it<00:03:45.660> just<00:03:46.050> looks

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
opening up the wet wipe it just looks

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.730 
opening up the wet wipe it just looks
like<00:03:46.350> one<00:03:46.560> of<00:03:46.620> those<00:03:46.800> moist<00:03:47.400> towelettes<00:03:48.740> it's

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
like one of those moist towelettes it's

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.240 
like one of those moist towelettes it's
quite<00:03:50.100> big<00:03:50.370> though<00:03:50.610> and<00:03:50.940> I'll<00:03:51.540> only<00:03:51.810> use<00:03:52.250> 20%

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
quite big though and I'll only use 20%

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.930 
quite big though and I'll only use 20%
of<00:03:53.670> it<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:53.940> clean<00:03:54.209> this<00:03:54.360> one<00:03:54.570> off<00:03:55.640> so<00:03:56.640> just<00:03:56.850> a

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
of it to clean this one off so just a

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.360 
of it to clean this one off so just a
nice<00:03:57.090> circular<00:03:57.480> motion<00:03:57.720> you<00:03:58.260> can<00:03:58.410> see<00:03:58.680> if<00:03:58.920> it

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
nice circular motion you can see if it

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.880 
nice circular motion you can see if it
was<00:03:59.520> just<00:03:59.730> a<00:03:59.850> one-step<00:04:00.330> process<00:04:00.390> all<00:04:01.380> of<00:04:01.740> that

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
was just a one-step process all of that

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.910 
was just a one-step process all of that
residue<00:04:02.459> would<00:04:03.270> be<00:04:03.420> left<00:04:03.690> on<00:04:03.900> there<00:04:04.200> which<00:04:04.890> is

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
residue would be left on there which is

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.699 
residue would be left on there which is
absolutely<00:04:05.730> not<00:04:06.270> what<00:04:06.330> we<00:04:06.690> want<00:04:06.900> so<00:04:07.530> then<00:04:07.680> I

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
absolutely not what we want so then I

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.949 
absolutely not what we want so then I
just<00:04:08.010> sit<00:04:08.160> that<00:04:08.340> carefully<00:04:08.850> back<00:04:09.090> on<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.750> bag

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
just sit that carefully back on the bag

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.870 
just sit that carefully back on the bag
that<00:04:09.990> it<00:04:10.350> comes<00:04:10.590> in<00:04:10.830> so<00:04:11.070> we<00:04:11.160> can<00:04:11.310> use<00:04:11.520> it<00:04:11.670> again

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
that it comes in so we can use it again

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.810 
that it comes in so we can use it again
on<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:12.120> next<00:04:12.270> lens<00:04:13.100> take<00:04:14.100> out<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.400> second

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
on the next lens take out the second

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.670 
on the next lens take out the second
cloth<00:04:15.030> which<00:04:15.270> is<00:04:15.300> really<00:04:15.990> high-quality<00:04:16.200> it

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
cloth which is really high-quality it

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.400 
cloth which is really high-quality it
feels<00:04:16.920> like<00:04:17.130> it's<00:04:17.340> made<00:04:17.580> of<00:04:17.760> you<00:04:18.450> know<00:04:18.480> spun

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
feels like it's made of you know spun

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.890 
feels like it's made of you know spun
cotton<00:04:19.830> or<00:04:20.100> something<00:04:20.310> like<00:04:20.609> that<00:04:20.670> and<00:04:21.120> then

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
cotton or something like that and then

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.890 
cotton or something like that and then
give<00:04:22.710> it<00:04:22.950> a<00:04:22.979> wipe<00:04:23.250> off

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.279 

and<00:04:27.219> as<00:04:28.219> simple<00:04:28.400> as<00:04:28.639> that<00:04:28.849> that<00:04:29.090> is<00:04:29.389> now<00:04:29.629> good

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
and as simple as that that is now good

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:33.179 
and as simple as that that is now good
to<00:04:30.469> go<00:04:30.680> let's<00:04:31.099> take<00:04:31.310> a<00:04:31.340> close-up<00:04:31.669> on<00:04:31.969> that<00:04:32.030> guy

00:04:33.179 --> 00:04:33.189 
to go let's take a close-up on that guy

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:36.249 
to go let's take a close-up on that guy
pretty<00:04:34.189> happy<00:04:34.580> with<00:04:34.699> that<00:04:34.759> so<00:04:35.569> let's<00:04:35.900> go<00:04:36.080> in

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:36.259 
pretty happy with that so let's go in

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:38.709 
pretty happy with that so let's go in
and<00:04:36.499> do<00:04:36.770> the<00:04:36.979> same<00:04:37.129> job<00:04:37.189> on<00:04:37.639> all<00:04:37.699> of<00:04:38.360> them<00:04:38.509> on

00:04:38.709 --> 00:04:38.719 
and do the same job on all of them on

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:41.200 
and do the same job on all of them on
the<00:04:38.779> food<00:04:39.379> you<00:04:39.560> have<00:04:39.590> actually<00:04:40.099> got<00:04:40.400> a<00:04:40.610> big<00:04:40.999> old

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
the food you have actually got a big old

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.140 
the food you have actually got a big old
thumbprint<00:04:41.900> on<00:04:42.050> there<00:04:42.340> which<00:04:43.340> I<00:04:43.490> kinda<00:04:43.849> did<00:04:43.999> on

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
thumbprint on there which I kinda did on

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.760 
thumbprint on there which I kinda did on
purpose<00:04:44.539> for<00:04:44.569> the<00:04:44.779> point<00:04:45.020> it<00:04:45.139> is<00:04:45.289> but<00:04:45.560> let's

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
purpose for the point it is but let's

00:04:45.770 --> 00:05:01.649 
purpose for the point it is but let's
fix<00:04:46.039> it<00:04:48.819> wet<00:04:49.819> cloth<00:04:51.879> nice<00:04:52.960> wet<00:04:53.960> cloth<00:04:56.710> nice<00:04:58.389> dry

00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:01.659 

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:07.120 

dry

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.700 

done<00:05:07.760> and<00:05:08.060> of<00:05:08.660> course<00:05:08.930> we<00:05:09.140> can<00:05:09.290> do<00:05:09.410> the<00:05:09.560> back

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
done and of course we can do the back

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:21.220 
done and of course we can do the back
elements<00:05:10.310> as<00:05:10.460> well<00:05:10.640> wet<00:05:13.120> wet<00:05:18.790> right<00:05:19.790> and<00:05:20.300> be

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 
elements as well wet wet right and be

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.470 
elements as well wet wet right and be
careful<00:05:21.590> to<00:05:21.650> get<00:05:21.890> the<00:05:22.220> residue<00:05:22.760> off<00:05:22.790> but<00:05:23.210> this

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480 
careful to get the residue off but this

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.530 
careful to get the residue off but this
is<00:05:23.660> like<00:05:23.990> bone<00:05:24.470> dry<00:05:24.890> this<00:05:24.950> cloth<00:05:25.520> it<00:05:25.730> sucks<00:05:26.240> any

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
is like bone dry this cloth it sucks any

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.990 
is like bone dry this cloth it sucks any
moisture<00:05:27.020> to<00:05:27.170> it<00:05:27.200> so<00:05:27.560> I've<00:05:27.800> never<00:05:28.640> had<00:05:28.880> an

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
moisture to it so I've never had an

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.400 
moisture to it so I've never had an
incident<00:05:29.150> where<00:05:29.630> I've<00:05:29.750> missed<00:05:30.020> a<00:05:30.170> bit<00:05:30.290> of

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
incident where I've missed a bit of

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.290 
incident where I've missed a bit of
moisture<00:05:30.560> on<00:05:30.950> them<00:05:31.130> it<00:05:31.280> just<00:05:31.310> it<00:05:31.790> does<00:05:32.000> it<00:05:32.150> so

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
moisture on them it just it does it so

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.730 
moisture on them it just it does it so
easily<00:05:32.690> just<00:05:32.870> make<00:05:32.930> sure<00:05:33.230> you<00:05:33.350> cover<00:05:33.560> the

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
easily just make sure you cover the

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.160 
easily just make sure you cover the
whole<00:05:33.770> surface<00:05:34.400> of<00:05:34.520> the<00:05:34.640> lens<00:05:34.840> same<00:05:35.840> with<00:05:36.020> the

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.170 
whole surface of the lens same with the
