whatever substrate using so you can see

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.160 
whatever substrate using so you can see
definitely<00:01:53.310> more<00:01:53.700> than<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.060> but<00:01:54.450> I'll<00:01:55.020> give

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.589 
driftwood into that tin Jana I'm
probably<00:02:57.810> gonna<00:02:57.989> do<00:02:58.200> some<00:02:58.409> of<00:02:58.440> this<00:02:59.299> the<00:03:00.299> java

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
probably gonna do some of this the java

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.819 
probably gonna do some of this the java
