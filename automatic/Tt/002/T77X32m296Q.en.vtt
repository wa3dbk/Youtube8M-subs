00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
that I'm seeing I wanted to kind of go

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.700 
that I'm seeing I wanted to kind of go
through<00:00:33.780> each<00:00:33.899> one<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:34.140> them<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.530> talk<00:00:34.680> about

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
through each one of them and talk about

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.709 
through each one of them and talk about
them<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.250> see<00:00:35.430> how<00:00:35.460> they're<00:00:35.700> similar<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.300> see

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
them things that might be changing and

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.100 
them things that might be changing and
everything<00:00:39.030> like<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.510> let's<00:00:39.780> start<00:00:39.989> off

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
everything like that so let's start off

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.930 
everything like that so let's start off
with<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.290> reflex<00:00:40.739> attachment<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.670> seems

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
with the reflex attachment that seems

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.209 
with the reflex attachment that seems
like<00:00:42.090> pretty<00:00:42.149> much<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.719> red<00:00:43.050> dot<00:00:43.290> your<00:00:43.829> basic

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
like pretty much a red dot your basic

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.760 
like pretty much a red dot your basic
red<00:00:44.460> dot<00:00:44.700> ACOG<00:00:45.600> that's<00:00:46.050> pretty<00:00:46.320> much<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.500> same

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
red dot ACOG that's pretty much the same

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.170 
red dot ACOG that's pretty much the same
thing<00:00:46.980> that<00:00:47.100> we've<00:00:47.250> seen<00:00:47.489> before<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:48.059> know

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
thing that we've seen before you know

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.750 
thing that we've seen before you know
you<00:00:48.270> get<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.719> increased<00:00:49.350> distance<00:00:50.219> where

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
you get that increased distance where

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.610 
you get that increased distance where
you<00:00:50.879> can<00:00:51.059> see<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.510> little<00:00:51.930> bit<00:00:52.020> more<00:00:52.170> accuracy

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
you can see a little bit more accuracy

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.700 
you can see a little bit more accuracy
but<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:54.059> know<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.329> costs<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.899> in<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.320> aiming

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
but you know it costs you in the aiming

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.770 
but you know it costs you in the aiming
down<00:00:55.860> sights<00:00:55.920> department<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.879> know<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.059> aim

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
down sights department you know you aim

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.779 
down sights department you know you aim
a<00:00:57.809> little<00:00:58.079> bit<00:00:58.289> slower<00:00:58.620> target<00:00:59.370> finder<00:00:59.550> that

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
a little bit slower target finder that

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.549 
a little bit slower target finder that
seems<00:01:00.059> like<00:01:00.300> said<00:01:00.570> something<00:01:00.750> new<00:01:01.079> I<00:01:01.289> kind<00:01:01.500> of

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
seems like said something new I kind of

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.709 
seems like said something new I kind of
thought<00:01:01.710> at<00:01:01.890> first<00:01:02.129> baby<00:01:02.430> monitor<00:01:02.969> but<00:01:03.510> this

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
thought at first baby monitor but this

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.570 
thought at first baby monitor but this
thing<00:01:03.899> actually<00:01:04.110> highlights<00:01:04.799> enemies<00:01:05.369> and

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
thing actually highlights enemies and

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.010 
thing actually highlights enemies and
everything<00:01:05.880> like<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.330> red<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.930> know

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
everything like that in red you know

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.570 
everything like that in red you know
kind<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.290> puts<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.590> red<00:01:07.860> triangle<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.400> think

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
kind of puts that red triangle I think

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.550 
kind of puts that red triangle I think
we<00:01:08.670> saw<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:09.030> in<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.299> multiplayer<00:01:09.869> preview

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
we saw that in the multiplayer preview

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.380 
we saw that in the multiplayer preview
and<00:01:10.710> everything<00:01:10.950> like<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.100> hybrid<00:01:12.030> optic

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
and everything like that hybrid optic

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.730 
and everything like that hybrid optic
that's<00:01:12.600> pretty<00:01:12.810> similar<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.200> what<00:01:13.409> we've<00:01:13.560> seen

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
that's pretty similar to what we've seen

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.380 
that's pretty similar to what we've seen
in<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.920> past<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.369> kind<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.880> cross<00:01:15.330> between

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
in the past is kind of a cross between

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.950 
in the past is kind of a cross between
the<00:01:15.960> red<00:01:16.200> dot<00:01:16.439> or<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.770> reflex<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.490> ACOG

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
the red dot or the reflex and the ACOG

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.359 
the red dot or the reflex and the ACOG
suppressor<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.200> know<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.040> use<00:01:20.340> that

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
suppressor you know and you use that

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.580 
suppressor you know and you use that
before<00:01:21.000> basically<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.900> don't<00:01:22.020> show<00:01:22.290> up<00:01:22.409> on

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
before basically you don't show up on

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.740 
before basically you don't show up on
the<00:01:22.860> minimap<00:01:22.979> when<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:23.880> shoot<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.180> gun<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.570> you

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
the minimap when you shoot a gun and you

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.420 
the minimap when you shoot a gun and you
lose<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.990> little<00:01:25.259> bit<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.470> damage<00:01:25.770> at<00:01:26.220> a

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
lose a little bit of damage at a

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.420 
lose a little bit of damage at a
particular<00:01:26.970> range<00:01:27.540> fast<00:01:28.409> mag<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:29.100> seems

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
particular range fast mag that seems

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.609 
particular range fast mag that seems
like<00:01:29.579> it's<00:01:29.850> kind<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.600> know<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:31.049> little<00:01:31.470> bit

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
like it's kind of you know a little bit

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.929 
like it's kind of you know a little bit
of<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.890> replacement<00:01:32.490> for<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.670> sleight-of-hand

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
of a replacement for a sleight-of-hand

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.030 
of a replacement for a sleight-of-hand
not<00:01:33.450> quite<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.930> know<00:01:33.960> full<00:01:34.350> but<00:01:34.619> you're<00:01:34.770> just

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
to have better accuracy but there's also

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.730 
to have better accuracy but there's also
going<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.850> be<00:01:50.939> this<00:01:51.240> laser<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.840> shines<00:01:52.500> out

have adjustable stock this is kind of

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.139 
have adjustable stock this is kind of
like<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.770> when<00:02:08.250> you're<00:02:08.399> aiming<00:02:08.789> down<00:02:08.940> your

site and you move faster I think we saw
that<00:02:11.700> as<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.690> stalker

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740

and kind of like a thermal hybrid kind

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.390 
and kind of like a thermal hybrid kind
of<00:03:47.970> type<00:03:48.180> thing<00:03:48.510> rapid<00:03:49.470> fire<00:03:49.680> that's<00:03:50.160> going<00:03:50.310> to

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
of type thing rapid fire that's going to

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.340 
of type thing rapid fire that's going to
allow<00:03:50.490> you<00:03:50.580> to<00:03:50.760> pull<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.270> trigger<00:03:51.300> faster<00:03:52.020> so

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
I think it adds twenty percent or

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.640 
I think it adds twenty percent or
decreases<00:03:54.780> you<00:03:54.990> know<00:03:55.020> the<00:03:55.230> time<00:03:55.440> in<00:03:55.620> between

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
decreases you know the time in between

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.890 
decreases you know the time in between
you<00:03:56.070> can<00:03:56.220> pull<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.700> trigger<00:03:56.910> twenty<00:03:57.570> percent

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
you can pull the trigger twenty percent

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.020 
you can pull the trigger twenty percent
long<00:03:58.650> barrel<00:03:59.010> that's<00:03:59.280> kind<00:03:59.610> of<00:03:59.640> like<00:03:59.820> your
