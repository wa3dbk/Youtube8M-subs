00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:38.419 
I don't know it's a food for thought me

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:40.509 
I don't know it's a food for thought me
of<00:03:39.199> course<00:03:39.470> wishful<00:03:39.799> thinking<00:03:40.040> I<00:03:40.159> wish<00:03:40.370> they

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
of course wishful thinking I wish they

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:41.949 
of course wishful thinking I wish they
would<00:03:40.669> go<00:03:40.819> back<00:03:41.000> to<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.239> World<00:03:41.449> War<00:03:41.750> two

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
would go back to the World War two

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.439 
would go back to the World War two
settings<00:03:42.349> but<00:03:42.949> as<00:03:43.549> most<00:03:43.879> people<00:03:44.120> know<00:03:44.150> it's

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:44.449 
settings but as most people know it's

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:46.300 
settings but as most people know it's
kind<00:03:44.629> of<00:03:44.690> hard<00:03:44.750> to<00:03:45.019> you<00:03:45.470> know<00:03:45.590> start<00:03:45.889> off<00:03:46.040> and

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
kind of hard to you know start off and

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.309 
kind of hard to you know start off and
progress<00:03:46.760> and<00:03:47.030> then<00:03:47.239> digress<00:03:47.659> it's<00:03:47.810> a<00:03:47.900> stupid

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
progress and then digress it's a stupid

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.430 
progress and then digress it's a stupid
so<00:03:49.040> I<00:03:49.220> think<00:03:49.280> you<00:03:49.790> know<00:03:49.940> they<00:03:50.750> might<00:03:51.049> move

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
so I think you know they might move

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.689 
so I think you know they might move
forward<00:03:51.650> with<00:03:51.889> this<00:03:52.040> so<00:03:52.190> it's<00:03:52.370> I<00:03:52.519> don't<00:03:52.639> know

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:52.699 
forward with this so it's I don't know

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:54.309 
forward with this so it's I don't know
it's<00:03:52.849> really<00:03:52.909> hard<00:03:53.239> to<00:03:53.419> say<00:03:53.569> because<00:03:53.720> you<00:03:54.199> have

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
it's really hard to say because you have

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:55.689 
it's really hard to say because you have
three<00:03:54.500> dozen<00:03:54.650> development<00:03:55.310> teams<00:03:55.489> and<00:03:55.639> they

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:55.699 
three dozen development teams and they

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:57.580 
three dozen development teams and they
all<00:03:55.819> have<00:03:55.970> to<00:03:56.150> own<00:03:56.599> three<00:03:56.959> different<00:03:57.319> thought

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
all have to own three different thought

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.379 
all have to own three different thought
processes<00:03:58.099> and<00:03:58.250> they<00:03:58.489> still<00:03:58.760> have<00:03:58.909> to<00:03:59.030> keep<00:03:59.180> it

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.389 
processes and they still have to keep it

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:01.509 
processes and they still have to keep it
in<00:03:59.479> one<00:04:00.079> cohesive<00:04:00.349> game<00:04:00.889> and<00:04:01.129> make<00:04:01.250> it<00:04:01.400> you

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
in one cohesive game and make it you

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.240 
in one cohesive game and make it you
