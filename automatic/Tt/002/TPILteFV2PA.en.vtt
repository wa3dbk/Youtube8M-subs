old hard drive this is a conventional
hard<00:00:50.340> drive<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:50.820> have<00:00:51.059> motor<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:52.500> have<00:00:52.620> a

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
hard drive so you have motor you have a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.500 
hard drive so you have motor you have a
platter<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.250> has<00:00:53.430> all<00:00:53.610> your<00:00:53.730> data<00:00:53.940> on<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.360> and

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
platter that has all your data on it and

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.240 
platter that has all your data on it and
it<00:00:54.600> has<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> head<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.289> what<00:00:55.379> has<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.680> do<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:55.949> spin

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
it has a head and what has to do is spin

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.119 
it has a head and what has to do is spin
up<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.399> motor<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:57.360> 7200<00:00:58.109> rpm<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.739> head<00:00:58.920> has<00:00:59.100> to

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
up the motor to 7200 rpm the head has to

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.400 
up the motor to 7200 rpm the head has to
access<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.910> data<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.480> that's<00:01:01.140> how<00:01:01.379> a

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
access the data and that's how a

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.709 
access the data and that's how a
conventional<00:01:02.070> hard<00:01:02.280> drive<00:01:02.550> works<00:01:03.030> problem

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
conventional hard drive works problem

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.810 
conventional hard drive works problem
with<00:01:03.809> conventional<00:01:04.290> hard<00:01:04.530> drives<00:01:04.820> they're

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
with conventional hard drives they're

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.450 
with conventional hard drives they're
not<00:01:06.119> as<00:01:06.330> fast<00:01:06.600> as<00:01:06.900> solid-state<00:01:07.500> anywhere<00:01:08.189> near

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
not as fast as solid-state anywhere near

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.330 
not as fast as solid-state anywhere near
it<00:01:08.490> they're<00:01:09.500> susceptible<00:01:10.500> if<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.070> could<00:01:11.220> say

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
it they're susceptible if I could say

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.660 
it they're susceptible if I could say
that<00:01:11.369> word<00:01:11.670> today<00:01:11.850> susceptible<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.560> shock<00:01:14.340> so

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
that word today susceptible to shock so

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.609 
that word today susceptible to shock so
if<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.880> have<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.330> laptop<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.200> hard

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
damage the hard drive that's how you

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.649

computers<00:04:04.100> were<00:04:04.370> slow<00:04:04.730> and<00:04:04.970> they<00:04:05.360> used<00:04:05.570> to<00:04:05.660> be

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
computers were slow and they used to be

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.360 
computers were slow and they used to be
the<00:04:05.870> bottleneck<00:04:06.200> of<00:04:06.410> conventional<00:04:07.160> hard

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
the bottleneck of conventional hard

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.000 
the bottleneck of conventional hard
drives<00:04:07.640> now<00:04:07.989> conventional<00:04:08.989> hard<00:04:09.470> drives<00:04:09.770> are

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
drives now conventional hard drives are

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.430 
drives now conventional hard drives are
the<00:04:10.430> bottlenecks<00:04:10.820> of<00:04:11.239> computers<00:04:11.930> it's

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
the bottlenecks of computers it's

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.130 
the bottlenecks of computers it's
amazing<00:04:12.620> how<00:04:13.120> technology<00:04:14.120> changes<00:04:14.660> and<00:04:14.900> times

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
amazing how technology changes and times

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.380 
amazing how technology changes and times

now<00:04:18.230> you<00:04:18.290> know<00:04:18.650> what<00:04:19.010> the<00:04:19.130> benefit<00:04:19.580> of<00:04:19.729> having

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
now you know what the benefit of having

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.740 
now you know what the benefit of having
a<00:04:20.630> solid<00:04:21.200> state<00:04:21.410> drive<00:04:21.650> is<00:04:21.830> right<00:04:22.789> now<00:04:23.000> my

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
a solid state drive is right now my

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.060 
a solid state drive is right now my
other<00:04:23.780> hard<00:04:24.229> drive<00:04:24.260> would<00:04:24.530> still<00:04:24.800> be

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
other hard drive would still be

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.370 
other hard drive would still be
loading<00:04:25.340> I'm<00:04:25.940> not<00:04:26.210> kidding<00:04:26.570> have<00:04:26.990> a<00:04:27.080> good<00:04:27.260> one

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
loading I'm not kidding have a good one

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.440
