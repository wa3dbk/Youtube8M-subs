00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
look like and you can see how big be the

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.849 
look like and you can see how big be the
belly<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.740> there<00:00:27.380> so<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.410> don't<00:00:28.500> think<00:00:28.740> it's

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
belly is there so I don't think it's

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.820 
belly is there so I don't think it's
because<00:00:29.070> it's<00:00:29.689> because<00:00:30.689> it's<00:00:30.840> fat<00:00:31.170> bloated<00:00:31.470> or

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
because it's because it's fat bloated or

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.430 
because it's because it's fat bloated or
something<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.870> must<00:00:33.870> be<00:00:33.960> frightened

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
something it just must be frightened

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.049 
something it just must be frightened
because<00:00:34.860> I've<00:00:35.130> happened<00:00:35.399> for<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> few<00:00:35.790> months

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
because I've happened for a few months

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.330 
because I've happened for a few months
and<00:00:37.340> it<00:00:39.290> it<00:00:40.290> wouldn't<00:00:40.559> make<00:00:40.649> sense<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:41.070> mean<00:00:41.129> it

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
and it it wouldn't make sense I mean it

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.819 
and it it wouldn't make sense I mean it
would<00:00:41.460> make<00:00:41.579> sense<00:00:41.790> if<00:00:42.120> they're<00:00:42.829> breeding

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
would make sense if they're breeding

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.340 
would make sense if they're breeding
because<00:00:44.460> there's<00:00:44.820> six<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.050> obviously

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
because there's six and so obviously

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.160 
because there's six and so obviously
there's<00:00:46.620> probably<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.879> males<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.450> females

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.709 

but<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.230> do<00:00:52.800> not<00:00:53.039> know<00:00:53.420> anything<00:00:54.420> about

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
but I do not know anything about

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.590 
but I do not know anything about
breeding<00:00:56.930> tetras<00:00:57.930> cuz<00:00:59.210> these<00:01:00.210> are<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> first

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
breeding tetras cuz these are the first

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.080 
breeding tetras cuz these are the first
touch-ups<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.109> had<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.559> strictly<00:01:02.090> these

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
touch-ups I had this is strictly these

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.260 
touch-ups I had this is strictly these
are<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.270> first<00:01:03.480> tetras<00:01:03.899> I've<00:01:04.019> ever<00:01:04.229> had

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
are the first tetras I've ever had

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.429 
are the first tetras I've ever had
actually<00:01:06.270> no<00:01:06.360> they're<00:01:06.510> not<00:01:06.600> but<00:01:06.840> they're<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
actually no they're not but they're the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.950 
actually no they're not but they're the
first<00:01:08.210> small<00:01:09.210> ones<00:01:09.860> but<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:11.070> think<00:01:11.369> you<00:01:11.520> have<00:01:11.580> to

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
first small ones but I think you have to

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.240 
first small ones but I think you have to
if<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.290> were<00:01:13.380> going<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.619> planning<00:01:14.159> on

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
if you were going to planning on

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.770 
if you were going to planning on
breeding<00:01:14.549> them<00:01:14.700> then<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.030> put<00:01:15.270> like<00:01:15.509> blood

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
breeding them then you put like blood

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.730 
breeding them then you put like blood
runs<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.280> put<00:01:17.280> them<00:01:17.400> into<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.670> new<00:01:17.820> tank<00:01:18.740> then

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
runs in put them into a new tank then

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.320 
runs in put them into a new tank then
separate<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.310> babies<00:01:20.640> from<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.850> arrows<00:01:21.090> when

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
separate the babies from the arrows when

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.980 
separate the babies from the arrows when
they're<00:01:21.540> when<00:01:22.200> they've<00:01:22.939> given<00:01:23.939> birth<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.570> set

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
they're when they've given birth and set

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.440 
they're when they've given birth and set
it<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.110> separate<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.590> fry<00:01:27.200> but<00:01:28.200> um<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:29.450> don't

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
it to separate the fry but um I don't

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.999 
it to separate the fry but um I don't
have<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> spare<00:01:30.869> tank<00:01:33.200> so<00:01:34.200> I'm<00:01:34.259> probably<00:01:34.409> just<00:01:34.650> I

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
have a spare tank so I'm probably just I

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.100 
have a spare tank so I'm probably just I
don't<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.549> don't<00:01:35.640> know<00:01:35.880> if<00:01:35.939> they<00:01:36.119> if<00:01:36.750> they<00:01:36.960> eat

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
don't I don't know if they if they eat

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.859 
don't I don't know if they if they eat
their<00:01:37.320> babies<00:01:37.439> they'd<00:01:37.799> probably<00:01:37.950> do<00:01:40.430> but

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
their babies they'd probably do but

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.330 
their babies they'd probably do but
there<00:01:42.869> are<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.049> lot<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.290> hiding<00:01:43.649> spaces<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.220> the

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
there are a lot of hiding spaces in the

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.830 
there are a lot of hiding spaces in the
Indus<00:01:44.939> thankfully<00:01:45.329> if<00:01:45.390> they<00:01:45.479> could<00:01:45.630> harden

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
Indus thankfully if they could harden

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.819 
Indus thankfully if they could harden
the<00:01:46.020> leaves<00:01:46.320> if<00:01:46.590> if<00:01:47.490> they<00:01:47.790> made<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.000> or<00:01:48.960> there

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
the leaves if if they made it or there

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:56.980 
the leaves if if they made it or there
are<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.189> many<00:01:50.399> occasions<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.840> wood<00:01:52.220> yeah

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.740 

see<00:01:57.990> ya<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.500> don't<00:01:58.770> think<00:01:59.010> anyone<00:01:59.750> watching

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
see ya I don't think anyone watching

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.420 
see ya I don't think anyone watching
this<00:02:00.870> is<00:02:01.110> actually<00:02:01.409> got<00:02:01.650> any<00:02:01.830> other<00:02:01.950> tetris

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
this is actually got any other tetris

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.240 
this is actually got any other tetris
but<00:02:03.260> let<00:02:04.260> me<00:02:04.409> know<00:02:04.530> if<00:02:04.650> you<00:02:04.740> do<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.070> if<00:02:05.220> you

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.990 
similar tetras like this cuz it'd be
nice<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:13.050> wasn't<00:02:13.260> frying<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:13.800> and<00:02:14.010> then

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
and it's kind of fun what she can't grow
