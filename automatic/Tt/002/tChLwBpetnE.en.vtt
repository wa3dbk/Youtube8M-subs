 Chatter is a very useful addon. the first point is the WARNS. 

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:13.331
 Whenever someone speaks a specific word in any chat, 

00:00:14.925 --> 00:00:22.301
 you can configure it to warn you, visually or sonorously. 

00:00:22.845 --> 00:00:28.816
 In my case, whenever they speak cuh or cullen, the WARN appears with the phrase. 

00:00:29.212 --> 00:00:37.383
 I set up for the exit to be like Raid Warn 

00:01:34.245 --> 00:01:39.167
 You can add multiple words. 

00:01:40.783 --> 00:01:48.114
 In this acount, I also added the words Bela, yoga. 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:26.720
 By default, if they speak the full name of your char, it appears in WARN, and with &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; in the tips 

00:03:07.945 --> 00:03:13.569
 By default the chatter uses this ugly edge, which only kisa likes. 

00:03:14.808 --> 00:03:19.071
 Here you take her. 

00:03:27.465 --> 00:03:34.770
 Here, in Highlights, is where we add words "warns" 

00:03:33.938 --> 00:03:41.783
 To add, just type and click Okay 

00:03:51.038 --> 00:03:55.025
 And in Output where we choose the output method. 14 00: 03: 56,350 -&gt; 00: 00: 00,000 My, it's marked as Raid Warning
