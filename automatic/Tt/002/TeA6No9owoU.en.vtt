the system can't wait to see
this<00:06:21.110> takes<00:06:21.470> me<00:06:21.699> this<00:06:22.699> boxes<00:06:23.120> like<00:06:23.750> I<00:06:23.810> said

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
this takes me this boxes like I said

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.480 
this takes me this boxes like I said
probably<00:06:24.199> only<00:06:24.349> temporary<00:06:24.889> okay<00:06:27.280> get<00:06:28.280> a<00:06:28.310> new

probably only temporary okay get a new

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.770 
probably only temporary okay get a new
box<00:06:28.669> in<00:06:28.879> here<00:06:29.030> probably<00:06:29.180> gonna<00:06:29.449> be<00:06:29.569> somewhere

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
box in here probably gonna be somewhere

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:31.809 
box in here probably gonna be somewhere
around<00:06:29.870> 16<00:06:30.319> cubes<00:06:30.650> after<00:06:31.009> driving

00:06:31.809 --> 00:06:31.819 
around 16 cubes after driving

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:35.619 
around 16 cubes after driving
displacement<00:06:32.389> and<00:06:32.629> poor<00:06:33.319> volume<00:06:34.539> that'll<00:06:35.539> be

00:06:35.619 --> 00:06:35.629 
displacement and poor volume that'll be

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:38.920 
displacement and poor volume that'll be
nice<00:06:35.780> and<00:06:35.990> fun<00:06:36.169> to<00:06:36.770> try<00:06:36.949> to<00:06:37.009> build<00:06:37.750> totally<00:06:38.750> be
