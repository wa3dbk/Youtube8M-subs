00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:26.040 
use the cable sort of like a crochet
hook<00:02:21.220> push<00:02:22.150> it<00:02:22.360> through<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.840> grommets<00:02:24.810> use<00:02:25.810> it

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
hook push it through the grommets use it

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.240 
hook push it through the grommets use it
to<00:02:26.170> pick<00:02:26.410> up<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.770> loop

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.300 

and<00:02:29.930> then<00:02:30.930> feed<00:02:31.290> it<00:02:31.470> back<00:02:31.860> through<00:02:32.280> the

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
and then feed it back through the

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.000 
and then feed it back through the
grommets<00:02:32.880> you<00:02:33.120> came<00:02:33.630> through<00:02:33.930> pulling<00:02:34.770> the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
grommets you came through pulling the

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:47.210 
grommets you came through pulling the
loop<00:02:35.220> with<00:02:35.520> it<00:02:44.690> keep<00:02:45.690> going<00:02:46.140> you'll<00:02:46.860> notice

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
loop with it keep going you'll notice

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.360 
loop with it keep going you'll notice
there<00:02:47.490> between<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.800> middle<00:02:49.800> two<00:02:50.040> loops

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
there between the middle two loops

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.210 
there between the middle two loops
there's<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.180> belt<00:02:51.540> loop<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:52.350> feed<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.830> cable

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
there's a belt loop to feed the cable

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.280 
there's a belt loop to feed the cable
through<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:53.820> it<00:02:53.940> doesn't<00:02:54.420> protrude<00:02:54.810> out<00:02:55.080> the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
through so it doesn't protrude out the

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
through so it doesn't protrude out the
bottom<00:03:02.810> they<00:03:03.810> all<00:03:04.080> work<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.500> same<00:03:04.740> way

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.709 

sometimes<00:03:14.310> you<00:03:14.489> can<00:03:14.640> use<00:03:14.670> a<00:03:14.819> combination<00:03:15.329> of

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:15.719 
sometimes you can use a combination of

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:17.539 
sometimes you can use a combination of
pushing<00:03:16.379> the<00:03:16.500> loop<00:03:16.680> through<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.129> grommets

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
pushing the loop through the grommets

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.819 
pushing the loop through the grommets
like<00:03:18.420> here<00:03:18.689> we're<00:03:18.870> doing<00:03:19.170> it<00:03:19.290> through<00:03:19.319> the<00:03:19.620> two

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
like here we're doing it through the two

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.899 
like here we're doing it through the two
outside<00:03:20.370> grommets<00:03:21.269> forming<00:03:21.689> the<00:03:21.810> pleat<00:03:22.079> and

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:22.909 
outside grommets forming the pleat and

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:26.839 
outside grommets forming the pleat and
then<00:03:23.909> I'm<00:03:24.090> going<00:03:24.239> to<00:03:24.329> use<00:03:24.629> the<00:03:25.340> cable<00:03:26.340> like<00:03:26.670> my

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
then I'm going to use the cable like my

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.970 
then I'm going to use the cable like my
crochet<00:03:27.120> hook<00:03:27.359> going<00:03:27.959> through<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.469> inside

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
crochet hook going through the inside

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.729 
crochet hook going through the inside
grommet<00:03:29.489> and<00:03:30.030> picking<00:03:30.510> up<00:03:33.349> when<00:03:34.349> you've<00:03:34.500> done

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
grommet and picking up when you've done

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.280 
grommet and picking up when you've done
the<00:03:35.010> last<00:03:35.280> loop<00:03:35.819> and<00:03:36.180> pulled<00:03:36.780> it<00:03:36.930> through<00:03:37.139> the

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
the last loop and pulled it through the

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.649 
the last loop and pulled it through the
inside<00:03:37.709> grommet<00:03:38.219> if<00:03:38.760> you<00:03:38.879> want<00:03:39.060> to<00:03:39.150> tuck<00:03:39.389> the

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659 
inside grommet if you want to tuck the

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.190 
inside grommet if you want to tuck the
tail<00:03:39.870> into<00:03:40.139> the<00:03:40.319> cable<00:03:40.739> up<00:03:41.340> in<00:03:41.639> under<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.900> vest

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
tail into the cable up in under the vest

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.550 
tail into the cable up in under the vest
now<00:03:43.879> you'll<00:03:44.879> go<00:03:45.239> over<00:03:45.299> and<00:03:45.629> finish<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.230> other

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
now you'll go over and finish the other

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.819 
now you'll go over and finish the other
pocket<00:03:46.859> in<00:03:47.189> the<00:03:47.310> same<00:03:47.579> manner<00:03:48.620> not<00:03:49.620> too

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
pocket in the same manner not too

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:54.079 
pocket in the same manner not too
difficult<00:03:50.099> little<00:03:50.849> tedious<00:03:51.030> but<00:03:51.480> easy<00:03:51.689> to<00:03:51.840> do
