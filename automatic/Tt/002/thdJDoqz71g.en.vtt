let's<00:03:36.340> first<00:03:36.610> check<00:03:36.820> the<00:03:36.970> camera<00:03:37.510> she<00:03:37.780> will

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
let's first check the camera she will

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.170 
let's first check the camera she will
notice<00:03:38.260> it<00:03:38.470> has<00:03:38.500> the<00:03:38.770> stock<00:03:39.220> camera<00:03:39.490> app<00:03:39.670> which

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
notice it has the stock camera app which

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.360 
notice it has the stock camera app which
has<00:03:40.420> the<00:03:40.600> two<00:03:40.780> buttons<00:03:41.170> for<00:03:41.410> capturing<00:03:41.860> photo

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
has the two buttons for capturing photo

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.090 
has the two buttons for capturing photo
and<00:03:42.670> video<00:03:42.940> so<00:03:43.660> this<00:03:43.870> is<00:03:44.020> the<00:03:44.170> initial<00:03:44.440> test<00:03:44.860> so

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
and video so this is the initial test so

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.130 
and video so this is the initial test so
I<00:03:45.130> will<00:03:45.400> give<00:03:45.700> further<00:03:46.090> videos<00:03:46.510> on<00:03:46.720> my<00:03:46.870> full

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
I will give further videos on my full

and has a thin bezel on the side holding
on<00:04:10.300> one<00:04:10.540> hand<00:04:10.840> is<00:04:11.020> really<00:04:11.230> comfortable<00:04:11.770> the

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
on one hand is really comfortable the

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.340 
on one hand is really comfortable the
plastic<00:04:12.700> feels<00:04:12.970> really<00:04:13.420> premium<00:04:13.720> build<00:04:14.080> and

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
plastic feels really premium build and

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.830 
plastic feels really premium build and
solid<00:04:14.860> and<00:04:15.130> also<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:15.550> same<00:04:15.760> glossy<00:04:16.270> look<00:04:16.690> of

solid and also the same glossy look of

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.660 
solid and also the same glossy look of
the<00:04:16.959> plastic<00:04:17.440> is<00:04:17.709> really<00:04:17.770> good

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
the plastic is really good

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.160 
the plastic is really good
but<00:04:18.790> on<00:04:18.940> the<00:04:19.030> side<00:04:19.209> comment<00:04:19.630> I<00:04:19.720> find<00:04:19.930> it<00:04:20.020> a<00:04:20.140> bit

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
but on the side comment I find it a bit

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.740 
but on the side comment I find it a bit
thick<00:04:20.560> comparing<00:04:21.160> to<00:04:21.280> other<00:04:21.489> UHD<00:04:22.210> phones<00:04:22.419> but

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
thick comparing to other UHD phones but

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.960 
thick comparing to other UHD phones but
other<00:04:23.080> than<00:04:23.260> that<00:04:23.500> so<00:04:23.800> far<00:04:23.830> this<00:04:24.430> is<00:04:24.610> really

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
other than that so far this is really

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:25.970 
other than that so far this is really
premium

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
premium

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.740 
premium
as<00:04:26.130> you<00:04:26.280> can<00:04:26.370> see<00:04:26.580> navigating<00:04:27.150> and<00:04:27.300> scrolling

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
as you can see navigating and scrolling

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.260 
as you can see navigating and scrolling
is<00:04:27.840> pretty<00:04:28.080> smooth<00:04:28.440> and<00:04:28.770> no<00:04:29.220> ghosting<00:04:29.760> so<00:04:30.000> far

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
is pretty smooth and no ghosting so far

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.820 
is pretty smooth and no ghosting so far
for<00:04:30.660> my<00:04:30.810> initial<00:04:31.140> impression<00:04:31.590> I<00:04:31.680> also

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
for my initial impression I also

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.950 
for my initial impression I also
included<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.640> benchmark<00:04:33.180> but<00:04:33.510> of<00:04:33.660> course

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
included the benchmark but of course

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.170 
included the benchmark but of course
full<00:04:34.320> detail<00:04:34.650> on<00:04:34.860> my<00:04:35.100> review<00:04:35.550> on<00:04:35.670> my<00:04:35.700> next

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
full detail on my review on my next

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.150 
full detail on my review on my next
video<00:04:36.420> or<00:04:36.660> the<00:04:36.810> antutu<00:04:37.080> it<00:04:37.470> resulted<00:04:37.980> to

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
video or the antutu it resulted to

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.890 
video or the antutu it resulted to
thirteen<00:04:38.520> thousand<00:04:38.970> six<00:04:39.180> hundred<00:04:39.300> forty<00:04:39.660> six

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
thirteen thousand six hundred forty six

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.850 
thirteen thousand six hundred forty six
and<00:04:40.230> forty<00:04:40.560> quadrant<00:04:41.070> it's<00:04:41.310> around<00:04:42.260> 4203<00:04:43.260> with

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
and forty quadrant it's around 4203 with

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.430 
and forty quadrant it's around 4203 with
a<00:04:43.890> very<00:04:44.280> impressive<00:04:44.610> refresh<00:04:45.330> rate<00:04:45.570> of<00:04:45.840> six<00:04:46.290> to

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
a very impressive refresh rate of six to

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.410 
a very impressive refresh rate of six to
eight<00:04:46.560> point<00:04:46.860> seventy<00:04:47.430> six<00:04:47.640> which<00:04:48.120> i<00:04:48.360> think

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
eight point seventy six which i think

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.900 
eight point seventy six which i think
will<00:04:48.930> really<00:04:49.170> be<00:04:49.470> promising<00:04:50.010> for<00:04:50.220> gaming<00:04:50.610> so

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
will really be promising for gaming so

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.970 
will really be promising for gaming so
stay<00:04:51.240> tuned<00:04:51.600> and<00:04:51.780> give<00:04:52.020> a<00:04:52.050> thumbs<00:04:52.140> up<00:04:52.500> if<00:04:52.710> you

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:52.980 
stay tuned and give a thumbs up if you

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.130 
stay tuned and give a thumbs up if you
want<00:04:53.190> me<00:04:53.430> to<00:04:53.460> have<00:04:53.850> a<00:04:53.880> separate<00:04:54.390> video<00:04:54.630> just

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140 
want me to have a separate video just

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.320 
want me to have a separate video just
for<00:04:55.230> the<00:04:55.470> gaming<00:04:55.740> experience<00:04:55.980> and<00:04:56.790> for<00:04:57.180> the

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
for the gaming experience and for the

this is very smooth fluid and the UI is
pretty<00:05:09.150> impressive<00:05:09.540> the<00:05:10.080> transitions<00:05:10.920> are

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
pretty impressive the transitions are

smooth and the build of the phone for me

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.040 
smooth and the build of the phone for me
it's<00:05:13.860> really<00:05:14.100> premium<00:05:14.460> build<00:05:14.910> but<00:05:15.480> I<00:05:15.690> notice

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
it's really premium build but I notice

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.110 
it's really premium build but I notice
it<00:05:16.200> doesn't<00:05:16.440> have<00:05:16.620> a<00:05:16.770> LED<00:05:17.040> notification<00:05:17.220> which

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
it doesn't have a LED notification which

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.720 
it doesn't have a LED notification which
may<00:05:18.420> add<00:05:18.690> some<00:05:19.050> perks<00:05:19.380> if<00:05:19.620> they<00:05:19.980> have<00:05:20.160> that<00:05:20.340> but
