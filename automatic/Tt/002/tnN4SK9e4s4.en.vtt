then you're gonna want to hold page up
which<00:00:53.969> raises<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.570> object<00:00:55.140> now<00:00:55.530> many<00:00:55.680> people

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
which raises the object now many people

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.799 
which raises the object now many people
are<00:00:56.070> aware<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.520> all<00:00:57.329> right<00:00:57.390> you're<00:00:57.719> gonna

raise to the top as much as you can and
then<00:01:00.690> you'll<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:00.899> do<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.350> same<00:01:01.559> thing<00:01:01.620> stack

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
then you'll just do the same thing stack

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.780 
then you'll just do the same thing stack
it<00:01:02.309> up<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:03.350> form<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.650> second<00:01:05.220> layer<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
it up and form the second layer of the

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.690 
it up and form the second layer of the
wall<00:01:06.030> think<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.020> as<00:01:07.229> laying<00:01:07.560> bricks<00:01:07.950> to

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
wall think of this as laying bricks to

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.060 
wall think of this as laying bricks to
form<00:01:09.030> your<00:01:09.210> tunnel<00:01:09.530> you<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.560> do<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:10.890> with

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
form your tunnel you can do this with

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.670 
form your tunnel you can do this with
rocks<00:01:11.400> but<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.240> lot<00:01:12.540> harder<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:13.439> way

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
rocks but it is a lot harder this way

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.469 
rocks but it is a lot harder this way
seems<00:01:13.979> pretty<00:01:14.189> cool<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.729> mean<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.030> can<00:01:15.150> get

seems pretty cool I mean you can get
some<00:01:15.659> pretty<00:01:15.900> amazing<00:01:16.350> stuff<00:01:16.560> done<00:01:16.770> with<00:01:16.920> this

to make it look like an actual cool

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.230 
to make it look like an actual cool
tunnel<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:19.860> can<00:01:20.009> use<00:01:20.159> rocks<00:01:20.520> around<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.060> and

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
tunnel you can use rocks around it and

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.149 
tunnel you can use rocks around it and
make<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:21.990> look<00:01:22.259> like<00:01:22.320> I've<00:01:22.650> broken<00:01:22.920> into

make this look like I've broken into
area<00:01:23.640> from<00:01:23.880> inside<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.420> rocks<00:01:24.630> it's<00:01:25.200> pretty

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
area from inside the rocks it's pretty

make<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.140> prytt<00:01:28.350> made<00:01:28.500> some<00:01:28.650> pretty<00:01:28.770> cool

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
make the prytt made some pretty cool

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.370 
make the prytt made some pretty cool
work<00:01:29.130> doing<00:01:29.340> done<00:01:30.210> with<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.689> but<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.140> pretty

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
there's one more part you gotta go on

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.310 
there's one more part you gotta go on
the<00:01:36.810> fourth<00:01:37.079> part<00:01:37.320> it's<00:01:37.470> very<00:01:37.500> important<00:01:39.320> to

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
the fourth part it's very important to

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.910 
the fourth part it's very important to
finish<00:01:40.650> off<00:01:40.920> your<00:01:40.950> wall<00:01:41.520> or<00:01:42.090> entryway<00:01:42.920> for

all right and then you'll just build

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.670 
all right and then you'll just build
yourself<00:01:51.720> off<00:01:53.930> and<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.110> can<00:01:55.290> make<00:01:55.470> whatever

you want in here I mean you can make

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.030 
you want in here I mean you can make
