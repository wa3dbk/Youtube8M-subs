they tape them up which is two problems

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.740 
they tape them up which is two problems
one<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.430> can't<00:01:26.640> inspect<00:01:27.090> them<00:01:27.299> at<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.540> time

I'm sure they're trying to do the right

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.259 
I'm sure they're trying to do the right
thing<00:04:12.250> and<00:04:12.370> in<00:04:12.489> the<00:04:12.610> grand<00:04:12.820> scheme<00:04:13.060> of<00:04:13.120> things

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
thing and in the grand scheme of things

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.120 
thing and in the grand scheme of things
the<00:04:13.570> average<00:04:13.690> punter<00:04:14.049> who<00:04:14.380> buys<00:04:14.590> a<00:04:14.620> board<00:04:15.010> game

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130

if<00:04:15.730> it's<00:04:16.120> missing<00:04:16.329> a<00:04:16.570> couple<00:04:16.600> of<00:04:16.959> pieces<00:04:17.200> to

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
if it's missing a couple of pieces to

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.069 
if it's missing a couple of pieces to
them<00:04:18.400> it<00:04:18.549> doesn't<00:04:18.579> really<00:04:18.880> matter<00:04:19.209> but<00:04:19.810> with<00:04:20.049> a

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
them it doesn't really matter but with a

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.800 
them it doesn't really matter but with a
puzzle<00:04:20.739> or<00:04:21.250> stuff<00:04:21.669> like<00:04:21.789> that<00:04:21.910> it<00:04:22.210> does<00:04:22.479> matter

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
puzzle or stuff like that it does matter

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.710 
puzzle or stuff like that it does matter
because<00:04:23.770> it<00:04:23.919> won't<00:04:24.310> work<00:04:24.400> it's<00:04:25.120> just<00:04:25.300> quite

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
because it won't work it's just quite

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.580 
because it won't work it's just quite
simply<00:04:25.750> won't

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
simply won't

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.970 
simply won't
and<00:04:27.060> it'll<00:04:28.060> cost<00:04:28.270> me<00:04:28.510> negative<00:04:28.960> feedback<00:04:29.500> and

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
and it'll cost me negative feedback and

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.879 
and it'll cost me negative feedback and
I've<00:04:30.580> got<00:04:31.120> to<00:04:31.210> take<00:04:31.360> the<00:04:31.480> time<00:04:31.780> to<00:04:32.139> go<00:04:32.320> that's

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
I've got to take the time to go that's

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:34.650 
I've got to take the time to go that's
the<00:04:33.010> other<00:04:33.190> factor<00:04:33.730> I've<00:04:34.150> got<00:04:34.300> to<00:04:34.419> take<00:04:34.510> the

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
the other factor I've got to take the

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.980 
the other factor I've got to take the
time<00:04:34.960> but<00:04:35.770> it's<00:04:35.919> taken<00:04:36.370> me<00:04:36.520> half<00:04:37.419> of<00:04:37.690> the<00:04:37.780> day

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
time but it's taken me half of the day

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.200
