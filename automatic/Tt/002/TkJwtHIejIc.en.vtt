00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.940
 Hello good afternoon to the whole metal forum 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.040
 hobby this time I love you 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.400
 present a small mechanism that 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:15.840
 I'm doing to be able to move the axes 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.390
 x yz of any machine to which 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.980
 we are amateurs this time what 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.590
 I'm doing with one of the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.869
 devices that are being most 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.359
 speaking these days for the forum that is 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.550
 the pulse generator and controller 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.509
 step by step engines this so famous that 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.420
 is coming out on ebay 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:39.409
 there you have it, you see it is the famous 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:42.110
 circuit inc which is a pulse generator and 

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:44.900
 controlled stepper motors 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.050
 what you see here is a small probe 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.420
 of a small thermometer that I have for 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.800
 here so you can see more or less the 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.470
 temperature then what is it taking from 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:01.790
 integrated the integrated is this one of 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:04.910
 the most famous and known the l 298 that 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.860
 Can handle up to 2 amps good 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.890
 Well, we are putting the subject as 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.790
 you can see here we have a small motor 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.930
 Step by Step 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.610
 and well we start if you look 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:21.420
 press the first button that is set 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.700
 running in one direction or increase the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.770
 speed depends on the way in which 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.150
 we have to take the plate I have 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.970
 set to increase or decrease mode 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.970
 speed you see 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.960
 as I go by pressing the button 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:49.580
 as the engine is increasing speed 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.580
 very little by little but it shows 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.320
 you will see now when I more or less take 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.320
 speed as you start to notice more 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.720
 and so 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:21.180
 there comes a time when it becomes saturated 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.610
 there is a little step down and well then 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.580
 you see now we take the jumper this 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:35.120
 we put it here in the jumper 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.670
 j-2 and now every time we press the 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.040
 buttons will no longer increase or decrease 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.650
 the speed because when you put the jumper 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:47.500
 he has memorized the last speed 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.500
 programmed then you see a sense 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.819
 in one sense and now I pulse the other 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:56.120
 button another direction forward to back 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:03:00.090
 for alante 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:03.420
 back does not do anything you see now 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:07.430
 I press the third button this last one over 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.530
 on the right and it is the stoppage of control 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.830
 I return to remove the jumper j-2 the 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.140
 above you can see that the temperature 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.739
 it's at 48 degrees is more than acceptable 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.299
 I already say it's up to 2 amps now 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.590
 I'll start again once 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:26.920
 he pressed the button 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.140
 and it's running at the last speed 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.480
 Now I'm going to press the other button 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.480
 in the middle to slow down 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.590
 good for the sound by the speed 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.590
 you can see that it is decreasing 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:49.190
 I return to your life 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:52.430
 that yes when you do the increase or 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.980
 decrease in speed to 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.930
 increase tour in one direction and to 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.930
 lower speed rotates in the other 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:08.090
 it's good saturation, well, you see 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.090
 I put the jumper back 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.269
 and there is a bit more to explain 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.269
 you see 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.390
 a sense 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.220
 another meaning and now more or less step 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.550
 explain what is the assembly of this 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:27.930
 it is a stepper motor as you have 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.370
 seen is with some pulleys of 10 and good 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.960
 if you look now when you hold the 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.330
 pulley above you will see that no no 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.570
 it turns because one turns then very simple 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.000
 because down here there is a clutch that 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.550
 what it does is transmit the attraction to the 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.080
 primary pulley but does not let it go 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.320
 the secondary because the clutch is not 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.830
 action then this 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.140
 switch 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.810
 getting the 24 volts to the 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:55.520
 clutch and there you have it 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.950
 when he stopped it what I do is already 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.440
 skip steps but we already have traction 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.150
 total 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.910
 you see 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:08.310
 the d is food is bone 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:11.930
 the pulley is stopped 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.930
 I give him tension again 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:18.249
 and the pulley as you see continues to rotate 

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:19.899
 Although I intend to stop it, I think that 

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:24.459
 this is very practical so to put in 

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:27.009
 an x and y axis can be passed from manual or 

00:05:24.459 --> 00:05:29.709
 automatic both with manual advance 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:32.559
 controlled at speed manually or 

00:05:29.709 --> 00:05:34.509
 if we do it through the marches then 

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:36.339
 nothing just wanted to tell you that to mode 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:39.759
 of comment for nothing a little 

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:41.529
 chapita aluminum 10 millimeters 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:44.199
 I mounted on the flat plate and you saw that 

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:48.249
 well the engine at origin was therefore 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:49.839
 you see that it was square and good 

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:52.899
 what I did was mount it on the plate 

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:54.279
 winch and I ate what this this 

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:57.279
 bit so it was then 

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:59.439
 totally a round keep the plate 

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:01.569
 of aluminum to fit in the 

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:04.959
 clutch the same specifically these are 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:07.089
 56 millimeters and these 53 calculating the 

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:10.149
 distance now I have to do the other 

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:11.800
 plate that goes over and well then what 

00:06:10.149 --> 00:06:14.769
 which is the other pulley to make a 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.659
 second reduction if you look here 

00:06:14.769 --> 00:06:19.060
 I have put a bearing on which in 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:21.060
 the stepper motor pulley 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:24.900
 that will help me for the second 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:28.480
 for the second and for her 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:30.370
 the second pulley because since the 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:32.710
 pulleys are exactly the same 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:35.950
 measure the distances of the belts 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:37.990
 they will also be the same, so nothing 

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:40.470
 only this come to taste to see them 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.470
 see you later
