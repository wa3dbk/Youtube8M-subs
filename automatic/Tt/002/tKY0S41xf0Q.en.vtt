menu now this week I want to talk about
holographic<00:00:17.590> cards<00:00:18.300> now<00:00:19.300> what<00:00:19.480> I<00:00:19.510> found<00:00:19.779> out

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
holographic cards now what I found out

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.040 
holographic cards now what I found out
recently<00:00:20.140> is<00:00:20.650> that<00:00:21.279> what<00:00:22.090> naruto<00:00:22.270> does<00:00:22.779> with

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
recently is that what naruto does with

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.320 
recently is that what naruto does with
our<00:00:23.170> holographic<00:00:23.410> cards<00:00:23.950> and<00:00:24.180> basically<00:00:25.180> what

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
our holographic cards and basically what

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.170 
our holographic cards and basically what
that<00:00:25.390> is<00:00:25.539> is<00:00:26.080> that<00:00:26.680> every<00:00:26.980> card<00:00:27.220> in<00:00:27.430> novato<00:00:27.910> set

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
that is is that every card in novato set

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.840 
that is is that every card in novato set
can<00:00:28.960> be<00:00:28.990> holographic<00:00:29.500> so<00:00:29.949> all<00:00:30.250> the<00:00:30.460> commons

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:30.850 
can be holographic so all the commons

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.970 
can be holographic so all the commons
could<00:00:31.119> be<00:00:31.210> a<00:00:31.240> holograph<00:00:31.630> the<00:00:31.750> card<00:00:31.960> all<00:00:32.710> the

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
could be a holograph the card all the

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.280 
could be a holograph the card all the
rares<00:00:33.190> could<00:00:33.460> be<00:00:33.520> holographic<00:00:33.879> are<00:00:34.210> all<00:00:34.449> the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
rares could be holographic are all the

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.780 
rares could be holographic are all the
super<00:00:35.620> raiders<00:00:35.920> can<00:00:36.070> be<00:00:36.160> a<00:00:36.190> holographic<00:00:36.550> all

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
super raiders can be a holographic all

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.070 
super raiders can be a holographic all
the<00:00:36.879> ultra<00:00:37.210> rares<00:00:37.390> all<00:00:37.600> the<00:00:37.660> secret<00:00:37.930> words

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.080 
the ultra rares all the secret words

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.170 
the ultra rares all the secret words
whatever<00:00:38.290> their<00:00:38.680> rarity<00:00:38.949> is<00:00:39.220> has<00:00:39.640> the<00:00:39.850> ability

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
whatever their rarity is has the ability

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.200 
whatever their rarity is has the ability
to<00:00:40.210> be<00:00:40.360> a<00:00:40.390> holographic<00:00:40.900> car<00:00:41.909> now<00:00:42.909> what<00:00:43.180> that

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
to be a holographic car now what that

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.600 
to be a holographic car now what that
means<00:00:43.540> is<00:00:43.989> that<00:00:44.170> every<00:00:44.589> time<00:00:44.979> you<00:00:45.159> get<00:00:45.250> a<00:00:45.309> pack

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
means is that every time you get a pack

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.240 
means is that every time you get a pack
of<00:00:45.640> number<00:00:46.360> ito<00:00:46.540> and<00:00:46.809> I<00:00:46.930> believe<00:00:47.140> vs.<00:00:47.620> did<00:00:48.129> this

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
of number ito and I believe vs. did this

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.820 
of number ito and I believe vs. did this
as<00:00:48.430> well<00:00:48.580> as<00:00:48.850> you<00:00:49.629> get<00:00:49.780> a<00:00:49.809> holographic<00:00:50.379> card<00:00:50.680> in

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
as well as you get a holographic card in

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.770 
as well as you get a holographic card in
it<00:00:50.949> guarantee<00:00:51.460> the<00:00:52.150> only<00:00:52.299> problem<00:00:52.540> is<00:00:52.720> that

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
it guarantee the only problem is that

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.770 
it guarantee the only problem is that
car<00:00:53.229> could<00:00:53.470> be<00:00:53.530> a<00:00:53.680> common<00:00:54.100> or<00:00:54.909> it<00:00:55.239> could<00:00:55.390> be<00:00:55.420> a

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
car could be a common or it could be a

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.829 
car could be a common or it could be a
rare<00:00:56.110> orchid<00:00:56.500> via<00:00:56.680> ultra<00:00:57.220> or<00:00:57.820> it<00:00:58.059> could<00:00:58.210> be<00:00:58.420> you

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
rare orchid via ultra or it could be you

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:01.579 
rare orchid via ultra or it could be you
know<00:00:58.960> whatever<00:00:59.729> and<00:01:00.729> those<00:01:00.970> games

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:01.589 
know whatever and those games

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.950 
know whatever and those games
holographic<00:01:02.589> does<00:01:03.040> not<00:01:03.220> mean<00:01:03.580> rarity<00:01:04.119> you

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
holographic does not mean rarity you

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.399 
holographic does not mean rarity you
still<00:01:05.229> get<00:01:05.530> you<00:01:06.400> know<00:01:06.549> one<00:01:07.240> super<00:01:07.690> rare<00:01:07.900> out<00:01:08.140> of

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
still get you know one super rare out of

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.620 
still get you know one super rare out of
you<00:01:08.830> know<00:01:08.920> every<00:01:09.220> six<00:01:09.729> packs<00:01:09.970> or<00:01:10.180> whatever<00:01:10.450> the

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
you know every six packs or whatever the

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.039 
you know every six packs or whatever the
ratio<00:01:11.049> is<00:01:11.400> but<00:01:12.400> that<00:01:12.430> super<00:01:12.939> rare<00:01:13.149> is<00:01:13.420> a<00:01:13.479> common

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
ratio is but that super rare is a common

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.639 
ratio is but that super rare is a common
I<00:01:14.259> guess<00:01:14.740> you<00:01:14.859> could<00:01:14.920> say<00:01:15.159> but<00:01:16.350> every<00:01:17.350> time<00:01:17.469> you

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
I guess you could say but every time you

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:18.990 
I guess you could say but every time you
get<00:01:17.740> a<00:01:17.799> whole<00:01:17.979> about<00:01:18.189> the<00:01:18.280> car<00:01:18.460> in<00:01:18.579> every<00:01:18.759> pack

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
get a whole about the car in every pack

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.870 
get a whole about the car in every pack
you<00:01:19.780> have<00:01:19.960> a<00:01:19.990> chance<00:01:20.380> of<00:01:20.770> that<00:01:21.310> holographic

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
you have a chance of that holographic

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.620 
you have a chance of that holographic
are<00:01:22.030> also<00:01:22.359> being<00:01:22.869> you<00:01:23.619> know<00:01:23.740> super<00:01:24.219> ultra<00:01:24.700> rare

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
are also being you know super ultra rare

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.249 
are also being you know super ultra rare
whatever<00:01:26.079> and<00:01:26.320> so<00:01:27.250> he<00:01:27.700> kind<00:01:27.939> of<00:01:28.259> essentially

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
whatever and so he kind of essentially

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.370 
whatever and so he kind of essentially
double<00:01:29.649> your<00:01:29.799> chances<00:01:29.829> of<00:01:30.490> pulling<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:32.229> know

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
double your chances of pulling you know

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.770 
double your chances of pulling you know
you<00:01:32.859> know<00:01:33.009> a<00:01:33.189> rare<00:01:33.549> hard<00:01:33.909> to<00:01:34.000> get<00:01:34.119> car<00:01:34.329> ultra

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
you know a rare hard to get car ultra

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.590 
you know a rare hard to get car ultra
rare<00:01:34.960> super<00:01:35.350> rare<00:01:35.500> or<00:01:35.590> whatever<00:01:35.890> Plus<00:01:36.759> this

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
rare super rare or whatever Plus this

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.859 
rare super rare or whatever Plus this
way<00:01:37.869> you<00:01:38.350> can<00:01:38.499> bling<00:01:38.710> out<00:01:38.799> your<00:01:39.009> whole<00:01:39.159> deck<00:01:39.460> or

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
way you can bling out your whole deck or

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.919 
way you can bling out your whole deck or
you<00:01:40.869> can<00:01:41.109> you<00:01:41.380> know<00:01:41.469> just<00:01:41.649> get<00:01:41.890> no<00:01:42.340> a<00:01:42.670> very<00:01:43.030> you

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
you can you know just get no a very you

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:46.169 
you can you know just get no a very you
know<00:01:43.960> non<00:01:44.890> expensive<00:01:45.490> version<00:01:45.850> of<00:01:45.909> the<00:01:46.030> deck

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
know non expensive version of the deck

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:48.840 
know non expensive version of the deck
as<00:01:46.359> well<00:01:46.390> I<00:01:47.009> think<00:01:48.009> this<00:01:48.340> was<00:01:48.520> something<00:01:48.700> that

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
as well I think this was something that

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.910 
as well I think this was something that
could<00:01:49.119> maybe<00:01:49.450> work<00:01:49.570> in<00:01:49.869> you<00:01:49.990> do<00:01:50.200> because<00:01:50.829> I

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
could maybe work in you do because I

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.190 
could maybe work in you do because I
think<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:52.060> know<00:01:52.179> this<00:01:52.299> way<00:01:52.509> every<00:01:52.929> time<00:01:52.960> you

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
think you know this way every time you

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.020 
think you know this way every time you
get<00:01:53.289> a<00:01:53.350> pack<00:01:53.560> you<00:01:53.829> get<00:01:53.950> a<00:01:53.979> holographic<00:01:54.369> hard<00:01:54.729> so

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
get a pack you get a holographic hard so

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.399 
get a pack you get a holographic hard so
people<00:01:55.329> who<00:01:55.539> want<00:01:55.689> to<00:01:55.749> play<00:01:55.840> some<00:01:56.170> sort<00:01:56.350> of

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409 
people who want to play some sort of

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.520 
people who want to play some sort of
weird<00:01:56.649> off<00:01:56.950> the<00:01:57.130> beat<00:01:57.310> weird<00:01:57.670> that<00:01:58.630> can<00:01:58.990> have<00:01:59.200> a

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
weird off the beat weird that can have a

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.989 
weird off the beat weird that can have a
holographic<00:02:00.039> version<00:02:00.399> of<00:02:00.490> that<00:02:00.549> deck<00:02:00.819> or

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:00.999 
holographic version of that deck or

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:03.599 
holographic version of that deck or
cards<00:02:01.420> that<00:02:01.659> you<00:02:02.560> know<00:02:02.710> Konami<00:02:03.159> or<00:02:03.340> whoever

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:03.609 
cards that you know Konami or whoever

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:05.550 
cards that you know Konami or whoever
does<00:02:03.819> not<00:02:03.850> see<00:02:04.299> is<00:02:04.420> becoming<00:02:04.840> very<00:02:05.139> good

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
does not see is becoming very good

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.709 
does not see is becoming very good
example<00:02:06.069> would<00:02:06.429> be<00:02:06.490> like<00:02:06.759> maybe<00:02:06.939> spore<00:02:07.329> fish

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
example would be like maybe spore fish

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:09.990 
example would be like maybe spore fish
for<00:02:08.020> to<00:02:08.200> come<00:02:08.350> out<00:02:08.470> as<00:02:08.560> Commons<00:02:08.979> and<00:02:09.759> you<00:02:09.880> can

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
for to come out as Commons and you can

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.150 
for to come out as Commons and you can
now<00:02:10.090> get<00:02:10.300> that<00:02:10.539> as<00:02:10.780> holographic<00:02:11.380> even<00:02:11.980> though

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
now get that as holographic even though

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.710 
now get that as holographic even though
they're<00:02:12.370> now<00:02:12.730> coming<00:02:12.910> out<00:02:13.060> holographic<00:02:13.569> rid

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
they're now coming out holographic rid

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.250 
they're now coming out holographic rid
of<00:02:13.840> them

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
of them

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.610 
of them
plays<00:02:14.849> this<00:02:15.849> is<00:02:16.150> uh<00:02:16.360> oh<00:02:16.569> you<00:02:16.959> can<00:02:17.110> kind<00:02:17.230> of<00:02:17.349> cut

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
plays this is uh oh you can kind of cut

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.990 
plays this is uh oh you can kind of cut
that<00:02:17.769> out<00:02:17.830> with<00:02:18.159> that<00:02:18.280> middle<00:02:18.549> portion<00:02:18.879> out

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
that out with that middle portion out

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.050 
that out with that middle portion out
you<00:02:19.510> can<00:02:19.659> eliminate<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:20.829> need<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.220> reprint<00:02:21.790> in

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
you can eliminate the need to reprint in

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.729 
you can eliminate the need to reprint in
holographic<00:02:22.540> form<00:02:22.930> because<00:02:23.500> you're<00:02:23.620> already

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
holographic form because you're already

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.110 
holographic form because you're already
going<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.069> get<00:02:24.189> them<00:02:24.340> at<00:02:24.459> holographic<00:02:25.000> form

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
going to get them at holographic form

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.390 
going to get them at holographic form
every<00:02:25.329> time<00:02:25.890> anyways<00:02:26.890> those<00:02:27.040> are<00:02:27.069> my<00:02:27.220> thoughts

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
every time anyways those are my thoughts

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.740 
every time anyways those are my thoughts
I<00:02:27.549> thought<00:02:27.700> it<00:02:27.790> was<00:02:27.879> kind<00:02:28.030> of<00:02:28.060> unique<00:02:28.299> kind<00:02:28.659> of

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
I thought it was kind of unique kind of

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.930 
I thought it was kind of unique kind of
cool<00:02:28.900> thing<00:02:29.140> that<00:02:29.409> I<00:02:29.500> really<00:02:29.620> does<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.189> I

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
cool thing that I really does and I

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.100 
cool thing that I really does and I
thought<00:02:31.120> it<00:02:31.209> might<00:02:31.329> translate<00:02:31.720> pretty<00:02:31.989> well

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
thought it might translate pretty well

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.589 
thought it might translate pretty well
in<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.290> you<00:02:32.409> do<00:02:32.620> so<00:02:33.459> leave<00:02:34.120> me<00:02:34.239> a<00:02:34.269> comment<00:02:34.420> on

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
in the you do so leave me a comment on

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:35.759 
in the you do so leave me a comment on
what<00:02:34.750> you<00:02:34.840> think<00:02:35.079> if<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.379> think<00:02:35.530> that<00:02:35.650> would

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
what you think if you think that would

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.289 
what you think if you think that would
be<00:02:35.860> a<00:02:35.890> good<00:02:36.040> idea<00:02:36.099> for<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.610> Konami<00:02:36.909> to<00:02:37.060> switch

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
be a good idea for a Konami to switch

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.210 
be a good idea for a Konami to switch
over<00:02:37.480> or<00:02:37.750> not<00:02:37.870> or<00:02:38.110> if<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.349> like<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.769> way<00:02:38.890> their

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
over or not or if you like the way their

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.860 
over or not or if you like the way their
rarity<00:02:39.670> and<00:02:40.000> their<00:02:40.090> holographic<00:02:40.540> system

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
rarity and their holographic system

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.349 
rarity and their holographic system
works<00:02:41.109> now<00:02:41.379> and<00:02:41.950> I<00:02:42.489> guess<00:02:42.640> that's<00:02:42.819> it<00:02:42.940> for<00:02:43.120> this

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
works now and I guess that's it for this

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:47.340 
works now and I guess that's it for this
week<00:02:43.420> this<00:02:43.989> is<00:02:44.170> black<00:02:44.349> the<00:02:44.500> guy<00:02:44.620> out
