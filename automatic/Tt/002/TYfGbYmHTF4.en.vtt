00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
have lost or cold so let's start with a

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.140 
have lost or cold so let's start with a
particular<00:01:04.250> young<00:01:05.250> bird<00:01:05.489> race<00:01:05.700> let's<00:01:06.030> say

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
particular young bird race let's say

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.420 
particular young bird race let's say
it's<00:01:06.299> your<00:01:06.360> first<00:01:06.659> young<00:01:06.900> bird<00:01:07.110> race<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.650> in

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
it's your first young bird race and in

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.130 
it's your first young bird race and in
this<00:01:08.610> race<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.090> have<00:01:10.220> sent<00:01:11.630> 75<00:01:12.630> young<00:01:12.869> birds

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
this race you have sent 75 young birds

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.800 
this race you have sent 75 young birds
and<00:01:15.170> you've<00:01:16.170> lost<00:01:16.409> 25<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.340> them<00:01:17.549> now<00:01:18.540> most

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
and you've lost 25 of them now most

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.200 
and you've lost 25 of them now most
fanciers<00:01:19.470> would<00:01:19.710> say<00:01:19.920> that<00:01:20.159> if<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.369> sent<00:01:20.640> 75

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
fanciers would say that if you sent 75

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.880 
fanciers would say that if you sent 75
young<00:01:21.509> birds<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> race<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.650> lose<00:01:22.860> a

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
young birds to a race and you lose a

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.090 
young birds to a race and you lose a
third<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.430> them<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:25.350> had<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> bad<00:01:25.830> race

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
third of them that you had a bad race

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.310 
third of them that you had a bad race
but<00:01:27.000> let<00:01:27.180> me<00:01:27.330> show<00:01:27.570> you

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
but let me show you

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.859 
but let me show you
statistically<00:01:29.299> what<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.960> mathematics<00:01:31.619> say

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
statistically what the mathematics say

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.399 
statistically what the mathematics say
the<00:01:33.869> opposite<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.610> so<00:01:35.610> we<00:01:36.450> had<00:01:36.600> 50<00:01:37.020> come<00:01:37.200> home

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
the opposite of so we had 50 come home

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.760 
the opposite of so we had 50 come home
we<00:01:37.619> lost<00:01:37.829> 25<00:01:40.220> squared<00:01:41.220> becomes<00:01:41.670> 625<00:01:42.560> 50<00:01:43.560> plus

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
we lost 25 squared becomes 625 50 plus

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.120 
we lost 25 squared becomes 625 50 plus
25<00:01:44.280> equals<00:01:45.170> 75<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:47.299> 75<00:01:48.299> into<00:01:48.750> 625<00:01:49.470> gives<00:01:49.799> us<00:01:49.950> a

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
25 equals 75 and 75 into 625 gives us a

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.700 
25 equals 75 and 75 into 625 gives us a
number<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.549> 8.3<00:01:51.590> now<00:01:53.149> 8.3<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.710> significant

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
number of 8.3 now 8.3 is a significant

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.980 
number of 8.3 now 8.3 is a significant
number<00:01:55.860> because<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:56.759> closer<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.780> most

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
number because it is closer to the most

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.899 
number because it is closer to the most
desirable<00:01:58.409> number<00:01:58.920> we're<00:01:59.100> looking<00:01:59.460> for<00:01:59.700> which

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
of losses we've had we've had a race

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.760 
of losses we've had we've had a race
that<00:02:12.450> was<00:02:12.629> as<00:02:12.780> close<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.290> 10

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
that was as close to 10

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.820 
that was as close to 10
we<00:02:13.920> could<00:02:14.100> have<00:02:14.190> gotten<00:02:14.660> meaning<00:02:15.660> that<00:02:16.320> we<00:02:16.590> had

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
we could have gotten meaning that we had

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.280 
we could have gotten meaning that we had
a<00:02:17.130> really<00:02:17.370> good<00:02:17.670> race

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
a really good race

pair<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:33.030> birds<00:02:33.270> we've<00:02:33.990> bred<00:02:34.200> twenty<00:02:34.620> young

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
pair of birds we've bred twenty young

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.960 
pair of birds we've bred twenty young
birds<00:02:35.070> and<00:02:35.720> over<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.810> course<00:02:37.050> of<00:02:37.700> young<00:02:38.700> birds

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
birds and over the course of young birds

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.340 
birds and over the course of young birds
old<00:02:39.210> birds<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.600> young<00:02:39.690> birds<00:02:39.900> maybe<00:02:40.140> old

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
old birds and young birds maybe old

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.040 
old birds and young birds maybe old
birds<00:02:40.560> again<00:02:40.710> we've<00:02:41.580> lost<00:02:41.820> five<00:02:42.240> of<00:02:42.450> them<00:02:42.600> so

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
birds again we've lost five of them so

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.730 
birds again we've lost five of them so
15<00:02:43.500> minus<00:02:43.650> five<00:02:44.010> squared<00:02:44.340> is<00:02:44.460> a<00:02:44.520> hundred

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
15 minus five squared is a hundred

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.250 
15 minus five squared is a hundred
fifteen<00:02:46.740> plus<00:02:46.950> five<00:02:47.220> equals<00:02:47.280> twenty<00:02:48.260> twenty

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
fifteen plus five equals twenty twenty

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.210 
fifteen plus five equals twenty twenty
goes<00:02:49.440> into<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:49.860> hundred<00:02:50.370> five<00:02:50.670> times<00:02:51.620> now<00:02:52.620> the

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
goes into a hundred five times now the

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.610 
goes into a hundred five times now the
problem<00:02:53.640> with<00:02:53.760> this<00:02:53.940> number<00:02:54.390> is<00:02:54.810> is<00:02:55.080> that<00:02:55.320> it

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
problem with this number is is that it

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.130 
problem with this number is is that it
is<00:02:55.650> on<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:57.540> low<00:02:57.750> end<00:02:57.780> of<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.580> desirable<00:02:59.580> scale

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
is on the low end of the desirable scale

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.990 
is on the low end of the desirable scale
with<00:03:01.140> 10<00:03:01.410> being<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:01.740> best<00:03:01.860> one<00:03:02.610> being<00:03:02.880> the

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
with 10 being the best one being the

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.560 
with 10 being the best one being the
worst

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
worst

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.770 
worst
so<00:03:04.350> this<00:03:04.620> particular<00:03:04.800> pair<00:03:05.580> in<00:03:05.850> my<00:03:06.240> opinion

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
so this particular pair in my opinion

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.370 
so this particular pair in my opinion
would<00:03:07.820> not<00:03:08.820> be<00:03:09.150> worth<00:03:09.420> your<00:03:09.660> time<00:03:09.870> breeding

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
would not be worth your time breeding

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.920 
would not be worth your time breeding
from<00:03:10.590> I<00:03:10.920> would<00:03:11.430> remove<00:03:11.970> this<00:03:12.240> pair<00:03:12.570> from<00:03:12.780> your

come up with a very low end desirable
number<00:03:34.350> I<00:03:35.030> want<00:03:36.030> to<00:03:36.120> show<00:03:36.300> you<00:03:37.910> another

particular<00:03:39.390> pair<00:03:39.840> of<00:03:39.930> birds<00:03:40.140> and<00:03:40.560> see<00:03:41.340> if<00:03:41.550> you

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
particular pair of birds and see if you

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.449 
particular pair of birds and see if you
can<00:03:41.940> make<00:03:42.120> a<00:03:42.150> determination<00:03:42.570> if<00:03:43.350> this<00:03:44.190> pair

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
can make a determination if this pair

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.150 
can make a determination if this pair
should<00:03:44.670> be<00:03:44.850> kept<00:03:45.120> or<00:03:45.450> removed<00:03:45.900> so<00:03:46.740> out<00:03:46.890> of<00:03:47.040> this

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
should be kept or removed so out of this

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.530 
should be kept or removed so out of this
particular<00:03:47.490> pair<00:03:47.880> as<00:03:47.970> you<00:03:48.090> can<00:03:48.240> see<00:03:48.390> we've

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
particular pair as you can see we've

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.130 
particular pair as you can see we've
bred<00:03:48.720> ten<00:03:48.959> young<00:03:49.140> birds<00:03:49.410> we've<00:03:50.220> lost<00:03:50.459> three

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
bred ten young birds we've lost three

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.080 
bred ten young birds we've lost three
which<00:03:52.140> seven<00:03:52.920> minus<00:03:53.220> three<00:03:53.250> squared<00:03:53.520> gives<00:03:54.000> us

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
which seven minus three squared gives us

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.330 
which seven minus three squared gives us
16<00:03:54.600> 7<00:03:55.290> plus<00:03:55.500> 3<00:03:55.530> is<00:03:55.770> 10<00:03:56.120> 10<00:03:57.120> goes<00:03:57.360> into<00:03:57.530> 16<00:03:58.530> one

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
16 7 plus 3 is 10 10 goes into 16 one

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.250 
16 7 plus 3 is 10 10 goes into 16 one
point<00:03:59.700> six<00:04:00.060> times<00:04:01.459> now<00:04:02.459> that's<00:04:03.360> worse<00:04:03.810> than

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
point six times now that's worse than

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.130 
point six times now that's worse than
the<00:04:04.380> pair<00:04:04.620> above<00:04:05.150> but<00:04:06.150> we<00:04:06.270> also<00:04:06.450> bred<00:04:06.780> only

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
the pair above but we also bred only

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.840 
the pair above but we also bred only
half<00:04:07.380> as<00:04:07.709> many<00:04:08.070> young<00:04:08.370> birds<00:04:09.050> now<00:04:10.580> in<00:04:11.580> my

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
half as many young birds now in my

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.370 
half as many young birds now in my
opinion<00:04:12.450> this<00:04:13.290> is<00:04:13.350> not<00:04:13.590> a<00:04:14.360> significant<00:04:15.380> number

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
opinion this is not a significant number

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:22.690 
opinion this is not a significant number
to<00:04:16.859> judge<00:04:17.100> a<00:04:17.130> pair<00:04:17.489> by<00:04:18.350> 20<00:04:19.350> is<00:04:20.060> 10<00:04:21.060> is<00:04:21.239> not

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
to judge a pair by 20 is 10 is not

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.840 
to judge a pair by 20 is 10 is not
because<00:04:23.700> this<00:04:23.850> number<00:04:24.090> is<00:04:24.270> so<00:04:24.570> low

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
because this number is so low

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.310 
because this number is so low
I<00:04:25.940> would<00:04:26.810> not<00:04:28.270> remove<00:04:29.270> this<00:04:29.480> pair<00:04:29.870> from<00:04:30.170> my

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
I would not remove this pair from my

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.680 
I would not remove this pair from my
breeding<00:04:30.590> loft<00:04:30.920> yet<00:04:31.280> I<00:04:31.490> would<00:04:31.910> try<00:04:32.150> to<00:04:32.180> get<00:04:32.510> at

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
breeding loft yet I would try to get at

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.890 
breeding loft yet I would try to get at
least<00:04:32.900> six<00:04:33.410> to<00:04:33.740> ten<00:04:33.950> more<00:04:34.190> young<00:04:34.430> burrs<00:04:34.670> out<00:04:35.000> of

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
least six to ten more young burrs out of

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.510 
least six to ten more young burrs out of
this<00:04:36.050> pair<00:04:36.320> to<00:04:36.440> make<00:04:36.650> a<00:04:36.980> proper<00:04:37.700> determination

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
this pair to make a proper determination

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:46.600 
this pair to make a proper determination
let<00:04:40.520> me<00:04:40.670> show<00:04:41.030> you<00:04:41.650> why<00:04:44.320> breeding<00:04:45.340> what<00:04:46.340> most

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
let me show you why breeding what most

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.580 
let me show you why breeding what most
guys<00:04:46.880> do<00:04:47.240> is<00:04:47.390> they'll<00:04:47.570> breed<00:04:47.780> six<00:04:48.110> young<00:04:48.350> birds

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
guys do is they'll breed six young birds

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.820 
guys do is they'll breed six young birds
out<00:04:48.830> of<00:04:48.860> a<00:04:49.070> particular<00:04:49.370> pair<00:04:49.820> of<00:04:49.910> birds<00:04:50.120> and

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
out of a particular pair of birds and

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.000 
out of a particular pair of birds and
then<00:04:51.830> make<00:04:52.130> it<00:04:52.280> a<00:04:52.370> determination<00:04:53.560> upon<00:04:54.560> those

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
then make it a determination upon those

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.210 
then make it a determination upon those
six<00:04:55.370> and<00:04:55.730> possibly<00:04:56.480> you<00:04:57.440> know<00:04:57.470> try<00:04:57.800> to<00:04:57.860> build<00:04:58.070> a

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
six and possibly you know try to build a

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.450 
six and possibly you know try to build a
family<00:04:58.400> around<00:04:58.790> them<00:04:59.030> or<00:04:59.860> remove<00:05:00.860> them<00:05:01.160> and

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
family around them or remove them and

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.890 
family around them or remove them and
either<00:05:02.390> way<00:05:02.660> I<00:05:02.690> don't<00:05:03.290> believe<00:05:03.620> you<00:05:03.950> have<00:05:04.900> made

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
either way I don't believe you have made

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.720 
either way I don't believe you have made
