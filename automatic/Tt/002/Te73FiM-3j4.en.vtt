00:01:59.720 --> 00:01:59.730 
and they maybe posed it to get it into

little more obvious about it because the

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.830 
little more obvious about it because the
yellow<00:02:08.640> paints<00:02:09.060> aren't<00:02:09.390> good<00:02:09.569> at<00:02:09.660> all<00:02:09.810> in

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
these and these ones aren't that bad but

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.270 
these and these ones aren't that bad but
overall<00:02:19.710> they're<00:02:20.070> not

it to have a really good paint job

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.140 
it to have a really good paint job
expected<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.770> be<00:02:25.860> at<00:02:25.980> least<00:02:26.280> twice<00:02:26.550> as<00:02:26.790> bad<00:02:26.940> as

these are and no they don't look too bad

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.810 
these are and no they don't look too bad
probably<00:02:29.450> but<00:02:30.450> overall<00:02:30.900> they're<00:02:31.110> not<00:02:31.260> good

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
probably but overall they're not good

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.160 
probably but overall they're not good
let's<00:02:32.820> put<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.090> face<00:02:33.240> mask<00:02:33.480> on<00:02:33.690> just<00:02:33.960> because

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
let's put the face mask on just because

they<00:02:56.700> just<00:02:56.880> kind<00:02:57.300> of<00:02:57.420> sit<00:02:57.720> there<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:58.140> then

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
they just kind of sit there and then

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.400 
they just kind of sit there and then
fall<00:02:59.850> off<00:02:59.880> pretty<00:03:00.270> easily<00:03:00.510> some<00:03:01.200> of<00:03:01.290> them

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
fall off pretty easily some of them

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.020 
fall off pretty easily some of them
stick<00:03:01.680> better<00:03:01.890> than<00:03:02.100> others<00:03:02.370> some<00:03:02.790> of<00:03:02.820> them

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
stick better than others some of them

stick better than others some of them
don't<00:03:03.209> stay<00:03:03.420> at<00:03:03.540> all<00:03:03.660> it<00:03:03.870> really<00:03:03.989> depends<00:03:04.560> on

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
don't stay at all it really depends on

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.460 
don't stay at all it really depends on
your<00:03:04.950> figure<00:03:05.610> they're<00:03:05.790> all<00:03:05.910> different<00:03:06.150> I<00:03:06.510> mean

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
your figure they're all different I mean

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.720 
your figure they're all different I mean
they're<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.650> same<00:03:07.860> sculpt<00:03:08.280> they<00:03:08.489> just

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
they're the same sculpt they just

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.699 
they're the same sculpt they just
whether<00:03:09.390> they<00:03:09.540> stay<00:03:09.720> on<00:03:09.870> or<00:03:09.989> not<00:03:10.110> complete

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
whether they stay on or not complete

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:11.960

look<00:03:10.920> alright<00:03:11.580> let's<00:03:11.760> talk<00:03:11.910> about

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
look alright let's talk about

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.140 
look alright let's talk about

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
far enough to do a repulsor blasts and

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.890 
far enough to do a repulsor blasts and
he's<00:03:32.040> got<00:03:32.190> a<00:03:32.220> really<00:03:32.580> tiny<00:03:33.120> little<00:03:33.360> repulsor

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
he's got a really tiny little repulsor

he's got a really tiny little repulsor

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
thing he's on there so I don't care for

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.840 
thing he's on there so I don't care for
that<00:03:36.510> does<00:03:36.810> make<00:03:36.959> a<00:03:36.989> good<00:03:37.230> fist<00:03:37.410> though<00:03:37.850> this

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
that does make a good fist though this

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.270 
that does make a good fist though this
open<00:03:39.239> pointing<00:03:39.660> hand<00:03:39.870> still<00:03:40.830> doesn't<00:03:41.130> raise

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
open pointing hand still doesn't raise

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.330 
open pointing hand still doesn't raise
enough<00:03:41.640> to<00:03:41.850> do<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.090> repulsor<00:03:42.630> blasts<00:03:43.070> but<00:03:44.070> I

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
enough to do a repulsor blasts but I

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.009 
enough to do a repulsor blasts but I
guess<00:03:44.489> it's<00:03:44.670> good<00:03:44.820> enough<00:03:45.060> whatever

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
guess it's good enough whatever

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.940 
guess it's good enough whatever

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
2-pack they're from two packs but it's a
