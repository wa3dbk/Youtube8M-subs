00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.869
 these mini blog and an aggoun on the stand 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.720
 microsoft not for exclusivity 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.770
 but for dragon ball z battle of the 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.840
 use of z 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.180
 my goal as we want a little bit a 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.890
 fighting game that really puts forward 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.379
 the multi this is a game that is 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.530
 developed by namco bandaï need to know 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.309
 that the previous dragon ball z is not 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.010
 extraordinary 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.579
 it's a euphemism there they tried to 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.170
 to catch up 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.500
 it looks a little better in all 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.360
 honesty but here we are frankly 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.460
 as much to say it right now it's not 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.720
 the game of the century 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.730
 you spoke night little players that's 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.120
 because indeed the whole game there 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.630
 is focused on four players or in 4 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.460
 against 4 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:03.329
 or else even when you play alone 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.030
 you will play with three ya and suddenly you 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.060
 are in the same battle with with 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.700
 world 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.740
 yeah knowing that suddenly the story 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.479
 she has more sense than they 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.860
 like the story in the dragon 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.960
 ball me I remember for example 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.290
 I loved the story modes of 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.360
 tenkaichi for example here I confess that 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.010
 it has too much neither tail nor head 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.020
 so we find more or less the same 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.030
 the same scenarios ie the 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.500
 same enemies there for example we could 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.970
 do two fights the first tale did 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.590
 not then know him anything in combat 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.870
 that we have done fifteen times with his 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.880
 singles germany 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.610
 bazaar then the second against vegeta 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.680
 climbach turn into audio in 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.750
 modial giant monkey this time I say to myself 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.800
 I've never seen that the bored break 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.270
 they are obliged he resumes the 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.830
 scenarios every time yes that's me 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.810
 I like that very well 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.010
 is that the background that is listed 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.210
 the impression that you really play the 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.940
 character there you can make yourself a 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.930
 Sangoku team if you want in for me 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.000
 it's a bit of a glass and the different 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.230
 steps of his huawei goku had more or 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.360
 fewer things but my device for 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.670
 a frieze and we know who to 47 bit 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.800
 close not like good by cons we are 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.910
 announces more than 70 characters or so 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.760
 we know them his race a treatment is 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.840
 a lot of transformation, that's it 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.330
 actually you were talking about the franc of 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.860
 consumption and emissions 60 issue 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.540
 so for the solo and it's the same 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.250
 missions that will be playable in coop 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.170
 so you have to know that it's just that 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.760
 can also after there is multi 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.460
 competitive in 4 against 4 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.380
 it's quickly the brothel so for what 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.980
 is commands they are extremely 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.560
 simplified a lock system that 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.720
 walk more or less 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.819
 know one more time I have not been 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.950
 super packed so much earlier if 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.349
 namco bandaï we also tested to saint 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.760
 seiya which was simple which made the 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.489
 fan service but it was a game of 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.440
 very simple fight it could 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.970
 to explain it is a bit of a game going on 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.160
 very simple tone that does not make a lot of 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.510
 service time so I confess I was 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.580
 a little disappointed but before he 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.319
 frankly after all everything is based on 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.760
 including synchronization with 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.819
 other characters must see how that 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.080
 will walk with the ia ausy it works 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.430
 moderately yes the regions that actually 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.900
 you can actually make combos 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.830
 and they send back the ball a little 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.350
 little he 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.269
 you can also give energy to your 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.069
 buddies if you do certain things to 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.840
 certain moments and it allows particular 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.600
 for example, I see someone 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.860
 extraordinary or things like that 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.390
 last little point too which is when 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.760
 even its importance we were presented 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.739
 the edition of one also who she 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.110
 contained a bonus of choice 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:31.220
 ie a naruto skin mode 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:33.170
 hokage for men that's running 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.420
 with the arms behind and you there and 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.090
 then who makes little sub game for 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.820
 for to start know is that these 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.769
 fireballs all that yeah that's because 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.280
 that she was pretty voice there frankly 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.930
 it's really a small addition 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.430
 friendly we will say but that's not 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.930
 make the course to do every day on 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.180
 will say after there are systems for 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.530
 increase the power of its different 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.360
 characters and a card system 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.709
 you win then that stuff but 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.940
 the most important is gameplay it's 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.430
 true that it is not what we are most 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.720
 excited for this game and his voice over there 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.160
 that's all we can say about battle 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.350
 of thee unfortunately we are a little 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.660
 little question we hope that by now 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.090
 exit it will be more interesting in itself 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.590
 do not really believe you never know here 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.220
 we especially hope to have other games 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.720
 more interesting 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.220
 what's it for the agreements the oil and 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.959
 fetishes to death at the canvas 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.959
 she will leave us here on ciao
