00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.460 
other ones I'll go ahead and open up
because<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.540> might<00:01:45.720> end<00:01:45.840> up<00:01:45.930> using<00:01:45.990> them<00:01:46.350> in

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
because I might end up using them in

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.730 
because I might end up using them in
matches<00:01:47.460> but<00:01:47.610> these<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.509> never<00:01:48.960> use<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.439> put<00:01:49.649> them

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
matches but these I never use I put them

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.230 
matches but these I never use I put them
straight<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.130> binder<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.579> I'd<00:01:50.700> leave<00:01:51.149> him

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
straight in a binder and I'd leave him

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.550 
straight in a binder and I'd leave him
right<00:01:51.390> in<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.540> plastic<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:52.170> it's<00:01:52.320> hard<00:01:52.500> to

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
right in the plastic so it's hard to

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.859 
right in the plastic so it's hard to
tell<00:01:52.740> it's<00:01:52.920> foil<00:01:53.250> because<00:01:53.939> its<00:01:54.299> own<00:01:54.420> plastic

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
tell it's foil because its own plastic

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.639 
tell it's foil because its own plastic
its<00:01:55.320> foil<00:01:56.180> so<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.540> got<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.869> foil<00:01:58.799> cryptic<00:01:59.219> command

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
its foil so I got a foil cryptic command

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.319 
its foil so I got a foil cryptic command
some<00:02:01.649> cool<00:02:01.920> flame<00:02:02.219> javelins<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:02.909> unmake

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329
