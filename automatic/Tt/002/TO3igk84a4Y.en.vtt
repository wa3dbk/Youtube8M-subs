00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
gets cracking straight on now as I

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
a blocky kind of outwards sort of fanned

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.910 
a blocky kind of outwards sort of fanned
and<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:21.240> also<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.659> dinosaur<00:01:22.200> has<00:01:22.380> got<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> cube

because we are way too late so we're

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.580 
because we are way too late so we're
just<00:01:44.820> gonna<00:01:45.030> build<00:01:45.180> up<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.600> like<00:01:45.930> as<00:01:46.170> explain

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
just gonna build up I like as explain

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.800 
just gonna build up I like as explain
every<00:01:46.890> single<00:01:47.189> one<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.490> like<00:01:47.670> myself<00:01:47.970> elevated

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
every single one I like myself elevated

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.690 
every single one I like myself elevated
I<00:01:48.960> don't<00:01:49.290> like<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.649> sticking<00:01:49.890> on<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.189> floor<00:01:50.399> so

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
I don't like it sticking on the floor so

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.580 
I don't like it sticking on the floor so
this<00:01:51.360> is<00:01:51.540> just<00:01:51.720> going<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.869> be<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> elevational

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
this is just going to be a elevational

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.590 
this is just going to be a elevational
block<00:01:52.880> and<00:01:53.880> we<00:01:53.970> are<00:01:54.060> going<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.240> start<00:01:54.450> off

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
block and we are going to start off

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.740 
block and we are going to start off
through<00:01:55.259> like<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:56.329> so<00:01:57.329> we're<00:01:57.450> gonna<00:01:57.570> have<00:01:57.689> a

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
through like that so we're gonna have a

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.139 
through like that so we're gonna have a
light<00:01:57.960> brown<00:01:58.200> there<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.799> then<00:01:59.729> we're<00:01:59.909> pretty

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
light brown there and then we're pretty

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.999 
light brown there and then we're pretty
much<00:02:00.509> just<00:02:01.200> going<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.469> be<00:02:01.560> able<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.799> straight

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
much just going to be able to straight

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.830 
much just going to be able to straight
off<00:02:02.130> there<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:02.549> for<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:03.360> we're<00:02:03.540> going<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.689> go

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
off there so for this we're going to go

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.929 
off there so for this we're going to go
to<00:02:03.899> four<00:02:04.619> six<00:02:05.009> we're<00:02:05.340> probably<00:02:05.520> going<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.790> go

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
to four six we're probably going to go

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.300 
to four six we're probably going to go
let's<00:02:06.479> go<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.659> block<00:02:06.930> high<00:02:07.229> again<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:08.610> one<00:02:09.270> two

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
let's go a block high again so one two

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.430 
let's go a block high again so one two
three<00:02:11.480> four

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
three four

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.340 
three four
five<00:02:14.180> six<00:02:15.180> seven<00:02:16.430> eight<00:02:17.660> eight<00:02:18.660> blocks<00:02:19.080> high

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
five six seven eight eight blocks high

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.220 
five six seven eight eight blocks high
now<00:02:20.220> what<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.210> want<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:21.420> do<00:02:21.540> now<00:02:21.720> is<00:02:21.960> basically

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
now what you want to do now is basically

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.970 
now what you want to do now is basically
just<00:02:23.070> connect<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:24.030> darker<00:02:24.960> blocks<00:02:25.230> just

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
just connect the darker blocks just

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.590 
just connect the darker blocks just
around<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.370> other<00:02:26.430> side<00:02:26.550> the<00:02:26.820> black<00:02:27.000> black

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
around the other side the black black

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.400 
around the other side the black black
clay<00:02:27.870> just<00:02:28.830> around<00:02:29.010> these<00:02:29.220> sites<00:02:29.780> however<00:02:30.780> you

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
clay just around these sites however you

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.400 
clay just around these sites however you
want<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.740> do<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:32.390> pretty<00:02:33.390> simple<00:02:33.960> just<00:02:34.140> want<00:02:34.350> to

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
want to do it pretty simple just want to

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.830 
want to do it pretty simple just want to
collect<00:02:34.530> around<00:02:35.100> like<00:02:35.730> so<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.390> that

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
collect around like so and that

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.570 
collect around like so and that
basically<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.500> light<00:02:37.710> one<00:02:37.890> is<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.220> finishing

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
basically the light one is the finishing

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.550 
basically the light one is the finishing
touch<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.180> end<00:02:39.390> do<00:02:39.690> not<00:02:39.870> seal<00:02:40.230> off<00:02:40.410> this

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
touch of the end do not seal off this

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.640 
touch of the end do not seal off this
like<00:02:40.800> this<00:02:41.570> because<00:02:42.570> I<00:02:42.840> mean<00:02:43.050> you<00:02:43.140> can<00:02:43.350> do<00:02:43.530> that

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
like this because I mean you can do that

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.500 
like this because I mean you can do that
a<00:02:43.890> little<00:02:44.310> bit<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.490> finesse<00:02:44.760> bit<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.060> fancy<00:02:45.210> but

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
a little bit of finesse bit of fancy but

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.030 
a little bit of finesse bit of fancy but
we're<00:02:45.630> doing<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:45.960> traditional<00:02:46.110> way<00:02:46.530> which

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
we're doing it the traditional way which

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.770 
we're doing it the traditional way which
is<00:02:47.190> just<00:02:47.220> basically<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.940> standard<00:02:48.360> way<00:02:48.720> you

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
is just basically the standard way you

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.210 
is just basically the standard way you
can<00:02:49.050> mix<00:02:49.320> it<00:02:49.410> up<00:02:49.470> like<00:02:49.740> the<00:02:49.830> bottom<00:02:50.070> of<00:02:50.160> this

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
can mix it up like the bottom of this

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.040 
can mix it up like the bottom of this
one<00:02:50.460> slightly<00:02:51.210> different<00:02:51.630> because<00:02:51.870> of<00:02:51.990> the

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
one slightly different because of the

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.430 
one slightly different because of the
textures<00:02:52.520> so<00:02:53.750> once<00:02:54.750> you've<00:02:54.930> done<00:02:55.110> that<00:02:55.170> you

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
textures so once you've done that you

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.590 
textures so once you've done that you
want<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.650> grab<00:02:55.860> your<00:02:55.890> clay<00:02:56.460> wall<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.210> you<00:02:57.330> want

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
want to grab your clay wall and you want

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.100 
want to grab your clay wall and you want
to<00:02:57.690> put<00:02:57.870> two<00:02:58.260> right<00:02:59.160> next<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.490> this<00:02:59.610> top<00:02:59.820> one<00:03:00.110> so

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
to put two right next to this top one so

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.570 
to put two right next to this top one so
imagine<00:03:01.500> you've<00:03:01.620> got<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.740> cross<00:03:02.040> here<00:03:02.280> you've

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
imagine you've got a cross here you've

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.760 
imagine you've got a cross here you've
got<00:03:02.670> three<00:03:03.120> down<00:03:03.330> three<00:03:03.690> long<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.440> light<00:03:04.590> one

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
got three down three long the light one

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.200 
got three down three long the light one
is<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:05.010> middle<00:03:05.250> one<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.580> then<00:03:06.030> you've<00:03:06.120> got

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
is the middle one and then you've got

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.210 
is the middle one and then you've got
the<00:03:06.270> black<00:03:06.450> stained<00:03:06.810> clay<00:03:07.440> which<00:03:07.740> is<00:03:07.770> just

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
the black stained clay which is just

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.010 
the black stained clay which is just
round<00:03:08.370> here<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.730> four<00:03:09.000> peaks<00:03:09.270> are<00:03:09.540> connected

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
round here the four peaks are connected

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.890 
round here the four peaks are connected
round<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:11.160> want<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.340> put<00:03:11.490> two<00:03:11.910> lighter<00:03:12.510> clays

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
round you want to put two lighter clays

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.670 
round you want to put two lighter clays
right<00:03:13.500> next<00:03:13.800> to<00:03:13.860> each<00:03:13.950> other<00:03:14.130> like<00:03:14.490> so<00:03:14.730> one<00:03:15.150> T

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
right next to each other like so one T

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.900 
right next to each other like so one T
then<00:03:16.680> you<00:03:16.800> want<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:16.980> do<00:03:17.160> what<00:03:17.459> we<00:03:17.580> like<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.760> call

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
then you want to do what we like to call

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.730 
then you want to do what we like to call
the<00:03:18.120> ghosting<00:03:18.510> effect<00:03:18.600> you<00:03:18.900> can<00:03:19.050> put<00:03:19.230> one<00:03:19.500> next

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
the ghosting effect you can put one next

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.640 
the ghosting effect you can put one next
to<00:03:19.950> it<00:03:20.010> and<00:03:20.070> one<00:03:20.250> or<00:03:20.370> cut<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:20.880> middle<00:03:21.120> one<00:03:21.209> out

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
to it and one or cut the middle one out

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.110 
to it and one or cut the middle one out
like<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.770> stare<00:03:23.040> effect<00:03:23.400> you're<00:03:23.760> just<00:03:23.970> in<00:03:24.090> a

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
like the stare effect you're just in a

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.220 
like the stare effect you're just in a
stare<00:03:24.390> straight<00:03:24.630> long<00:03:24.870> again

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
stare straight long again

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.650 
stare straight long again
so<00:03:25.740> another<00:03:25.920> to<00:03:26.190> connecting<00:03:26.670> off<00:03:26.790> that<00:03:26.970> this

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
so another to connecting off that this

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.750 
so another to connecting off that this
is<00:03:27.750> gonna<00:03:27.870> be<00:03:27.990> quite<00:03:28.230> big<00:03:28.500> so<00:03:28.530> we're<00:03:29.430> gonna<00:03:29.550> see

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
is gonna be quite big so we're gonna see

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.270 
is gonna be quite big so we're gonna see
how<00:03:29.820> it<00:03:29.880> goes<00:03:30.320> one<00:03:31.320> along<00:03:31.620> there<00:03:31.830> one<00:03:32.070> along

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
how it goes one along there one along

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.770 
how it goes one along there one along
again<00:03:32.520> so<00:03:32.700> you<00:03:32.760> want<00:03:32.910> to<00:03:33.060> along<00:03:33.330> two<00:03:33.570> up<00:03:33.750> one

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
again so you want to along two up one

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.270 
again so you want to along two up one
long<00:03:35.180> ghost<00:03:36.180> again<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.750> stairs<00:03:37.080> one<00:03:37.980> again

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
long ghost again the stairs one again

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.520 
long ghost again the stairs one again
and<00:03:38.550> then<00:03:38.640> one<00:03:38.940> again<00:03:39.270> so<00:03:39.300> three<00:03:39.959> all<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.440> way

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
and then one again so three all the way

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:41.810 
and then one again so three all the way
up<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:40.800> third<00:03:41.070> one<00:03:41.340> there<00:03:41.490> you<00:03:41.610> want<00:03:41.760> to

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
up the third one there you want to

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.740 
up the third one there you want to
connect<00:03:42.060> another<00:03:42.209> block<00:03:42.690> like<00:03:43.200> so<00:03:44.750> stairs

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
connect another block like so stairs

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.430 
connect another block like so stairs
back<00:03:46.050> down<00:03:46.290> again<00:03:46.650> to<00:03:46.890> two<00:03:47.100> and<00:03:47.660> then<00:03:48.660> now<00:03:48.930> you

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
back down again to two and then now you

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.410 
back down again to two and then now you
can<00:03:49.770> finish<00:03:50.190> off<00:03:50.489> the<00:03:50.640> little<00:03:50.880> bit<00:03:50.970> of<00:03:51.090> handle

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
can finish off the little bit of handle

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.810 
can finish off the little bit of handle
bit<00:03:51.510> should<00:03:51.989> run<00:03:52.320> technically<00:03:52.860> through<00:03:53.310> the

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
bit should run technically through the

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.250 
bit should run technically through the
axe<00:03:54.000> itself<00:03:54.540> so<00:03:54.690> we're<00:03:54.780> just<00:03:54.810> gonna<00:03:54.989> finish

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
axe itself so we're just gonna finish

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.600 
axe itself so we're just gonna finish
