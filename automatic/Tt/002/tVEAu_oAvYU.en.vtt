00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.469
 healthy harmonics with you jason from 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.770
 truman channel gay play real 

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:17.840
 maniacs and the theme of our today's 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:20.119
 podcast latspley battles I do not want 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.590
 I want to let him go but a little 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.500
 other vein first let's 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.900
 deal with my past and call 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.180
 some threw explay cheeks who what 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.310
 It caused a reaction, in principle, I understand 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.949
 what is interesting yes and the audience 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.899
 supported thanks to all those who put 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:38.449
 Like or write a comment Habib that 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.700
 the audience is interesting but what's the answer 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.520
 letplays who are challenging 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.140
 Well, let's start the Undertaker Synod 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.300
 Lenok and indeed wrote that he 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.770
 no license not for playstation not for 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.660
 so he can play 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.820
 Tomatoes behind bars Tomatoes wrote 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.210
 Type that he now in Moscow on the next 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:02.390
 week he will we can hack but i 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.909
 asked him to answer so he got off 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.619
 when I have time with me 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:10.549
 so nobody contacted 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:15.049
 online gamer gamer ryazan went on 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:17.270
 me we talked to or literally in 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.060
 during noon vkontakte he did not answer 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.280
 and then she stopped responding sharply though 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.450
 these are the enemies of this battle i have gained 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:29.150
 they canapka even such a setup 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.670
 turned out to build bear carry trivialities 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.360
 in general, he seemed to agree at first 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:37.009
 and then merged somewhere well 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.070
 final tactics 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.350
 Basically no answer at all yes and 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.710
 line is not the same 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.170
 you are an absolute absolute silence guys this 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.509
 uninteresting apparently 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.500
 my message didn't get to them when I 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.670
 drew it in all possible sources 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.430
 contacts that could only 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.130
 find and I again I know that 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.830
 my subscribers and our total subscribers 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.730
 or fans of those letsplayshchikov reported but 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.890
 similar ideas in general none of this 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:14.400
 it came out then we played the bottom kairosh 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:17.400
 explay channel principle for march aliya 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.860
 specializes if as can be said 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.740
 there to girlish zadrachivat so actively 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.230
 I advise you to play a lot of fun 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.110
 By the way everyone who has not seen you go 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.110
 playlist is our online fight we often 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.420
 were onizuka extremalka was fun 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.090
 the gift I kicked my ass but it does not 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.830
 this process is less fun on this bellow 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.300
 how is it still because of problems with 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.400
 by sound 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.770
 it's the little things in the organizational 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.070
 Basically, it was great in general, why am I 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:53.060
 I thought maybe we need to do 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:55.670
 the following seems to me maybe if the display 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.650
 don't answer well don't know maybe and or not 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.890
 interested let us be 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.840
 attract interested people 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.090
 we respect subscribers, I will probably turn to 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.860
 you if you have laziness in mind 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.640
 surely you watch the other channel to 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.010
 the place 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.519
 arshin so unique you look 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.599
 other channels and maybe you would like 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.870
 see the fight 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:21.560
 Jason Well, I mean, my fight with 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:24.230
 other letlepleyschikam probably I ask 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.440
 you somehow 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:31.069
 bring their play gave cheek to someone to fight 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:34.340
 you wanted to see with me 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.200
 link to this video and in general can 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.540
 explain the idea of â€‹â€‹people just simply 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.180
 We release three fights on any platform 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:46.040
 go to vkh not at playstation and xbox 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:49.580
 Vlad is perhaps just as in 3 different 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.830
 characters oh just who wins one 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.959
 will win and it will be fun great i want 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.099
 develop this theme explay battle to you 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.410
 pimples fought 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.370
 so that the deadly battle we have united 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.410
 the only condition 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.420
 which I would like to adhere to 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.049
 channel that challenges me will 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.760
 30 thousand movie subscribers at least 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:10.790
 30 thousand in my opinion so good 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.440
 a figure like that most people will have 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.440
 opportunity to play with me 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.780
 deliver you spectacular performances and 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.860
 pleasure from seeing in general and those 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.560
 simply 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:25.860
 Clearly your help is required. Dear game. 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.420
 maniacs let's get some sleep i'm 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.460
 principle must surely some 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.980
 sources about are watching my channel and wanted 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.320
 would take part in a similar carnage 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.170
 Well, let's adequately the whole thing 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.270
 perceive and we throw a threat in any way 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.880
 do not bandage salta I hope you 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.830
 ass I'll trample I'll destroy you from 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.170
 here is such an ancestor then I am with such 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.770
 I just don't communicate with people and no no 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.110
 interesting 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.870
 it is clear that the person is inadequate in general 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.970
 an idea is living an idea I will try to develop 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.590
 I hope you will help me with this 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.900
