00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:20.029
 pater noster yes if you read engine 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.189
 action 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.870
 this song on which will also be 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.270
 shoot a clip 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.830
 they founded bourem it's one of the big 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.809
 themes of classical music from 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.910
 symphony of the new world of langeac 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.129
 think that one segnora had to sweat a little 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.350
 little to place the lyrics also 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.809
 on on both the rhythm and the 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.760
 melody his choice was to draw inspiration 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.309
 strongly from a biblical text of 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.070
 prophet Isaiah what is really a 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.830
 announcement of what can be expected from 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.950
 best for humanity with words 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.860
 and symbolic images of peace from 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.430
 concord and this field is deeply a 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.430
 fields of hope 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.070
 that's how do you mean hello 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.369
 with whom we shot 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.570
 debate of the very beautiful cnet 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:30.310
 during this time we will make a 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.020
 plan of drones with a human chain 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.450
 and so we can go on with 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:39.880
 your first playback that will be done on 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:42.909
 the mound groen hello just 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.189
 yes we're just going to montella on the small 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.380
 butte in that direction like that we 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:53.159
 in addition we will rather have this backdrop behind 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.159
 you some magistrates back to 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.390
 Paris 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.940
 wash us 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.270
 advance 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.270
 the 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.730
 2 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.710
 today 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:07.710
 Dallier 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.150
 descending 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.480
 it's the 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.319
 I do not know about water 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.319
 tournament 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.210
 Oh 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.210
 it 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.500
 it's pretty hard to describe a 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.510
 text on a music that did not have 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.570
 been planned to carry a text 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.450
 so here it is an exercise but good 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.820
 when I finished we are happy but 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.650
 forty years it must be done is 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.810
 particularly arduous but good at the same 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.920
 time we always have fun doing 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.920
 a little difficult things 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.390
 Oh 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:18.720
 it's here 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.340
 Oh 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.610
 it's amazing since up to 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:43.860
 now that we do not have the side of your 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:45.000
 passage to doha in a beautiful setting 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.910
 frankly very good to go to the 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.180
 meeting of several people and 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.180
 power 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.950
 to denigrate her 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.900
 maybe some messages in some 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.040
 lyrics are neither in the songs are we going 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.670
 remove the top 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.340
 and then we have the right I took it by 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:05.890
 do like since there will be the release of 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.110
 montcuq the last person in the chain 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.360
 lampoon will be monseigneur di falco account 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.220
 he drops everyone looks at this 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.940
 last job and that was a little 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.940
 better 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.169
 we know 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.720
 then simple 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.180
 season 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.540
 messages from the past through 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.930
 his songs are the same as those of 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:42.720
 previous albums namely sharing 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.180
 love the welcome of others do not 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.700
 judge do not condemn do not reject 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.490
 think these are themes of values 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:53.360
 which everyone is attached to 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.360
 universal values 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.229
