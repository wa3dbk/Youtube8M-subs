and<00:00:23.810> we're<00:00:24.810> looking<00:00:24.900> up<00:00:25.080> at<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.289> Rocky

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
and we're looking up at the Rocky

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.310 
and we're looking up at the Rocky
Mountains<00:00:25.980> what<00:00:26.189> an<00:00:26.310> amazing<00:00:26.939> view<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.510> for

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
Mountains what an amazing view and for

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.080 
Mountains what an amazing view and for
those<00:00:28.410> who<00:00:28.470> saw<00:00:28.890> velocity<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.609> actually<00:00:29.910> see

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
those who saw velocity you actually see

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.780 
those who saw velocity you actually see
those<00:00:30.619> thrust<00:00:31.619> lines<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.250> mountain<00:00:32.610> from

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
those thrust lines in the mountain from

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.330 
those thrust lines in the mountain from
the<00:00:33.510> tectonic<00:00:33.870> plate<00:00:34.260> movement<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.890> formed

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
the tectonic plate movement that formed

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.280 
the tectonic plate movement that formed
the<00:00:35.550> rocky<00:00:36.000> mountain<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.840> mountain<00:00:37.110> face

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
the rocky mountain in the mountain face

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.410 
the rocky mountain in the mountain face
the<00:00:38.160> cliff<00:00:38.399> side<00:00:38.430> up<00:00:38.700> there<00:00:38.850> beautiful

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
the cliff side up there beautiful

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.709 
the cliff side up there beautiful
spectacular<00:00:40.110> then<00:00:40.710> you've<00:00:40.860> also<00:00:40.950> got<00:00:41.719> some

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.000 
spectacular then you've also got some
more<00:00:42.840> outcropping<00:00:43.379> rocks<00:00:43.559> over<00:00:43.770> there<00:00:43.800> as

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
more outcropping rocks over there as

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.979 
more outcropping rocks over there as
well<00:00:44.190> which<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.430> formed<00:00:44.670> by<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.989> tectonic

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
well which is formed by the tectonic

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.529 
well which is formed by the tectonic
plate<00:00:46.350> movement<00:00:46.379> this<00:00:46.890> side<00:00:47.129> well<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
plate movement this side well the the

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.540 
plate movement this side well the the
east<00:00:48.690> side<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.170> Rockies<00:00:49.559> went<00:00:50.039> down<00:00:50.280> and

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
east side of the Rockies went down and

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.250 
east side of the Rockies went down and
the<00:00:50.640> west<00:00:50.820> side<00:00:50.969> went<00:00:51.210> over<00:00:51.449> near<00:00:51.780> Vancouver

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
the west side went over near Vancouver

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.930 
the west side went over near Vancouver
and<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.980> sort<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.160> form<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.430> beautiful<00:00:53.789> Rocky

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
and it sort of form the beautiful Rocky

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.220 
and it sort of form the beautiful Rocky
Mountains<00:00:54.329> but<00:00:54.360> yeah<00:00:54.600> as<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.840> can<00:00:54.899> see<00:00:55.079> we're

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
Mountains but yeah as you can see we're

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.670 
Mountains but yeah as you can see we're
sending<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.559> bit<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:56.870> bit<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.960> solid<00:00:58.320> ice<00:00:58.469> here

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
sending a bit of bit of solid ice here

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.869 
sending a bit of bit of solid ice here
that's<00:00:58.800> accumulated<00:00:59.039> on<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.489> side<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.730> the

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
that's accumulated on the side of the

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.660 
that's accumulated on the side of the
river<00:01:00.000> but<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.109> an<00:01:01.199> amazing<00:01:01.440> spot<00:01:01.890> and

river but this is an amazing spot and
we're<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:03.000> bear<00:01:03.180> country<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.350> don't<00:01:04.500> really

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
we're in bear country and I don't really

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.230 
we're in bear country and I don't really
will<00:01:04.769> get<00:01:04.920> even<00:01:05.040> by<00:01:05.220> bears<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:05.790> hopefully<00:01:06.210> I

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
will get even by bears so hopefully I

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.030 
will get even by bears so hopefully I
shouldn't<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.750> shouldn't<00:01:07.260> really<00:01:07.650> but<00:01:07.950> then

let see if I could skim a rock holy

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.859 
let see if I could skim a rock holy
that<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:13.890> just<00:01:14.450> consolidated<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.570> little<00:01:15.780> bit

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
that I just consolidated a little bit

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.539 
that I just consolidated a little bit
let's<00:01:15.960> see<00:01:16.049> if<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.229> can<00:01:16.259> skim<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.710> Oh<00:01:19.400> beer<00:01:20.400> the

let's see if I can skim it Oh beer the

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.090 
let's see if I can skim it Oh beer the
fly<00:01:20.700> scheme<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.180> yeah<00:01:21.450> let's<00:01:21.750> write<00:01:21.840> again

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
fly scheme that yeah let's write again

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.740 
fly scheme that yeah let's write again
come<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.130> rock<00:01:23.400> look<00:01:23.580> at<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.210> um<00:01:24.509> this

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
come a rock look at this this is um this

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.990 
come a rock look at this this is um this
all<00:01:24.900> used<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.200> be<00:01:25.320> rock<00:01:25.729> but<00:01:26.729> then<00:01:26.850> there's

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
all used to be rock but then there's

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.370 
all used to be rock but then there's
just<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.360> oh<00:01:27.689> like<00:01:27.780> skimming<00:01:28.049> again<00:01:30.380> so

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
just this oh like skimming again so

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.840 
just this oh like skimming again so
this<00:01:31.530> ruler<00:01:31.799> obviously<00:01:32.310> would<00:01:32.610> have<00:01:32.729> been

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
this ruler obviously would have been

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.740 
this ruler obviously would have been
formed<00:01:33.299> due<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.110> UM<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:35.360> bloody<00:01:36.360> snow

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
formed due to the UM the bloody snow

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.539 
formed due to the UM the bloody snow
melting<00:01:37.229> off<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.470> off<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.650> Rocky<00:01:38.159> Mountains
