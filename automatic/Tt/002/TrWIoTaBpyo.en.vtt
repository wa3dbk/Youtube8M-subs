00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.830
 most evil was chosen and treshka of all 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:10.019
 serial bmw m3 then we noted that 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.539
 equipped with a powerful 420 engine 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.879
 one and a half ton machine capable of 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:15.869
 impossible impossible and not really 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:17.400
 need and in the city 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.949
 and if so, then reveal the potential 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.810
 these cars should only 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.650
 specially prepared training ground 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.439
 that we are for you and deals and so on 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.890
 2008 one day the most powerful 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.890
 BMW cars 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.930
 bmp company makes the car and it's not 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.000
 news 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.190
 what about the fact that besides that they 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.620
 miss free weapon sale 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.080
 mass destruction and she shoots 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.930
 amazement is the main task 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.050
 bavarian warheads with the letter m and im it 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.120
 succeeds with a high degree of accuracy 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.400
 There are 3 types of nature 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.610
 shells from BMW m3 for young shooters 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.830
 m5 snipers for their fathers 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.690
 pit stop of your military sports career 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:07.830
 and m6 as the apotheosis of the universal blue dream 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.490
 large-caliber shell filled 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.259
 adrenaline to failure yes all three like 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.930
 on the selection and we have today 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:18.090
 check this trinity for aptitude 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.580
 and the ability to adapt to peaceful 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.090
 life is extremely difficult task for both 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.399
 parties 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.830
 but still military training 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.970
 BMW models under command of the program 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.400
 auto-lines are declared open 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.800
 bmw m3 immediately gets a prize for 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.810
 The value clarity truthfulness and sharpness 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.550
 steering the little nimble coupe 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.940
 equipped with a completely non-childish 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.250
 engine producing 420 horsepower and 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.770
 the red zone on his tachometer begins 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.410
 from 8400 rpm 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.290
 m3 appears in several guises coupe 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.420
 sedan and convertible they are all incredible 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.790
 fast and tough thanks to sports 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.530
 pendants are superb pass on 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.810
 high speeds we managed 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.870
 perform this exercise more than 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.390
 100 kilometers per hour out of a possible 250 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.490
 road test in 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.890
 traffic police at this speed we definitely do not 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.530
 would take the following and next with us 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.470
 will be brutal from office monotony 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.990
 business-class sedan bmw m5 his 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.450
 civil modification also visited 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:25.020
 on our test in all-wheel drive version 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.150
 530 x and very comfortable 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.950
 comfortable but not too drivery 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.950
 car what we see before us 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:36.330
 Now other than insanity can not be called 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.910
 v10 engine power is no longer 420 and 507 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.650
 horses agile machine CIS 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.930
 switching faster than any 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.410
 professional race driver and again 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.019
 this dull mark of limiter is 250 and not 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.300
 kilometer more at this speed and so 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.640
 any death clash is like so 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.280
 what if u puts a fool proof so 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.630
 at around 60 on this car 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.850
 I want to go 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.340
 they get out say on the common roads 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.370
 do not use you completely 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.620
 right but we are on the ground by the way overclocking 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.720
 Allow to 60 kilometers per hour at 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.640
 this rocket takes exactly 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.130
 as long as it takes 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.330
 to take a look at the speedometer and remove 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.390
 foot off the gas pedal 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.510
 we managed to test both variations of m 5 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.130
 and sedan and wagon diagnosis they are both 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.920
 very sick and on 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.040
 like it but now the icon of glamor 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.850
 pathos and design bmw m6 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.020
 anti-aircraft gun with pink bows 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.650
 aerodynamic thingies in a circle and 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.900
 inside without you talking this car 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.080
 give head to clipping that baron 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.000
 munhausen when they were fired from a cannon 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.140
 experienced the same sensations as us 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.550
 in m6 at start up with large dimensions 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.450
 less overloads are experienced 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.650
 the speed then remains the same here the same 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.780
 507 horses 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.090
 but sometimes the driver doesn't need all the power 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.760
 engine and maximum dynamism 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.180
 BMW M6 for example in urban conditions 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.560
 movement so after starting the engine 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.530
 automatically turns on underlined 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.110
 comfortable program p400 which 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.870
 uses 400 horsepower but only 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.970
 just pressing the power button is enough 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.760
 to get my order all 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.920
 power resulting pedal kinematics 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.260
 accelerator changes to the side more 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.140
 responsiveness that allows 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.690
 Program p500 enjoy sports and 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:34.880
 in the p500 program sport is uncompromising 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.880
 the racing character of this car 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.730
 today we just touched 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.980
 m series topics from bmw 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.510
 but in our future releases we are not yet 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.850
 time back to these amazing 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:50.620
 car and be sure to tell you about 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.620
 each of them in more detail
