00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.669
 It's a setup. 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:30.859
 Even in settings 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:32.870

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.760
 One of the features that the hp 2 working model has is 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.220

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:35.080
 It was planned. 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.340
 next 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.300
 There are two systems

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.520
 And 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.129
 The fact is 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.399
 uneasy 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.009
 The big feature is 500 mega 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.920

 About one time 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:34.609
 Thursday part of the week is authentic. Also 

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:38.979
 It gives a soft tm. 

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:42.139
 But after a little break 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:43.599
 Looking at keywords 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.589
 Before you click on the schedule,

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.429
 I'm afraid there's such a thing. 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:58.519
 I got a truck with a star. 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.519

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:45.459
 It is added. 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.639
 I have only been concerned about grades in these areas. 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:49.579

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.020
 Could it be the target contrast? 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.409
 Location 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:12.509

 It is close to me now, but the opening song itself in Japan 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.539
 As soon as it is realized, 

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:47.839
 Do you think it should be a muster? 

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:50.120
 the problem is 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.120
