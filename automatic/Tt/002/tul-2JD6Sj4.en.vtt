I<00:01:50.630> guess<00:01:51.630> because<00:01:51.840> that's<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.710> blame<00:01:52.860> the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
I guess because that's to blame the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.530 
I guess because that's to blame the
Treasury<00:01:53.549> when<00:01:53.790> they<00:01:53.880> finally<00:01:54.149> figure<00:01:54.509> out

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
Treasury when they finally figure out

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.450 
Treasury when they finally figure out
that<00:01:54.810> there<00:01:54.960> isn't<00:01:55.110> any<00:01:55.409> gold<00:01:55.680> in<00:01:56.040> Fort<00:01:56.340> Knox

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
that there isn't any gold in Fort Knox

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.370 
that there isn't any gold in Fort Knox

up<00:02:02.460> for<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.880> fun<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.390> partly<00:02:04.079> because<00:02:04.229> I

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
up for the fun of it partly because I

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.649 
up for the fun of it partly because I
just<00:02:05.250> trust<00:02:05.579> governor's<00:02:06.000> not<00:02:06.149> because<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.509> know

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
just trust governor's not because I know

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.229 
just trust governor's not because I know
anything<00:02:07.439> but<00:02:08.039> if<00:02:08.129> they<00:02:08.250> really<00:02:08.489> had<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.000> gold

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
anything but if they really had the gold

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.339 
anything but if they really had the gold
there<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.720> don't<00:02:09.780> think<00:02:09.959> they<00:02:10.140> should<00:02:10.170> be

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
there I don't think they should be

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.140 
there I don't think they should be
afraid<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:11.009> hawed<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.430> haven't<00:02:11.700> done<00:02:11.730> one

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
afraid and hawed it and haven't done one

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.940 
afraid and hawed it and haven't done one
it's<00:02:12.780> probable<00:02:13.500> that

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
it's probable that

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.500 
it's probable that
central<00:02:14.310> banks<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.760> world<00:02:14.970> have<00:02:15.180> been<00:02:15.270> lying

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
central banks the world have been lying

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.420 
central banks the world have been lying
to<00:02:15.720> all<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:16.050> us<00:02:16.140> about<00:02:16.319> their<00:02:17.099> eventual

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
to all of us about their eventual

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.369 
to all of us about their eventual
potential<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.300> returning<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.870> gold<00:02:19.140> dinner

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
potential of returning to a gold dinner

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:20.720 
potential of returning to a gold dinner
because<00:02:19.560> they<00:02:19.739> probably<00:02:19.950> don't<00:02:20.280> have<00:02:20.459> the

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
because they probably don't have the

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.330 
because they probably don't have the
gold<00:02:20.910> that's<00:02:21.690> totally<00:02:22.349> unjustified<00:02:22.769> opinion

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
gold that's totally unjustified opinion

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.650 
gold that's totally unjustified opinion
probably<00:02:23.519> inappropriate<00:02:24.209> for<00:02:24.360> public

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
probably inappropriate for public

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.470 
probably inappropriate for public
consumption<00:02:25.319> but<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:26.250> shows<00:02:26.550> my<00:02:26.790> attitude<00:02:27.300> of

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
consumption but it shows my attitude of

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.320 
consumption but it shows my attitude of
mistrust<00:02:27.959> for<00:02:28.170> these<00:02:28.319> guys<00:02:28.819> that's<00:02:29.819> amazing

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
mistrust for these guys that's amazing

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.580 
mistrust for these guys that's amazing
because<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.780> was<00:02:30.930> watching<00:02:31.290> The<00:02:31.440> History

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
because I was watching The History

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.620 
because I was watching The History
Channel<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.190> other<00:02:32.400> night<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.940> it<00:02:33.360> was<00:02:33.480> all

on Fort Knox and it was called America's

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.990 
on Fort Knox and it was called America's
Book<00:02:36.840> of<00:02:37.050> Secrets<00:02:37.110> is<00:02:37.739> there<00:02:38.400> really<00:02:38.730> gold

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
Book of Secrets is there really gold

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.509 
Book of Secrets is there really gold
there<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.450> last<00:02:39.660> time<00:02:39.930> that<00:02:39.959> they

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
there and the last time that they

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.759 
there and the last time that they
audited<00:02:41.519> or<00:02:41.760> they<00:02:42.150> took<00:02:42.360> a<00:02:42.420> couple<00:02:42.769> Congress

audited or they took a couple Congress

audited or they took a couple Congress
people<00:02:44.099> I<00:02:44.190> think<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.549> was<00:02:44.670> in<00:02:44.879> early<00:02:45.540> 70s

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
people I think it was in early 70s

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.460 
people I think it was in early 70s
because<00:02:47.090> Nixon<00:02:48.090> was<00:02:48.269> president<00:02:48.299> and<00:02:48.989> they

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
because Nixon was president and they

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.229 
because Nixon was president and they
took<00:02:49.769> him<00:02:50.040> into<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.549> vault<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:50.940> they<00:02:51.000> showed

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
took him into the vault and they showed

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.670 
took him into the vault and they showed
him<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.480> room<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:51.780> there<00:02:51.900> was<00:02:51.959> actually<00:02:52.349> gold

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
him a room and there was actually gold

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.259 
him a room and there was actually gold
bars<00:02:52.950> there<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.280> mean<00:02:53.549> they<00:02:53.700> didn't<00:02:53.940> show<00:02:54.120> him

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
bars there I mean they didn't show him

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.270 
bars there I mean they didn't show him
everything<00:02:54.540> but<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:55.470> was<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.860> last<00:02:56.040> time

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
everything but that was the last time

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.160 
everything but that was the last time
anybody's<00:02:56.790> ever<00:02:56.910> even<00:02:57.269> seen<00:02:57.599> the<00:02:57.780> gold<00:02:57.989> I

anybody's ever even seen the gold I

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.690 
anybody's ever even seen the gold I
don't<00:02:58.260> even<00:02:58.470> think<00:02:58.799> that<00:02:58.829> somebody<00:02:59.519> in

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
don't even think that somebody in

don't even think that somebody in

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
government knows where that gold is or

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.759 
government knows where that gold is or

sheet in terms of how we cover that gold
it<00:03:12.930> almost<00:03:13.140> looks<00:03:13.530> more<00:03:13.620> like<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.040> liability

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
it almost looks more like a liability

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.880 
it almost looks more like a liability
maybe<00:03:15.090> we're<00:03:15.660> keeping<00:03:16.079> it<00:03:16.230> but<00:03:16.470> maybe<00:03:16.650> it's

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
maybe we're keeping it but maybe it's

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.949 
maybe we're keeping it but maybe it's

and<00:03:19.350> that's<00:03:19.680> why<00:03:19.980> I<00:03:20.010> brought<00:03:20.340> this<00:03:20.519> up<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:21.389> I

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
and that's why I brought this up that I

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.390 
and that's why I brought this up that I
don't<00:03:21.900> trust<00:03:22.139> but<00:03:22.410> Bernanke<00:03:22.889> was<00:03:23.040> sort<00:03:23.310> of

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
don't trust but Bernanke was sort of

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.270 
don't trust but Bernanke was sort of
thinking<00:03:24.209> lack<00:03:24.900> of<00:03:25.079> knowledge<00:03:25.560> there<00:03:25.950> on

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
thinking lack of knowledge there on

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.940 
thinking lack of knowledge there on
something<00:03:26.910> as<00:03:27.120> crucial<00:03:27.540> as<00:03:27.840> this<00:03:28.170> he<00:03:28.769> knows

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
something he just doesn't want to talk

something he just doesn't want to talk
about<00:03:30.750> it<00:03:30.989> that's<00:03:31.440> my<00:03:31.590> point<00:03:31.799> no<00:03:32.190> and<00:03:32.220> I<00:03:32.670> think

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
about it that's my point no and I think

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.670 
about it that's my point no and I think
this<00:03:33.060> is<00:03:33.239> one<00:03:33.389> of<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.569> reasons<00:03:33.959> that<00:03:34.049> it's

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
this is one of the reasons that it's

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.590 
this is one of the reasons that it's
making<00:03:35.100> it<00:03:35.280> very<00:03:35.489> difficult<00:03:35.819> for<00:03:36.150> a<00:03:36.329> lot<00:03:36.359> of

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
making it very difficult for a lot of

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.210 
making it very difficult for a lot of
businesses<00:03:37.109> today<00:03:37.440> they<00:03:37.620> don't<00:03:37.769> know<00:03:38.010> what

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
businesses today they don't know what

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.400 
businesses today they don't know what
tax<00:03:38.549> policy<00:03:39.090> is<00:03:39.150> going<00:03:39.359> to<00:03:39.420> be<00:03:39.600> they<00:03:40.200> don't

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
tax policy is going to be they don't

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.410 
tax policy is going to be they don't
know<00:03:40.620> what<00:03:40.799> regulation<00:03:41.549> policies<00:03:42.090> are<00:03:42.269> going

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
know what regulation policies are going

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.729 
know what regulation policies are going
to<00:03:42.480> be<00:03:42.600> I<00:03:42.630> mean<00:03:42.900> look<00:03:43.019> at<00:03:43.079> all<00:03:43.170> the<00:03:43.350> things<00:03:43.560> that

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
to be I mean look at all the things that

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.830 
to be I mean look at all the things that

about Argentina which states its

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
inflation rate is 10

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.110 
inflation rate is 10
when<00:04:27.289> everybody<00:04:27.620> knows<00:04:27.710> it's<00:04:28.190> 20<00:04:28.639> the<00:04:28.880> law

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
when everybody knows it's 20 the law

when everybody knows it's 20 the law
that<00:04:29.389> an<00:04:29.509> economist<00:04:30.169> can't<00:04:30.560> produce<00:04:31.400> his<00:04:31.699> own

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
that an economist can't produce his own

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.120 
that an economist can't produce his own
guesstimate<00:04:32.660> of<00:04:32.840> inflation<00:04:33.500> because<00:04:33.919> that

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
guesstimate of inflation because that

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.230 
guesstimate of inflation because that
would<00:04:34.280> be<00:04:34.430> illegal<00:04:34.610> I<00:04:35.860> mean<00:04:36.860> beyond<00:04:37.759> beyond

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
would be illegal I mean beyond beyond

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.059 
would be illegal I mean beyond beyond
even<00:04:38.780> sensibility

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:40.069 
even sensibility

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:42.040 
even sensibility
yeah<00:04:40.400> and<00:04:40.639> that<00:04:40.759> we'll<00:04:40.910> talk<00:04:41.599> about<00:04:41.840> that

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
yeah and that we'll talk about that

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.990 
yeah and that we'll talk about that
there's<00:04:42.349> a<00:04:42.410> bill<00:04:42.710> before<00:04:43.039> Congress<00:04:43.639> right<00:04:43.729> now

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
there's a bill before Congress right now

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.180 
there's a bill before Congress right now
to<00:04:44.060> make<00:04:44.300> it<00:04:44.449> illegal<00:04:44.750> to<00:04:44.930> protest<00:04:45.530> at<00:04:45.770> any

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
to make it illegal to protest at any

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.670 
to make it illegal to protest at any
event<00:04:46.639> where<00:04:47.240> let's<00:04:47.930> say<00:04:48.020> a<00:04:48.110> congressperson

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
event where let's say a congressperson

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.339 
event where let's say a congressperson
is<00:04:49.099> that<00:04:49.340> yeah<00:04:50.270> they<00:04:50.449> don't<00:04:50.569> want<00:04:50.660> you<00:04:50.900> to<00:04:51.199> be

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:51.349 
is that yeah they don't want you to be

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:53.140 
is that yeah they don't want you to be
protesting<00:04:52.009> at<00:04:52.130> a<00:04:52.160> town<00:04:52.430> hall<00:04:52.669> meeting<00:04:52.699> I

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.150 
protesting at a town hall meeting I

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.790 
protesting at a town hall meeting I
guess<00:04:53.330> you<00:04:53.479> can<00:04:53.599> get<00:04:53.780> arrested<00:04:54.199> in<00:04:54.349> the<00:04:54.470> future

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
guess you can get arrested in the future

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.960 
guess you can get arrested in the future
that's<00:04:55.639> basically<00:04:56.599> how<00:04:57.190> oppression<00:04:58.190> starts

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
that's basically how oppression starts

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.870 
that's basically how oppression starts
out<00:04:59.180> when<00:05:00.080> governments<00:05:00.590> get<00:05:00.740> desperate<00:05:01.669> they

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
out when governments get desperate they

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.180 
out when governments get desperate they
start<00:05:02.180> getting<00:05:02.380> oppressive<00:05:03.380> and<00:05:03.590> we're

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
start getting oppressive and we're

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.649 
start getting oppressive and we're
starting<00:05:04.490> to<00:05:04.550> see<00:05:04.610> more<00:05:04.729> and<00:05:05.060> more<00:05:05.210> evidence

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:05.659 
starting to see more and more evidence

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:07.779 
starting to see more and more evidence
of<00:05:05.840> it<00:05:05.990> which<00:05:06.229> is<00:05:06.470> I<00:05:06.770> guess<00:05:07.280> one<00:05:07.610> of<00:05:07.639> the

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:07.789 
of it which is I guess one of the

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:09.760 
of it which is I guess one of the
reasons<00:05:08.060> but<00:05:08.300> it's<00:05:08.780> it's<00:05:09.050> probably<00:05:09.500> for

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
reasons but it's it's probably for

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.460 
reasons but it's it's probably for
safety<00:05:10.190> sake<00:05:10.370> you<00:05:10.610> gotta<00:05:10.819> own<00:05:11.419> hard<00:05:11.960> assets

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
safety sake you gotta own hard assets

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:13.930 
safety sake you gotta own hard assets
because<00:05:12.800> the<00:05:12.979> paper<00:05:13.190> that<00:05:13.490> you<00:05:13.580> have<00:05:13.610> in<00:05:13.849> your

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
because the paper that you have in your

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.710 
because the paper that you have in your
wallet<00:05:14.150> is<00:05:14.509> depreciating<00:05:15.199> every<00:05:15.440> day<00:05:16.720> a

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 
wallet is depreciating every day a

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.080 
wallet is depreciating every day a
little<00:05:18.289> comment<00:05:18.830> because<00:05:19.009> it<00:05:19.370> just<00:05:19.580> happened

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
little comment because it just happened

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.450 
this last yesterday a hundred dollar
drop<00:05:24.020> in<00:05:24.259> the<00:05:24.409> price<00:05:24.740> of<00:05:24.770> gold

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
drop in the price of gold

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.420 
drop in the price of gold
normally<00:05:26.180> that<00:05:26.210> would<00:05:26.479> scare<00:05:27.050> me<00:05:27.080> and<00:05:27.560> I<00:05:28.220> would

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
normally that would scare me and I would

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:29.680 
normally that would scare me and I would
say<00:05:28.610> gee<00:05:28.849> there<00:05:29.030> must<00:05:29.180> be<00:05:29.330> something

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
say gee there must be something

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.149 
say gee there must be something
happening<00:05:29.840> that<00:05:30.289> I<00:05:30.319> don't<00:05:30.620> know<00:05:30.860> about

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:31.159 
happening that I don't know about

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:34.779 
happening that I don't know about
because<00:05:31.639> my<00:05:31.940> view<00:05:32.330> is<00:05:32.630> that<00:05:33.020> gold<00:05:33.530> is<00:05:33.830> one<00:05:34.639> of

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:34.789 
because my view is that gold is one of

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:37.689 
because my view is that gold is one of
the<00:05:34.880> pious<00:05:35.889> salvation<00:05:36.889> points<00:05:37.250> that<00:05:37.490> people

the pious salvation points that people

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:41.230 
the pious salvation points that people
like<00:05:38.690> us<00:05:38.900> you<00:05:39.380> and<00:05:39.560> me<00:05:39.620> with<00:05:39.949> savings<00:05:40.610> can<00:05:41.030> be

like us you and me with savings can be

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.990

this<00:05:44.180> financial<00:05:44.780> repression<00:05:45.110> we<00:05:45.469> should<00:05:45.680> hold

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
this financial repression we should hold

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.760 
this financial repression we should hold
precious<00:05:46.280> metals<00:05:46.900> as<00:05:47.900> protection<00:05:48.469> against

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:52.689 
destruction of the paper currency system
but<00:05:51.169> think<00:05:51.440> about<00:05:51.650> it<00:05:51.770> I<00:05:51.800> mean<00:05:51.949> this<00:05:52.130> was<00:05:52.370> one

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:52.699 
but think about it I mean this was one

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:55.480 
but think about it I mean this was one
trade<00:05:53.210> at<00:05:53.449> 10,000<00:05:54.380> contracts<00:05:55.039> which<00:05:55.460> is

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.290 
million ounces
all<00:05:57.319> right<00:05:57.710> seemed<00:05:58.130> to<00:05:58.250> be<00:05:58.370> timed<00:05:58.759> right<00:05:59.150> at

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 
all right seemed to be timed right at

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.180 
all right seemed to be timed right at
the<00:05:59.389> time<00:05:59.630> Bernanke<00:06:00.380> was<00:06:00.500> talking<00:06:00.919> so<00:06:01.130> it

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
the time Bernanke was talking so it

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.950 
the time Bernanke was talking so it
could<00:06:01.340> be<00:06:01.460> blamed<00:06:01.759> on<00:06:02.000> Bernanke<00:06:02.330> or<00:06:02.599> something

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
could be blamed on Bernanke or something

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.930 
could be blamed on Bernanke or something
I<00:06:03.080> don't<00:06:03.259> think<00:06:03.319> Bernanke<00:06:04.099> said<00:06:04.460> anything

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
I don't think Bernanke said anything

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.820 
I don't think Bernanke said anything
that<00:06:05.120> important<00:06:05.599> but<00:06:06.169> the<00:06:06.349> point<00:06:06.530> I<00:06:06.680> was

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
that important but the point I was

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.850 
that important but the point I was
trying<00:06:06.889> to<00:06:07.069> get<00:06:07.219> to<00:06:07.280> is<00:06:07.940> there<00:06:08.569> will<00:06:08.840> be<00:06:08.870> times

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
trying to get to is there will be times

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.029 
trying to get to is there will be times
when<00:06:10.219> our<00:06:10.580> own<00:06:11.000> faith<00:06:11.449> might<00:06:11.780> be<00:06:12.080> questioned

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 
when our own faith might be questioned

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.339 
when our own faith might be questioned
but<00:06:13.639> I<00:06:13.699> think<00:06:14.000> you<00:06:14.120> and<00:06:14.300> I<00:06:14.389> have<00:06:15.110> enough

people buying and I think that's

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:45.520 
people buying and I think that's
something<00:07:44.510> that<00:07:44.690> they're<00:07:45.020> not<00:07:45.230> going<00:07:45.380> to<00:07:45.410> be

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:45.530 
something that they're not going to be

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.200 
something that they're not going to be
able<00:07:45.620> to<00:07:45.740> control<00:07:46.130> in<00:07:46.250> other<00:07:46.340> words<00:07:46.610> it's<00:07:46.910> the

able to control in other words it's the

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.750 
able to control in other words it's the
fiscal<00:07:47.750> market<00:07:48.140> is<00:07:48.280> eventually<00:07:49.280> going<00:07:49.640> to

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:49.760 
fiscal market is eventually going to

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.240 
fiscal market is eventually going to
take<00:07:50.300> control<00:07:50.690> from<00:07:51.140> the<00:07:51.290> paper<00:07:51.500> market<00:07:52.070> and

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:52.250 
take control from the paper market and

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:54.430 
take control from the paper market and
overwhelm<00:07:53.090> it<00:07:53.270> and<00:07:53.450> I<00:07:53.570> guess<00:07:53.810> that's<00:07:54.200> a<00:07:54.410> good

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:54.440
