so this should be the last bit of
benchmarking<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.290> do<00:01:07.350> for<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.710> little<00:01:07.799> while<00:01:07.979> on

next thing I'm going to do is just going
on<00:01:18.630> as<00:01:18.720> much<00:01:18.869> mark<00:01:19.340> alright<00:01:20.340> so<00:01:20.460> our<00:01:20.490> first

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
on as much mark alright so our first

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.179 
on as much mark alright so our first
benchmark<00:01:21.180> is<00:01:21.689> going<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.710> be<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:25.189> that

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
benchmark is going to be the that

and as you can see USB to point I was

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.230 
and as you can see USB to point I was
just<00:02:02.149> a<00:02:02.390> ridiculous<00:02:03.229> bottleneck<00:02:04.159> it's<00:02:04.939> fine

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
just a ridiculous bottleneck it's fine

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.209 
just a ridiculous bottleneck it's fine
for<00:02:05.479> peripheral<00:02:05.990> but<00:02:06.439> not<00:02:06.799> for<00:02:06.979> external

for peripheral but not for external

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:14.770

Megara some curious to see you know if

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:58.320 
Megara some curious to see you know if
all<00:02:38.030> this<00:02:38.239> was<00:02:38.420> worth<00:02:38.660> it

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:09.670 

yes<00:02:59.330> it<00:02:59.569> looks<00:02:59.750> like<00:02:59.990> we're<00:03:00.230> doing

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.950 

I'm<00:03:10.680> just<00:03:10.950> going<00:03:11.130> to<00:03:11.190> go<00:03:11.310> call<00:03:11.640> it<00:03:11.790> 118<00:03:12.540> megam

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:12.960 
I'm just going to go call it 118 megam

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.260 
I'm just going to go call it 118 megam
those<00:03:13.880> so<00:03:14.990> we<00:03:15.990> gained<00:03:16.230> 15<00:03:16.740> Meg's<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.100> second<00:03:17.580> ten

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
those so we gained 15 Meg's a second ten

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.690 
those so we gained 15 Meg's a second ten
percent<00:03:18.630> faster<00:03:18.870> than<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.350> 5400<00:03:19.920> RPM<00:03:20.430> drive

drive and put it inside that enclosure I

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.040 
drive and put it inside that enclosure I
think<00:04:07.270> that<00:04:07.390> would<00:04:07.450> really<00:04:07.510> give<00:04:07.750> me<00:04:07.810> the<00:04:07.840> best

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
think that would really give me the best

in those worlds thunderbolt has a much
higher<00:04:10.230> throughput<00:04:11.230> than<00:04:11.500> USB<00:04:11.920> 3<00:04:12.280> does<00:04:12.460> so<00:04:13.450> I

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
higher throughput than USB 3 does so I

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.289 
higher throughput than USB 3 does so I
fully<00:04:13.990> intend<00:04:14.320> to<00:04:14.350> utilize<00:04:14.500> that<00:04:14.710> Thunderbolt

been such as the one I'll be doing with
this<00:04:24.960> so<00:04:25.960> there<00:04:26.140> you<00:04:26.260> go<00:04:26.550> overall<00:04:27.550> get<00:04:28.120> about

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
this so there you go overall get about

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.270 
this so there you go overall get about
ten<00:04:28.480> percent<00:04:28.570> faster<00:04:29.020> with<00:04:29.350> 72<00:04:29.710> hour<00:04:29.950> versus

5400rpm I'm kind of surprised by that
I'll<00:04:34.360> be<00:04:34.450> honest<00:04:34.840> it's<00:04:35.020> been<00:04:35.110> a<00:04:35.170> while<00:04:35.410> like<00:04:35.650> I

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
I'll be honest it's been a while like I

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.870 
I'll be honest it's been a while like I
said<00:04:35.980> since<00:04:36.220> I've<00:04:36.340> done<00:04:36.520> any<00:04:36.700> kind<00:04:36.790> of

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.610 
benchmark stuff on hard drive it used to
be<00:04:41.260> that<00:04:41.440> you<00:04:41.560> had<00:04:41.740> a<00:04:41.770> much<00:04:42.130> much<00:04:43.060> greater

comfortable space the 500 gig gives you

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.670 
comfortable space the 500 gig gives you
I'm<00:04:52.420> not<00:04:52.660> sure<00:04:52.900> it's<00:04:53.050> really<00:04:53.170> gonna<00:04:53.350> be<00:04:53.530> worth

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
I'm not sure it's really gonna be worth

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.100 
I'm not sure it's really gonna be worth
it<00:04:53.920> um<00:04:54.100> I<00:04:54.580> wanted<00:04:55.300> to<00:04:55.360> get<00:04:55.480> in<00:04:55.630> there<00:04:55.750> take<00:04:56.080> a

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
it um I wanted to get in there take a

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.590 
it um I wanted to get in there take a
look<00:04:56.320> at<00:04:56.440> what<00:04:56.470> made<00:04:56.740> it<00:04:56.860> tick<00:04:57.040> so<00:04:57.760> I'm<00:04:58.000> alright

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
look at what made it tick so I'm alright

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.670 
look at what made it tick so I'm alright
with<00:04:58.630> doing<00:04:58.960> that<00:04:59.080> but<00:04:59.919> uh<00:04:59.980> overall<00:05:01.680> I'm

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
with doing that but uh overall I'm

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.140 
with doing that but uh overall I'm
probably<00:05:02.919> could<00:05:03.100> have<00:05:03.130> just<00:05:03.340> left<00:05:03.430> to<00:05:03.580> 500<00:05:04.030> gig

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
probably could have just left to 500 gig

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.140 
probably could have just left to 500 gig
in<00:05:04.270> there<00:05:04.419> but<00:05:05.110> I<00:05:05.140> got<00:05:05.380> a<00:05:05.410> little<00:05:05.500> bit<00:05:05.710> faster

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
in there but I got a little bit faster

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.120 
in there but I got a little bit faster
faster<00:05:07.150> speed<00:05:07.450> so<00:05:08.200> I<00:05:08.470> get<00:05:08.680> some<00:05:08.800> knocking<00:05:08.950> at

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
faster speed so I get some knocking at

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.070 
faster speed so I get some knocking at
the<00:05:09.190> point<00:05:09.430> really<00:05:09.940> this<00:05:10.090> space<00:05:10.360> will<00:05:10.960> be

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
the point really this space will be

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.440 
the point really this space will be
useful<00:05:11.500> um<00:05:11.800> I<00:05:12.160> already<00:05:12.580> partition<00:05:13.120> that<00:05:13.210> drive

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
useful um I already partition that drive

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.840 
useful um I already partition that drive
out<00:05:13.630> i've<00:05:13.780> got<00:05:13.900> 600<00:05:14.380> gigs<00:05:14.530> available<00:05:15.130> now<00:05:15.790> for
