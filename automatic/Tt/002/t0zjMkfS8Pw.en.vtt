as<00:00:08.400> a<00:00:08.460> science<00:00:09.059> problem<00:00:09.599> we<00:00:10.469> have<00:00:10.679> here

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
as a science problem we have here

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.400 
as a science problem we have here
something<00:00:11.250> set<00:00:11.610> up<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:12.059> it<00:00:12.750> really<00:00:12.990> doesn't

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
something set up and it really doesn't

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.289 
something set up and it really doesn't
matter<00:00:13.500> what<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:13.920> question<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.429> asking<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:15.150> lot

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
matter what the question is asking a lot

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.140 
matter what the question is asking a lot

choices is enough for you to solve the
problem<00:00:20.550> this<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:20.850> especially<00:00:21.480> beneficial<00:00:21.779> if

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
problem this is especially beneficial if

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.019 
problem this is especially beneficial if
you're<00:00:22.529> trying<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.920> hurry<00:00:23.220> through<00:00:23.430> questions

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
you're trying to hurry through questions

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.009 
you're trying to hurry through questions
and<00:00:24.330> save<00:00:25.140> time<00:00:25.470> here<00:00:26.430> we<00:00:26.580> have<00:00:27.019> temperature

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
and save time here we have temperature

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.660 
and save time here we have temperature
and<00:00:28.260> pressure<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.070> something<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.640> happening

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
and pressure and something is happening

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.139 
and pressure and something is happening
to<00:00:30.150> both<00:00:30.510> of<00:00:30.750> these<00:00:30.949> now<00:00:32.009> as<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.669> first<00:00:32.880> look

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
to both of these now as you first look

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.380 
to both of these now as you first look
at<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:33.450> one<00:00:33.840> thing<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.170> remember<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:35.390> there's

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
at this one thing to remember is there's

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.530 
at this one thing to remember is there's
two<00:00:37.110> goals<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:38.010> test<00:00:38.550> questions<00:00:38.969> the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
two goals that test questions the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.510 
two goals that test questions the
writers<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.230> test<00:00:40.469> questions<00:00:40.860> are<00:00:41.010> going<00:00:41.160> for

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
writers of test questions are going for

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.970 
writers of test questions are going for
first<00:00:41.879> they<00:00:42.570> want<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.899> present<00:00:43.050> something<00:00:43.710> and

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
first they want to present something and

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.850 
first they want to present something and
make<00:00:44.430> sure<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.879> you're<00:00:45.360> able<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.600> derive<00:00:46.559> the

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
make sure that you're able to derive the

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.010 
make sure that you're able to derive the
answer<00:00:47.219> appropriately<00:00:47.969> but<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.629> other<00:00:48.809> is

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
answer appropriately but the other is

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.900 
answer appropriately but the other is
just<00:00:49.050> do<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.770> understand<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.579> sort<00:00:50.850> of

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
just do you understand the sort of

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.299 
just do you understand the sort of
material<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.289> sometimes<00:00:52.590> common-sense

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
material and so sometimes common-sense

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.330 
material and so sometimes common-sense
can<00:00:54.030> point<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.840> answer<00:00:55.260> here<00:00:56.070> we're

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
can point you to the answer here we're

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.220 
can point you to the answer here we're
dealing<00:00:56.460> with<00:00:56.670> temperature<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.510> pressure

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
dealing with temperature and pressure

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.500 
dealing with temperature and pressure
and<00:00:58.680> one<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.460> them<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.730> going<00:00:59.910> up<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.329> one<00:01:00.480> of

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
and one of them is going up and one of

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.479 
and one of them is going up and one of
the<00:01:00.629> things<00:01:00.750> going<00:01:01.109> down<00:01:01.469> something<00:01:02.250> is

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
the things going down something is

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.090 
the things going down something is
happening<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:02.969> both<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.510> them<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.989> if<00:01:04.979> you

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
happening to both of them and if you

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.410 
happening to both of them and if you
think<00:01:05.369> about<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.760> when<00:01:05.909> temperature

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
think about it when temperature

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.320 
think about it when temperature
increases<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:07.350> most<00:01:07.590> systems<00:01:08.119> pressure<00:01:09.119> is

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
increases in most systems pressure is

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.120 
increases in most systems pressure is
going<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.659> increase<00:01:10.170> as<00:01:10.409> well<00:01:10.680> if<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.950> just

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
going to increase as well if you just

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.770 
going to increase as well if you just
don't<00:01:11.549> don't<00:01:11.880> think<00:01:12.030> about<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.330> question

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
don't don't think about the question

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.170 
don't don't think about the question
again<00:01:13.470> just<00:01:13.680> look<00:01:13.799> at<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:13.979> answers<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.400> so<00:01:14.790> if

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
again just look at the answers and so if

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.359 
again just look at the answers and so if
you<00:01:15.630> were<00:01:15.780> just<00:01:15.960> making<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.650> straight<00:01:16.979> up<00:01:17.100> guess

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
you were just making a straight up guess

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.789 
you were just making a straight up guess
based<00:01:17.939> on<00:01:18.180> your<00:01:18.390> knowledge<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:19.110> how<00:01:19.770> things

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
based on your knowledge of how things

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.370 
based on your knowledge of how things
work<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.700> world<00:01:20.729> as<00:01:21.380> temperature

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
work in the world as temperature

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.710 
work in the world as temperature
increases<00:01:22.670> pressure<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.909> going<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.240> increase

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
increases pressure is going to increase

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.260 
increases pressure is going to increase
and<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.110> might<00:01:25.290> lead<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.710> choice<00:01:26.040> B<00:01:26.430> let

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
and that might lead you to choice B let

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.819 
and that might lead you to choice B let
me<00:01:27.330> show<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.540> another<00:01:27.900> way<00:01:28.110> again<00:01:28.500> just

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
me show you another way again just

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.069 
me show you another way again just
focused<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.490> answer<00:01:29.850> choices<00:01:29.880> here<00:01:30.570> that

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
focused on the answer choices here that

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.399 
focused on the answer choices here that
you<00:01:31.259> can<00:01:31.470> come<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.979> same<00:01:32.159> answer<00:01:32.960> if<00:01:33.960> we

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
you can come to the same answer if we

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.560 
you can come to the same answer if we
look<00:01:34.590> at<00:01:34.710> these<00:01:34.860> three<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.180> answer

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
look at these three of the answer

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.460 
look at these three of the answer
choices<00:01:36.710> have<00:01:37.710> temperature<00:01:38.460> going<00:01:38.729> up<00:01:39.119> and

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
choices have temperature going up and

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.020 
choices have temperature going up and
one<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.619> them<00:01:40.740> has<00:01:41.040> temperature<00:01:41.520> going<00:01:41.729> down

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
one of them has temperature going down

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.020 
one of them has temperature going down
so<00:01:42.810> if<00:01:43.110> if<00:01:43.560> we<00:01:43.829> didn't<00:01:44.189> consider<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.790> pressure

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
so if if we didn't consider the pressure

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.569 
so if if we didn't consider the pressure
if<00:01:45.270> we<00:01:45.390> only<00:01:45.600> consider<00:01:45.899> temperature<00:01:46.439> we<00:01:47.399> would

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
if we only consider temperature we would

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.179 
if we only consider temperature we would
say<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.970> odds<00:01:48.240> are<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:49.259> answer<00:01:49.710> choice<00:01:49.950> that

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
say that odds are the answer choice that

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.789 
say that odds are the answer choice that
is<00:01:50.310> correct<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.909> probably<00:01:51.600> one<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.840> these<00:01:52.049> that

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
is correct is probably one of these that

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.490 
is correct is probably one of these that
has<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.220> temperature<00:01:53.640> on<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.880> increase<00:01:54.500> now

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
has the temperature on the increase now

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.959 
has the temperature on the increase now
let's<00:01:55.740> look<00:01:55.890> at<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.130> other<00:01:56.250> half<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.729> this

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
let's look at the other half of this

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.539 
let's look at the other half of this
what's<00:01:57.780> going<00:01:58.049> on<00:01:58.200> with<00:01:58.380> depression<00:01:58.680> we<00:01:59.399> have

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
what's going on with depression we have

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.149 
what's going on with depression we have
pressure<00:01:59.850> going<00:02:00.240> down<00:02:00.600> pressure<00:02:01.500> going<00:02:01.829> up

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
pressure going down pressure going up

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.899 
pressure going down pressure going up
pressure<00:02:03.119> stays<00:02:03.649> unchanged<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:04.909> pressure

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
pressure stays unchanged and pressure

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.050 
pressure stays unchanged and pressure
going<00:02:06.180> up<00:02:06.500> so<00:02:07.500> out<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:08.160> if<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.429> just<00:02:08.459> looked<00:02:08.940> at

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
going up so out of if you just looked at

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.809 
going up so out of if you just looked at
this<00:02:09.209> out<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.750> out<00:02:09.959> of<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.170> four<00:02:10.349> choices

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
this out of the out of the four choices

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.090 
this out of the out of the four choices
two<00:02:11.819> of<00:02:12.000> them<00:02:12.150> have<00:02:12.360> pressure

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
two of them have pressure

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.060 
two of them have pressure
creasing<00:02:13.600> one<00:02:14.600> has<00:02:14.870> pressure<00:02:15.110> going<00:02:15.440> down<00:02:15.740> and

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
creasing one has pressure going down and

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.840 
creasing one has pressure going down and
one<00:02:16.640> has<00:02:17.030> pressure<00:02:17.450> being<00:02:17.780> unchanged<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:18.890> so

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
one has pressure being unchanged and so

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.420 
one has pressure being unchanged and so
again<00:02:20.570> if<00:02:20.720> you<00:02:20.870> were<00:02:20.960> just<00:02:21.170> guessing<00:02:21.470> you

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
again if you were just guessing you

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.250 
again if you were just guessing you
would<00:02:22.610> say<00:02:22.790> that<00:02:22.970> the<00:02:23.060> answer<00:02:23.210> was<00:02:23.630> probably

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
would say that the answer was probably

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.210 
would say that the answer was probably
going<00:02:24.500> to<00:02:24.590> be<00:02:25.120> one<00:02:26.120> of<00:02:26.270> these<00:02:26.390> two<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:27.200> then<00:02:28.070> as

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
going to be one of these two and then as

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.820 
going to be one of these two and then as
you<00:02:28.370> look<00:02:28.550> back<00:02:28.730> at<00:02:28.970> this<00:02:29.150> section<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:30.440> answer

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
you look back at this section the answer

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.760 
you look back at this section the answer
is<00:02:30.980> likely<00:02:31.190> going<00:02:31.460> to<00:02:31.730> be<00:02:31.840> one<00:02:32.840> of<00:02:32.990> these<00:02:33.170> three

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
is likely going to be one of these three

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.190 
is likely going to be one of these three
that<00:02:34.370> have<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.790> temperature<00:02:35.270> going<00:02:35.660> up<00:02:35.870> and

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
that have the temperature going up and

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.690 
that have the temperature going up and
so<00:02:37.100> which<00:02:37.520> answer<00:02:38.090> choice<00:02:38.920> marries<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.460> most

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
so which answer choice marries the most

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.290 
so which answer choice marries the most
popular<00:02:41.800> selection<00:02:42.800> over<00:02:42.950> here<00:02:43.460> with<00:02:44.120> the

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
popular selection over here with the

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.110 
popular selection over here with the
most<00:02:44.480> popular<00:02:45.110> selection<00:02:45.710> over<00:02:45.860> here<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:46.520> the

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
most popular selection over here and the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.140 
most popular selection over here and the
answer<00:02:47.630> is<00:02:48.310> going<00:02:49.310> to<00:02:49.430> be<00:02:49.520> this<00:02:49.730> one<00:02:49.970> right

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
answer is going to be this one right

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.650 
answer is going to be this one right
here

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
here

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.300 
here
choice<00:02:51.320> B<00:02:51.350> and<00:02:52.160> so<00:02:52.940> if<00:02:53.240> you<00:02:53.630> have<00:02:54.380> time<00:02:54.740> to<00:02:55.100> go

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
choice B and so if you have time to go

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.640 
choice B and so if you have time to go
through<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.300> understand<00:02:56.990> the<00:02:57.170> problem

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
through and you understand the problem

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.840 
through and you understand the problem
and<00:02:57.770> you're<00:02:57.980> able<00:02:58.310> to<00:02:58.340> make<00:02:58.550> the<00:02:58.700> correct

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
and you're able to make the correct

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.150 
and you're able to make the correct
selection<00:02:59.420> you<00:03:00.170> don't<00:03:00.410> have<00:03:00.560> to<00:03:00.680> resort<00:03:01.070> to

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
selection you don't have to resort to

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.640 
selection you don't have to resort to
this<00:03:01.430> but<00:03:01.700> it's<00:03:02.450> a<00:03:02.600> great<00:03:02.870> way<00:03:03.080> to<00:03:03.110> just<00:03:03.410> kind

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
this but it's a great way to just kind

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.640 
this but it's a great way to just kind
of<00:03:03.770> do<00:03:04.400> a<00:03:04.430> gut<00:03:04.760> check<00:03:04.820> if<00:03:05.390> you<00:03:05.960> have<00:03:06.200> had<00:03:06.410> time

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
of do a gut check if you have had time

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.010 
of do a gut check if you have had time
or<00:03:07.040> if<00:03:07.850> you're<00:03:08.120> trying<00:03:08.450> to<00:03:08.510> make<00:03:08.720> an<00:03:08.840> educated

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
or if you're trying to make an educated

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.200 
or if you're trying to make an educated
guess<00:03:09.530> it's<00:03:10.040> an<00:03:10.220> excellent<00:03:10.580> way<00:03:10.730> to<00:03:10.880> make<00:03:11.090> an

guess it's an excellent way to make an
educated<00:03:11.780> guess<00:03:12.080> that<00:03:12.970> more<00:03:13.970> than<00:03:14.150> likely

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
educated guess that more than likely

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:23.370 
educated guess that more than likely
will<00:03:14.840> be<00:03:15.200> correct

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380
