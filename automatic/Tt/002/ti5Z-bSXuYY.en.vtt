00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.389
 We want to consciously take the luscious meal today with a look at the 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.120
 Today's adversaries make you realize that the Plattling Black Hawks are judging the he 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.770
 through a difficult season in the GFL South need to play with the very very 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.600
 small squad always 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.080
 There were two difficulties on the field today 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.510
 Difficulty getting there was swing in later kickoff and at the 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.300
 Plattling Black Hawks also had three injured two times 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.440
 Ambulance here is my target from among others Adam Hazel of them 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.640
 that's a pity weakening for the Sunny little hurt 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.700
 but still battling Team Dopingfalles words harsh setback 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.600
 will be two seriously injured with having to blame Euro 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.160
 Problems me 2 or dislocated 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.190
 December came to the hospital 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.110
 so of course that was just my extra weakening and then still 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.300
 Dirk Overbeck was a very bitter miss but I would like to go for that 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.540
 Blackout Chico suspected the fierce performance today 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.100
 all speak out even if it in the end a clear result for the Dresdner 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.190
 Although 72 to 6 was around then the characters played cheaters to explain about the 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.100
 Team performance around the Monday then naturally concerns them all 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.420
 have been superior 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.719
 the gamer 

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:10.629
 Percent in the first quarter the Morlocks percent have right at the beginning of the 

00:01:10.629 --> 00:01:14.069
 Plattlinger also stopped this year with a new player 

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:14.670
 back then 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.899
 in the pass defense that has already paid off 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:20.509
 In any case, you'll be quick-witted old super eye and ear 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:21.740
 Positioning 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.000
 that's where the important decisions in the field ASCC are 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.040
 what he should do 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.860
 So there's the vile and uncertainty 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.920
 which already started very well first one 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.520
 top-star run by Larry Croom and then there were two Persians on Jan 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.610
 Hilgenfeldt and arose on Sebastian Krech 20 10 clock he was an extra point 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.860
 gone wrong machines are already in the right direction too 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:43.479
 to run 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:44.380
 at the start 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.470
 who had the second quarter around most but maybe a bit 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:48.900
 to be withdrawn too far 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.130
 40 kW 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.530
 Plattling Black out back in the game Cologne last that was the 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.890
 Curious convince at the fourth and bore Panther 2 Action 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.110
 what made points elsewhere how close the Plattlinger had that of the 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.220
 We had to think of musicians. "So fast was the rain that came out of the rain 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.010
 ball 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.750
 something was wrong with a snack the panda had to go to the left 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.969
 dodge 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.039
 and there I thought okay a judgment of the stopped is morning at Altdorf 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.780
 he conjures up somehow autistic buy chat from Dragon 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.709
 solved 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.459
 he makes a very long run ahead in the river Tarn and in the back 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.359
 It was then quite fast and easy for the Plattlinger 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:26.349
 you already so that we do not care about their connection already Bowser did not start 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:27.769
 but just taxes 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.329
 because a short time to approx 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.329
 Percent supported and Soko put on after what happened co 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:36.579
 they should get a grip again and therefore that was the only one who was 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.199
 20 to 6 Germany already has something to work on Alexander Schwarz teamwork 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:41.410
 responded again 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.150
 Papstein Pass by Taner Gandhi who after surviving thumb break again 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.760
 back in the team was good on Jan Hilgenfeldt for 27 to 6 then turn Plattling 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.629
 in attack 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:54.519
 on the way with the chance of further points and then came the big one 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.279
 Great moment of folk rock folk always makes our own sport but already 

00:02:58.279 --> 00:02:59.349
 often mentioned 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:02.719
 Percent Bernanke Bayer did not reduce server within the last five years 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:04.049
 through which sense has 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.400
 country-queen also our percent very many beautiful forecourt of his 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.549
 Teammates back to the endzone 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.170
 So does his mind work and that was never clear but should be up 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:16.039
 Once the mood is high up at the wheel 

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:19.659
 So that was action by a budding international both 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.659
 been five times more to say more about the masters yet with another day 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:26.940
 already at half time from 41 to sixth there was already 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.070
 the serious injury of Adam Hazel whose out of the game had to do that 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.989
 was also a bit of the sticking point in the offensive efforts of the Plattlinger 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.159
 those who hope for it are no longer compulsory 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:40.469
 and not only that one has rather the problem is often less that one likes 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:43.469
 Role had to play both sides of the ball 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:46.589
 through this one simply has the strength left and then in the off the conservation one has 

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:48.609
 then already had the feeling thinks 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:52.489
 you are on Plattlinger side Dülmen if such a player Ummendorf 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.019
 then it did get into the building 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.209
 here and there a bit too easy as I think 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.899
 that was difficult situation but difficult situation for the 

00:03:59.899 --> 00:04:02.389
 Plattlinger this loss and next 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:06.089
 as just a setback of then new came to handle these games and 

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:08.059
 stay mentally at the top 

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:11.269
 you can not blame anyone that that just happens to be yours 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:12.999
 Sport that eventually you know 

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:15.989
 Realistically, Wars estimated that and that's the way it should be 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.239
 As a result, the FES made slow progress to clubs from the middle of the third 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.370
 Quarter Oliver Beck gave it its second partly on the third row 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.520
 Lukas Wetzlar convinced Lukas Wetzlar by good runs 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.030
 Two top chances also contributed to Jan Christopher Kocer's kids on a total 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.830
 seen more with Philip Götze 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.009
 Philipp Schuster as well as a whole lot of young people that's what I think so too 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.340
 It will be important for the teams to succeed 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.169
 that one also says Becom plays with when since then because of 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.880
 Did our plan more precisely Mockus then not exactly 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.919
 the free voters forget the dancers are doing a class job 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.199
 before she turns red 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:50.860
 Per cent yes that's the point where you often do something as a short sleeper 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.919
 easier to say okay it in the morning big cushion now so the second 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.710
 Guard and even the Kauder kicks 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.630
 and then, of course, with the help of those, they will fit in well 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:01.599
 circumstances 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:05.319
 Hauber anyway positive insert into topics then it is perfect if it is 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:08.449
 Coach would be perfect then it is for the team and for the never-ending 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:09.610
 playful 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:11.150
 with hall thing around 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.379
 anyway at a home game if you win then 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:16.169
 There you go with the elation Lawn can look forward to the next games 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:17.830
 especially that 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.610
 and shy in the all around successful day for the murder in the end in this 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.470
 clear 72 to 6 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.350
 votes are collected after the match but means corrected 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.960
 with the question how are so after the injury-related departure things 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.749
 Time out was like the comeback 

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:35.180
 Dörfler world at Generika can today's Bergamo for Kerner 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:38.139
 but so that she gets reinforced 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:42.560
 if there's a fair amount of money, then some key data will never give you more money 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.710
 erstreiten 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.240
 especially as the variety is but more corrective built Merkel body 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.309
 Player asked 

00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:50.989
 how his estimation is, what value does this game have in the 

00:05:50.989 --> 00:05:53.289
 Compared to other what can you learn from it 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:55.550
 Apple the job as a coach 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.639
 he did not win the Loser Greuther Fürth but also in the Stadtwette Muse 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:04.219
 The roulade may have been reported for Laughers Uelzen Sport 

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:09.460
 was on his early break but is already Gradert Melbeck of the Fund Proft 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.690
 in the tus-tor Ordinary the city cleaner Aguero the heading good for the new 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.279
 Scourge storm may be Jander 

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:21.309
 Although school-based in the NLA food or would it percent if percent 

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:23.529
 Tony before that of the newlywed 

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:27.089
 a zero pay round or less Orazio ever more powerful Dr 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:32.689
 Today exhibition of anticipation meant by competitors Robert Unterburger 

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:37.349
 The ESP and Amber vacation spot horse would be countries immediately on the day 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.300
 so far so 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.960
 Gary Spielbuehler year of four weeks summer break always sen 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.639
 with the second win of the season again self-confidence on the 24th 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:50.689
 In July we will head to Plattling for a direct second leg 

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:52.990
 what is the best thing you can now, from your point of view 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.250
 in the four weeks summer break should do that the dreary everyday life 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.250
 the first and last but also a few more injured 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:04.160
 a bit of debtors bit their lesson for all those who 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.600
 Ruminating then I have decided to go to the limits partially 

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.110
 one of the tankers 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.909
 then get back into training in time you put the meadows the 

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:13.869
 Culture as well as to change that 

00:07:13.869 --> 00:07:17.379
 And then it's very important the Plattling Black Ops for the second leg 

00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:20.789
 but never to be underestimated Turn one never knows like that 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.729
 in the minds of the players then Porr both dead 

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:26.990
 We must be on guard anyway 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:30.030
 the space rent whether there are Plattling he remains dangerous 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:31.899
 insofar 

00:07:31.899 --> 00:07:34.319
 must have been in consensus 

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:38.020
 work and then it would end well the song we still - 

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.929
 Hoffer because they are not so great free at least not like 

00:07:41.929 --> 00:07:43.930
 Feilzer cares for the next four weeks in between 

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.690
 to take such a small percent super world championship is something to you 

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:48.630
 I should only warmly recommend 

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:52.570
 but the next one on the Marais ripped there at 24 million is in Plattling 

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:56.710
 the Blackhawks we from Radio Monarchs in Erfurt where 45 employees 

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.490
 and although it does not look quite like it in the background, it does 

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:02.639
 still wish you a nice summer now you have good times like 

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:04.810
 this at 4 1 Wozniacki are so good back home
