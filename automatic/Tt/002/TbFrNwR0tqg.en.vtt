00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.690
 hello together here is yours again 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.060
 dimitri we are located at the lake edersee 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.850
 It's late for the heart and the sun 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.620
 GroÃŸwallstadt started the big one 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.750
 can be very good at the moment 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.800
 balance chic or no 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.730
 outsmart sugar 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.290
 I would like to introduce you today 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.090
 We now have two variants in 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.680
 ten grams and in 16 degrees 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.019
 I like to fish the lighter ones 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.290
 bar mare and the heavy one 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.580
 I'll say a short vertical route 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.900
 again cooler under water works 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.870
 because many can not 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.760
 imagine as the door for the new one is 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.530
 you sink the bait to the bottom 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.620
 and would have been easy on 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.630
 So the bait is hanging like that 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.820
 fast and hard concern with red 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.799
 but it accelerates so that he is high 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.810
 shoots then lets play the red 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.310
 fast to the water surface at the field of 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:27.159
 bait in the loose quickly back in 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:29.650
 and turns and makes you so you can 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.930
 effectively fish very large area 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.020
 from a standing boat or from 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.700
 a slightly drifting board from the 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.700
 I would like to briefly show in practice 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:12.400
 really strong on jinshan also shoots 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:13.980
 Lothar ask tailor reinfeldt 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.480
 found the premises 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.480
 completely back to the ground 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.540
 something would have to be an album 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:03:25.590
 which of course changes better 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.420
 works works 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.520
