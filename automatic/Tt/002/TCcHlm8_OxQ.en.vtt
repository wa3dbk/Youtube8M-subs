the steam that's produced as a result at
the<00:01:53.979> high<00:01:54.190> temperatures<00:01:54.790> actually<00:01:55.450> helps<00:01:55.780> to

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
the high temperatures actually helps to

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.200 
the high temperatures actually helps to
lock<00:01:56.200> in<00:01:56.440> more<00:01:56.710> of<00:01:56.860> the<00:01:56.979> flavor<00:01:57.280> and<00:01:57.640> nutrients

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
lock in more of the flavor and nutrients

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.990 
lock in more of the flavor and nutrients
so<00:01:58.689> it's<00:01:58.840> tastier<00:01:59.409> to<00:01:59.650> eat<00:01:59.890> and<00:02:00.159> better<00:02:00.610> for
