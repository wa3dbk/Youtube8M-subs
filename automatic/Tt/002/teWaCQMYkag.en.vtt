 then you check the options here recommend it 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.700
 you mark 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.040
 we will start a 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.010
 click on start scan 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.220
 and the program will search the 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.560
 errors that are on your computer 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.960
 logically this error does not occur with 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.480
 frequency that starts your own 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.330
 system it will be found after being 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.880
 found and will be deleted from your 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.100
 computer and of course I write not 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.410
 more of your operating system 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.430
 this method it is center cent 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.770
 will work 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.970
 There is no way out but the question arises. 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:46.850
 Why does this error occur on my computer? 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.970
 there are usually two cases that occur 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.120
 this one error is because the system itself 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.800
 create a record in the directory 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.760
 inappropriate for this registration already 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.570
 other positions 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.780
 It's a lack of updating of the drive. Let's 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:05.120
 wait for the check to end in a 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.030
 long time is less than five minutes 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.470
 it's good quick after the end of 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.420
 verification 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.049
 we can see here that it was found 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.450
 15 errors on my computer my pc 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:20.420

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.530
 selected all of your computer and
