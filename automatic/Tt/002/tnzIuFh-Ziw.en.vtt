00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.139
 let's make a very fabric flower 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.500
 simple, it's going to take more than 15 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.780
 minutes in doing it 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.360
 we have to draw first the 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.860
 flower pattern and a sheet of paper are 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.370
 it's about an actor with five petals 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.070
 rounded 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:29.710
 I'm going to use two fabrics this fabric that 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.190
 it's a little thicker it's a tacit type 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.490
 and this other more porous one that is a 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.440
 organizes 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.560
 I'm going to cut it out of this first one 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.950
 six times the flower and this other five 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.950
 times 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.040
 one of these patterns is going to be the basis 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.320
 of the flower 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.110
 so that the base is not so flat 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.160
 I have a little ripple I'm going to 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:01:00.190
 fold twice as here and with help 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.290
 of a needle I'm going to sew a little bit in 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.080
 the stitch on the tip 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.960
 I do not have this around here it says doubling 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.340
 four times and get a little bit the 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.720
 tip now I open well 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.430
 and this would be the basis of our flower 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.909
 it's going to be so flat but it has a 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.710
 little note 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.799
 now it's about doing the 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.490
 heavy 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.180
 I'm going to donate 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.160
 the first of the 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.160
 two months as follows 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.729
 leaving the right side of the fabric towards 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.729
 outside 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.830
 double cio once 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.520
 As you can see, one of the petals has been left 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.520
 between us two 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.579
 again 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.020
 and now 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.320
 I have to sew 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.590
 this tip in the center of the base of the 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.590
 flower 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.489
 As you can see here I have already inserted the first 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.960
 petal just above one of the 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.360
 petals of the base 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.850
 hello I will repeat the process but with 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.740
 the other trafficking fabric 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.800
 organza forgiveness 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.800
 what I do is double as here 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.820
 to a second where 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.330
 what you can do now is a stitch 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.970
 and it's here so it does not move after 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.750
 of the 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.750
 the petal 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:02.720
 in the stitch and then as in the 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.150
 process in the step of andrÃ©s 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.480
 and get it right here next to 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.480
 other 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.030
 you have to repeat this same process 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:16.480
 with the hip alternating a fabric and 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.480
 others 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.580
 once you have known all the 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:25.250
 petals what you have to do is the 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.250
 organza pull it up 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.360
 and open a little to give it more volume 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.760
 in the center so you can not see the 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.760
 stitches I'm going to sew 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.300
 of the same color 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.580
 and in the back in this area 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.190
 where are all the seams I'm going to 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.890
 Sew a circle of the same fabric in 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:09.840
 this circle I will take advantage 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.840
 to stick the pint 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.760
 this is how the flower would be finished 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:20.419
 As you can see I have sewn a pearl in the 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.270
 center and so I have managed to disguise the 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.920
 stitches on the back stuck with 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.560
 silicone clamp 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.870
 between the two nate parts of the clamp 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.570
 having it I have to paste between a 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.230
 little circle of cloth so that it does not look 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.230
 the glue 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.460
 otherwise he would sing
