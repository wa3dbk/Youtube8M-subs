00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:10.100
 You thought you saw it all, you're very 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:15.970
 wrong because in a few seconds more 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.970
 you will live a unique experience 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:31.270
 good people and generate tagline in another 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.270
 new video in this case I'm going to 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.130
 teach a site in farms in the area 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.290
 Mars 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:42.490
 will be the exclusion zone to do more 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.860
 exact level 18 it seems to me that 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.890
 I had to make it anyway 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.350
 I will do well for what 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.629
 so you can notice it because it's a good 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.260
 area to palomear and it is taken out enough 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.260
 moments 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.370
 well here we already had what is going to 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:05.019
 get points because here what you do 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.030
 It is very similar to the outer darkness 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.280
 let's say we would have to kill a few 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.939
 days and yellow blood we would leave 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.590
 that they kill us and reappear and we 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:17.549
 same side we would kill again the 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.549
 themselves and so on 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.390
 here what we have to eat does not 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.610
 mostly the replenishment code 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.780
 If I'm not mistaken, what does it give us? 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.780
 more lumen for the cabal 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.200
 and what said that is with the lumen here 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.690
 we passed what the first door did not 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.780
 we open the second we would put what 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.400
 the spectral is from here and it would open 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.090
 the door that is now thanks to these 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.980
 families 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.000
 It is a little faster 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.000
 they make it go beyond 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.880
 nothing's worth this is what there is this is 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.620
 repetitive the two ships always leave 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.540
 the centurion who kills you to ensure 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.940
 a quick death and action you can 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.590
 do it very fast level 18 as you see 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.180
 there and nothing I hope you liked 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.180
 Good wishes and even others
