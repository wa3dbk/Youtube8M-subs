 Of discs 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.880
 that means cloning 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.450
 this is an image of our disk 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.450

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:43.889
 here that is not saying here is not identifying 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.599
 two hard drives 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.929
 if we are not going to desist from 1 

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:51.929

 what are we going to give him here we select where 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:06.379
 for example here we will give in 6 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.909
 before we're going to put a name you want 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.859
 the golden decision 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.540
 no pardon they will say no here if yes 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.959
 i who buy 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.069

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.609
 I must say that not in this case they rise to say yes 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.069
 to start 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.099
 for that reason I do not want 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.319
 we are not going to submit 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.479

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.079
 means the treasury of where the image will be 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.649
 so it's not just with one 

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:54.279
 let's see what there is 

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:57.729
 here city destination 

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:59.569
 where 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.569
 is going to be cloning this album bouquets g 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.269
 and we do not touch it they're just 

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:12.179
 a amount of space that is tensing month 

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:15.189
 our speech that 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:18.189
 and then here we are going to give you 10 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.370
 I was going to start loading 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.779
 let's wait 

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:30.779
 it's a medium long process 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.900
 but in question like I'm doing a tutorial 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.110
 and I'm looking forward to one more than anything I'm a lot slower 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:42.169
 much more feel more apart sogama that chelsea much eager 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.139
 that is, it becomes 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.139
 26 very compact 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:52.080
 but ready is all that has to be done 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.219
 here is that we were expected to wait for it to reach 100% 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.580
 afterwards is not the message we want is yes yes 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.400
 and ready ap some to counter when we learn we take out the disk 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.240
 we put it on the other computer that does 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.430
 they must take into account 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.210
 with some disk 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.169
 you should keep in mind that the other compact if the two computers are 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:19.180
 same 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.060
 identical same processor same ram memory same hard drive 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:26.729
 yes yes no it will not work 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:29.680
 it tends to go 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.819
 to water the compactor 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:35.219
 do not stop being equal before 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:36.849
 well its all 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:40.059
 here we wait for you to be lacking and ready 

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:42.509
 these products could be among others
