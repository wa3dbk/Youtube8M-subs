00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
flat iron and I actually wet longer

without washing my hair instead of two

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.750 
without washing my hair instead of two
weeks<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.610> did<00:01:11.790> three<00:01:12.090> weeks<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:13.520> may<00:01:14.520> be<00:01:14.580> a

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
weeks I did three weeks so that may be a

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.390 
weeks I did three weeks so that may be a
contributing<00:01:15.180> factor<00:01:15.420> as<00:01:15.930> well<00:01:16.170> but<00:01:16.920> my<00:01:17.100> hair

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
contributing factor as well but my hair

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.880 
contributing factor as well but my hair
is<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> lot<00:01:18.030> drier<00:01:19.189> than<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.369> usually<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.909> um

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
is a lot drier than it usually is um

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.539 
is a lot drier than it usually is um
which<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:23.009> don't<00:01:23.070> like<00:01:23.330> so<00:01:24.470> I<00:01:25.470> have<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.159> work<00:01:26.340> on

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
which I don't like so I have to work on

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.640 
which I don't like so I have to work on
getting<00:01:26.820> some<00:01:27.000> moisture<00:01:27.390> placed<00:01:28.020> back<00:01:28.320> into

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
getting some moisture placed back into

getting some moisture placed back into
my<00:01:28.950> hair<00:01:30.020> which<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.170> always<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.650> task<00:01:32.420> so<00:01:33.420> um<00:01:34.490> you

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
my hair which is always a task so um you

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.600 
my hair which is always a task so um you
know<00:01:35.659> not<00:01:36.659> only<00:01:36.900> because<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.229> heat<00:01:37.500> damage<00:01:37.740> but

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
know not only because of heat damage but

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.440 
know not only because of heat damage but
because<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:40.369> you<00:01:41.369> know<00:01:41.490> just<00:01:41.759> how<00:01:41.850> dry<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.180> made

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450

than<00:01:53.640> anything<00:01:53.909> else<00:01:54.329> maybe<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:56.009> another<00:01:56.360> four

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
than anything else maybe in another four

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
a a blow dry and then a twist so I can

heat<00:02:43.350> so<00:02:44.350> nothing<00:02:45.190> too<00:02:45.430> hot<00:02:45.760> and<00:02:46.120> I<00:02:46.540> did<00:02:46.750> a

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
heat so nothing too hot and I did a

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.860
