want to keep in mind for instance right

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.220 
want to keep in mind for instance right
now<00:00:14.460> it's<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.910> pretty<00:00:15.089> new<00:00:15.269> console<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:15.960> what

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
now it's a pretty new console and what

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.840 
now it's a pretty new console and what
that<00:00:16.379> means<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:16.770> like<00:00:16.920> every<00:00:17.250> new<00:00:17.400> console

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
that means is like every new console

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.330 
that means is like every new console
there<00:00:18.090> isn't<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.600> huge<00:00:18.960> library<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.740> games<00:00:20.070> to

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
there isn't a huge library of games to

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.670 
there isn't a huge library of games to
jump<00:00:20.609> into<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:21.900> can<00:00:22.080> cause<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.289> lot<00:00:22.619> of

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
jump into and that can cause a lot of

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.279 
jump into and that can cause a lot of
droughts<00:00:23.550> in<00:00:23.939> between<00:00:24.390> periods<00:00:25.050> where<00:00:25.260> you

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
droughts in between periods where you

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.900 
droughts in between periods where you
don't<00:00:25.529> really<00:00:25.619> have<00:00:25.769> anything<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.279> play<00:00:26.550> and

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
don't really have anything to play and

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.939 
don't really have anything to play and
that<00:00:27.300> could<00:00:27.510> really<00:00:27.869> make<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.439> seem<00:00:28.710> like<00:00:28.890> a

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
that could really make it seem like a

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.220 
that could really make it seem like a
bad<00:00:29.250> purchase<00:00:29.580> decision<00:00:30.269> it's<00:00:30.689> just<00:00:30.960> sort<00:00:31.140> of

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
bad purchase decision it's just sort of
