00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
I put together Britta Cassandra view him

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
which I cover all of the individual

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.339 
which I cover all of the individual
components<00:00:08.639> of<00:00:09.090> Britta<00:00:09.300> cos<00:00:09.450> you'll<00:00:10.019> see<00:00:10.170> how

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
components of Britta cos you'll see how

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.520 
components of Britta cos you'll see how
I<00:00:10.410> transfer<00:00:10.860> them<00:00:11.010> into<00:00:11.309> their<00:00:12.230> the<00:00:13.230> modern

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
I transfer them into their the modern

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.070 
I transfer them into their the modern
modes<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.759> special<00:00:15.089> interest<00:00:15.360> is<00:00:15.480> blast<00:00:15.809> off

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
modes the special interest is blast off

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.200 
modes the special interest is blast off
because<00:00:16.260> I<00:00:16.470> have<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:17.039> fan<00:00:17.699> mode<00:00:17.970> that<00:00:18.180> gives

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
because I have a fan mode that gives

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.090 
because I have a fan mode that gives
them<00:00:18.449> this<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.810> transmen<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:19.590> monster

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
them this a transmen to this monster

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.040 
them this a transmen to this monster
claw<00:00:20.310> arm<00:00:20.609> which<00:00:21.210> i<00:00:21.300> think<00:00:21.359> looks<00:00:21.510> really<00:00:21.720> nice

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
claw arm which i think looks really nice

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.269 
claw arm which i think looks really nice
I'll<00:00:22.320> see<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.560> when<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.740> put<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:23.039> all<00:00:23.130> together

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
I'll see it when I put it all together

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.189 
I'll see it when I put it all together
but<00:00:24.029> you<00:00:24.150> may<00:00:24.269> want<00:00:24.449> especially<00:00:24.960> watch<00:00:25.109> a

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
but you may want especially watch a

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.630 
but you may want especially watch a
blast<00:00:25.439> off<00:00:25.710> because<00:00:25.980> most<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.340> stuff

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
blast off because most of this stuff

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.609 
blast off because most of this stuff
you'll<00:00:27.180> see<00:00:27.359> in<00:00:27.449> other<00:00:27.570> reviews<00:00:28.019> but<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.470> is

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
you'll see in other reviews but this is

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.710 
you'll see in other reviews but this is
a<00:00:28.800> unique<00:00:29.519> fan<00:00:29.789> mode<00:00:30.000> by<00:00:30.179> me<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.510> think

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
a unique fan mode by me that I think

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.930 
a unique fan mode by me that I think
really<00:00:31.050> works<00:00:31.349> for<00:00:31.470> Bruticus<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.640> I'm<00:00:32.730> going

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
really works for Bruticus so I'm going

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.310 
really works for Bruticus so I'm going
to<00:00:32.969> start<00:00:33.180> with<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.390> lace<00:00:33.570> I'm<00:00:33.899> gonna<00:00:34.050> get<00:00:34.200> the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.030 
to start with the lace I'm gonna get the
arms<00:00:34.530> out<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.920> way<00:00:37.430> and<00:00:39.469> here's<00:00:40.469> the

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
arms out of the way and here's the

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.290 
arms out of the way and here's the
onslaught<00:00:41.610> component<00:00:42.320> I'm<00:00:43.320> going<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:44.090> plug<00:00:45.090> it

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
onslaught component I'm going to plug it

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.139 
onslaught component I'm going to plug it
on<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:47.809> Swindell<00:00:48.809> component<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:50.149> the

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
on to the Swindell component and the

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.750 
on to the Swindell component and the
Braille<00:00:51.719> component<00:00:54.350> and<00:00:55.370> yeah<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.550> guy's

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
Braille component and yeah this guy's

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:05.690 
Braille component and yeah this guy's
getting<00:00:57.390> huge<00:01:03.470> next<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.589> will<00:01:04.769> plug<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.309> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
getting huge next I will plug on the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.789 
getting huge next I will plug on the
I'll<00:01:06.630> do<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.869> blasts<00:01:07.049> off<00:01:07.290> compiled<00:01:07.590> because

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
I'll do the blasts off compiled because

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.170 
I'll do the blasts off compiled because
it's<00:01:07.950> kind<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.250> hardest<00:01:08.640> one<00:01:08.790> because<00:01:09.000> you

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
it's kind of hardest one because you

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.060 
it's kind of hardest one because you
have<00:01:09.210> all<00:01:09.420> this<00:01:09.960> stuff<00:01:10.200> over<00:01:10.470> here<00:01:10.500> they<00:01:10.830> need

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
have all this stuff over here they need

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.980 
have all this stuff over here they need
to<00:01:11.280> negotiate<00:01:12.240> around<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.760> get<00:01:14.840> that's<00:01:15.840> one

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
to negotiate around so get that's one

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.570 
to negotiate around so get that's one
thing<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.200> hate<00:01:16.350> about<00:01:16.380> these<00:01:16.650> combiner<00:01:17.040> ports

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
thing I hate about these combiner ports

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.050 
thing I hate about these combiner ports
is<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.909> they<00:01:18.810> tend<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.290> bend<00:01:19.850> instead<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.939> go

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
is that they tend to bend instead of go

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.020 
is that they tend to bend instead of go
on<00:01:21.500> they<00:01:22.500> are<00:01:22.650> really<00:01:23.130> nice<00:01:23.280> combined<00:01:23.700> reports

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
on they are really nice combined reports

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.160 
on they are really nice combined reports
that<00:01:24.150> once<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.420> get<00:01:24.540> them<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:24.750> because<00:01:25.020> they

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
that once you get them on because they

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.520 
that once you get them on because they
don't<00:01:25.409> really<00:01:25.770> come<00:01:26.130> off<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:27.140> mean<00:01:28.140> they're

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
don't really come off I mean they're

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:29.990 
don't really come off I mean they're
very<00:01:28.710> solid<00:01:29.220> that's<00:01:29.369> what<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.549> mean

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
very solid that's what I mean

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.420 
very solid that's what I mean
then<00:01:30.750> plug<00:01:31.670> for<00:01:32.670> text<00:01:33.119> on

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.120 

I<00:01:39.350> mean<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.470> problem<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.860> if<00:01:40.950> they<00:01:41.070> were

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
I mean the problem is if they were

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.800 
I mean the problem is if they were
easier<00:01:41.550> though<00:01:41.790> they'd<00:01:42.060> be<00:01:42.180> easier<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.690> take

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
easier though they'd be easier to take

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.800 
easier though they'd be easier to take
off<00:01:43.020> -<00:01:43.290> which<00:01:43.440> would<00:01:43.590> be<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.710> problem<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.810> this

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
off - which would be a problem and this

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.360 
off - which would be a problem and this
is<00:01:46.880> Bruticus<00:01:47.880> in<00:01:48.120> his<00:01:48.480> massive<00:01:49.380> robot<00:01:49.950> mode

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.370 
is Bruticus in his massive robot mode

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.930 
is Bruticus in his massive robot mode
and<00:01:50.700> as<00:01:51.420> you<00:01:51.510> can<00:01:51.600> see<00:01:52.160> the<00:01:53.160> claw<00:01:53.400> arm<00:01:53.670> just

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
and as you can see the claw arm just

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.030 
and as you can see the claw arm just
really<00:01:54.390> works<00:01:54.600> for<00:01:54.810> this<00:01:54.900> guy<00:01:55.050> I<00:01:55.230> really<00:01:55.830> like

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
all combiners have problems but this guy

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.640 
all combiners have problems but this guy
is<00:02:10.410> really<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.459> first<00:02:11.550> modern<00:02:11.970> trance

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
is really the first modern trance

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.980 
is really the first modern trance
combiner<00:02:13.650> that<00:02:13.860> I<00:02:13.920> think<00:02:14.130> just<00:02:14.310> really<00:02:14.370> works

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
combiner that I think just really works

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.730 
combiner that I think just really works
he's<00:02:15.990> got<00:02:16.230> basically<00:02:16.530> nice<00:02:17.010> proportions

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
he's got basically nice proportions

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.190 
he's got basically nice proportions
everything<00:02:19.740> just<00:02:19.950> he<00:02:20.700> just<00:02:20.730> looks<00:02:21.030> nice<00:02:21.240> the

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
everything just he just looks nice the

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.530 
everything just he just looks nice the
only<00:02:22.410> real<00:02:22.560> problem<00:02:23.100> with<00:02:23.490> him<00:02:23.670> is<00:02:23.880> if<00:02:24.450> you

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
only real problem with him is if you

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.690 
only real problem with him is if you
look<00:02:24.690> out<00:02:24.840> from<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.140> side<00:02:25.470> he's<00:02:26.100> very<00:02:26.310> thin

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
look out from the side he's very thin

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.510 
look out from the side he's very thin
which<00:02:26.910> is<00:02:27.060> kind<00:02:27.270> of<00:02:27.330> odd<00:02:27.770> if<00:02:28.770> they<00:02:28.980> have<00:02:29.310> made

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
which is kind of odd if they have made

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.010 
which is kind of odd if they have made
an<00:02:29.670> saw<00:02:29.910> Voyager<00:02:30.360> they<00:02:30.510> could<00:02:30.660> have<00:02:30.750> made<00:02:30.870> it

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
an saw Voyager they could have made it

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.520 
an saw Voyager they could have made it
thicker<00:02:31.230> but<00:02:32.070> um<00:02:33.110> that's<00:02:34.110> really<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.470> only

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
thicker but um that's really the only

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.510 
thicker but um that's really the only
reason<00:02:34.740> why<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.010> would<00:02:35.130> want

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
reason why I would want

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.190 
reason why I would want
unsought<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.480> be<00:02:36.540> a<00:02:36.600> Voyager<00:02:36.930> because

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
unsought to be a Voyager because

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.240 
unsought to be a Voyager because
currently<00:02:37.620> if<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:37.770> look<00:02:37.920> at<00:02:38.010> him<00:02:38.100> from<00:02:38.190> the

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
currently if you look at him from the

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.780 
currently if you look at him from the
front

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
front

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.940 
front
he<00:02:39.270> is<00:02:39.390> quite<00:02:39.750> well<00:02:39.930> proportioned<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.560> like<00:02:40.770> how

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
he is quite well proportioned I like how

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:41.780 
he is quite well proportioned I like how
he<00:02:41.010> turned<00:02:41.310> out

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
he turned out

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.220 
he turned out
now<00:02:42.660> for<00:02:42.840> poseability<00:02:43.610> he<00:02:44.610> has<00:02:44.820> a<00:02:45.300> waist

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
now for poseability he has a waist

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.110 
now for poseability he has a waist
swivel<00:02:46.500> let's<00:02:47.100> get<00:02:47.310> out<00:02:47.400> an<00:02:47.519> angle<00:02:47.850> but<00:02:48.000> it

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
swivel let's get out an angle but it

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.150 
swivel let's get out an angle but it
works<00:02:48.330> because<00:02:48.650> since<00:02:49.650> everything's<00:02:49.980> going

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
works because since everything's going

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.340 
works because since everything's going
to<00:02:50.220> be<00:02:50.280> lower<00:02:50.519> than<00:02:50.640> him<00:02:50.910> allows<00:02:51.180> him<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.480> do

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
to be lower than him allows him to do

00:02:52.350 --> 00:03:02.230 
to be lower than him allows him to do
reaching<00:02:52.800> poses<00:02:53.190> like

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.620 

I<00:03:02.380> grabbed<00:03:03.380> you<00:03:03.860> it<00:03:04.730> allows<00:03:04.850> him<00:03:05.090> to<00:03:05.150> do<00:03:05.360> stuff

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
I grabbed you it allows him to do stuff

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.930 
I grabbed you it allows him to do stuff
like<00:03:05.720> that<00:03:06.050> very<00:03:06.950> easily<00:03:07.280> without<00:03:07.490> having<00:03:07.790> to

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
like that very easily without having to

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.970 
like that very easily without having to
have<00:03:08.450> them<00:03:08.570> bend<00:03:08.750> over<00:03:08.990> so<00:03:09.140> I<00:03:09.170> think<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.770> cut

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
have them bend over so I think the cut

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.580 
have them bend over so I think the cut
of<00:03:10.100> the<00:03:10.160> joint<00:03:10.370> is<00:03:10.460> actually<00:03:10.790> kind<00:03:10.970> of<00:03:11.030> smart

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
of the joint is actually kind of smart

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.500 
of the joint is actually kind of smart
then<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.950> legs<00:03:13.160> go<00:03:13.430> forward<00:03:14.270> and<00:03:14.980> back<00:03:15.980> in<00:03:16.700> and

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
then the legs go forward and back in and

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.450 
then the legs go forward and back in and
out<00:03:17.990> bend<00:03:18.950> at<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:19.100> knee<00:03:19.310> here<00:03:20.440> it's<00:03:21.440> yeah<00:03:22.250> bend

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460 
out bend at the knee here it's yeah bend

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.360 
out bend at the knee here it's yeah bend
up<00:03:22.580> in<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:22.790> rotate<00:03:23.330> above<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:23.990> knee<00:03:24.140> and<00:03:24.380> then

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
up in the rotate above the knee and then

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.640 
up in the rotate above the knee and then
thing<00:03:25.790> on<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.030> leg<00:03:26.210> you<00:03:26.360> get<00:03:26.570> articulation<00:03:27.410> in

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
thing on the leg you get articulation in

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.860 
thing on the leg you get articulation in
the<00:03:27.800> toes<00:03:28.100> and<00:03:28.340> stuff<00:03:28.610> like<00:03:29.390> I'm<00:03:29.570> here<00:03:29.750> you

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
the toes and stuff like I'm here you

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.510 
the toes and stuff like I'm here you
especially<00:03:30.230> get<00:03:30.500> articulation<00:03:31.160> in<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.310> toes

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
especially get articulation in the toes

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.250 
especially get articulation in the toes
on<00:03:31.700> Swindell<00:03:32.120> you<00:03:32.630> can<00:03:32.780> move<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:33.050> heel<00:03:33.230> a

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
on Swindell you can move the heel a

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.770 
on Swindell you can move the heel a
little<00:03:33.350> bit<00:03:33.620> which<00:03:33.740> can<00:03:33.950> help<00:03:34.100> and<00:03:34.850> then<00:03:35.000> where

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
little bit which can help and then where

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.270 
little bit which can help and then where
all<00:03:35.870> you<00:03:36.050> can<00:03:36.200> move<00:03:36.350> the<00:03:36.500> hands<00:03:36.860> down<00:03:37.040> here

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
all you can move the hands down here

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.500 
all you can move the hands down here
which<00:03:37.490> are<00:03:38.000> actually<00:03:38.300> quite<00:03:38.450> nice<00:03:38.720> heels<00:03:39.080> and

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
which are actually quite nice heels and

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.450 
which are actually quite nice heels and
it's<00:03:41.510> actually<00:03:41.810> very<00:03:41.920> possible<00:03:42.920> to<00:03:42.980> game<00:03:43.190> into

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:43.460 
it's actually very possible to game into

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.400 
it's actually very possible to game into
a<00:03:43.490> nice<00:03:44.000> pose<00:03:46.780> it's<00:03:47.780> hard<00:03:47.960> to<00:03:48.050> cover<00:03:48.140> the<00:03:48.290> pose

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
a nice pose it's hard to cover the pose

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.340 
a nice pose it's hard to cover the pose
ability<00:03:48.740> on<00:03:48.830> this<00:03:48.980> guy<00:03:49.220> because<00:03:49.670> a<00:03:50.630> lot<00:03:51.200> of<00:03:51.230> the

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
ability on this guy because a lot of the

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.540 
ability on this guy because a lot of the
pose<00:03:51.470> ability<00:03:51.770> just<00:03:51.890> really<00:03:52.160> depends<00:03:52.430> on

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
pose ability just really depends on

00:03:52.550 --> 00:04:00.310 
pose ability just really depends on
which<00:03:53.380> figure<00:03:54.380> is<00:03:54.590> which<00:03:54.800> joint<00:03:55.280> so<00:03:56.000> oh<00:03:59.320> yeah

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:00.320 
which figure is which joint so oh yeah

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.610 
which figure is which joint so oh yeah
you<00:04:00.440> can<00:04:00.560> also<00:04:00.680> take<00:04:01.040> the<00:04:01.160> head<00:04:01.310> of<00:04:01.490> the<00:04:01.550> head

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
you can also take the head of the head

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.170 
you can also take the head of the head
yeah<00:04:03.620> just<00:04:06.490> you<00:04:07.490> can<00:04:07.610> take<00:04:07.640> a<00:04:07.760> little<00:04:07.970> bit<00:04:08.090> to

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
yeah just you can take a little bit to

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.020 
yeah just you can take a little bit to
get<00:04:08.300> imbalanced<00:04:08.630> because<00:04:09.350> not<00:04:09.790> every<00:04:10.790> pose

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
get imbalanced because not every pose

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.300 
get imbalanced because not every pose
works<00:04:11.360> well<00:04:11.600> with<00:04:11.840> each<00:04:12.500> joint<00:04:13.250> but<00:04:15.070> yeah<00:04:16.070> this

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
works well with each joint but yeah this

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.920 
works well with each joint but yeah this
guy<00:04:16.549> just<00:04:16.850> looks<00:04:17.030> so<00:04:17.840> awesome<00:04:18.109> I<00:04:19.660> mean<00:04:20.660> it's

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
guy just looks so awesome I mean it's

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.090 
guy just looks so awesome I mean it's
not<00:04:21.049> like<00:04:21.109> it's<00:04:21.410> hard<00:04:21.500> to<00:04:21.650> get<00:04:21.770> balanced<00:04:22.040> you

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
not like it's hard to get balanced you

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.560 
not like it's hard to get balanced you
just<00:04:22.250> need<00:04:22.370> to<00:04:22.430> put<00:04:22.610> a<00:04:22.820> little<00:04:23.120> bit<00:04:23.300> of<00:04:23.390> time

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:23.570 
just need to put a little bit of time

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.530 
just need to put a little bit of time
into<00:04:24.400> tweaking<00:04:25.400> it<00:04:25.520> so<00:04:25.670> it<00:04:25.790> balances<00:04:25.910> well<00:04:26.330> and

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
into tweaking it so it balances well and

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.590 
into tweaking it so it balances well and
I<00:04:26.770> just<00:04:27.770> really<00:04:28.010> like<00:04:28.160> this<00:04:28.340> thing<00:04:28.400> I<00:04:28.820> think

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
I just really like this thing I think

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.810 
I just really like this thing I think
this<00:04:29.780> set<00:04:30.020> as<00:04:30.200> a<00:04:30.230> whole<00:04:30.500> is<00:04:30.770> worth<00:04:31.010> it<00:04:31.250> you'll

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
this set as a whole is worth it you'll

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.940 
this set as a whole is worth it you'll
have<00:04:31.970> to<00:04:32.030> suffer<00:04:32.270> through<00:04:32.570> some<00:04:33.200> kind<00:04:33.470> of<00:04:33.620> poor

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
have to suffer through some kind of poor

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.790 
have to suffer through some kind of poor
figures<00:04:34.280> like<00:04:34.490> brawl<00:04:35.000> and<00:04:35.300> onslaught<00:04:35.810> but<00:04:36.680> the

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
figures like brawl and onslaught but the

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.770 
figures like brawl and onslaught but the
other<00:04:36.920> figures<00:04:37.250> are<00:04:37.400> nice<00:04:37.550> really<00:04:38.240> nice<00:04:38.390> and

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
other figures are nice really nice and

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.440 
other figures are nice really nice and
even<00:04:39.770> though<00:04:39.890> brawl<00:04:40.220> and<00:04:40.400> Anza<00:04:40.790> aren't<00:04:41.120> great

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
even though brawl and Anza aren't great

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.840 
even though brawl and Anza aren't great
as<00:04:41.630> individual<00:04:42.110> figures<00:04:42.440> brawl<00:04:43.280> is<00:04:43.520> really

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
as individual figures brawl is really

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.330 
as individual figures brawl is really
one<00:04:44.000> of<00:04:44.030> the<00:04:44.210> stronger<00:04:44.620> limb<00:04:45.620> components<00:04:46.220> me

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
one of the stronger limb components me

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.560 
one of the stronger limb components me
especially<00:04:46.460> cuz<00:04:46.760> he<00:04:46.850> has<00:04:46.940> that<00:04:47.090> nice<00:04:47.240> heel

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
especially cuz he has that nice heel

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.020 
especially cuz he has that nice heel
then<00:04:48.080> you<00:04:48.200> have<00:04:48.320> does<00:04:48.710> have<00:04:48.890> decent<00:04:49.220> toes<00:04:49.580> and

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
then you have does have decent toes and

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.940 
then you have does have decent toes and
an<00:04:50.180> onslaught<00:04:50.600> you<00:04:51.170> can't<00:04:51.410> not<00:04:51.620> have<00:04:51.650> him

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
an onslaught you can't not have him

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.670 
an onslaught you can't not have him
because<00:04:52.100> he's<00:04:52.280> the<00:04:52.310> central<00:04:52.820> unit<00:04:53.060> so

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
because he's the central unit so

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.960 
because he's the central unit so
basically<00:04:54.680> I<00:04:54.800> highly<00:04:55.190> recommend<00:04:55.610> this<00:04:55.700> set

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
basically I highly recommend this set

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.810 
basically I highly recommend this set
you<00:04:56.720> may<00:04:56.840> want<00:04:57.080> to<00:04:57.140> look<00:04:58.070> for<00:04:58.280> pictures<00:04:58.490> of

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
you may want to look for pictures of

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.250 
you may want to look for pictures of
other<00:04:58.910> fan<00:04:59.210> modes<00:04:59.450> like<00:04:59.600> I've<00:04:59.690> seen<00:04:59.900> some

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
other fan modes like I've seen some

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.360 
other fan modes like I've seen some
different<00:05:01.160> fan<00:05:01.340> modes<00:05:01.580> for<00:05:01.790> brawl<00:05:02.510> and<00:05:03.370> blast

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
different fan modes for brawl and blast

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.130 
different fan modes for brawl and blast
off<00:05:04.610> where<00:05:04.910> they're<00:05:05.420> both<00:05:05.570> the<00:05:05.690> legs<00:05:05.900> where

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
off where they're both the legs where

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.990 
off where they're both the legs where
they're<00:05:06.290> both<00:05:06.530> really<00:05:07.250> nice<00:05:07.430> thick<00:05:07.820> and

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
they're both really nice thick and

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.780 
they're both really nice thick and
chunky<00:05:08.240> sort<00:05:08.630> of<00:05:08.690> g1e<00:05:09.110> legs<00:05:09.410> I<00:05:09.740> don't<00:05:10.550> think

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
chunky sort of g1e legs I don't think

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.190 
chunky sort of g1e legs I don't think
they<00:05:10.850> really<00:05:11.120> work<00:05:11.240> for<00:05:11.390> this<00:05:11.510> figure<00:05:11.840> because

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
they really work for this figure because

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.490 
they really work for this figure because
I<00:05:12.500> think<00:05:13.340> being<00:05:13.790> a<00:05:14.000> tall

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
I think being a tall

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.330 
I think being a tall
and<00:05:14.740> kind<00:05:15.460> of<00:05:15.520> lanky<00:05:15.880> works<00:05:16.480> for<00:05:16.870> it<00:05:17.320> I<00:05:17.350> see<00:05:18.220> why

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
and kind of lanky works for it I see why

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.890 
and kind of lanky works for it I see why
a<00:05:18.370> lot<00:05:18.580> of<00:05:18.640> people<00:05:18.850> wouldn't<00:05:19.000> like<00:05:19.120> about<00:05:19.390> it

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
a lot of people wouldn't like about it

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:22.530 
a lot of people wouldn't like about it
it<00:05:20.410> works<00:05:20.620> for<00:05:20.860> me<00:05:20.950> or<00:05:21.130> Heather<00:05:21.280> and<00:05:21.670> I

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 
it works for me or Heather and I

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:23.970 
it works for me or Heather and I
definitely<00:05:22.720> do<00:05:23.110> recommend<00:05:23.350> using<00:05:23.650> this

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
definitely do recommend using this

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.500 
definitely do recommend using this
transformation<00:05:24.340> for<00:05:24.760> blast-off<00:05:25.120> because

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
transformation for blast-off because

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.420 
transformation for blast-off because
anything<00:05:26.080> to<00:05:26.320> give<00:05:26.440> the<00:05:26.590> upper<00:05:26.950> body<00:05:27.160> more

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
anything to give the upper body more

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.150 
anything to give the upper body more
chunk<00:05:27.790> is<00:05:28.000> really<00:05:28.810> nice<00:05:28.990> and<00:05:29.650> I<00:05:29.770> think<00:05:29.800> it<00:05:30.040> does

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
chunk is really nice and I think it does

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.130 
chunk is really nice and I think it does
such<00:05:30.370> a<00:05:30.400> good<00:05:30.610> job<00:05:30.670> and<00:05:31.090> like<00:05:31.690> I<00:05:31.780> was<00:05:31.930> saying

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
such a good job and like I was saying

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.730 
such a good job and like I was saying
when<00:05:32.260> I<00:05:32.380> was<00:05:32.560> uh<00:05:32.590> in<00:05:33.720> a<00:05:34.720> blast-off's<00:05:35.260> review

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
when I was uh in a blast-off's review

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.460 
when I was uh in a blast-off's review
where<00:05:35.980> I<00:05:36.010> show<00:05:36.100> off<00:05:36.490> this<00:05:36.640> fan<00:05:36.910> mode<00:05:37.150> I<00:05:37.470> really

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
where I show off this fan mode I really

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.590 
where I show off this fan mode I really
think<00:05:38.740> the<00:05:38.860> biggest<00:05:39.010> problem<00:05:39.280> of<00:05:39.700> the<00:05:40.240> normal

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 
think the biggest problem of the normal

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.660 
think the biggest problem of the normal
arm<00:05:41.290> transformation<00:05:41.950> once<00:05:42.070> ends<00:05:42.310> up<00:05:42.400> being

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:42.670 
arm transformation once ends up being

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.700 
arm transformation once ends up being
super<00:05:43.330> long<00:05:43.480> with<00:05:43.630> law<00:05:43.810> of<00:05:43.870> mass<00:05:44.110> down<00:05:44.410> here

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
super long with law of mass down here

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.380 
super long with law of mass down here
it's<00:05:45.250> just<00:05:45.340> that<00:05:45.610> it<00:05:45.730> looks<00:05:45.970> like<00:05:46.030> it's<00:05:46.270> trying

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:46.390 
it's just that it looks like it's trying

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.100 
it's just that it looks like it's trying
to<00:05:46.600> mimic<00:05:46.750> the<00:05:47.970> functionality<00:05:48.970> of<00:05:49.000> the<00:05:49.720> vortex

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
to mimic the functionality of the vortex

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.080 
to mimic the functionality of the vortex
arm<00:05:50.380> like<00:05:50.890> here<00:05:51.040> it's<00:05:51.130> obviously<00:05:51.580> not<00:05:51.760> trying

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
arm like here it's obviously not trying

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.280 
arm like here it's obviously not trying
to<00:05:52.210> mimic<00:05:52.450> it<00:05:52.600> so<00:05:52.810> even<00:05:53.020> though<00:05:53.140> it's

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:53.290 
to mimic it so even though it's

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.810 
to mimic it so even though it's
different<00:05:53.860> in<00:05:54.160> that<00:05:54.280> proportion

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
different in that proportion

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.310 
different in that proportion
it<00:05:54.940> doesn't<00:05:55.270> look<00:05:55.360> wrong<00:05:55.660> it<00:05:55.900> just<00:05:56.080> looks<00:05:56.230> like

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
it doesn't look wrong it just looks like

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.470 
it doesn't look wrong it just looks like
a<00:05:56.590> different<00:05:57.310> type<00:05:57.670> of<00:05:57.910> arm<00:05:58.060> which<00:05:58.180> I<00:05:58.300> think

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:58.480 
a different type of arm which I think

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.110 
a different type of arm which I think
works<00:05:59.080> really<00:05:59.410> well<00:05:59.650> and<00:06:00.640> I<00:06:00.820> can<00:06:00.970> actually

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
works really well and I can actually

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.670 
works really well and I can actually
even<00:06:01.480> get<00:06:01.630> a<00:06:01.690> little<00:06:01.750> bit<00:06:01.960> poseability<00:06:02.320> with

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
even get a little bit poseability with

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.800 
even get a little bit poseability with
this<00:06:02.800> because<00:06:02.980> you<00:06:03.070> can<00:06:03.190> move<00:06:03.370> the<00:06:03.810> Clauses
