basically<00:01:48.540> ready<00:01:49.140> then<00:01:49.500> for<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.970> make<00:01:51.090> more

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
videos basically but this is just a

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.280 
videos basically but this is just a
quick<00:01:53.579> video<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:54.450> can<00:01:54.570> think<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.869> as<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:54.990> lazy

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
quick video you can think of as a lazy

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.319 
quick video you can think of as a lazy
video<00:01:55.649> if<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.829> want<00:01:56.040> but<00:01:56.399> it's<00:01:56.850> not<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.149> bad

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
video if you want but it's not that bad

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.600 
video if you want but it's not that bad
but<00:01:58.110> both<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.799> will<00:01:59.070> seamless

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
but both of that will seamless

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:30.270 
but both of that will seamless
