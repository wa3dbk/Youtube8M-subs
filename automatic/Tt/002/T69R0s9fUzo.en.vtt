00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.140
 Good Iiii 

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.140
 Four 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.560
 by Hi people are sports How are you all? 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.830
 Ha A' 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:24.210
 8 Today's repair is also mid this 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:28.080
 It is the place of the sound mail of the web, but it is a place that cuts well 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.520
 In that repair, such as doing it that always today is that 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.700
 I do not show everything 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:41.230
 It is good point of attention here part 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:46.780
 That's where I said now that I've been doing now, but I'm back, but three days a day 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:48.820
 I'm also passing through, but after the first time in the first time in the first time, it's completed but before that sensibility 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.180
 In this state 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.180
 this 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:59.150
 Please adjust the length of the cord tightly 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:03.540
 If you take this diagonally , you will see a large pocket 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:08.390
 It is easy to make it spread in the morning sun 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:12.200
 If you shorten this in two bottles 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:18.860
 It is easy to make a pocket like life 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:22.610
 New only and even Well, for example, here Lorin instrument's mid-width because we tighten the string 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.620
 It's narrow , so I'm getting deeper 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.440
 so 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:36.670
 For this ace and this, Mr. z takes a little wider while sleeping 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:40.300
 Note to so you can the difference of the finished that we'll I was saying, become Hiromeutsushime 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:44.820
 Simon's note length adjustment in this state 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.820
 Please do it, then I will finish it 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.330
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.590
 Yes I feel like this, I tried to finish good for the spread today 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.130
 Yes 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.500
 Wide and shallow 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:16.000
 I feel like I'm sorry 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:22.350
 It is the last point of caution of that last , but it is disturbed if it is too long for this sound stream this day 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:27.280
 If you leave it for a long time, even if it was a little short, you can make the adjustment to expand it. 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.880
 It may first I also little or hope I'll be careful short here is short and it anymore 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.510
 I will not 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.970
 When I say that because to adjust while compressing for spread 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.990
 Yes yes 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:41.410
 It is easy, but today is such a feeling 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.410
 Sora 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 Hmm
