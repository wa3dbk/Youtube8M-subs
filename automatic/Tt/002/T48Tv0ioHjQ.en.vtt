00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
way in the reason why I'm doing this is

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.749 
way in the reason why I'm doing this is
because<00:01:03.380> I<00:01:03.590> want<00:01:03.770> the<00:01:03.860> end<00:01:04.040> of<00:01:04.190> the<00:01:04.280> wing<00:01:04.489> to<00:01:04.670> be

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
because I want the end of the wing to be

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.030 
because I want the end of the wing to be
tapered<00:01:05.210> out<00:01:05.360> we<00:01:06.080> don't<00:01:06.259> want<00:01:06.500> it<00:01:06.590> to<00:01:06.680> be<00:01:06.800> solid

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040
