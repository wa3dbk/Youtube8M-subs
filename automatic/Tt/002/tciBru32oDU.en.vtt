00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.460
 I thought you were coming early 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.520
 Yeah. if 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.680
 It has been 2000 years since you can barely claim that this is fast 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.420
 Actually I'm not worried to go back and remember they tortured me 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.920
 Do not be too lazy about it and go to one of the first world countries like America 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.640
 Where there are many Catholics who do not agree to torture 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.700
 Really, do you think the time is right? 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.260
 Definitely yes 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:51.180
 You can not go that way. Do you expect that they are ready to meet a long white man, but should appear appropriately with your Palestinian name and your clothes? 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.740
 To Jeffrey you're right I'll go back to them 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.760
 How do I look ? 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.560
 Ideal 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.300
 And you have to wear your old clothes 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.040
 Like this 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.320
 Looks very cool 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.600
 I'm very excited Jeffrey 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.520
 Now you will go to a public place with many people to witness your descent 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.400
 good idea 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.940
 Know a place filled with people and the masses 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.500
 They seem to be a good place to go back 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.380
 Nabam is also a wonderland of the world 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.620
 It looks charming and charming 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:39.420
 It is also full of important people 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.080
 Thanks for helping Jeffrey appreciate him 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.420
 Come to Lucoria 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.200
 Ok Fuck 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:02:09.160
 Music blaring 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:22.020
 I am here to send you to the kingdom of mole Hashish 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.860
 Yarkhi Ya Oh Mai led 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:41.020
 Hit stop to move Please stop 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.300
 Yashab and his mother 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.360
 GuantÃ¡namo prison 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.420
 A goal has been revived or destroyed 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.340
 Enter here, O despicable quorum 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.240
 Let me get out of here 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.640
 Osama bin Laden 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.060
 I hope that bread and water you like 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.340
 I love him and I will get out of here 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.340
 jesus 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.200
 Welcome to my modest home 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.720
 Not Muhammad what are you doing here? 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.040
 I live here 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.620
 I do not want to get out of this rotten place 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.220
 Where I belong 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.300
 Excellent I happened to have an idea 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.180
 Let's hear it 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.840
 Kill you and then kill me 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.340
 Maybe you should think again 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.200
 What do I kill you and then kill me using your power to revive the dead and go to heaven 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.480
 There is a wall in the road that prevents me from going to heaven 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.600
 Damn those Americans thought about everything 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.480
 I think I have a better idea 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.900
 Hack all this 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.100
 He continued to eat 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:13.160
 Jesus turned the water into wine. How will he swallow the bread now? 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.200
 I have the solution 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.220
 The weakness of Muslims 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.700
 how did you get it? 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.960
 Do all of our purposes 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.660
 I have more stores than you 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.440
 What will you do? 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.960
 Just a simple art project 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.980
 He answered 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:49.040
 Do not stop, please stop 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:05:06.220
 Matt is not Mohammed 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:19.360
 Another 2,000-year-old gives them 66 children 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.680
 Be sure to give them 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.260
 Yagmila Yahlouh Yamzah 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.020
 What the hell? 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.080
 Who do you believe? 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.760
 Muhammad is not your excuse 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.460
 A distant station 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.300
 All questions have been answered. All questions, answers, questions, questions, questions, questions, questions, answers, questions, questions, questions, answers. 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:53.500
 When people describe your religions as violent and barbaric, the worst way to prove this is by practicing barbarity and brutality.
