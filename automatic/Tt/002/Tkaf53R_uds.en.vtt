00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:14.340
 Now we are driving lessons 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.460
 will consider 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.080
 practical actions 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:26.390
 while stopping the car 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:30.650
 novice drivers often ask here 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:35.140
 what question how to do when 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:38.650
 full stop with the clutch pedal and 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.650
 brake pedal 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:46.570
 First of all 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.100
 need to complete a full stop 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.710
 do not shoot 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.120
 foot from the clutch pedal or rather not 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:59.379
 release the pedal until we 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.379
 remove from gear 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.220
 if we don't take off the gear and let go 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.450
 pedal 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:12.280
 the machine rush forward and on 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:15.090
 crosswalk can run over 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.090
 pedestrians 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:26.690
 brake pedal also needed 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:31.940
 let go only if we 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:37.510
 sure that the car does not roll back not 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.510
 back not forward depending on the slope 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:47.750
 Now we will try to practice 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:50.800
 consider all the right actions in 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.800
 stop time 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:13.250
 we need to choose a place include 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.990
 where necessary 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.990
 appropriate turn signal 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.890
 included turn made sure no 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.550
 cars on the right side viewed 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.550
 all zones 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.130
 set the car in parallel 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:43.360
 curb squeeze the clutch and 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.360
 slow down to a full stop 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:53.930
 look 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.930
 now the clutch pedal is pressed then the floor 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:02.250
 and the brake pedal is depressed that's what 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:07.240
 actions we have to perform first 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:11.590
 Hurry to remove the gear and install 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:18.239
 lever in neutral position that's just 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:18.239
 now we can let go of the pedal and 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:28.640
 right foot hold the brake pedal 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:32.209
 gradually let go and look not 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:36.890
 does the car roll back 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:41.319
 the option is suitable for the territory of the carriageway 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.319
 parts where there is no bias 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.240
 if we stand on the rise or 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:53.320
 downhill 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:58.110
 it means the pedal is held until 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.110
 did not put the car on the handbrake 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:09.370
 after that we can take your foot off 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.370
 brake pedals
