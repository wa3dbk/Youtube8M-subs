00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.040
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:01.349 --> 00:00:09.750
 forever and this video is about how 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.650
 download assassins creed rock right 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.980
 name rouge 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:18.390
 as regards downloads if we 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:21.260
 let's introduce the same gulin 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.260
 download 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.900
 also write its correct kreed 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:33.280
 bow 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.880
 on an essay on personal computers we 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.070
 we can immediately see a bunch of different links 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:43.570
 you even see me marked yourself on 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:47.290
 which I went well honestly everywhere 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.870
 in fact you can meet the divorce 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.000
 the plan of what is being downloaded perfect 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.570
 Poltava file exotic with icon 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.510
 torrent 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.730
 Of course this is not true it is rather 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.640
 most likely even a viral program 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.160
 which you can pick up and now I 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.240
 I will tell specifically the site on which 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:09.610
 can download torrent site n.n. Terry 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.740
 club point ru well you see when you first 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.350
 he comes in here, he gives you this 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.210
 adventure reserved 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.250
 but no less need to press 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.590
 more go to the site 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.960
 he will still be issued what 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.970
 insecure connection but basically i 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.720
 vouch for this site repeatedly here 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.020
 downloaded on the new and similar 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.780
 go to the tracker section 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.370
 and I are basically the 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.940
 immediately assassin's creed rock 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.940
 click search 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.859
 we went to mail.ru a little bit 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.330
 wrong i did because i need 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:51.810
 will look for him here 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.810
 click search 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:02:01.060
 and voila many different versions that is 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:04.570
 we are specifically interested in these four 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.130
 They are in the hot news section 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:12.110
 license code in principle it can not 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:14.280
 take specifically from say repack rg 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.140
 games 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:21.420
 basically on your screen now! 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.480
 repack rg mechanics 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.950
 In principle, I use it, that is, we are on 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.130
 channel you can find the passage 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.370
 These games just the same through this one 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.370
 most 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:39.170
 repack from mechanics I play well and the third 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.540
 repack is the same catalyst 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.180
 in principle, they are all good enough 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.770
 novak exactly each of them i'm not 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.050
 compared to each other, I used to 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.720
 use exactly poultices from 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.370
 mechanics and therefore 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.520
 I probably advise you because already 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.640
 checked I'm going through no glitches and 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.790
 there is no such thing basically 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.520
 distinctive characteristics they have 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.380
 exactly in the launcher and the like 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.660
 that is, here we can features 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.260
 release see for yourself 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:16.760
 features here and i even somewhere in my 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:19.940
 I met the screenshot of the launcher here 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.040
 Already accounting is not visible for some reason because 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.489
 i am unregistered now 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.109
 basically quick if you make it 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.700
 can see a lot of new information but 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:34.069
 again yes of course there is an advertisement 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.730
 chickens sometimes without which not to do 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.730
 one site 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.439
 again here to say that here 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.530
 ruling all things but we have enough 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:48.890
 just once flipping on the page back we 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.019
 already kinda went about how 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.400
 In general, all go to the main mistakes of his 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.489
 by the way installation and launch 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.989
 here we see this launcher further 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.989
 just update here 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:06.710
 go down setting and running here 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.710
 in principle, we have nothing 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:14.010
 and repack from the mechanics that I 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:17.489
 enjoyed it too need to upgrade 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.160
 and by the way this one we looked while 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.250
 that only metalworkers from setting and 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.639
 start see already completely different 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:28.229
 installer 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:30.710
 and here is the same but you choose yourself as 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:34.800
 you want some you like 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:37.919
 Principle on this all precisely and but us 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.350
 The club can be downloaded assassins creed if 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:44.100
 you do not want to pay 1800 rubles 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:47.729
 incentive for this game I certainly paid you 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.560
 well, probably too much cost 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:52.169
 despite the fact that the toy is me 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.270
 really like on our channel 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:56.490
 there will be a complete passage this is not 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.220
 forget to subscribe to like 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.150
