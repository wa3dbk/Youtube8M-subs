00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.309
 we were always told that sooner or later 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.309
 it can happen 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:20.310
 one day the world familiar to us will disappear 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:33.980
 it was a biological weapon with 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:37.090
 the virus spared no one people began to vomit 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:41.950
 each other to pieces just to survive 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.950
 society fell into decay 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.370
 it was a sign to us 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.370
 what's normal life 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.030
 is over 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.610
 we are the last frontier 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.399
 we are fighters of the special squad 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:20.280
 we don't know how many of us 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.280
 and what we have to go through 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.960
 but one thing we know for sure 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:36.140
 we have hope for a brighter tomorrow 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.140
 and we are ready to fight for him
