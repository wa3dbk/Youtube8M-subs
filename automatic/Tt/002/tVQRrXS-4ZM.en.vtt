00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:09.100 
okay I'm here with that HP Mini 5 102

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.740 
okay I'm here with that HP Mini 5 102
netbook<00:00:09.550> and<00:00:09.820> I'm<00:00:10.420> just<00:00:10.570> going<00:00:10.720> to

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:10.750 
netbook and I'm just going to

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.450 
netbook and I'm just going to
demonstrate<00:00:10.930> the<00:00:11.650> problems<00:00:12.160> with<00:00:12.370> the

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:12.460 
demonstrate the problems with the

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.400 
demonstrate the problems with the
keyboard<00:00:12.820> that<00:00:13.089> it<00:00:13.750> has<00:00:14.460> basically<00:00:16.290> if<00:00:17.290> you

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
keyboard that it has basically if you

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.640 
keyboard that it has basically if you
type<00:00:17.700> three<00:00:18.700> keys<00:00:18.970> together<00:00:19.230> they'll<00:00:20.230> send

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
type three keys together they'll send

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.450 
type three keys together they'll send
another<00:00:20.920> key<00:00:21.670> that's<00:00:22.000> unrelated<00:00:22.449> for<00:00:22.810> example

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
another key that's unrelated for example

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.830 
another key that's unrelated for example
if<00:00:24.460> you<00:00:24.640> type<00:00:24.880> I've<00:00:25.180> just<00:00:25.300> got<00:00:25.449> a<00:00:25.480> notepad<00:00:25.630> open

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
if you type I've just got a notepad open

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.040 
if you type I've just got a notepad open
here<00:00:26.260> to<00:00:26.349> show<00:00:26.560> if<00:00:27.310> you<00:00:27.490> type<00:00:27.730> CD<00:00:28.179> space<00:00:28.210> in

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
here to show if you type CD space in

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.140 
here to show if you type CD space in
quickly<00:00:29.439> it'll<00:00:30.220> actually<00:00:30.460> send<00:00:30.880> the<00:00:30.939> Enter

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
quickly it'll actually send the Enter

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.609 
quickly it'll actually send the Enter
key<00:00:31.179> as<00:00:31.420> well<00:00:31.570> so<00:00:31.810> just<00:00:31.840> watch<00:00:32.140> I'll<00:00:32.320> just<00:00:32.439> type

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
key as well so just watch I'll just type

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:39.410 
key as well so just watch I'll just type
CD<00:00:32.980> space<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:34.390> for<00:00:34.540> example<00:00:34.930> if<00:00:35.020> I'm<00:00:35.170> in<00:00:35.320> a

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.850 

farming<00:00:40.420> Linux<00:00:40.750> or<00:00:40.960> Dass<00:00:41.170> and<00:00:41.200> I'm<00:00:41.530> trying<00:00:41.800> to

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
farming Linux or Dass and I'm trying to

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.260 
farming Linux or Dass and I'm trying to
change<00:00:42.010> directory<00:00:42.460> and<00:00:42.579> talk<00:00:42.760> and<00:00:42.910> quickly

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.270 
change directory and talk and quickly

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.830 
change directory and talk and quickly
it'll<00:00:43.930> press<00:00:44.170> enter<00:00:44.530> and<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:46.300> know<00:00:46.450> ruin<00:00:46.750> the

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
it'll press enter and you know ruin the

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.020 
it'll press enter and you know ruin the
command<00:00:47.170> say<00:00:47.620> that's<00:00:48.280> a<00:00:48.460> really<00:00:48.760> annoying

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
command say that's a really annoying

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.720 
command say that's a really annoying
problem<00:00:49.480> it<00:00:49.629> also<00:00:49.750> does<00:00:50.140> it<00:00:50.579> with<00:00:51.579> other

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
problem it also does it with other

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.990 
problem it also does it with other
combinations<00:00:52.420> say<00:00:52.809> a<00:00:53.050> Zed<00:00:53.890> in<00:00:54.039> space<00:00:54.370> see<00:00:54.850> it's

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
combinations say a Zed in space see it's

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.360 
combinations say a Zed in space see it's
going<00:00:55.359> down<00:00:55.539> lines<00:00:55.809> I'm<00:00:56.649> not<00:00:56.800> pressing<00:00:56.980> enter

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
going down lines I'm not pressing enter

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.549 
going down lines I'm not pressing enter
at<00:00:57.460> all<00:00:57.609> but<00:00:57.879> it's<00:00:58.000> it's<00:00:58.780> pressing<00:00:59.020> entered<00:00:59.350> by

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
at all but it's it's pressing entered by

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.280 
at all but it's it's pressing entered by
itself<00:00:59.910> X<00:01:00.910> and<00:01:01.750> s<00:01:01.930> they<00:01:02.320> do<00:01:02.379> it<00:01:02.590> to<00:01:03.360> FV<00:01:04.360> also

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
itself X and s they do it to FV also

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.110 
itself X and s they do it to FV also
have<00:01:05.440> the<00:01:05.530> problem<00:01:07.620> there's<00:01:08.620> also<00:01:09.120> problems

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
have the problem there's also problems

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.230 
have the problem there's also problems
with<00:01:10.360> other<00:01:10.600> key<00:01:10.870> combinations<00:01:11.530> so<00:01:11.830> D<00:01:12.160> F<00:01:12.670> and<00:01:13.000> T

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
with other key combinations so D F and T

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.040 
with other key combinations so D F and T
will<00:01:14.140> actually<00:01:14.560> send<00:01:14.830> the<00:01:15.160> f3<00:01:16.030> key<00:01:16.240> by<00:01:17.020> itself

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
will actually send the f3 key by itself

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:23.340 
will actually send the f3 key by itself
now<00:01:17.770> by<00:01:17.980> default<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:19.320> HP<00:01:20.320> minis<00:01:22.140> hold<00:01:23.140> down

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
now by default the HP minis hold down

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.410 
now by default the HP minis hold down
the<00:01:23.500> function<00:01:23.650> key<00:01:24.100> so<00:01:24.370> when<00:01:24.580> send<00:01:24.820> f3<00:01:25.210> it'll

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
the function key so when send f3 it'll

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.900 
the function key so when send f3 it'll
actually<00:01:25.510> send<00:01:25.870> the<00:01:25.930> function<00:01:26.320> of<00:01:26.440> f3<00:01:26.830> so<00:01:27.670> if<00:01:27.820> I

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 
actually send the function of f3 so if I

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.200 
actually send the function of f3 so if I
type<00:01:28.120> DFT<00:01:28.840> and<00:01:29.080> quickly<00:01:30.010> see<00:01:30.730> it's<00:01:30.850> changing

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
type DFT and quickly see it's changing

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.950 
type DFT and quickly see it's changing
the<00:01:31.300> brightness<00:01:31.480> on<00:01:31.870> the<00:01:31.900> screen<00:01:33.960> because

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
the brightness on the screen because

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.840 
the brightness on the screen because
that's<00:01:35.170> what<00:01:35.410> if<00:01:35.650> the<00:01:35.860> three<00:01:36.040> function<00:01:36.730> if

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
that's what if the three function if

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.630 
that's what if the three function if
three<00:01:37.090> is<00:01:37.150> assigned<00:01:37.450> to<00:01:37.630> on<00:01:38.440> the<00:01:38.560> keyboard<00:01:38.980> and

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
three is assigned to on the keyboard and

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.280 
three is assigned to on the keyboard and
you<00:01:39.700> can<00:01:39.910> see<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.270> brightness<00:01:40.720> has<00:01:40.990> come<00:01:41.170> up

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
you can see the brightness has come up

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.380 
you can see the brightness has come up
on<00:01:42.100> the<00:01:42.250> screen<00:01:42.340> they're<00:01:42.670> all<00:01:42.820> on<00:01:42.970> pressing<00:01:43.300> is

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
on the screen they're all on pressing is

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.930 
on the screen they're all on pressing is
DF<00:01:43.750> and<00:01:43.930> T<00:01:46.320> another<00:01:47.320> combination<00:01:48.010> is<00:01:48.220> the

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
DF and T another combination is the

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.750 
DF and T another combination is the
numbers<00:01:49.300> two<00:01:49.540> six<00:01:49.840> seven<00:01:50.050> so<00:01:50.410> if<00:01:50.500> I<00:01:50.590> type<00:01:50.800> 267<00:01:51.640> n

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
numbers two six seven so if I type 267 n

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.920 
numbers two six seven so if I type 267 n
it<00:01:52.600> sends<00:01:52.990> a<00:01:53.050> thing<00:01:53.230> into<00:01:53.410> standby<00:01:53.830> because

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
it sends a thing into standby because

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.000 
it sends a thing into standby because
267<00:01:55.930> press<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.590> f5<00:01:57.250> key<00:01:57.310> and<00:01:58.180> by<00:01:58.390> default

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
267 press the f5 key and by default

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.740 
267 press the f5 key and by default
because<00:02:00.010> the<00:02:00.310> function<00:02:00.760> key<00:02:00.940> is<00:02:01.060> always<00:02:01.330> on<00:02:01.510> on

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
because the function key is always on on

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.630 
because the function key is always on on
these<00:02:01.960> netbooks<00:02:02.380> it<00:02:02.680> sends<00:02:03.010> it<00:02:03.100> into<00:02:03.220> standby

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
these netbooks it sends it into standby

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.219 
these netbooks it sends it into standby
which<00:02:03.820> is<00:02:03.910> really<00:02:04.150> annoying

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.729 

now<00:02:08.800> this<00:02:08.950> problem<00:02:09.220> isn't<00:02:09.670> limited<00:02:09.879> to

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739
