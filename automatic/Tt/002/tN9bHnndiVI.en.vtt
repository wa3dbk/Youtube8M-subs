00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
so today I want to talk about signing

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.340 
so today I want to talk about signing
your<00:00:02.909> piece<00:00:03.149> a<00:00:03.360> lot<00:00:03.570> of<00:00:03.720> people<00:00:03.929> don't<00:00:04.080> think

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
your piece a lot of people don't think

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.539 
your piece a lot of people don't think
that<00:00:04.470> the<00:00:04.529> signatures<00:00:04.920> very<00:00:05.100> important<00:00:05.460> but

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
that the signatures very important but

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.049 
that the signatures very important but
remember<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:05.970> signature<00:00:06.420> is<00:00:07.080> just<00:00:07.620> as<00:00:07.770> more

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:08.059 
remember the signature is just as more

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:10.459 
remember the signature is just as more
much<00:00:09.059> as<00:00:09.210> part<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.540> your<00:00:09.660> balance<00:00:10.050> as<00:00:10.200> any

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
much as part of your balance as any

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.890 
much as part of your balance as any
other<00:00:10.860> element<00:00:11.400> in<00:00:11.580> your<00:00:11.700> painting<00:00:12.090> so<00:00:12.690> when

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
other element in your painting so when

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.060 
other element in your painting so when
you're<00:00:13.049> putting<00:00:13.230> your<00:00:13.320> signature<00:00:13.860> somewhere

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
you're putting your signature somewhere

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.650 
you're putting your signature somewhere
in<00:00:14.490> around<00:00:14.820> here<00:00:15.000> traditionally<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.570> the

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
in around here traditionally to the

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.570 
in around here traditionally to the
bottom<00:00:15.960> of<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.109> painting<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.650> want<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.460> make

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
bottom of the painting you want to make

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.890 
bottom of the painting you want to make
sure<00:00:17.730> that<00:00:17.970> you're<00:00:18.150> putting<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.480> in<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.600> spot

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
sure that you're putting it in a spot

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.160 
sure that you're putting it in a spot
that<00:00:19.140> works<00:00:19.800> with<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.640> painting<00:00:21.029> now<00:00:21.689> one<00:00:22.140> of

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
that works with the painting now one of

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.920 
that works with the painting now one of
the<00:00:22.350> best<00:00:22.619> ways<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:22.949> do<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.869> with<00:00:24.869> a

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
the best ways to do that is with a

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.660 
the best ways to do that is with a
simple<00:00:25.730> acetate<00:00:26.730> overlay<00:00:27.890> so<00:00:28.890> I'll<00:00:29.279> put<00:00:29.550> this

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
simple acetate overlay so I'll put this

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.160 
simple acetate overlay so I'll put this
up<00:00:29.880> in<00:00:30.000> here<00:00:30.330> where<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:30.630> can<00:00:30.779> see<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.019> well

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
up in here where you can see it well

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.680 
up in here where you can see it well
okay<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.820> can<00:00:32.940> see<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.210> piece<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.510> acetate

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
okay you can see the piece of acetate

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.080 
okay you can see the piece of acetate
I've<00:00:34.320> actually<00:00:34.680> signed<00:00:34.950> my<00:00:35.190> name<00:00:35.219> on<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:35.880> so

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
I've actually signed my name on to it so

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.819 
I've actually signed my name on to it so
what<00:00:36.149> we're<00:00:36.270> gonna<00:00:36.360> do<00:00:36.570> now<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:36.930> let's<00:00:37.380> zoom<00:00:37.680> in

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
what we're gonna do now is let's zoom in

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.290 
what we're gonna do now is let's zoom in
a<00:00:37.860> little<00:00:38.070> bit<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.460> then<00:00:38.760> we'll<00:00:38.850> take<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.059> look

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
a little bit and then we'll take a look

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.000 
a little bit and then we'll take a look
at<00:00:39.480> how<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:39.960> can<00:00:40.050> move<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.500> around<00:00:40.649> on<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
at how I can move this around on the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.880 
at how I can move this around on the
acetate<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.610> see<00:00:41.760> where<00:00:41.940> I<00:00:41.969> want<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.300> actually

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
acetate and see where I want to actually

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.440 
acetate and see where I want to actually
place<00:00:43.890> my<00:00:44.160> signature<00:00:44.579> paint<00:00:44.879> my<00:00:45.000> signature

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
place my signature paint my signature

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.310 
place my signature paint my signature
onto<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.140> finished<00:00:46.440> painting

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.650 

so<00:00:49.920> now<00:00:50.040> that<00:00:50.100> was<00:00:50.310> zoomed<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:50.850> then<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.510> can

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
so now that was zoomed in then you can

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.850 
so now that was zoomed in then you can
see<00:00:51.810> that<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.080> is<00:00:52.200> my<00:00:52.290> little<00:00:52.590> piece<00:00:52.710> of

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
see that this is my little piece of

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.880 
see that this is my little piece of
acetate<00:00:53.040> and<00:00:53.910> all<00:00:54.060> I've<00:00:54.180> done<00:00:54.590> let's<00:00:55.590> put<00:00:55.770> my

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
acetate and all I've done let's put my

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:56.600 
acetate and all I've done let's put my
signature<00:00:56.130> on<00:00:56.460> it

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
signature on it

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.180 
signature on it
now<00:00:57.570> those<00:00:57.810> little<00:00:57.870> pieces<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.380> acetate<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:58.950> can

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
now those little pieces to acetate I can

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.590 
now those little pieces to acetate I can
actually<00:00:59.340> start<00:00:59.670> moving<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.150> signature

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
actually start moving the signature

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.410 
actually start moving the signature
around<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.230> seeing<00:01:01.640> where<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.670> like<00:01:03.060> it<00:01:03.270> and

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
around and seeing where I like it and

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.750 
around and seeing where I like it and
where<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.750> compositionally<00:01:04.589> likes<00:01:05.520> to<00:01:05.670> be

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
where it compositionally likes to be

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.730 
where it compositionally likes to be
placed<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.330> like<00:01:06.870> to<00:01:06.990> keep<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.200> horizontal

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
placed I like to keep a horizontal

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.020 
placed I like to keep a horizontal
signature<00:01:08.130> there's<00:01:08.490> just<00:01:08.640> something<00:01:08.970> about

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
signature there's just something about

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.590 
signature there's just something about
it<00:01:09.210> that's<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:10.020> know<00:01:10.140> elegant<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.600> just

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
it that's you know elegant and I just

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.480 
it that's you know elegant and I just
think<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.900> works<00:01:13.140> for<00:01:13.410> the<00:01:13.470> best<00:01:13.680> now<00:01:14.220> others

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
think it works for the best now others

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.030 
think it works for the best now others
have<00:01:14.670> been<00:01:14.760> known<00:01:14.940> to<00:01:15.110> make<00:01:16.110> their<00:01:16.380> signature

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
have been known to make their signature

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.660 
have been known to make their signature
a<00:01:18.080> part<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:20.820> actual<00:01:22.009> painting<00:01:23.009> which<00:01:23.460> one

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
a part of the actual painting which one

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.670 
a part of the actual painting which one
I<00:01:23.700> mean<00:01:24.000> by<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.720> could<00:01:25.530> actually

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
I mean by this is you could actually

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.400 
I mean by this is you could actually
sign<00:01:26.190> your<00:01:26.400> name<00:01:26.610> into<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.330> wood<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.200> put

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
sign your name into the wood and you put

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.990 
sign your name into the wood and you put
your<00:01:28.530> copy<00:01:28.710> right<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.070> your<00:01:29.220> Derek<00:01:29.580> C<00:01:29.759> wicks

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
your copy right in your Derek C wicks

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.969 
your copy right in your Derek C wicks
there<00:01:30.240> then<00:01:31.050> it'd<00:01:31.140> be<00:01:31.200> just<00:01:31.470> it<00:01:31.650> gets<00:01:31.740> hidden

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
there then it'd be just it gets hidden

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.010 
there then it'd be just it gets hidden
within<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.550> elements<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.600> painting<00:01:33.930> a

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
within the elements of the painting a

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.770 
within the elements of the painting a
lot<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.259> guys<00:01:34.800> that<00:01:35.160> are<00:01:35.220> kind<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.850> gimmicky<00:01:36.570> do

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
lot of guys that are kind of gimmicky do

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.109 
lot of guys that are kind of gimmicky do
that<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.530> that's<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.830> way<00:01:37.950> exact<00:01:38.729> reason

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
that I and that's the way exact reason

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.820 
that I and that's the way exact reason
why<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.270> don't<00:01:39.540> do<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.869> because<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.440> think<00:01:40.500> it's<00:01:40.770> a

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
why I don't do it because I think it's a

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.430 
why I don't do it because I think it's a
little<00:01:41.070> bit<00:01:41.430> gimmicky<00:01:41.930> now<00:01:42.930> when<00:01:43.170> I'm<00:01:43.290> looking

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
little bit gimmicky now when I'm looking

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.200 
little bit gimmicky now when I'm looking
around<00:01:43.680> at<00:01:43.920> my<00:01:44.040> signature<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.670> think<00:01:45.030> that

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
around at my signature I think that

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.580 
around at my signature I think that
that's<00:01:45.750> not<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.530> bad<00:01:47.160> spot<00:01:47.610> at<00:01:47.940> all<00:01:48.350> okay<00:01:49.350> it's

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
that's not a bad spot at all okay it's

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.810 
that's not a bad spot at all okay it's
kind<00:01:49.830> of<00:01:49.979> out<00:01:50.100> of<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:52.220> out<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.370> way<00:01:53.580> of<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
kind of out of the out of the way of the

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.670 
kind of out of the out of the way of the
main<00:01:54.030> focal<00:01:54.510> area<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:55.020> want<00:01:55.200> your<00:01:55.320> name<00:01:55.440> to<00:01:55.470> be

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
main focal area you want your name to be

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.350 
main focal area you want your name to be
there<00:01:55.860> but<00:01:55.979> not<00:01:56.100> pounding<00:01:56.460> people<00:01:57.030> over<00:01:57.240> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
there but not pounding people over the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.000 
there but not pounding people over the
head<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.840> just<00:01:58.020> want<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.530> nice

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
head you just want it in a nice

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.060 
head you just want it in a nice
inconspicuous<00:01:59.640> area<00:02:00.500> but<00:02:01.500> then<00:02:01.650> this<00:02:01.830> little

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
inconspicuous area but then this little

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.310 
inconspicuous area but then this little
grizzly<00:02:02.490> cub<00:02:02.729> was<00:02:02.940> really<00:02:03.780> worked<00:02:03.960> out<00:02:04.140> well

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
grizzly cub was really worked out well

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.840 
grizzly cub was really worked out well
and<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.620> think<00:02:04.680> it's<00:02:05.010> gonna<00:02:05.130> end<00:02:05.250> up<00:02:05.490> being<00:02:05.700> a

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
and I think it's gonna end up being a

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.399 
and I think it's gonna end up being a
limited<00:02:06.270> edition<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.900> I<00:02:06.930> had<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.229> take<00:02:07.350> it

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
limited edition so that I had to take it

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.469 
limited edition so that I had to take it
one<00:02:07.590> step<00:02:07.620> further<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.100> had<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.340> think<00:02:08.519> well<00:02:08.700> I'm

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
one step further I had to think well I'm

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.199 
one step further I had to think well I'm
gonna<00:02:09.630> be<00:02:09.780> signing<00:02:10.110> this<00:02:10.229> later<00:02:10.470> -<00:02:11.000> so<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.030> made

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
gonna be signing this later - so I made

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.650 
gonna be signing this later - so I made
another<00:02:12.450> piece<00:02:12.720> of<00:02:12.840> acetate<00:02:13.019> that<00:02:14.390> not<00:02:15.390> only

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
another piece of acetate that not only

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.449 
another piece of acetate that not only
had<00:02:16.489> the<00:02:17.489> signature<00:02:18.030> are<00:02:18.360> on<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.459> painted

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
had the signature are on the painted

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.140 
had the signature are on the painted
name<00:02:21.049> but<00:02:22.049> my<00:02:22.200> side<00:02:22.470> signature<00:02:22.980> too<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.730> then

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
name but my side signature too and then

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.240 
name but my side signature too and then
I<00:02:24.239> started<00:02:24.480> moving<00:02:24.600> it<00:02:24.930> around<00:02:25.049> to<00:02:25.950> see<00:02:26.130> where

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
I started moving it around to see where

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.400 
I started moving it around to see where
I<00:02:26.340> liked<00:02:26.580> it<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.330> then<00:02:27.540> once<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.840> did<00:02:28.049> that<00:02:28.080> over

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
I liked it and then once I did that over

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.410 
I liked it and then once I did that over
here<00:02:28.769> I<00:02:29.360> didn't<00:02:30.360> mind<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.890> actual<00:02:32.239> signed<00:02:33.239> in

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
here I didn't mind the actual signed in

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.449 
here I didn't mind the actual signed in
the<00:02:33.510> painting<00:02:33.870> signature<00:02:34.320> but<00:02:35.100> I<00:02:35.130> was<00:02:35.310> gonna

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
the painting signature but I was gonna

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.520 
the painting signature but I was gonna
lose<00:02:35.790> on<00:02:36.209> every<00:02:36.269> single<00:02:36.840> print<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.290> would<00:02:37.350> have

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
lose on every single print I would have

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.820 
lose on every single print I would have
lost<00:02:37.709> my<00:02:38.100> name<00:02:39.140> so<00:02:40.140> that's<00:02:40.350> what<00:02:40.530> I<00:02:40.560> thought

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
lost my name so that's what I thought

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.690 
lost my name so that's what I thought
well<00:02:41.040> over<00:02:41.489> here<00:02:41.670> might<00:02:41.880> not<00:02:42.090> be<00:02:42.239> too<00:02:42.420> bad<00:02:43.700> but

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
well over here might not be too bad but

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.090 
well over here might not be too bad but
then<00:02:44.850> we<00:02:44.970> ran<00:02:45.120> into<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.480> problem<00:02:45.900> of<00:02:46.080> now<00:02:46.830> God

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
then we ran into the problem of now God

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.380 
then we ran into the problem of now God
changed<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.519> number<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.030> color<00:02:48.750> I<00:02:48.840> on<00:02:49.230> my

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
changed the number of the color I on my

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.789 
changed the number of the color I on my
actual<00:02:51.390> in<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.900> painting<00:02:52.290> sign<00:02:52.470> named

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
actual in the painting sign named

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.280 
actual in the painting sign named
because<00:02:53.549> of<00:02:53.670> course<00:02:53.850> we're<00:02:54.060> losing<00:02:54.390> it<00:02:54.510> into

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
because of course we're losing it into

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.319 
because of course we're losing it into
the<00:02:55.470> actual<00:02:56.070> piece<00:02:56.400> now<00:02:56.610> so<00:02:56.970> that's<00:02:57.120> what<00:02:57.239> I'm

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:58.490 
the actual piece now so that's what I'm
gonna<00:02:57.450> do<00:02:57.600> now<00:02:57.780> is<00:02:57.900> I'm<00:02:57.989> gonna<00:02:58.079> paint<00:02:58.290> another

Blagh green that's in here so that it

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.569 
Blagh green that's in here so that it
goes<00:03:03.249> with<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:04.269> painting<00:03:04.950> all<00:03:05.950> right<00:03:06.249> so<00:03:06.549> our

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
goes with the painting all right so our

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.809 
goes with the painting all right so our
back<00:03:07.469> and<00:03:08.469> I've<00:03:08.739> made<00:03:08.920> a<00:03:08.980> new<00:03:09.219> little<00:03:09.519> piece<00:03:09.670> of

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
back and I've made a new little piece of

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.270 
back and I've made a new little piece of
acetate<00:03:10.030> that<00:03:10.359> just<00:03:10.719> has<00:03:10.900> my<00:03:11.109> Derrick<00:03:12.069> wicks

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
acetate that just has my Derrick wicks

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.890 
acetate that just has my Derrick wicks
and<00:03:12.549> this<00:03:12.730> time<00:03:12.909> I<00:03:12.939> saw<00:03:13.209> him<00:03:13.329> with<00:03:13.420> a<00:03:13.450> gold<00:03:13.719> pan

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
and this time I saw him with a gold pan

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.470 
and this time I saw him with a gold pan
cuz<00:03:14.109> I<00:03:14.170> thought<00:03:14.319> gold<00:03:14.590> was<00:03:14.799> going<00:03:15.219> to<00:03:15.430> be<00:03:16.329> much

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
cuz I thought gold was going to be much

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.119 
cuz I thought gold was going to be much
better<00:03:16.719> and<00:03:17.019> I<00:03:17.079> really<00:03:17.409> didn't<00:03:17.680> like<00:03:17.709> over

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:18.129 
better and I really didn't like over

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.399 
better and I really didn't like over
here<00:03:18.280> at<00:03:18.489> all<00:03:18.639> I<00:03:18.930> really<00:03:19.930> liked<00:03:20.139> what<00:03:20.379> I

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:20.409 
here at all I really liked what I

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.530 
here at all I really liked what I
started<00:03:20.769> seeing<00:03:21.040> when<00:03:21.609> I<00:03:21.639> moved<00:03:22.090> the

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
started seeing when I moved the

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.160 
started seeing when I moved the
signature<00:03:23.200> and<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:24.340> Derrick<00:03:24.639> wicks<00:03:25.079> over<00:03:26.079> to

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
signature and the Derrick wicks over to

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:33.349 
signature and the Derrick wicks over to
this<00:03:26.319> side<00:03:28.139> now<00:03:29.139> by<00:03:29.680> positioning<00:03:30.310> this<00:03:30.459> I

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.659 

could<00:03:34.359> see<00:03:34.629> that<00:03:35.169> that<00:03:35.650> would<00:03:36.159> be<00:03:36.310> the<00:03:36.430> perfect

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:36.669 
could see that that would be the perfect

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.599 
could see that that would be the perfect
placement<00:03:37.150> it<00:03:37.780> would<00:03:37.930> balance<00:03:38.139> off<00:03:38.530> with<00:03:39.430> some

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
placement it would balance off with some
