00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.050 
good and fine and fun but this
wheatgrass<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.680> one<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.160> reasons<00:00:17.609> that<00:00:17.820> we

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
wheatgrass is one of the reasons that we

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.420 
wheatgrass is one of the reasons that we
bought<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.840> yes<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.650> does<00:00:19.890> look<00:00:20.220> like

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
bought this and yes this does look like

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.960 
bought this and yes this does look like
a<00:00:20.490> patch<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:20.910> sod<00:00:22.100> this<00:00:23.100> particular<00:00:23.340> one<00:00:23.609> were

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
a patch of sod this particular one were

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.810 
a patch of sod this particular one were
grown<00:00:24.210> in<00:00:24.240> soil<00:00:24.720> says<00:00:25.619> effect<00:00:25.949> side<00:00:26.279> right<00:00:26.670> out

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
grown in soil says effect side right out

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.419 
grown in soil says effect side right out
of<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.970> yard<00:00:27.210> we<00:00:28.140> purchased<00:00:28.560> our<00:00:28.920> wheat<00:00:29.160> grass

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
of the yard we purchased our wheat grass

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.930 
of the yard we purchased our wheat grass
right<00:00:29.970> from<00:00:30.300> grassroots<00:00:30.689> natural<00:00:31.619> market<00:00:31.940> and

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
right from grassroots natural market and

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.660 
right from grassroots natural market and
so<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.300> can<00:00:33.510> buy<00:00:33.719> from<00:00:34.140> them<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.590> tray<00:00:35.040> or<00:00:35.340> half

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
so you can buy from them a tray or half

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.180 
so you can buy from them a tray or half
tray<00:00:36.059> this<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.540> half<00:00:36.780> tray<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.440> wheatgrass

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
tray this is a half tray of wheatgrass

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.100 
tray this is a half tray of wheatgrass
and<00:00:38.879> at<00:00:39.210> least<00:00:39.300> right<00:00:39.540> now<00:00:39.570> that's<00:00:39.899> around

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
and at least right now that's around

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.430 
and at least right now that's around
nine<00:00:40.620> or<00:00:40.649> ten<00:00:40.920> dollars<00:00:41.250> for<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.489> half<00:00:41.670> tray<00:00:42.440> and

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
nine or ten dollars for a half tray and

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.529 
nine or ten dollars for a half tray and
so<00:00:43.680> basically<00:00:44.010> we<00:00:44.640> just<00:00:44.670> trim<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.420> wheat

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
so basically we just trim the wheat

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.569 
so basically we just trim the wheat
grass<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.559> have<00:00:46.739> out<00:00:46.890> here<00:00:47.039> my<00:00:47.160> scissors

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
grass and I have out here my scissors

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.360 
grass and I have out here my scissors
and<00:00:48.649> i<00:00:49.649> also<00:00:49.860> have<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.789> bowl<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:52.070> water<00:00:53.070> that

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
and i also have a bowl of water that

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.400 
and i also have a bowl of water that
I've<00:00:53.520> gotten<00:00:53.910> from<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.270> filtration<00:00:54.809> on<00:00:55.170> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
I've gotten from the filtration on the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.389 
I've gotten from the filtration on the
fridge<00:00:55.680> which<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:55.980> have<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> pretty<00:00:56.340> good

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
fridge which you have a pretty good

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.209 
fridge which you have a pretty good
filter<00:00:56.760> on<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.879> fridge<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.680> like<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.710> rinse<00:00:59.039> it

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
filter on the fridge I like to rinse it

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.680 
filter on the fridge I like to rinse it
off<00:00:59.309> once<00:00:59.699> before<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.059> juice<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.510> because

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
off once before I juice it because

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.599 
off once before I juice it because
you're<00:01:01.109> drinking<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.559> wrong<00:01:01.770> right<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.309> so

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
you're drinking it wrong right and so

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.440 
you're drinking it wrong right and so
with<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.660> wheatgrass<00:01:05.030> you<00:01:06.030> don't<00:01:06.210> have<00:01:06.299> you

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
with the wheatgrass you don't have you

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.580 
with the wheatgrass you don't have you
don't<00:01:06.479> go<00:01:06.689> all<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.840> way<00:01:06.900> down<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.350> white

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
don't go all the way down to the white

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.580 
don't go all the way down to the white
but<00:01:07.890> you<00:01:07.979> kind<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.189> clip<00:01:09.200> if<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.320> think<00:01:10.530> about

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
but you kind of clip if you think about

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.859 
but you kind of clip if you think about
it<00:01:10.770> just<00:01:10.890> like<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.250> would<00:01:11.280> cut<00:01:11.580> grass<00:01:11.850> if<00:01:12.720> you

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
it just like you would cut grass if you

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.750 
it just like you would cut grass if you
were<00:01:12.960> trimming<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.350> off<00:01:13.470> cut<00:01:14.340> about<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.640> much

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
were trimming it off cut about that much

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.249 
were trimming it off cut about that much
off<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.390> just<00:01:15.570> dumped<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:15.990> bowl<00:01:16.170> and

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
off and I just dumped in the bowl and

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.230 
off and I just dumped in the bowl and
you<00:01:16.350> leave<00:01:16.759> about<00:01:17.759> an<00:01:17.970> inch<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:20.030> just<00:01:21.030> start

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
you leave about an inch and just start

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.380 
you leave about an inch and just start
from<00:01:21.360> one<00:01:21.570> end<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:21.900> trim<00:01:22.670> take<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.790> off<00:01:23.909> just

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
from one end and trim take it off just

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.880 
from one end and trim take it off just
like<00:01:24.509> cutting<00:01:24.900> grass<00:01:25.110> by<00:01:25.320> hand<00:01:25.560> it's<00:01:25.710> really

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
like cutting grass by hand it's really

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.830 
like cutting grass by hand it's really
kind<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.159> funny<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.640> do<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:29.659> probably<00:01:30.659> see

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
kind of funny to do it probably see

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.590 
kind of funny to do it probably see
there<00:01:31.729> I'm<00:01:32.729> started<00:01:33.090> cutting<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.420> back

just<00:03:04.720> rinsing<00:03:05.049> it<00:03:05.170> off<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:07.510> I<00:03:08.019> try<00:03:08.590> as<00:03:08.920> often

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
just rinsing it off and I try as often

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.170 
just rinsing it off and I try as often
as<00:03:09.459> possible<00:03:10.019> to<00:03:11.019> use<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.500> filtered<00:03:11.950> water<00:03:12.180> we

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
as possible to use the filtered water we

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.110 
as possible to use the filtered water we
have<00:03:13.389> very<00:03:13.689> highly<00:03:14.409> smelly<00:03:15.120> chlorinated

water<00:03:16.150> where<00:03:16.480> we<00:03:16.569> live<00:03:16.780> and<00:03:16.810> probably

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
water where we live and probably

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.199 
water where we live and probably
eventually<00:03:17.530> we'll<00:03:18.519> look<00:03:18.669> at<00:03:18.849> getting<00:03:19.120> a

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
eventually we'll look at getting a

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.050 
eventually we'll look at getting a
filter<00:03:19.690> for<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:19.989> sink<00:03:20.519> but<00:03:21.519> having<00:03:21.879> it

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
filter for the sink but having it

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.270 
filter for the sink but having it
invested<00:03:23.019> the<00:03:23.199> what<00:03:23.829> it<00:03:23.889> looks<00:03:24.040> like<00:03:24.129> to<00:03:24.190> be

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
invested the what it looks like to be

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.800 
invested the what it looks like to be
five<00:03:24.519> or<00:03:24.549> six<00:03:24.819> hundred<00:03:25.060> dollars<00:03:25.090> to<00:03:25.480> do<00:03:25.629> that

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
five or six hundred dollars to do that

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.720 
five or six hundred dollars to do that
to<00:03:26.290> get<00:03:26.379> a<00:03:26.440> reverse<00:03:26.590> osmosis<00:03:26.919> filter<00:03:27.579> I<00:03:27.609> get

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
to get a reverse osmosis filter I get

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.490 
to get a reverse osmosis filter I get
really<00:03:27.849> the<00:03:28.030> best<00:03:28.239> possible<00:03:28.510> filter<00:03:29.079> but

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
really the best possible filter but

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.180 
really the best possible filter but
because<00:03:29.799> we<00:03:29.980> are<00:03:30.129> renting<00:03:30.400> and<00:03:31.799> the<00:03:32.799> idea<00:03:33.099> of

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
because we are renting and the idea of

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.979 
because we are renting and the idea of
cutting<00:03:33.400> holes<00:03:33.699> in<00:03:33.879> someone<00:03:34.150> else's<00:03:34.480> sink<00:03:34.750> and

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
cutting holes in someone else's sink and

cutting holes in someone else's sink and

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
just a little just some text but

just a little just some text but
honestly<00:04:40.120> most<00:04:41.120> of<00:04:41.330> what<00:04:41.540> comes<00:04:41.570> out<00:04:42.940> looks

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.760 
honestly most of what comes out looks
like<00:04:44.120> chewed<00:04:44.360> grass<00:04:44.660> really<00:04:45.050> does<00:04:45.320> and<00:04:45.620> it's

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
pretty dry so there's not usually much

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.400 
pretty dry so there's not usually much
more<00:04:47.510> left<00:04:47.750> in<00:04:47.870> there<00:04:48.080> but<00:04:49.070> I<00:04:49.100> tend<00:04:49.400> to<00:04:49.490> do<00:04:49.610> that

of wheatgrass that we put through here

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.130 
of wheatgrass that we put through here
