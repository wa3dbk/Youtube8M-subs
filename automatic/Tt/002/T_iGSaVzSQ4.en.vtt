00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:15.889 
laptop now right I'm taking that part

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:17.460 
laptop now right I'm taking that part
because<00:00:16.190> the<00:00:16.339> motherboard<00:00:16.730> right<00:00:16.910> here<00:00:17.150> is

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:17.470 
because the motherboard right here is

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.710 
because the motherboard right here is
having<00:00:18.470> some<00:00:18.710> failing<00:00:19.189> RAM<00:00:19.429> in<00:00:19.669> it<00:00:19.820> it's

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
having some failing RAM in it it's

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.779 
having some failing RAM in it it's
missing<00:00:21.230> one<00:00:21.259> gigabyte<00:00:22.039> RAM<00:00:22.369> which<00:00:22.580> is

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
missing one gigabyte RAM which is

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.390 
missing one gigabyte RAM which is
completely<00:00:23.449> ridiculous<00:00:23.980> it<00:00:24.980> shouldn't<00:00:25.310> be

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
completely ridiculous it shouldn't be

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.989 
completely ridiculous it shouldn't be
doing<00:00:25.669> this<00:00:25.699> in<00:00:25.970> the<00:00:25.999> first<00:00:26.089> place<00:00:26.419> and<00:00:27.400> I<00:00:28.400> just

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:31.839 
doing this in the first place and I just
wanted<00:00:29.329> to<00:00:29.509> say<00:00:29.599> if<00:00:29.839> you<00:00:29.929> guys<00:00:30.109> ever<00:00:30.640> have<00:00:31.640> any

there's just one thing you may want to

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.819 
there's just one thing you may want to
watch<00:00:44.359> out<00:00:44.600> for<00:00:47.079> ports<00:00:48.079> like<00:00:48.289> I<00:00:48.769> can<00:00:49.550> focus<00:00:50.210> on

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
watch out for ports like I can focus on

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.930 
watch out for ports like I can focus on
like<00:00:51.829> the<00:00:51.980> speaker<00:00:52.370> poor<00:00:52.670> right<00:00:53.030> here<00:00:54.940> there

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
like the speaker poor right here there

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.319 
like the speaker poor right here there
you<00:00:56.030> go<00:00:56.949> it's<00:00:57.949> that's<00:00:58.339> a<00:00:58.519> special<00:00:58.940> way<00:00:59.059> take

you go it's that's a special way take
that<00:00:59.510> I<00:00:59.629> got<00:00:59.839> lift<00:01:00.109> up<00:01:00.289> on<00:01:00.500> it<00:01:00.679> and<00:01:01.570> this<00:01:02.570> port

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
that I got lift up on it and this port

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.580 
that I got lift up on it and this port
right<00:01:03.019> here<00:01:03.430> which<00:01:04.430> is<00:01:04.640> for<00:01:05.060> the<00:01:05.530> trackpad<00:01:06.530> and

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
right here which is for the trackpad and

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.290 
right here which is for the trackpad and
keyboard<00:01:07.510> there<00:01:08.510> is<00:01:08.690> a<00:01:08.720> little<00:01:09.200> thing<00:01:09.920> that

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
keyboard there is a little thing that

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.270 
keyboard there is a little thing that
flaps<00:01:11.300> up<00:01:11.540> and<00:01:11.750> down<00:01:11.930> you<00:01:12.710> just<00:01:12.830> gotta<00:01:13.100> make

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
flaps up and down you just gotta make

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.920 
flaps up and down you just gotta make
sure<00:01:13.340> you<00:01:13.670> aren't<00:01:13.820> lifting<00:01:14.060> up<00:01:14.360> on<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:14.690> port

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
sure you aren't lifting up on the port

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.100 
sure you aren't lifting up on the port
itself<00:01:15.140> otherwise<00:01:15.770> you<00:01:16.010> will<00:01:16.250> take<00:01:16.730> it<00:01:16.910> off

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
itself otherwise you will take it off

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.020 
itself otherwise you will take it off
which<00:01:18.110> is<00:01:18.350> not<00:01:18.740> good<00:01:18.980> at<00:01:19.400> all<00:01:21.520> the<00:01:22.520> battery<00:01:22.970> was

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
which is not good at all the battery was

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.800 
which is not good at all the battery was
extremely<00:01:23.750> easy<00:01:23.990> to<00:01:24.170> take<00:01:24.470> off<00:01:24.790> when<00:01:25.790> when<00:01:26.660> you

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
extremely easy to take off when when you

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.880 
extremely easy to take off when when you
flip<00:01:27.380> up<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:29.950> area<00:01:30.950> to<00:01:31.160> take<00:01:31.370> it<00:01:31.520> off<00:01:31.640> it<00:01:32.270> does

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
flip up the area to take it off it does

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.520 
flip up the area to take it off it does
stick<00:01:33.890> it<00:01:34.220> does<00:01:34.550> you<00:01:35.420> can<00:01:35.630> bend<00:01:35.900> it<00:01:36.080> in<00:01:36.230> the<00:01:36.380> way

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
stick it does you can bend it in the way

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.380 
stick it does you can bend it in the way
you<00:01:36.560> want<00:01:36.950> to<00:01:37.190> bend<00:01:37.400> it<00:01:37.550> will<00:01:37.700> not<00:01:37.850> move<00:01:38.060> back

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
you want to bend it will not move back

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.530 
you want to bend it will not move back
to<00:01:38.600> the<00:01:38.690> motherboard<00:01:38.990> which<00:01:39.320> is<00:01:39.470> very<00:01:39.680> nice

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
to the motherboard which is very nice

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.290 
to the motherboard which is very nice
then<00:01:41.540> the<00:01:41.720> solid<00:01:42.050> state<00:01:42.260> drive<00:01:42.790> the<00:01:43.790> SSD<00:01:44.420> is

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
then the solid state drive the SSD is

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.880 
then the solid state drive the SSD is
very<00:01:47.300> simple<00:01:47.630> take<00:01:47.990> out<00:01:48.200> there's<00:01:48.470> just<00:01:48.650> one

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
very simple take out there's just one

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.400 
very simple take out there's just one
thing<00:01:48.920> you<00:01:49.580> should<00:01:49.610> not<00:01:49.880> do<00:01:50.150> do<00:01:50.690> not<00:01:50.870> lift<00:01:51.170> up

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
thing you should not do do not lift up

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.300 
thing you should not do do not lift up
too<00:01:51.860> much<00:01:52.070> on<00:01:52.340> taking<00:01:52.730> it<00:01:52.820> out<00:01:52.970> maybe<00:01:53.300> I<00:01:54.310> don't

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
too much on taking it out maybe I don't

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.930 
too much on taking it out maybe I don't
know<00:01:55.550> one<00:01:56.560> one-sixth<00:01:57.560> of<00:01:57.680> an<00:01:57.800> inch<00:01:57.980> don't<00:01:58.700> lift

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
know one one-sixth of an inch don't lift

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.580 
know one one-sixth of an inch don't lift
it<00:01:59.060> up<00:01:59.180> too<00:01:59.390> much<00:01:59.420> just<00:01:59.960> enough<00:02:00.080> for<00:02:00.350> you<00:02:00.470> to

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
it up too much just enough for you to

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.360 
it up too much just enough for you to
grab<00:02:00.800> it<00:02:00.830> and<00:02:01.100> wiggle<00:02:01.850> it<00:02:01.970> out<00:02:03.550> now<00:02:04.870> if<00:02:05.870> you

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
grab it and wiggle it out now if you

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.859 
grab it and wiggle it out now if you
need<00:02:07.370> to<00:02:07.550> replace<00:02:07.820> the<00:02:08.090> i/o<00:02:08.239> board<00:02:08.659> or

screwdriver and this is another torque
I'm<00:02:39.060> for<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.540> forgot<00:02:40.019> what<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.500> what<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.280> size

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
I'm for I forgot what the what the size

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:48.289 
I'm for I forgot what the what the size

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
be very careful with cuz it's that port

00:02:52.650 --> 00:03:00.920 
be very careful with cuz it's that port
right<00:02:52.769> there<00:02:52.850> if<00:02:53.850> I<00:02:53.970> can<00:02:54.209> focus<00:02:54.989> in<00:02:55.290> on<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:59.930> that

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
right there if I can focus in on it that

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
latch in the back they have to lift up

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.509 
latch in the back they have to lift up
and<00:03:07.700> it's<00:03:08.700> very<00:03:08.970> small<00:03:09.540> it's<00:03:10.190> in<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.340> back

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
and it's very small it's in the back

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.120 
and it's very small it's in the back
it's<00:03:11.790> not<00:03:12.000> in<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.209> front<00:03:12.480> like<00:03:12.930> Windows<00:03:13.440> like

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
it's not in the front like Windows like

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.229 
it's not in the front like Windows like
a<00:03:14.160> windows<00:03:14.610> laptop<00:03:15.620> you<00:03:16.620> have<00:03:16.860> is<00:03:17.310> just<00:03:17.910> very

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
a windows laptop you have is just very

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.240 
a windows laptop you have is just very

that<00:03:20.400> poured<00:03:20.760> out<00:03:20.910> it<00:03:21.120> is<00:03:21.600> very<00:03:21.959> pretty<00:03:22.890> easy

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
that poured out it is very pretty easy

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.069 
that poured out it is very pretty easy
to<00:03:23.400> do<00:03:23.790> that<00:03:24.000> but<00:03:24.269> if<00:03:24.510> you<00:03:24.690> know<00:03:24.810> what<00:03:24.959> you're

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
to do that but if you know what you're

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.349 
to do that but if you know what you're
doing<00:03:25.459> you<00:03:26.459> can<00:03:26.489> get<00:03:27.030> through<00:03:27.239> it

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
doing you can get through it

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:37.600 
doing you can get through it
successfully

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.850 

now<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.700> back<00:03:39.659> of<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:39.900> board<00:03:40.110> is<00:03:40.290> pretty<00:03:40.590> bare

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
now the back of the board is pretty bare

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.119 
now the back of the board is pretty bare
as<00:03:41.159> you<00:03:42.150> can<00:03:42.269> see<00:03:42.510> just<00:03:42.959> a<00:03:43.200> few<00:03:43.379> ram<00:03:43.590> chips<00:03:43.950> and

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:44.129 
as you can see just a few ram chips and

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:46.759 
as you can see just a few ram chips and
some<00:03:44.250> other<00:03:45.230> Saturday<00:03:46.230> board<00:03:46.440> may<00:03:46.620> be<00:03:46.680> a

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
some other Saturday board may be a

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.660 
some other Saturday board may be a
memory<00:03:47.099> controller<00:03:47.489> on<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.760> back<00:03:47.909> i<00:03:47.940> believe

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
memory controller on the back i believe

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.149 
memory controller on the back i believe
once<00:03:50.670> i<00:03:50.790> get<00:03:50.970> my<00:03:51.000> new<00:03:51.299> motherboard<00:03:51.900> i<00:03:52.200> believe

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
once i get my new motherboard i believe

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.729 
once i get my new motherboard i believe
i<00:03:53.519> am<00:03:53.819> going<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.299> try<00:03:54.480> to<00:03:54.569> reflow<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.260> chips

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
i am going to try to reflow the chips

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.860 
i am going to try to reflow the chips
and<00:03:55.980> the<00:03:56.069> memory<00:03:56.849> controller<00:03:56.970> if<00:03:57.390> i<00:03:57.510> can<00:03:57.690> find

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
and the memory controller if i can find

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.069 
and the memory controller if i can find
it<00:03:58.190> i'm<00:03:59.190> sure<00:03:59.280> i<00:03:59.579> fix<00:03:59.909> it<00:04:00.090> has<00:04:00.329> has<00:04:00.840> it

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
it i'm sure i fix it has has it

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.899 
it i'm sure i fix it has has it
somewhere<00:04:01.440> and<00:04:03.440> it's<00:04:04.440> pretty<00:04:05.099> easy<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:05.549> put

00:04:05.899 --> 00:04:05.909 
somewhere and it's pretty easy to put

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:09.530 
somewhere and it's pretty easy to put
back<00:04:05.940> in<00:04:06.299> extremely<00:04:07.200> easy<00:04:08.180> so<00:04:09.180> i<00:04:09.209> wouldn't

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
back in extremely easy so i wouldn't

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.330 
back in extremely easy so i wouldn't
worry<00:04:09.690> if<00:04:09.930> you<00:04:10.319> need<00:04:10.500> to<00:04:10.650> take<00:04:10.859> something

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
worry if you need to take something

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.640 
worry if you need to take something
apart<00:04:11.489> and<00:04:11.910> replace<00:04:12.239> it<00:04:12.480> don't<00:04:13.319> worry<00:04:13.530> about

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
apart and replace it don't worry about

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.430 
apart and replace it don't worry about
it<00:04:13.980> it's<00:04:14.160> super<00:04:14.970> super<00:04:15.180> easy<00:04:15.540> in<00:04:16.549> that<00:04:17.549> case

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
it it's super super easy in that case

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.900 
it it's super super easy in that case
you<00:04:19.440> just<00:04:19.470> have<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.250> know<00:04:20.310> what<00:04:20.549> you're<00:04:20.669> doing

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
you just have to know what you're doing
