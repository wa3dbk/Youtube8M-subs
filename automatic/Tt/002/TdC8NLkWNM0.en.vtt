00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.599
 well I 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.599

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.599
 higher eyes 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.410
 I'm curious where the market is at 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.790
 story is determined by trees a few centuries ago the space is the referendum 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.350
 keeping the job market 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.260
 to the honesty of a friend 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.260
 to date, it still takes a couple of the man's place 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.150
 they already have all that order on board 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.460
 build there for promotion but the top 10 has become a little less 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.030
 over the entire weekend and the uncertainty take one hundred volunteers 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.970
 to ensure that everything runs smoothly, the fences must be placed now the 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.300
 lamps should be hung the 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.960
 be placed 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.650
 van valleys 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.230
 Another murder and traffic should of course be at the busiest times 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.810
 difficult to be guided for the job 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.479
 we are a free happy foundation in that regard reveal yes 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.020
 for example, more than enough volunteers 100 to be able to all 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.740
 realize 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.040
 especially 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.520
 excitedly killing three known pulps 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.980
 commitment 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.980
 Then you have to give something back 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.120
 i have in my life 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.120

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.330
 we will have to put effort into doing it 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.480
 the biggest pressure on bank rates 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.450
 worth the effort 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.450
 or I wouldn't 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.459

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.759
 you can call it 

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:46.519
 goal is to track it 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.270

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.589
