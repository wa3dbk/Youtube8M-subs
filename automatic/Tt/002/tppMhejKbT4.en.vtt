probability<00:00:51.500> you<00:00:52.500> should<00:00:53.160> worked<00:00:53.340> out

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
probability you should worked out

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.270 
probability you should worked out
something<00:00:53.879> like<00:00:54.000> 3.1<00:00:54.600> or<00:00:55.110> very<00:00:55.860> close<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
something like 3.1 or very close to the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.610 
something like 3.1 or very close to the
3.2<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.390> almost<00:00:57.539> fitting<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.170> half<00:00:58.379> way

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
3.2 so it's almost fitting in half way

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.139 
3.2 so it's almost fitting in half way
so<00:00:59.370> that's<00:00:59.969> where<00:01:00.379> we<00:01:01.379> got<00:01:01.559> our<00:01:01.590> 3.2<00:01:02.370> but<00:01:03.030> we're

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
so that's where we got our 3.2 but we're

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.780 
so that's where we got our 3.2 but we're
very<00:01:03.390> mindful<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.470> 3.2<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.280> higher<00:01:05.489> than

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
very mindful that 3.2 is higher than

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.460 
very mindful that 3.2 is higher than
what<00:01:06.000> we<00:01:06.030> have<00:01:06.210> ever<00:01:06.360> done<00:01:06.659> before

increase<00:01:18.509> last<00:01:18.869> year<00:01:19.049> so<00:01:20.040> far<00:01:20.280> based<00:01:20.460> on

increase last year so far based on
available<00:01:21.210> data<00:01:21.270> is<00:01:21.960> about<00:01:22.320> 4.1<00:01:22.950> percent<00:01:23.189> and

available data is about 4.1 percent and
it's<00:01:24.330> expected<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.930> cross<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.590> year<00:01:25.830> probably

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
it's expected to cross the year probably

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.440 
it's expected to cross the year probably
around<00:01:27.390> close<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.990> five<00:01:28.200> percent<00:01:28.490> so<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.909> the
