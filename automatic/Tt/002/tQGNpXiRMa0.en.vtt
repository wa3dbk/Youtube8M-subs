00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
size of ski I wanted and then they came

size of ski I wanted and then they came
back<00:03:46.769> at<00:03:47.190> me<00:03:47.370> with<00:03:47.400> what<00:03:48.060> actually<00:03:48.599> works

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
back at me with what actually works

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.379 
back at me with what actually works
because<00:03:49.500> I<00:03:49.739> didn't<00:03:50.400> know<00:03:50.430> how<00:03:50.700> to<00:03:50.760> build<00:03:51.030> a<00:03:51.150> ski

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
because I didn't know how to build a ski

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.199 
because I didn't know how to build a ski
so<00:03:51.750> it<00:03:52.200> took<00:03:52.440> us<00:03:52.650> a<00:03:52.769> few<00:03:52.799> tries<00:03:53.250> but<00:03:53.280> when<00:03:54.060> we

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
so it took us a few tries but when we

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.819 
so it took us a few tries but when we
finally<00:03:54.239> got<00:03:54.750> it<00:03:54.959> we<00:03:55.079> had<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.380> right<00:03:55.530> amount

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
finally got it we had the right amount

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.819 
finally got it we had the right amount
of<00:03:55.919> rocker<00:03:56.160> the<00:03:56.700> perfect<00:03:57.209> flex<00:03:57.829> everything

its key you is hand drawn back we spent
at<00:04:06.569> himself<00:04:06.780> I<00:04:07.290> was<00:04:07.739> involved<00:04:08.010> from<00:04:08.280> the

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
at himself I was involved from the

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.410 
at himself I was involved from the
beginning<00:04:08.610> to<00:04:09.120> the

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
beginning to the

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.900

end<00:04:09.569> of<00:04:09.750> my<00:04:09.930> ski<00:04:10.230> started<00:04:10.830> just<00:04:11.160> drawing<00:04:11.550> ideas

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
end of my ski started just drawing ideas

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.350 
end of my ski started just drawing ideas
and<00:04:12.540> we<00:04:13.260> kind<00:04:13.500> of<00:04:13.590> decided<00:04:14.250> on<00:04:14.550> a<00:04:14.580> shape<00:04:15.000> and

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
and we kind of decided on a shape and

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.930 
and we kind of decided on a shape and
the<00:04:16.320> way<00:04:16.709> it<00:04:16.859> was<00:04:16.980> going<00:04:17.160> to<00:04:17.250> look<00:04:17.489> and<00:04:17.760> then

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
the way it was going to look and then

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.509 
the way it was going to look and then
from<00:04:18.720> there<00:04:18.780> I<00:04:18.959> went<00:04:19.200> into<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.769> graphic<00:04:20.280> and

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
from there I went into the graphic and

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.180 
from there I went into the graphic and
just<00:04:20.730> basically<00:04:21.260> took<00:04:22.260> inspiration<00:04:22.590> from

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
just basically took inspiration from

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.970 
just basically took inspiration from
anywhere<00:04:23.850> I<00:04:23.910> could<00:04:24.060> I<00:04:24.540> used<00:04:24.930> Japan<00:04:25.350> as<00:04:25.620> a<00:04:25.650> main

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
anywhere I could I used Japan as a main

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.980 
anywhere I could I used Japan as a main
inspiration<00:04:26.700> just<00:04:26.730> because<00:04:27.330> I<00:04:27.450> love<00:04:27.660> skiing

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990
