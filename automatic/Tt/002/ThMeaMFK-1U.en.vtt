overall by the Titans me that's still a
shocker<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.670> me<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.790> thought<00:00:36.090> someone<00:00:36.360> was

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
would have fell a bit but the Titans

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.869 
would have fell a bit but the Titans
went<00:00:39.780> with<00:00:39.930> Mariota<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.370> Domino's

highlights<00:00:47.250> Fowler<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.730> thought<00:00:48.180> he<00:00:48.300> was<00:00:48.360> going

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
highlights Fowler I thought he was going

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.260 
highlights Fowler I thought he was going
to<00:00:48.539> be<00:00:48.660> decent<00:00:48.870> but<00:00:49.170> he<00:00:50.039> Phil<00:00:50.340> he<00:00:50.789> was<00:00:50.940> taken

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
to be decent but he Phil he was taken

and<00:00:51.390> then<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.960> Raiders<00:00:52.260> had<00:00:52.469> all<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.829> options

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
and then the Raiders had all the options

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.770 
and then the Raiders had all the options
they<00:00:53.370> want<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.670> thought<00:00:53.910> Williams<00:00:54.360> was<00:00:54.600> going

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
to be the top guy on the Raiders board I

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.240 
to be the top guy on the Raiders board I
was<00:00:56.760> wrong<00:00:56.940> thank<00:00:57.870> goodness<00:00:57.989> i'm<00:00:58.890> not<00:00:59.100> very

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
was wrong thank goodness i'm not very

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.860

high<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.550> Leonard<00:00:59.969> Williams<00:01:00.149> at<00:01:00.359> all<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.809> I

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
high on Leonard Williams at all and I

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.569 
high on Leonard Williams at all and I
was<00:01:01.020> just<00:01:01.140> happy<00:01:01.320> we<00:01:01.530> did<00:01:01.710> not<00:01:01.890> take<00:01:02.160> him<00:01:02.309> I

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
was just happy we did not take him I

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.009 
was just happy we did not take him I
think<00:01:02.820> he's<00:01:02.910> very<00:01:03.059> overrated<00:01:03.570> just<00:01:03.930> a

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
think he's very overrated just a

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.020 
think he's very overrated just a
physical<00:01:04.320> force<00:01:04.710> that's<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.159> I<00:01:05.309> don't<00:01:05.970> think

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
physical force that's it I don't think

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.609 
physical force that's it I don't think
he's<00:01:06.270> that<00:01:06.390> edge<00:01:06.630> rusher<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.350> Raiders

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
he's that edge rusher that the Raiders

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.170 
he's that edge rusher that the Raiders
would<00:01:07.770> want<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.100> thought<00:01:08.280> Fowler<00:01:08.610> was<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.030> only

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
would want I thought Fowler was the only

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.850 
would want I thought Fowler was the only
guy<00:01:09.420> worth<00:01:09.659> taking<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.320> terms<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.650> pass

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
guy worth taking in terms of pass

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.460 
guy worth taking in terms of pass
rushers<00:01:11.280> in<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.490> first<00:01:11.670> round<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.409> where<00:01:13.409> does

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
rushers in the first round so where does

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.039 
rushers in the first round so where does
that<00:01:13.619> go<00:01:13.830> here<00:01:14.010> Omari<00:01:14.729> Cooper<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.390> felt<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:15.960> I

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
that go here Omari Cooper I felt you I

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.600 
that go here Omari Cooper I felt you I
have<00:01:16.350> them<00:01:16.470> as<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.710> second<00:01:17.040> best<00:01:17.189> receiver

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
have them as the second best receiver

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.460 
have them as the second best receiver
behind<00:01:18.000> Kevin<00:01:18.330> white<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.540> think<00:01:18.689> White's<00:01:19.080> range

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
behind Kevin white I think White's range

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.010 
behind Kevin white I think White's range
is<00:01:19.830> better<00:01:20.070> he's<00:01:20.759> not<00:01:20.970> just<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.299> combine<00:01:21.750> freak

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
is better he's not just a combine freak

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.679 
is better he's not just a combine freak
white<00:01:22.290> white<00:01:22.770> has<00:01:22.950> shown<00:01:23.220> his<00:01:23.430> range<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:24.000> more

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
white white has shown his range is more

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.710 
white white has shown his range is more

bit<00:01:39.720> faster<00:01:40.170> white<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.770> just<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.490> range<00:01:41.729> I

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
bit faster white is just the range I

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.819 
bit faster white is just the range I
think<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.689> range<00:01:42.899> works<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.439> red<00:01:43.619> zone<00:01:43.649> a

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
think that range works in the red zone a

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.819 
think that range works in the red zone a
little<00:01:43.890> more<00:01:44.250> than<00:01:44.430> Cooper<00:01:44.759> will<00:01:44.909> but

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
little more than Cooper will but

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.200 
little more than Cooper will but
Cooper's<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:46.950> guy<00:01:47.070> who's<00:01:47.460> more<00:01:47.700> ready<00:01:47.970> now

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
Cooper's the guy who's more ready now

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.410 
Cooper's the guy who's more ready now
White<00:01:48.899> has<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.290> better<00:01:49.409> sealing<00:01:49.799> so<00:01:50.420> we'll

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
White has the better sealing so we'll

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.179 
White has the better sealing so we'll
see<00:01:51.600> doubt<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.810> few<00:01:52.200> years<00:01:52.409> down<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.770> line<00:01:52.799> what

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
see doubt a few years down the line what

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.889 
see doubt a few years down the line what
will<00:01:53.310> happen<00:01:53.610> with<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.299> receivers<00:01:54.750> but

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
will happen with the the receivers but

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.889 
will happen with the the receivers but
Cooper<00:01:55.460> they<00:01:56.460> bring<00:01:56.670> something<00:01:57.390> for<00:01:57.570> Derek

this<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.040> supposedly<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.579> deep<00:02:02.790> draft<00:02:03.119> class

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
this is supposedly a deep draft class

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.690 
this is supposedly a deep draft class
but<00:02:03.719> they<00:02:04.560> needed<00:02:04.740> an<00:02:05.009> end<00:02:05.219> up<00:02:05.369> with<00:02:05.490> true

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
there will Cooper's got a good work

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.720 
there will Cooper's got a good work
like<00:02:13.349> he<00:02:13.530> doesn't<00:02:13.860> seem<00:02:14.040> like<00:02:14.220> just<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.459> product

sounds very polished very all around and

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.890 
sounds very polished very all around and
saw<00:02:31.319> a<00:02:31.349> playmaker<00:02:31.860> I<00:02:31.980> think<00:02:32.450> he<00:02:33.450> addresses<00:02:33.870> a

saw a playmaker I think he addresses a
need<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.170> mean<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.560> Raiders<00:02:34.830> had<00:02:34.980> multiple

offers were but they has to be one you
can't<00:02:39.720> refuse<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.380> probably<00:02:41.250> that<00:02:41.430> wasn't

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
can't refuse and probably that wasn't

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.910 
can't refuse and probably that wasn't
the<00:02:41.760> case<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.360> Raiders<00:02:42.660> select<00:02:43.379> the<00:02:43.470> Cooper

the case the Raiders select the Cooper
they<00:02:44.430> were<00:02:44.549> on<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.819> clock<00:02:44.970> probably<00:02:45.569> for<00:02:45.810> a

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
they were on the clock probably for a

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.390 
they were on the clock probably for a
minute<00:02:46.200> they<00:02:46.349> select<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.830> Cooper<00:02:47.160> really

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
minute they select the Cooper really

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.880 
minute they select the Cooper really
quick<00:02:47.670> which<00:02:47.940> indicates<00:02:48.470> he<00:02:49.470> had<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.799> have

the top guy that had to have been Cooper

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.150 
the top guy that had to have been Cooper
