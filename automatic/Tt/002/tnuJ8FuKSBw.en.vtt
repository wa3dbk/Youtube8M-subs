00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
don't understand it like I don't

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.740 
don't understand it like I don't
understand<00:01:25.680> why<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.760> it<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.390> what<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.720> is

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.050 
understand why it is it is what it is
and<00:01:27.869> why<00:01:28.260> there<00:01:28.500> is<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:28.860> much<00:01:29.010> I<00:01:29.280> mean<00:01:29.610> if<00:01:29.880> I

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
and why there is so much I mean if I

say<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.430> was<00:01:32.520> probably<00:01:32.640> because<00:01:33.030> there's<00:01:33.360> such

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
say it was probably because there's such

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.300 
say it was probably because there's such
a<00:01:33.540> high<00:01:33.750> tourist<00:01:34.140> right<00:01:34.380> through<00:01:34.560> here<00:01:34.830> like
