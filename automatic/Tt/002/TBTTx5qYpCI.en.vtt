00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
probably made the flight go pretty

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.090 
probably made the flight go pretty
quickly<00:00:58.199> for<00:00:58.500> them<00:00:58.620> because<00:00:58.739> they<00:00:58.890> were<00:00:58.980> all

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
quickly for them because they were all

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.610 
quickly for them because they were all
glued<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.820> windows<00:01:00.210> waiting<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.170> see<00:01:01.379> what
