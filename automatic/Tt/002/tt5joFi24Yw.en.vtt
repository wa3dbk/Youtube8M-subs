00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.890
 hello today on assassin's review 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.410
 creed 2 

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:13.469
 blake de tire is a collector's edition 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:16.470
 It turned out in 2010 in March itself 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.640
 game assassin's creed 2 was released in 2009 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.340
 year first on consoles and then in March 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:26.010
 the game is out for personal computers 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.619
 on windows means with us 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.740
 edition just for personal 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.740
 computers 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:42.769
 so it looks from all sides and 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:45.489
 publications there are differences there is still 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:50.739
 collector's edition white edishen there 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:54.219
 does not enter the building itself bonus disc 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:59.989
 there is still such a panoramic 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:02.269
 pictures and some other differences 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.570
 this edition box is made on 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:13.850
 magnets 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:19.119
 such a magnet does not snap well 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.119
 holding such a panoramic view 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:36.370
 to see better show him 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:38.500
 a slightly different angle twist my hands 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:42.340
 long box because about the thing 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.580
 the building is nothing special to say 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:51.580
 and show here, too, just simply 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:02:04.210
 artbook disk with the game and so I got 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:02:06.750
 artbook disk and bonus disk 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.750
 will show at the end 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:17.800
 recorded music on bonus discs 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:25.239
 developer diaries video journal 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:28.930
 such and wallpaper from assassin's creed music 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:31.810
 by the way quite pleasant unlike 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:37.319
 some other games in the same 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:40.810
 unity music is not so nice 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:44.519
 Does the same audition than in the second 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:48.810
 assassin's creed and for five years now 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.810
 now I leaf through the art book 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:27.880
 There are pages with very beautiful views. 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:32.220
 There are those who are just like that 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:38.349
 done with some text with an explanation 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:45.390
 pages and glossy and matte but also 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:45.390
 very high quality it is made accelerate 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.920
 here we see blades 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.549
 A good decision to enter into the game Leonardo 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:02.080
 yes Vinci which makes different 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:04.920
 modifications assassin sorry that like 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.709
 already in the subsequent parts 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:11.140
 but I didn't play the third 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:14.290
 or rather I didn’t really like her and I 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:17.530
 absolution, too, but a black flag and 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.680
 unity could be somehow more interesting 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:23.229
 do at least 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.870
 many moments in assassin's creed 2 me 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.669
 liked more than unity of course i 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:33.310
 don't take into account 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:37.030
 graphics but the gameplay itself is made 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:39.630
 Great not very interesting to see 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.630
 stick figure 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:51.270
 the stand is made of plastic 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.940
 apparently not very plastic 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.780
 quality is used in the stand 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:00.449
 the figure itself is made of good 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:06.180
 plastic but in new type editions 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:09.410
 uniquely black flag on betfair there 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:14.070
 plastic it seems to me that 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:18.800
 slightly higher quality it for 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:21.750
 five-year edition very worthy 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:26.910
 let's see now what he has there under 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:32.070
 hood here with his eyes 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:34.520
 somehow not very good but to him there and 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:39.539
 look basically no one but 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:42.410
 It certainly looks like it’s as if 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:48.660
 he needs help 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:52.050
 medical staff well that's all 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:54.409
 the collection review has come to an end 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:58.099
 editions 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:06:00.259
 he's pretty small apparently it was 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:04.339
 one of the first collection editions 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:06.289
 which began to be made in such 

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:08.209
 mass quantity as it is now in many 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:13.639
 games there is a collector's edition but 

00:06:08.209 --> 00:06:17.659
 no less and the building is pretty good I would 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:21.919
 even said good and the game itself too 

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:24.199
 very good write in the comments 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:27.349

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:28.129
