 and well the words were clearly very 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.940
 clear if we win we can play other 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.560
 thing that maintaining 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.240

 ball on adverse introduction julien

 story alert stone bernard a balloon 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.740
 on the winged for blair connor who is going 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.240
 withstand three defenders before 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.430
 maybe to sneak in to go 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.080
 mark the test difficult to say but in 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.060
 anyway studded sir will he do 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.830
 call to the video we've been playing for four 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.720
 minutes only and here blair connor 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.900
 who resisted confesses jolts and 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.219
 aurillac and maybe to go flatten 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.620
 difficult really hard to get 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.149
 an opinion then then we will settle 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.020
 simply rely on blair 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.000
 connor who gives us an indication 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.719
 for him well he misses some 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.160
 centimeters 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.379
 but look at sir finally cost 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.040
 decides to validate this essay after 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.350
 transformation 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.450
 bordeaux and raphael ibanez puts 7 to 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.309
 0 we've been playing for four minutes in 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.809
 this meeting is not later 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.640
 find them again before the party and 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.260
 pierre bernard here says himself what he 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.670
 transversal total alert and lula who 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.649
 only has to recover the ball and 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.809
 offered himself a magnificent dive in 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.550
 in the end melisande andré moga the rain 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.619
 who surrendered the playing conditions 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.630
 very difficult but burgundy realize 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.220
 a perfect match dominators 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.500
 in conquest and full of realism at 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.270
 moment of scoring so it leads 14 to 0 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.040
 after a quarter of an hour and well 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.570
 Frenchmen in the trap are obliged 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.189
 to react and as often these are thanks 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.780
 at their forwards with here nemetschek 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.640
 powered by all its partners 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.130
 behind the goal line 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.509
 a pride reaction of the promoted who goes 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.140
 maybe just wake up this 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.490
 Ooyonnax team 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.020
 always looking for a first 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.549
 victory this season outside 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.680
 the test is transformed 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.420
 Bordeaux only leads 14 to 7 but if 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.920
 you have the balls to create a breach in 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.509
 the defense he's stopped on the line 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.460
 40 meters but Julien Dray seizes 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.020
 of the balloon and defenseless in front of him 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.270
 get a straight line to finish 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.430
 his race between the poles there also the 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.810
 Realism Bordeaux will have done wonders 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.430
 at the beginning of the meeting a few 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.770
 missed tackles also on the side 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.649
 which makes the task of 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.119
 julien rey three tries to 1 the break is 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.770
 so made for this Bordeaux team 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.210
 criticized lately for his 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.710
 lack of fighting spirit but who 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.420
 today really delivered the 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.430
 clocks on time 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.479
 matthew clarkin enjoyed the show there 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.900
 would like to go into second 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.640
 period 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.710
 a second act well started by this 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.679
 team of oyonnax barnard 2 on penalty 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.720
 brings back the promoted to 21 10 only problem this 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.220
 evening in the ranks of the promoted Monday if 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.930
 clean which was very expensive 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.180
 Ozonaxians for this high plating on 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.780
 mares fold the kerr bucks a carton 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.030
 yellow 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.890
 in numerical superiority then burgundy 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.420
 gets loose as usual and produces 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.980
 a lot of rugby matthew clarkin 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.870
 this one that just came into play there 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.360
 alert charles saubusse who has no other 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.220
 solution than to extend to the foot in 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.019
 Fabien defensive withdrawal cibray misses the 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.459
 balloon just as his partners did you 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.080
 the balls also only player to 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.880
 have all understood blair connor that freezes 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.290
 it takes up this balloon and flatten 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.209
 behind the line 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.220
 there too we will call on the video 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.350
 for this fourth try no offside 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.299
 at the start of the action step forward at 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.730
 time to flatten the test so can be 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.319
 validated and connor afford a doubled that 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.600
 allows bordeaux at the game time of 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.280
 lead 28 to 10 the win is 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.209
 it seems acquired but raphaël ibanez 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.160
 ask his players to pick up 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.830
 the offensive bonus it takes for that 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.750
 still scored once and 15 against 14 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.489
 thanks to this good work from the fronts and 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.709
 well a benefit in progress and reported 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.630
 kerbernard then will try a diagonal 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.820
 completely missed will come back so 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.340
 where the penalty jumps it 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.780
 fault was so done look good number 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.280
 6 louis benoît madaule who plays 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.959
 quickly he clear the stones for 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.239
 flatten in the goal and so score 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.310
 the 5th and that of his Bordeaux team 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.630
 bay to win it finally have 35,10 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.330
 and moves away from the red zone 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.650
 3 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.970
 11th success this season with climbs 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.770
 for the first time of a pass 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.240
 of offensive aubisque enough to delight the 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.240
 captain bordelais matthew clarkin
