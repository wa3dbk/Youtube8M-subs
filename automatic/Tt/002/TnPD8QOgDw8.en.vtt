the<00:01:40.270> back<00:01:40.450> here<00:01:40.750> you've<00:01:40.959> got<00:01:41.200> 6<00:01:41.800> effects<00:01:42.280> loops

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
the back here you've got 6 effects loops

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.790 
the back here you've got 6 effects loops
there's<00:01:43.060> an<00:01:43.270> individual<00:01:43.810> programmable<00:01:44.590> loop

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
there's an individual programmable loop

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.249 
there's an individual programmable loop
for<00:01:45.099> each<00:01:45.130> channel<00:01:45.700> also<00:01:46.569> there's<00:01:46.750> a<00:01:46.810> master

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
for each channel also there's a master

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.260 
for each channel also there's a master
parallel<00:01:47.739> loop<00:01:47.950> with<00:01:48.190> a<00:01:48.220> mixed<00:01:48.580> level<00:01:48.879> control

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
and a master series loop that's

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:54.210 
and a master series loop that's
programmable<00:01:52.470> also<00:01:53.470> it's<00:01:53.709> MIDI<00:01:54.009> compatible

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
programmable also it's MIDI compatible

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.660 
programmable also it's MIDI compatible
and<00:01:54.759> can<00:01:54.789> be<00:01:55.450> MIDI<00:01:55.690> controlled

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
and can be MIDI controlled

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.580 
and can be MIDI controlled
