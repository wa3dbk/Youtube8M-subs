00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.910 
in my previous videos and I actually
just<00:02:00.570> got<00:02:00.719> done<00:02:00.930> watching<00:02:01.140> my<00:02:01.409> her<00:02:01.590> and<00:02:01.770> then

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
just got done watching my her and then

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.670 
just got done watching my her and then
I'll<00:02:02.100> be<00:02:02.189> twisted<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:03.110> Mira's<00:02:04.110> not<00:02:04.290> really<00:02:04.560> at

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
I'll be twisted so Mira's not really at

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.100 
I'll be twisted so Mira's not really at
his<00:02:04.799> full<00:02:05.180> potential<00:02:06.180> left<00:02:06.600> because<00:02:06.990> it's

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
his full potential left because it's

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.410 
his full potential left because it's
still<00:02:07.320> kind<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.649> down

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
still kind of down

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.320 
still kind of down
so<00:02:09.009> it's<00:02:10.009> probably<00:02:10.369> a<00:02:10.460> lot<00:02:10.640> longer<00:02:10.850> than<00:02:11.060> this

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
so it's probably a lot longer than this

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.380 
so it's probably a lot longer than this
good<00:02:12.260> eyes<00:02:12.410> you<00:02:12.709> can<00:02:12.890> see<00:02:12.920> my<00:02:13.520> thin<00:02:13.790> spots<00:02:15.160> they

good eyes you can see my thin spots they
you<00:02:17.390> know<00:02:17.510> of<00:02:17.600> course<00:02:17.840> it's<00:02:18.080> not<00:02:18.200> gonna<00:02:18.470> match

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
you know of course it's not gonna match

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.470 
you know of course it's not gonna match
you<00:02:19.430> know<00:02:19.550> it's<00:02:19.700> not<00:02:19.790> going<00:02:19.970> to<00:02:20.060> get<00:02:20.180> as<00:02:20.270> long

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 
was using it for like two to three

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.350 
was using it for like two to three
months<00:02:33.380> straight<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:33.709> it's<00:02:34.580> gotten<00:02:35.030> me<00:02:35.150> good

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
months straight and it's gotten me good

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.570 
months straight and it's gotten me good
growth<00:02:35.630> and<00:02:35.900> actually<00:02:36.560> right<00:02:36.980> now<00:02:37.190> I<00:02:37.370> never

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
growth and actually right now I never

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.400
