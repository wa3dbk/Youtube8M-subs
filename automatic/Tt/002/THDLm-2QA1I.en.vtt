00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:07.260
 Servus people welcome to a new one 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.179
 the result of the fitness tv is my name 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.429
 Raphael and in this issue I show 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.110
 you workout one upper arm a say 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.049
 Training plan for the training at home 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.250
 biceps and triceps muscle everything 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.260
 we really only need it 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.720
 two dumbbells the exercises are like that 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.670
 built up that we make three sets with 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.530
 eight to twelve repetitions each 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.220
 sentence 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.660
 which has its weight should 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.370
 accordingly be chosen so that we 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.590
 really only a maximum of twelve 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.420
 create repetition if there are a few 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.129
 repeat less are say 10 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.320
 or eight repetitions set that no 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.239
 problem of repeat area eight 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.850
 until twelve is actually ideal for the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.820
 muscle building why are we training that 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.859
 Triceps muscle simply does this 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.510
 two-thirds of the upper arm and the 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:50.730
 he would like to have thick upper arms 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.890
 In addition to the biceps and definitely the 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.510
 train triceps who actually now 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.960
 not to say let's start with that 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.510
 workout 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.920
 the first exercise in our biceps and 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.199
 Triceps workout are the hammer curls 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.089
 We sit down at the end of a shallow bank 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.620
 or chair grab us two dumbbells 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:06.360
 in the hammer so that the 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.189
 can view hand indoor surfaces the 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.290
 Hang on arms and start with that 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.670
 stretch and bend the arms it is 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.890
 to pay attention that the back straight 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.540
 is and the upper arms as close as possible 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.189
 Body stay with this exercise 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.799
 we complete three sets with each 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.180
 eight to twelve repetitions as 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.340
 Next for the biceps we perform the 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.110
 Concentration currys from we sit down 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.759
 legs apart on a flat bench chair 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.320
 or the bed edge grab with the 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.479
 right hand after a short dumbbell 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.280
 however, let the attach press 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.320
 elbow in the right thigh to 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.060
 to stretch the arms now and stretch 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.200
 Let's lean this poor slowly 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.600
 we shoot eight to twelve times 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.009
 then switch to the left arm where 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.359
 We then exactly the same thing only 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.250
 perform mirrored 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:46.429
 it will be changing every evening 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.840
 three sets completed a total of 6 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:51.090
 Now the reverse dumbbells follow 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.380
 shorten we sit upright on one 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.909
 training bench or chair 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.799
 The feet are close together 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.119
 We are grabbed by two dumbbells 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.799
 in the upper hand speak the 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.200
 palms show away from the body 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.329
 Build body tension on your arms 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.799
 fixed close to the upper body and begin 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.289
 with the stretch and bend of the arms 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.000
 without moving the upper arms the dumbbells 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:10.709
 as close as we can to the 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.930
 Shoulder the back should be there 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.460
 just here are three sentences 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.230
 eight to twelve repetitions 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.750
 Advantage of this exercise as well as exercise 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.550
 our forearms as a last biceps exercise 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.960
 the quint ivans follow the trend the 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.910
 actually bugs a normal one 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.040
 Dumbbell girl, however, in three 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.870
 is divided into stages and from 21 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.250
 repetitions per sentence exists in each 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.470
 Stage will be seven repetitions 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.150
 We sit down with legs apart 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.230
 Attack a trade with both hands 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.970
 at the ends 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.800
 for example, the rod or the 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.330
 weight slices at the first level 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.620
 we let the hands together with the exercise 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.420
 hang and lead the trade 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.220
 Movement seven times to the 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.740
 point at which the forearms 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.940
 Level are at the second level 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.920
 let's run the dumbbell from the 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.020
 end position of the first level seven times 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.120
 up to the maximum flexion of the arms 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.990
 in the third stage of the exercise lead 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.880
 we seven times the complete 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.590
 movement sequence from speak of 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.170
 stretched arm to the maximum 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.050
 bent position together result in that 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.060
 21 repetition which is again use 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.980
 a total of three sentences are executed 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.570
 Depending on the performance level, the trend 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.130
 Ivan also with two dumbbells or 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.200
 a barbell be executed 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.160
 the first exercise for the triceps muscle 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.200
 are the french press 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.760
 In the second, we lay down the 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.920
 luck left on a training bench or 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.480
 the floor arms with dumbbells 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.490
 we stretch our breasts upwards 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.290
 so that the palms look 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.030
 We bow our arms and lead the 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.920
 Dumbbell next to our head afterwards 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.030
 Let us stretch our arms back into hers 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.560
 starting position 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.420
 it is important to note that the 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.820
 position of the upper arms during the 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.950
 Exercise is not too changed and you 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.570
 the poor do not overstretch here too 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.280
 eight to twelve repetitions at three 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.600
 sets 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.310
 the second exercise for the war itself 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.320
 is the tight bench press with dumbbells 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.970
 We lie back on one again 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.560
 flat bench or the floor the 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.450
 We take dumbbells in our hands 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.010
 that the palms look at 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.810
 We also eat the dumbbells 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.970
 against each other for more stability 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.010
 Now we press this together 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.870
 up and down over the chest 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.010
 The poor should follow suit 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.420
 upper body are located 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.010
 The exercise may vary depending on the performance level 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.140
 also be carried out with one hand 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.430
 by packing these on the sides as well 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.600
 here will be eight to twelve again 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.240
 repetitions in three sentences 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.280
 performed last exercise for the triceps 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.840
 Muscle are the tips we sit on 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.150
 the long side of a flat bench or 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.620
 but on our bedside put the feet 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.450
 on a chair or stool with the 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.460
 equal height from the legs are there 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.389
 stretched out we support each other with both hands 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.919
 the edge off 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.960
 and now raise the buffers of the bank 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.659
 follow the arms up between upper and 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.729
 forearm and upper body 1 90 each 

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:34.169
 Grad angle creates position short 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:36.840
 hold and then push up again 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.999
 We will do this 16 to 20 times at three 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.710
 Yes, that was already true 

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:42.900
 our training plan for the bizet and 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.550
 tips training at home now again 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.740
 a few info at the end of the video 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.360
 if you want to build muscles then 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.580
 will definitely handle weight like that 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.169
 that you have a maximum of eight to twelve years 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.580
 he wanted to create repetition 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.990
 should train the endurance 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.469
 repetition numbers a bit high 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.340
 For example, 26 to 30 are used 

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:00.900
 repeats 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.120
 accordingly, of course, that too 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.099
 otherwise lower will be 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.389
 warm up well before training 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:07.979
 really the a and o so you can 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:10.080
 Prevent injuries super 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:12.539
 otherwise you can use this training plan 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.159
 go through six to eight weeks as well 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:17.250
 he has just been introduced 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:19.469
 then you can do a 23 exercises against 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.839
 others exchange their muscles for years 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:24.150
 not to get used to the training 

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:25.289
 Say, put new stimuli if they 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.699
 still have questions about this 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.710
 training plan you can you can you
