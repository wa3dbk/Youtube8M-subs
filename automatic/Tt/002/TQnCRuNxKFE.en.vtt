00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
to enjoy a retirement but I don't think

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.260 
to enjoy a retirement but I don't think
that'll<00:00:40.440> be<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.620> case<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.910> reason

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
that'll be the case and the reason

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.779 
that'll be the case and the reason
they're<00:00:42.420> very<00:00:42.600> popular<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:43.350> Russia<00:00:43.710> these<00:00:44.070> old

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
they're very popular in Russia these old

they're very popular in Russia these old
geared<00:00:45.629> engined<00:00:47.480> aircraft<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.660> they

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
geared engined aircraft is that they

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.799 
geared engined aircraft is that they
don't<00:00:49.110> really<00:00:49.289> have<00:00:49.379> Afghan<00:00:49.920> as<00:00:50.160> much<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:51.210> they

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
don't really have Afghan as much so they

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.260 
don't really have Afghan as much so they
are<00:00:52.140> very<00:00:52.289> keen<00:00:52.620> on<00:00:52.879> aircraft<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.149> are

a little bit of a steep learning curve

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.899 
a little bit of a steep learning curve
isn't<00:01:11.880> beginning<00:01:12.270> but<00:01:13.110> I<00:01:13.170> have<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.590> say<00:01:13.909> this

60 years old as I mentioned
and<00:02:14.519> as<00:02:15.290> my<00:02:16.290> flying<00:02:17.269> progress<00:02:19.010> progresses<00:02:20.010> I

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
and as my flying progress progresses I

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.750 
and as my flying progress progresses I
should<00:02:20.939> say<00:02:21.170> I<00:02:22.549> needed<00:02:23.549> something

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
should say I needed something

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.390 
should say I needed something
all-weather<00:02:24.480> capability<00:02:25.079> I<00:02:25.590> needed

you know for the fuel burn she wasn't

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.949 
you know for the fuel burn she wasn't
the<00:03:38.430> fastest<00:03:38.849> just<00:03:39.030> because<00:03:39.329> the<00:03:39.419> cabin<00:03:39.780> is<00:03:39.930> so

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
the fastest just because the cabin is so

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.990 
the fastest just because the cabin is so
big<00:03:40.379> and<00:03:40.409> it's<00:03:40.650> a<00:03:40.889> it's<00:03:41.129> just<00:03:41.220> a<00:03:41.400> big<00:03:41.669> plane

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000

that wing is very big and you know it's

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.610 
that wing is very big and you know it's
a<00:03:46.530> lot<00:03:46.709> of<00:03:46.829> drag<00:03:47.359> so<00:03:48.359> fortunately<00:03:48.810> it's<00:03:49.049> time

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
a lot of drag so fortunately it's time

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:50.270 
a lot of drag so fortunately it's time
to<00:03:49.919> let<00:03:50.069> go
