00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.519
 hello welcome to a video 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.929
 my name is niklas and i'll show you 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.460
 Today, the devil motivates two mk2 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.430
 almost the new edition of the already 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.070
 well known motive 2 and i want now 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.689
 here once briefly on the two 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.519
 satellites to get 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.590
 Here we see now with ever 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.380
 the aluminum handy otherwise 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.950
 consist of a wood fiber that 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:39.210
 housing then the subwoofer with his 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.360
 250 mm woofer 22 liters net volume 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.489
 he has and weighed a full 13 4 kilograms 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.219
 and is with a class level 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.289
 equipped in front we have also directly 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.329
 the whole operating possibilities of the 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.180
 subwoofers, for example, the volume 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.649
 then still be regulated which source 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.600
 to be guided or you can 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.070
 he also stops and turn over 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.270
 This is the alternative to this control panel 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.830
 we still have the possibility the whole 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.850
 controlled by remote control 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.390
 we should not paint directly to 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.740
 subwoofers or sitting far away 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.020
 at connections have behind at 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.119
 subwoofer once the power connection and 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.720
 On-off switch 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:25.020
 then we can have two analog signals 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.590
 feed and then digitally over co 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.840
 share and an optical input then 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.189
 we have the power button again 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.170
 so that the calls are automatically available 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.490
 as soon as there is a signal on the phase 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.439
 Can we hire and if he wants to 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.390
 Wall stands or stands free in the room 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.990
 and here below we see the 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.329
 connections for the speakers here 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.530
 to see the craft flex opening there 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.060
 the whole 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:54.360
 bastl flex system is the two ways 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.299
 Satellites have 125mm tweeters and 1 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.280
 84 mm deep midrange rear we have 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.080
 another bracket seen from the wall 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.810
 and the connection cable and here again 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:08.250
 The aluminum waves in a closeup 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.140
 In any case, you have us ever 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.060
 very convinced that the system belongs to the sample 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.319
 we have not even got there yet 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.239
 but in a tester even further about it 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.620
 report and a matching link in 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.180
 post the video description 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.160
 that's it from me I'm natural 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.720
 your attention and say goodbye 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.720
 I'll be fine until the next video
