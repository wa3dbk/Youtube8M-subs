&gt;&gt; Stanford University.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.020
&gt;&gt; When I was in the military on active
duty, I realized that some of

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.660
the problems that we were addressing were,
were very complex and they,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.690
they really demanded the expertise of a
wide range of experts.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:23.030
The nature of many of the conflicts that
we face are very localized.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.610
So the empirical studies of conflict
project,

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.420
it aims to basically democratize access to
good quality microdata.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.450
Make, make it a public good.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.770
Make it available to a much wider group.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.750
To date we've, we've got some great data
coming out of Iraq.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.000
We declassified the significant activities
database a good, good portion of that.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.250
We've got good quality data from
Afghanistan, Colombia, Mexico, Pakistan.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.090
One of our best data sources is,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.070
is the comprehensive data set on conflict
in the Philippines, going back to 1975.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.120
For example, where an incident heard,
geolocated sometimes down to a,

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.590
you know, an eight-digit grid which is
like, a 10 meter area.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.110
What occurred, was it,

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.830
you know, was it raid, was it an ambush,
was it a, an apprehension, a surrender.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.640
The outcome is, said if whether there was
casualties or

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.950
whether something was confiscated.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.470
And then, then information on the details
of,

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.430
of who participated that the type of
government unit,

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.440
the type of rebel unit, just take it down
to like, the district level.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.550
You'll see some areas have no violence
which is most areas actually and

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.130
some areas have huge spikes of violence.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.760
Insurgency and civil wars and,

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.170
and these types of conflicts are very
local in nature.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.560
If you agg, if you try to understand them
by aggregating data to far up from

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.570
the level that it's truly the violence
and, and the actions are occurring.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.460
You're just not gonna get the type of
information you need to really

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.980
understand what's happening.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.780
What we learn in the Philippines is
relevant to many other

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.660
cases around the world that are facing
similar challenges.

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.630
How can we be smarter, how can we better
understand the nature of conflict,

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.880
how can we prevent conflict?

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.420
Basically, how can we effectively and
efficiently reduce the human costs of

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.500
these terrible and tragic conflicts around
the world.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.316
By being smart about [UNKNOWN], by better
understanding the nature of

00:02:02.316 --> 00:02:04.560
those conflicts, by understanding the root
causes.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.260
We figure we can take an evidence based
methodology rigorous approach to

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.462
understanding conflict.

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:10.630
We're gonna get closer to,

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.330
to the understanding we need to make a
difference.
