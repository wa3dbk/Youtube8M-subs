00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.700

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.680
 expulsion from life 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.689
 very good and if you have this a bit of 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.119
 fear of environmental envy because 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.250
 you saw is how the truth asks you 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.799

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.470
 came out this news is how long they will last 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.439
 to which I answer to achieve much 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.420
 because if Matías decides to take this step 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.920
 for that boyfriend is because it's something 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.140
 important with time is a bit this 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.520
