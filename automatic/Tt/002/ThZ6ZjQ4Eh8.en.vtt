this<00:05:33.090> this<00:05:33.630> is<00:05:33.690> very<00:05:34.050> fragile<00:05:34.350> I<00:05:34.680> don't

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
this this is very fragile I don't

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.940 
this this is very fragile I don't
necessarily<00:05:36.060> is<00:05:36.570> that<00:05:36.750> the<00:05:36.870> best<00:05:36.900> joint<00:05:37.590> ever

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
necessarily is that the best joint ever

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:43.850 
necessarily is that the best joint ever
but<00:05:38.850> uh<00:05:40.220> it<00:05:41.220> works<00:05:41.870> then<00:05:42.870> you<00:05:42.990> just<00:05:43.200> gotta<00:05:43.380> just

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
but uh it works then you just gotta just

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:50.020 
but uh it works then you just gotta just
the<00:05:44.010> legs<00:05:44.280> so<00:05:44.729> they<00:05:46.460> sit<00:05:47.460> like<00:05:47.700> a<00:05:48.200> cheetah
