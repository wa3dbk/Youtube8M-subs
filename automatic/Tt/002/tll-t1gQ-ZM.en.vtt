00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
which sets it apart from the other two

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.430 
which sets it apart from the other two
phones<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.149> very<00:00:54.180> well<00:00:54.690> visible<00:00:55.079> in

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
phones and it is very well visible in

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.590 
phones and it is very well visible in
the<00:00:55.680> picture<00:00:56.039> quality<00:00:56.360> something<00:00:57.360> very

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
the picture quality something very

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.689 
the picture quality something very
unique<00:00:57.660> about<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.469> e7<00:00:58.890> mini<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.309> the

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
unique about the e7 mini is the

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.790 
unique about the e7 mini is the
swiveling<00:01:00.090> camera<00:01:00.629> which<00:01:00.960> can<00:01:00.989> be<00:01:01.469> adjusted

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
swiveling camera which can be adjusted

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.090 
swiveling camera which can be adjusted
to<00:01:02.280> any<00:01:02.609> angle<00:01:03.180> in<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.780> range<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.260> 180<00:01:04.680> degrees

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
to any angle in the range of 180 degrees

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.429 
to any angle in the range of 180 degrees
so<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.489> can<00:01:05.790> actually<00:01:06.299> set<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.780> as<00:01:06.960> front

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
so you can actually set it as front

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.679 
so you can actually set it as front
camera<00:01:07.830> or<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.130> rear<00:01:08.430> camera<00:01:08.880> or<00:01:09.030> set<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.540> at

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
camera or the rear camera or set it at

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.990 
camera or the rear camera or set it at
an<00:01:09.840> angle<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.320> take<00:01:10.590> some<00:01:11.070> really<00:01:11.490> interesting

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
an angle to take some really interesting
