welcome to the LCS
I<00:00:31.210> would<00:00:32.210> say<00:00:32.329> joining<00:00:32.689> an<00:00:32.780> organization<00:00:32.899> and

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
I would say joining an organization and

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.229 
I would say joining an organization and
it's<00:00:33.860> like<00:00:34.070> the<00:00:34.190> easier<00:00:34.460> way<00:00:34.670> I<00:00:34.700> would<00:00:34.910> call<00:00:35.059> it

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
it's like the easier way I would call it

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.210 
it's like the easier way I would call it
because<00:00:35.930> you<00:00:36.050> don't<00:00:36.170> need<00:00:36.320> to<00:00:36.440> organize<00:00:36.980> that

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
because you don't need to organize that

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.819 
because you don't need to organize that

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
for me personally I think it's something

for me personally I think it's something
we<00:01:22.640> both<00:01:22.909> were<00:01:23.299> interested<00:01:23.509> when<00:01:24.110> on<00:01:24.590> the

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
we both were interested when on the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.710 
we both were interested when on the
moment<00:01:25.130> we<00:01:25.220> saw<00:01:25.430> the<00:01:25.490> streets<00:01:26.000> this<00:01:26.540> is

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
moment we saw the streets this is

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.980 
moment we saw the streets this is
because<00:01:27.080> it's<00:01:27.470> team<00:01:27.860> they<00:01:28.579> smart<00:01:29.000> they're

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.960 
because it's team they smart they're
very<00:01:30.290> good<00:01:30.590> and<00:01:31.009> I<00:01:31.130> think<00:01:31.159> this<00:01:31.579> is<00:01:31.729> the

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
very good and I think this is the

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.380 
very good and I think this is the
difference<00:01:32.450> why<00:01:32.750> we<00:01:33.170> said<00:01:33.439> okay<00:01:33.920> and<00:01:34.189> I<00:01:34.940> think

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
difference why we said okay and I think

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.390 
difference why we said okay and I think
this<00:01:35.600> is<00:01:35.750> a<00:01:35.780> very<00:01:36.110> good<00:01:36.380> school<00:01:36.710> to<00:01:36.740> go<00:01:37.070> through

this is a very good school to go through

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.050 
this is a very good school to go through
for<00:01:37.790> later<00:01:38.350> careers<00:01:39.350> we<00:01:40.040> are<00:01:40.220> an<00:01:40.670> older

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.690 
obviously go individually a lot from
this<00:02:16.570> now<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:17.620> actually<00:02:17.950> have<00:02:18.160> to<00:02:18.370> be<00:02:18.490> here

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
this now you actually have to be here

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.670 
this now you actually have to be here
you<00:02:18.940> need<00:02:19.090> to<00:02:19.150> do<00:02:19.540> all<00:02:19.690> your<00:02:19.840> shores<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:20.530> have

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
you need to do all your shores you have

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.440 
you need to do all your shores you have
to<00:02:20.890> think<00:02:21.520> about<00:02:21.700> all<00:02:21.970> this<00:02:22.090> stuff<00:02:22.210> you're

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
to think about all this stuff you're

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.240 
to think about all this stuff you're
doing<00:02:22.480> because<00:02:22.900> you<00:02:23.050> actually<00:02:23.170> with<00:02:23.530> other

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
doing because you actually with other

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.430 
doing because you actually with other
people<00:02:24.610> in<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.790> same<00:02:24.970> house<00:02:25.330> same<00:02:25.690> room<00:02:26.080> I

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
people in the same house same room I

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.110 
people in the same house same room I
think<00:02:26.800> it's<00:02:27.070> really<00:02:27.250> good<00:02:27.460> especially<00:02:27.640> when

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
think it's really good especially when

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.600 
think it's really good especially when
you're<00:02:28.330> kind<00:02:29.110> of<00:02:29.230> junk<00:02:29.470> as<00:02:29.709> we<00:02:30.130> are<00:02:30.250> right<00:02:30.430> now

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
you're kind of junk as we are right now

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:37.980 
you're kind of junk as we are right now
you<00:02:31.540> you<00:02:31.900> learn<00:02:32.050> a<00:02:32.110> lot<00:02:36.180> since<00:02:37.180> we're<00:02:37.510> kind<00:02:37.870> of

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
you you learn a lot since we're kind of

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.800 
you you learn a lot since we're kind of
new<00:02:38.110> blood<00:02:38.230> into<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.590> LCS<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.720> hopefully<00:02:40.720> we

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
new blood into the LCS and hopefully we

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.890 
new blood into the LCS and hopefully we
can<00:02:40.840> actually<00:02:41.140> bring<00:02:41.470> a<00:02:41.500> bit<00:02:41.709> of<00:02:41.770> new<00:02:42.190> spice<00:02:42.520> I

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
can actually bring a bit of new spice I

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.960 
can actually bring a bit of new spice I
think<00:02:43.900> it's<00:02:44.050> actually<00:02:44.170> our<00:02:44.800> play<00:02:45.070> style<00:02:45.430> we

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
think it's actually our play style we

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.960 
think it's actually our play style we
are<00:02:46.120> willing<00:02:46.750> to<00:02:46.870> risk<00:02:47.500> a<00:02:47.709> lot<00:02:47.800> of<00:02:47.980> stuff<00:02:48.220> big

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
are willing to risk a lot of stuff big

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.510 
are willing to risk a lot of stuff big
