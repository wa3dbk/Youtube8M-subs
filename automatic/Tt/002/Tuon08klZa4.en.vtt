this<00:00:00.840> is<00:00:00.960> Brandon<00:00:01.350> from<00:00:01.500> Team<00:00:01.770> and

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
this is Brandon from Team and

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.860 
this is Brandon from Team and
performance<00:00:02.490> today<00:00:02.939> I<00:00:02.970> wanted<00:00:03.300> to<00:00:03.360> go<00:00:03.510> over<00:00:03.540> a

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
performance today I wanted to go over a

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.780 
performance today I wanted to go over a
few<00:00:03.959> of<00:00:04.170> the<00:00:04.319> finer<00:00:04.529> details<00:00:05.190> that<00:00:05.460> we<00:00:05.580> look

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
few of the finer details that we look

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.519 
few of the finer details that we look
for<00:00:05.819> when<00:00:06.120> we're<00:00:06.509> doing<00:00:06.660> our<00:00:06.899> mouth<00:00:07.140> jobs

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
for when we're doing our mouth jobs

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.950 
for when we're doing our mouth jobs
valve<00:00:08.460> job<00:00:08.670> on<00:00:08.849> a<00:00:08.880> head<00:00:09.090> is<00:00:09.210> very<00:00:09.389> important

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
valve job on a head is very important

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.870 
valve job on a head is very important
because<00:00:10.080> not<00:00:10.440> only<00:00:10.500> does<00:00:11.010> it<00:00:11.070> affect<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.730> way

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
because not only does it affect the way

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.940 
because not only does it affect the way
the<00:00:12.090> head<00:00:12.269> seals<00:00:12.690> but<00:00:12.929> it<00:00:13.049> affects<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.530> flow

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
the head seals but it affects the flow

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.099 
the head seals but it affects the flow
as<00:00:14.219> well<00:00:14.759> as<00:00:14.910> how<00:00:15.059> your<00:00:15.240> spring<00:00:15.570> pack<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:15.960> going

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
as well as how your spring pack is going

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.680 
as well as how your spring pack is going
to<00:00:16.199> come<00:00:16.379> out<00:00:16.590> so<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.430> get<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.670> valve<00:00:17.910> job<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.539> be

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
to come out so to get a valve job to be

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.090 
to come out so to get a valve job to be
the<00:00:18.810> way<00:00:18.960> that<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.289> should<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.710> have<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.949> pay

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
the way that it should you have to pay

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.250 
the way that it should you have to pay
attention<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.880> finer<00:00:21.359> details<00:00:21.930> in<00:00:22.140> the

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
guide itself which will result in bad

run-out if it's too tight it'll allow

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.869 
run-out if it's too tight it'll allow
the<00:00:45.899> valve<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.530> stick<00:00:46.920> later<00:00:47.399> down<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.700> road

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
the valve to stick later down the road

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.799 
the valve to stick later down the road
so<00:00:48.809> when<00:00:49.680> we're<00:00:49.860> doing<00:00:50.010> our<00:00:50.309> guide<00:00:51.000> fitment<00:00:51.570> we

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
so when we're doing our guide fitment we

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.520 
so when we're doing our guide fitment we
put<00:00:52.079> eight<00:00:52.920> tenths<00:00:53.309> on<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.850> intake<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.530> one

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
put eight tenths on the intake and one

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.700 
put eight tenths on the intake and one
and<00:00:55.739> two<00:00:55.920> tenths<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.670> exhaust<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.809> we'll

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
and two tenths on the exhaust so we'll

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.060 
and two tenths on the exhaust so we'll
check<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:58.980> here<00:00:59.489> which<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.329> dummy<00:01:00.539> guide

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
check that here which is the dummy guide

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.820 
check that here which is the dummy guide
it's<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> good<00:01:02.309> god<00:01:02.579> fitting<00:01:03.320> the<00:01:04.320> next<00:01:04.619> thing

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
it's a good god fitting the next thing

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.480 
it's a good god fitting the next thing
that<00:01:04.860> we<00:01:05.129> look<00:01:05.369> for<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.060> inside<00:01:06.540> diameter

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
that we look for is the inside diameter

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.710 
that we look for is the inside diameter
when<00:01:08.490> we're<00:01:08.640> cutting<00:01:08.909> our<00:01:09.030> inside<00:01:09.450> diameter

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
when we're cutting our inside diameter

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.920 
when we're cutting our inside diameter
this<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.770> very<00:01:11.100> important<00:01:11.610> because<00:01:11.820> too<00:01:12.630> large

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
this is very important because too large

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.440 
this is very important because too large
of<00:01:13.260> an<00:01:13.380> inside<00:01:13.770> diameter<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.970> can't<00:01:15.180> keep

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
of an inside diameter and you can't keep

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.240 
of an inside diameter and you can't keep
your<00:01:15.659> port<00:01:16.020> velocity<00:01:16.650> up<00:01:16.830> when<00:01:17.070> you're

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
your port velocity up when you're

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.880 
your port velocity up when you're
flowing<00:01:17.520> too<00:01:18.090> small<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.020> bottlenecks<00:01:19.650> it

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
flowing too small and it bottlenecks it

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.730 
flowing too small and it bottlenecks it
so<00:01:20.610> we<00:01:21.240> set<00:01:21.479> all<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.689> ours<00:01:21.990> we've<00:01:22.320> worked<00:01:22.530> very

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
so we set all of ours we've worked very

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.010 
so we set all of ours we've worked very
hard<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:23.130> find<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.610> perfect<00:01:23.640> percentage<00:01:24.570> for

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
hard to find the perfect percentage for

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.359 
hard to find the perfect percentage for
each<00:01:25.049> kind<00:01:25.500> of<00:01:25.650> valve<00:01:25.890> or<00:01:26.280> angle<00:01:27.240> or<00:01:28.369> port

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
each kind of valve or angle or port

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.710 
each kind of valve or angle or port
style<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:31.250> we<00:01:32.250> have<00:01:32.430> all<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.640> our<00:01:32.820> tools<00:01:33.090> preset

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
style so we have all of our tools preset

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.840 
style so we have all of our tools preset
for<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.049> for<00:01:34.409> each<00:01:34.530> valve<00:01:34.860> or<00:01:35.159> angle<00:01:35.490> or<00:01:35.610> port

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
for that for each valve or angle or port

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.600 
for that for each valve or angle or port
style<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.439> adjust<00:01:37.439> accordingly<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:38.310> way<00:01:38.430> we

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
style and adjust accordingly that way we

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.789 
style and adjust accordingly that way we
can<00:01:38.790> just<00:01:39.090> come<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.630> cut<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.409> move<00:01:40.590> on

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
can just come in and cut and move on

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.950 
can just come in and cut and move on
with<00:01:40.979> our<00:01:41.159> valve<00:01:41.430> job

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.649 

next<00:01:44.960> thing<00:01:45.229> is<00:01:45.440> the<00:01:46.040> run<00:01:46.580> out<00:01:46.610> on<00:01:46.940> the<00:01:47.060> guy<00:01:47.240> or

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
next thing is the run out on the guy or

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.219 
next thing is the run out on the guy or
on<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.110> seat<00:01:48.350> I'm<00:01:48.590> sorry<00:01:48.850> we<00:01:49.850> don't<00:01:50.060> let<00:01:50.240> we
