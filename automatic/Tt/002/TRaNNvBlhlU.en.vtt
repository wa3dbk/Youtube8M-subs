00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.220 
is actually just falling and catching
yourself<00:02:09.789> and<00:02:10.209> then<00:02:10.300> falling<00:02:10.629> again<00:02:10.869> and<00:02:11.050> it's

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
yourself and then falling again and it's

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.500 
yourself and then falling again and it's
kind<00:02:11.440> of<00:02:11.500> like<00:02:11.560> this<00:02:11.860> I'm<00:02:12.430> falling<00:02:12.970> backwards

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
kind of like this I'm falling backwards

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.360 
kind of like this I'm falling backwards
instead<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:13.840> forwards<00:02:13.959> and<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.980> starts<00:02:15.250> going

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
instead of forwards and it starts going

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.009 
instead of forwards and it starts going
faster<00:02:15.910> unless<00:02:16.120> I<00:02:16.269> get<00:02:16.330> up<00:02:16.540> to<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.810> middle

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
faster unless I get up to the middle

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.650 
faster unless I get up to the middle
here<00:02:17.140> we're<00:02:18.209> responsible<00:02:19.209> for<00:02:19.330> our<00:02:19.569> own

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
here we're responsible for our own

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.509 
here we're responsible for our own
safety<00:02:19.930> so<00:02:20.260> we<00:02:20.410> have<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.650> constantly<00:02:20.980> look<00:02:21.370> at

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
safety so we have to constantly look at

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.460 
safety so we have to constantly look at
the<00:02:21.780> fittings<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:22.989> make<00:02:23.110> sure<00:02:23.260> they're

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
the fittings to make sure they're

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.920 
the fittings to make sure they're
nothing's<00:02:23.890> getting<00:02:24.099> loose<00:02:24.459> or<00:02:25.150> if<00:02:25.180> weakening

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
nothing's getting loose or if weakening

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.509 
nothing's getting loose or if weakening
or<00:02:26.230> getting<00:02:26.620> jammed<00:02:27.099> and<00:02:28.980> it's<00:02:29.980> not<00:02:30.129> that<00:02:30.310> hard

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
or getting jammed and it's not that hard

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:32.910 
or getting jammed and it's not that hard
but<00:02:30.700> it's<00:02:30.879> you<00:02:31.209> know<00:02:31.269> you<00:02:32.170> can't<00:02:32.799> take

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
but it's you know you can't take

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:33.839 
but it's you know you can't take
anything<00:02:33.160> for<00:02:33.310> granted

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849

I'm wearing a harness which of course
was<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.170> most<00:02:38.200> obvious<00:02:38.829> thing<00:02:38.980> but<00:02:39.010> I

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
was the the most obvious thing but I

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.780 
was the the most obvious thing but I
have<00:02:39.340> to<00:02:39.430> actually<00:02:39.670> sleep<00:02:39.880> in<00:02:39.970> his<00:02:40.120> harness

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
have to actually sleep in his harness

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.039 
have to actually sleep in his harness
because<00:02:42.790> I'm<00:02:42.880> afraid<00:02:43.030> I<00:02:43.239> roll<00:02:43.420> out<00:02:43.450> of<00:02:43.599> bed<00:02:43.720> or

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
because I'm afraid I roll out of bed or

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:45.960 
because I'm afraid I roll out of bed or
or<00:02:44.980> that<00:02:45.220> Alice<00:02:45.459> will<00:02:45.549> get<00:02:45.700> up<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:45.910> go

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
sleepwalking in the wheel just take off

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.520 
sleepwalking in the wheel just take off
it's<00:02:48.130> it's<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:48.940> trust<00:02:49.180> issue<00:02:49.379> for<00:02:50.379> me<00:02:50.500> is

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
it's it's the the trust issue for me is

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.170 
it's it's the the trust issue for me is
the<00:02:50.769> challenge<00:02:51.160> I<00:02:51.250> mean<00:02:51.370> it's<00:02:51.579> a<00:02:51.640> combination

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
the challenge I mean it's a combination

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.569 
the challenge I mean it's a combination
of<00:02:52.269> the<00:02:52.390> fact<00:02:52.629> of<00:02:52.750> my<00:02:53.079> disability<00:02:53.860> up<00:02:53.980> here<00:02:54.190> the

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
of the fact of my disability up here the

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.050 
of the fact of my disability up here the
lack<00:02:55.390> of<00:02:55.569> power<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:56.200> my<00:02:56.920> need<00:02:57.190> for<00:02:57.220> him<00:02:57.760> and

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
lack of power and my need for him and

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.490 
lack of power and my need for him and
they<00:02:58.870> were<00:02:59.049> our<00:02:59.319> hand-in-hand<00:03:00.000> I<00:03:01.379> would<00:03:02.379> have

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
they were our hand-in-hand I would have

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.229 
they were our hand-in-hand I would have
said<00:03:02.709> earlier<00:03:03.160> there<00:03:03.430> was<00:03:03.519> just<00:03:03.760> about<00:03:04.030> the

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
said earlier there was just about the

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.289 
said earlier there was just about the
difficulty<00:03:04.780> of<00:03:04.810> doing<00:03:05.200> things<00:03:05.410> up<00:03:05.560> here<00:03:05.769> and

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
difficulty of doing things up here and

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.270 
difficulty of doing things up here and
and<00:03:07.299> the<00:03:07.569> fear<00:03:07.780> factor<00:03:07.959> but<00:03:08.410> but<00:03:08.859> the<00:03:08.920> fact<00:03:08.950> is

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
and the fear factor but but the fact is

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.670 
and the fear factor but but the fact is
it<00:03:09.459> it's<00:03:09.760> all<00:03:09.880> tied<00:03:10.150> in<00:03:10.359> with<00:03:10.389> the<00:03:11.380> fact<00:03:11.620> that

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
it it's all tied in with the fact that

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.590 
it it's all tied in with the fact that
he's<00:03:11.889> down<00:03:12.069> there<00:03:12.370> for<00:03:12.819> me<00:03:12.970> he's<00:03:13.060> got<00:03:13.239> my<00:03:13.389> back

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
he's down there for me he's got my back

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.599 
he's down there for me he's got my back
and<00:03:13.900> that<00:03:14.530> I<00:03:14.560> have<00:03:14.739> to<00:03:14.859> be<00:03:14.950> able<00:03:15.040> to<00:03:15.280> let<00:03:15.489> these

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
and that I have to be able to let these

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:20.250 
and that I have to be able to let these
two<00:03:15.880> things<00:03:17.250> integrate
