00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
through the screen here very nice and

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.349 
through the screen here very nice and
easy<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.159> use<00:01:50.369> but<00:01:50.789> really<00:01:50.850> for<00:01:51.149> me<00:01:51.240> the

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:51.359 
easy to use but really for me the

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:52.580 
easy to use but really for me the
biggest<00:01:51.570> difference<00:01:52.079> with<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.350> car

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
biggest difference with this car

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.529 
biggest difference with this car
compared<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.070> old<00:01:53.189> on<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.969> increase

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
compared to the old on is the increase

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.950 
compared to the old on is the increase
in<00:01:54.689> interior<00:01:55.680> quality<00:01:56.119> because<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.539> feels

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
in interior quality because it feels

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.410 
in interior quality because it feels
much<00:01:58.170> better<00:01:58.380> built<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.159> design<00:01:59.490> is<00:02:00.060> also

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
much better built and the design is also

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.780 
much better built and the design is also
nicer<00:02:00.750> too

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.850

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
is key selling point is the fact that

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.510 
is key selling point is the fact that
it's<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.930> only<00:03:02.990> car<00:03:03.260> this<00:03:03.470> size<00:03:03.710> that<00:03:04.070> is

slung driving position and the very
responsive<00:03:09.620> steering<00:03:09.940> means<00:03:10.940> that<00:03:11.150> it

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
responsive steering means that it

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.880 
responsive steering means that it
effectively<00:03:11.750> feels<00:03:12.050> like<00:03:12.200> a<00:03:12.290> sports<00:03:12.680> car
