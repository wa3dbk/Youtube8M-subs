00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:13.619 

right<00:00:12.019> this<00:00:12.200> is<00:00:12.379> about<00:00:12.499> paints<00:00:13.219> and<00:00:13.400> pigments

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:13.629 
right this is about paints and pigments

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.570 
right this is about paints and pigments
so<00:00:14.629> we're<00:00:15.199> going<00:00:15.320> to<00:00:15.379> ask<00:00:15.559> ourselves<00:00:15.709> why<00:00:16.219> do

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
so we're going to ask ourselves why do

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.089 
so we're going to ask ourselves why do
we<00:00:16.759> paint<00:00:17.180> things<00:00:17.570> and<00:00:17.869> the<00:00:18.230> answer<00:00:18.650> is<00:00:18.770> two

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:19.099 
we paint things and the answer is two

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:21.550 
we paint things and the answer is two
reasons<00:00:19.310> number<00:00:19.880> one<00:00:20.390> to<00:00:21.020> make<00:00:21.199> them<00:00:21.380> look

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
reasons number one to make them look

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.689 
reasons number one to make them look
more<00:00:21.860> attractive

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
more attractive

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.240 
more attractive
but<00:00:23.060> also<00:00:23.270> it<00:00:23.630> can<00:00:23.660> protect<00:00:24.199> things<00:00:24.800> as<00:00:25.039> well

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
but also it can protect things as well

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.769 
but also it can protect things as well
so<00:00:25.430> it<00:00:25.550> could<00:00:25.669> protect<00:00:25.820> metal<00:00:26.390> or<00:00:26.570> it<00:00:26.660> could

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
so it could protect metal or it could

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.950 
so it could protect metal or it could
protect<00:00:26.899> wood<00:00:27.759> there<00:00:28.759> are<00:00:28.910> three<00:00:29.239> things<00:00:29.629> in

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
protect wood there are three things in

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.319 
protect wood there are three things in
paint<00:00:30.320> you<00:00:30.590> need<00:00:30.739> to<00:00:30.919> know<00:00:31.099> about<00:00:31.219> the<00:00:32.029> first

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
paint you need to know about the first

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.110 
paint you need to know about the first
thing<00:00:32.750> is<00:00:32.989> the<00:00:33.559> pigment<00:00:33.920> that<00:00:34.460> gives<00:00:35.000> the

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
thing is the pigment that gives the

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.310 
thing is the pigment that gives the
paint<00:00:35.390> its<00:00:35.570> color<00:00:35.930> so<00:00:36.559> this<00:00:37.390> this<00:00:38.390> paint<00:00:38.750> will

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
paint its color so this this paint will

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.590 
paint its color so this this paint will
contain<00:00:39.649> lots<00:00:39.829> of<00:00:39.920> grays<00:00:40.370> and<00:00:40.399> blues<00:00:41.149> and<00:00:41.480> that

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
contain lots of grays and blues and that

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.810 
contain lots of grays and blues and that
gives<00:00:41.840> it<00:00:42.020> its<00:00:42.050> color<00:00:42.410> then<00:00:43.220> you've<00:00:43.400> got<00:00:43.640> the

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
gives it its color then you've got the

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.810 
gives it its color then you've got the
binding<00:00:44.600> medium<00:00:44.810> and<00:00:45.260> that<00:00:45.290> is<00:00:46.130> the<00:00:46.430> substance

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
binding medium and that is the substance

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.780 
binding medium and that is the substance
which<00:00:47.000> makes<00:00:47.270> a<00:00:47.450> paint<00:00:47.810> stick<00:00:48.530> to<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:49.220> surface

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
which makes a paint stick to the surface

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.110 
which makes a paint stick to the surface
you<00:00:50.630> are<00:00:50.810> applying<00:00:51.290> it<00:00:51.530> to<00:00:51.770> and<00:00:52.040> then<00:00:52.790> there's

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
you are applying it to and then there's

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.600 
you are applying it to and then there's
the<00:00:53.270> solvent<00:00:53.840> and<00:00:53.960> that<00:00:54.050> helps<00:00:54.860> the<00:00:55.280> paint

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
the solvent and that helps the paint

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.729 
the solvent and that helps the paint
spread<00:00:56.270> out<00:00:56.480> that<00:00:56.690> helped<00:00:56.840> thin<00:00:57.110> the<00:00:57.260> paint<00:00:57.470> to

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
spread out that helped thin the paint to

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.160 
spread out that helped thin the paint to
spread<00:00:58.100> it<00:00:58.250> out<00:00:58.430> the<00:00:59.420> last<00:00:59.660> thing<00:00:59.840> you<00:00:59.930> need<00:00:59.960> to

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
spread it out the last thing you need to

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.049 
spread it out the last thing you need to
know<00:01:00.320> on<00:01:00.470> this<00:01:00.620> point<00:01:00.860> is<00:01:01.070> that<00:01:01.160> all<00:01:01.610> paints

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
know on this point is that all paints

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.250 
know on this point is that all paints
are<00:01:02.180> colloids

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
are colloids

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.130 
are colloids
what's<00:01:03.980> a<00:01:04.129> colloid<00:01:04.549> well<00:01:04.850> it's<00:01:05.149> lots<00:01:05.509> of<00:01:05.689> tiny

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
what's a colloid well it's lots of tiny

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.999 
what's a colloid well it's lots of tiny
little<00:01:06.560> solid<00:01:07.130> particles<00:01:07.939> that<00:01:08.689> are

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
little solid particles that are

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:11.920 
little solid particles that are
dispersed<00:01:10.009> within<00:01:10.430> a<00:01:10.610> liquid<00:01:11.060> but<00:01:11.570> don't

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
dispersed within a liquid but don't

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.499 
dispersed within a liquid but don't
dissolve<00:01:12.590> within<00:01:13.219> it<00:01:13.490> and<00:01:13.700> that's<00:01:13.939> spread<00:01:14.299> out

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
dissolve within it and that's spread out

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.469 
dissolve within it and that's spread out
throughout<00:01:15.200> the<00:01:15.319> entire<00:01:15.560> liquid<00:01:16.369> and<00:01:16.850> all

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
throughout the entire liquid and all

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:25.990 
throughout the entire liquid and all
paints<00:01:17.990> are<00:01:18.139> cards

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.860 

right<00:01:26.990> you<00:01:27.200> need<00:01:27.350> to<00:01:27.410> know<00:01:27.620> about<00:01:27.740> how

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
right you need to know about how

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.870 
right you need to know about how
oil-based<00:01:29.870> paints<00:01:30.320> dry<00:01:30.620> and<00:01:30.920> water-based

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
oil-based paints dry and water-based

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.480 
oil-based paints dry and water-based
paints<00:01:32.420> dry<00:01:32.870> let's<00:01:33.620> look<00:01:33.770> at<00:01:33.890> water-based

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
paints dry let's look at water-based

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.360 
paints dry let's look at water-based
paints<00:01:34.880> first<00:01:35.150> I<00:01:35.510> spread<00:01:36.380> them<00:01:36.620> thinly<00:01:36.980> and

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
paints first I spread them thinly and

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.200 
paints first I spread them thinly and
then<00:01:38.120> the<00:01:38.510> solvent<00:01:39.050> evaporates<00:01:39.520> and<00:01:40.520> that

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
then the solvent evaporates and that

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.960 
then the solvent evaporates and that
causes<00:01:41.540> the<00:01:41.930> paint<00:01:42.170> to<00:01:42.530> dry<00:01:42.850> with<00:01:43.850> an

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
causes the paint to dry with an

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.740 
causes the paint to dry with an
oil-based<00:01:44.360> paint<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:47.000> solvent<00:01:47.510> also

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
oil-based paint the solvent also

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.570 
oil-based paint the solvent also
evaporates<00:01:48.850> but<00:01:49.850> then<00:01:50.180> the<00:01:50.750> oil<00:01:50.960> is<00:01:51.580> oxidized

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
evaporates but then the oil is oxidized

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.540 
evaporates but then the oil is oxidized
by<00:01:52.970> oxygen<00:01:53.210> in<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:53.810> air<00:01:53.840> and<00:01:54.350> that<00:01:54.890> causes<00:01:55.250> it

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
by oxygen in the air and that causes it

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:04.030 
by oxygen in the air and that causes it
to<00:01:55.730> dry

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.180 

you<00:02:04.970> also<00:02:05.210> need<00:02:05.600> to<00:02:05.810> know<00:02:05.960> about

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
you also need to know about

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.490 
you also need to know about
thermochromic<00:02:07.190> paints<00:02:08.030> their<00:02:08.750> paints<00:02:09.290> that

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
thermochromic paints their paints that

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.500 
thermochromic paints their paints that
change<00:02:10.220> color<00:02:10.640> depending<00:02:10.759> on<00:02:11.450> the

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
change color depending on the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.830 
change color depending on the
temperature<00:02:12.260> so<00:02:12.890> if<00:02:13.190> they<00:02:13.430> get<00:02:13.670> hotter<00:02:14.120> they

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
temperature so if they get hotter they

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.140 
temperature so if they get hotter they
may<00:02:15.050> change<00:02:15.320> color<00:02:15.680> if<00:02:16.070> they<00:02:16.220> get<00:02:16.430> colder<00:02:17.000> they

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
may change color if they get colder they

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.240 
may change color if they get colder they
may<00:02:17.330> change<00:02:17.600> color<00:02:17.960> now<00:02:18.530> we<00:02:18.590> could<00:02:18.920> use<00:02:18.950> these

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
may change color now we could use these

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.600 
may change color now we could use these
for<00:02:19.490> instance<00:02:19.550> with<00:02:20.360> a<00:02:20.600> hot<00:02:21.560> mug<00:02:21.950> of<00:02:22.130> tea<00:02:22.160> I

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
for instance with a hot mug of tea I

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.580 
for instance with a hot mug of tea I
don't<00:02:23.120> want<00:02:23.270> to<00:02:23.330> touch<00:02:23.480> if<00:02:23.750> it's<00:02:23.960> two<00:02:24.110> hawks<00:02:24.380> I

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
don't want to touch if it's two hawks I

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.860 
don't want to touch if it's two hawks I
might<00:02:24.770> burn<00:02:25.010> myself<00:02:25.550> but<00:02:26.030> as<00:02:26.180> it<00:02:26.450> cools<00:02:26.720> down

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
might burn myself but as it cools down

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.440 
might burn myself but as it cools down
the<00:02:27.440> mug<00:02:27.770> could<00:02:27.920> actually<00:02:28.070> change<00:02:28.520> color<00:02:28.970> so<00:02:29.420> I

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
the mug could actually change color so I

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.680 
the mug could actually change color so I
then<00:02:29.690> know<00:02:29.900> if<00:02:30.020> it's<00:02:30.200> safe<00:02:30.470> to<00:02:30.500> drink<00:02:30.980> or<00:02:31.160> not

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
then know if it's safe to drink or not

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.310 
then know if it's safe to drink or not
now<00:02:32.690> one<00:02:32.840> of<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:32.990> problems<00:02:33.080> with

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
now one of the problems with

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.930 
now one of the problems with
thermochromic<00:02:33.770> paints<00:02:34.310> is<00:02:34.400> that<00:02:34.580> there's<00:02:34.790> a

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
thermochromic paints is that there's a

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.000 
thermochromic paints is that there's a
limited<00:02:35.420> number<00:02:35.780> of<00:02:35.840> colors<00:02:36.110> not<00:02:36.500> very<00:02:36.740> many

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
limited number of colors not very many

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.520 
limited number of colors not very many
so<00:02:37.459> if<00:02:37.610> i<00:02:37.730> mix<00:02:38.030> them<00:02:38.300> with<00:02:38.480> acrylic<00:02:39.080> paints

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
so if i mix them with acrylic paints

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.980 
so if i mix them with acrylic paints
then<00:02:39.920> i<00:02:40.040> get<00:02:40.190> a<00:02:40.220> wider<00:02:40.640> range<00:02:41.090> of<00:02:41.360> colors<00:02:41.420> and

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
then i get a wider range of colors and

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:51.350 
then i get a wider range of colors and
they're<00:02:42.470> thermochromic<00:02:43.300> paints

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.760 

now<00:02:52.360> we're<00:02:52.569> talking<00:02:52.900> about<00:02:52.990> glow-in-the-dark

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
now we're talking about glow-in-the-dark

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.690 
now we're talking about glow-in-the-dark
paints<00:02:54.640> in<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.540> olden<00:02:56.050> days<00:02:56.220> people<00:02:57.220> used<00:02:57.610> to

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
paints in the olden days people used to

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.880 
paints in the olden days people used to
sometimes<00:02:58.239> used<00:02:58.450> radioactive<00:02:59.319> chemicals

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
sometimes used radioactive chemicals

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.740 
sometimes used radioactive chemicals
which<00:03:00.069> used<00:03:00.310> to<00:03:00.370> glow<00:03:00.610> in<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:00.849> dark<00:03:01.090> but<00:03:01.599> they

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
which used to glow in the dark but they

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.640 
which used to glow in the dark but they
were<00:03:01.810> very<00:03:01.959> dangerous<00:03:02.730> nowadays<00:03:03.730> we<00:03:04.420> use

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
were very dangerous nowadays we use

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.650 
were very dangerous nowadays we use
phosphorescent<00:03:05.650> paints<00:03:06.160> they<00:03:06.700> also<00:03:06.910> glow<00:03:07.510> in

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
phosphorescent paints they also glow in

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.960 
phosphorescent paints they also glow in
the<00:03:07.780> dark<00:03:08.050> but<00:03:08.410> they're<00:03:08.560> much<00:03:08.800> safer<00:03:09.130> they

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
the dark but they're much safer they

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.470 
the dark but they're much safer they
work<00:03:10.270> by<00:03:10.630> absorbing<00:03:11.190> light<00:03:12.360> during<00:03:13.360> the

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
work by absorbing light during the

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.809 
work by absorbing light during the
daytime<00:03:13.959> and<00:03:14.230> then<00:03:14.709> they<00:03:14.860> release<00:03:15.250> it<00:03:15.459> very

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
daytime and then they release it very

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.610 
daytime and then they release it very
slowly<00:03:16.600> the<00:03:16.930> whole<00:03:17.110> time

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
slowly the whole time

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.949 
slowly the whole time
so<00:03:17.890> they<00:03:18.160> appear<00:03:18.760> to<00:03:18.910> glow<00:03:19.060> in<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.450> dark<00:03:19.720> at

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
so they appear to glow in the dark at

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:28.730 
so they appear to glow in the dark at
nighttime

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.800
