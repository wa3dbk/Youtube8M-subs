00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.940
 recruit a chain of 19 air 5 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.180
 the first three air loops will be 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.780
 replace the first double crochet in 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:37.780
 we knit the fourth air loop 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.410
 single crochet and further in 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:45.070
 we knit each air loop for another 5 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:49.870
 double crochet means first were 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:57.970
 double crochet second column with 3 columns 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:01:03.660
 double crochet 4 crochet column with 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.660
 double crochet and 6 double crochet 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:13.390
 then we knit one air loop 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.370
 below we skip one air loop and 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.100
 over the next air loop on here 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:22.500
 so that the thread does not stretch we 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:27.420
 grabbing two strings so it will be better 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:30.730
 first knotted crochet and 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.590
 based on this column still knit 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:36.510
 as if twisted column that is the whole 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:39.340
 the column will be called the twisted column 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:43.120
 we hook the hook here this one here 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:47.080
 in front of the bar we grab the working thread 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:49.420
 we pull out again we enter 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:53.890
 hook in this hole grab working 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:57.250
 nakid 3 1 thread grab working thread 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:01.300
 nakid and fourth time we capture 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:04.780
 worker thread that is four to viva still 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:08.229
 just grabbing the thread we throw 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:14.920
 and stretch through everything that is in 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:17.430
 us on the hook something like a magnificent 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:23.440
 column tank he like this with us 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:26.620
 deployed further air loop 1 1 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.739
 air loop below and skip over 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:33.340
 knot the next air loop 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.390
 double crochet and beyond 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.239
 posts 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.150
 over the next air loop column with 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:44.739
 nakida 2 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:54.959
 next third crochet 4 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:54.959
 double crochet 5 crochet 6 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.070
 and the last seventh double crochet 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.550
 that is, we have a canvas with columns with 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.220
 nakidom and in the middle here so entwined 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:16.180
 column next row we knit 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.880
 lifting loops they will not be like us 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.710
 be considered the second principle of writing 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.010
 direct canvas mine will be located 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:27.520
 nose as if on the side and further column above 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:40.410
 tying the column with 7 columns 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:40.410
 nakida 2 3 4 5 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.290
 6 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.709
 7 double crochets 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:59.909
 air loop above the post 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:05.129
 they wrap around the column we are here at the top two 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:07.489
 loop threads we knit a column with 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:13.230
 nakidom 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:15.780
 farther again the air loop and down 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.359
 passing the air loop over the post 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.840
 double crochet 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:25.410
 above the next double crochet 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:30.030
 double crochet and so on until the end of the row 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:32.510
 we should all be in succession 7 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.510
 posts 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:40.430
 5 6 and 7 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:48.199
 the next row we knit 3 air 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.870
 loops it will be just like lifting loops 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:52.550
 we do not consider them on the side until the second principle 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.240
 knitting a smooth canvas 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:59.960
 and above the posts we knit that is 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:03.020
 call it to them immediately the first bar we 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:07.690
 knit 7 crochets 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.690
 there is a column above the column 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.520
 we knit crochets further 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:26.889
 1 air loop 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.949
 at the bottom of one air loop skip 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:33.970
 and above crochet we knit 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:36.639
 we knot the column itself 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:39.789
 and start and twist around captured 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:45.449
 working thread nakid captured working 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:48.639
 thread nakid 3 1 and 4 times 

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:52.680
 now grab the worker thread a little 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:55.500
 pull down the canvas and up the hook 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:59.800
 the hook head looks down and 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:02.350
 stretching through all navi you are alone 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.020
 air loop at the bottom one air 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:07.960
 loop and skip over next 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:10.139
 we knit columns with one 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.139
 nakidom 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:31.319
 there should be a total of 7 bars already 4 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:31.319
 5 6 and 7 columns 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:41.699
 that's the way alternating a row where we 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:46.490
 from the twisted column and the row where we have the usual 

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:49.439
 column we get this picture 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:51.900
 if you will use this drawing 

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:53.879
 in blouses or dress you can 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.879
 gradually increase the amount 

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:58.650
 columns with sc and you would like to 

00:06:56.879 --> 00:07:04.370
 Line can be expanded 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:04.370
 web bending and widening
