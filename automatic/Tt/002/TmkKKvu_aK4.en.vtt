00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
basically just because of the size i

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.490 
basically just because of the size i
mean<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.850> 1520<00:00:33.390> was<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> bit<00:00:33.870> too<00:00:34.079> big<00:00:34.290> for<00:00:34.469> my

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500

mean the 1520 was a bit too big for my
pocket<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.760> dropped<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.120> couple<00:00:36.300> times<00:00:36.630> so

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
gotta fix but this wasn't worth the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.930
