00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
set review this is on the lego minecraft

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.560 
set review this is on the lego minecraft
set<00:00:07.440> and<00:00:07.649> this<00:00:08.220> is<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.550> microworld<00:00:09.330> so

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
set and this is the microworld so

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.419 
set and this is the microworld so
everything's<00:00:10.349> scaled<00:00:10.920> down<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.570> instead<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.599> a

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:13.429 
everything's scaled down to instead of a

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.120 
everything's scaled down to instead of a
big<00:00:14.429> block<00:00:14.730> it's<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.089> 1<00:00:15.330> by<00:00:15.480> 1<00:00:15.529> brick<00:00:16.529> I<00:00:16.800> guess

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
big block it's a 1 by 1 brick I guess

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.090 
big block it's a 1 by 1 brick I guess
you<00:00:17.250> could<00:00:17.430> say<00:00:17.640> brick<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.180> plate<00:00:18.480> size<00:00:19.100> so

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
you could say brick and plate size so

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.400 
you could say brick and plate size so
let's<00:00:20.640> get<00:00:20.789> into<00:00:20.850> this<00:00:21.270> we're<00:00:21.720> going<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.930> first

this<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.100> first<00:00:59.129> set<00:00:59.699> that<00:01:00.059> really<00:01:00.480> broke

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
this is the first set that really broke

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.439 
this is the first set that really broke
through<00:01:01.800> lego<00:01:02.039> cuusoo<00:01:02.340> that's<00:01:03.000> where<00:01:03.270> you

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
through lego cuusoo that's where you

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.679 
through lego cuusoo that's where you
pitch<00:01:04.170> your<00:01:04.409> idea<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.040> if<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.670> get<00:01:05.820> 10,000<00:01:06.540> or

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
pitch your idea and if you get 10,000 or

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.020 
pitch your idea and if you get 10,000 or
more<00:01:06.720> people<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.680> want<00:01:08.040> support<00:01:08.850> it

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
more people that want support it

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.270 
more people that want support it
basically<00:01:09.479> then<00:01:09.810> Lego<00:01:10.350> takes<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.130> into

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
basically then Lego takes it into

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.120 
basically then Lego takes it into
consideration<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:12.299> starts<00:01:12.799> designing<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.890> set

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
consideration and starts designing a set

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.429 
consideration and starts designing a set
so<00:01:14.400> there's<00:01:14.700> another<00:01:14.939> look<00:01:15.180> at<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.439> we're
