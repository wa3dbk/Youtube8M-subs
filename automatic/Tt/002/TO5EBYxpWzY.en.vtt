00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.180 
so this is the place that I come to get
my<00:02:40.280> lava<00:02:40.640> rocks<00:02:40.970> and<00:02:41.510> basically<00:02:41.900> it's<00:02:42.860> just<00:02:42.980> a

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
my lava rocks and basically it's just a

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.430 
my lava rocks and basically it's just a
hill<00:02:44.050> and<00:02:45.050> you've<00:02:45.230> got<00:02:45.440> rocks<00:02:46.720> all<00:02:47.720> up<00:02:48.200> and

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
hill and you've got rocks all up and

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.370 
hill and you've got rocks all up and
down<00:02:49.239> and<00:02:50.239> what<00:02:50.360> happens<00:02:50.780> is<00:02:51.050> those

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
down and what happens is those

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.160 
down and what happens is those
eventually<00:02:52.100> they<00:02:52.310> break<00:02:52.550> off<00:02:52.820> so<00:02:53.780> they<00:02:53.930> roll

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
eventually they break off so they roll

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.540 
eventually they break off so they roll
down<00:02:54.200> to<00:02:54.709> the<00:02:56.110> roadside<00:02:57.110> here<00:02:57.800> and<00:02:58.010> you<00:02:58.340> just

walk<00:02:58.820> along<00:02:59.000> and<00:02:59.540> you<00:02:59.630> just<00:02:59.690> pick<00:03:00.530> them<00:03:00.650> up<00:03:00.770> so

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
walk along and you just pick them up so

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.300 
walk along and you just pick them up so
you<00:03:02.600> can<00:03:02.840> pretty<00:03:03.140> much<00:03:03.230> find<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.860> right<00:03:04.040> size

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310
