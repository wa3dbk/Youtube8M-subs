00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
clip here we were talking about what to

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.279 
clip here we were talking about what to
do<00:00:17.460> when<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:17.789> find<00:00:18.000> a<00:00:18.180> tick<00:00:18.359> how<00:00:18.840> do<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:19.050> get<00:00:19.260> a

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
do when you find a tick how do you get a

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.470 
do when you find a tick how do you get a
tick<00:00:19.560> off<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:20.039> your<00:00:20.220> dog<00:00:20.490> now<00:00:21.270> there's

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
tick off of your dog now there's

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.120 
tick off of your dog now there's
probably<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.990> hundred<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.619> one<00:00:22.800> different

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
probably a hundred and one different

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.089 
probably a hundred and one different
ways<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.789> people<00:00:23.850> can<00:00:24.300> come<00:00:24.480> up<00:00:24.660> with<00:00:25.099> from

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
ways that people can come up with from

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.950 
ways that people can come up with from
burning<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.300> abdomen<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.439> tick<00:00:28.680> with<00:00:28.949> a

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
burning the abdomen of the tick with a

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.319 
burning the abdomen of the tick with a
blown-out<00:00:30.960> match<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.800> pouring<00:00:32.189> oil<00:00:32.430> over<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.149> I

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
blown-out match to pouring oil over it I

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.110 
blown-out match to pouring oil over it I
find<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.410> simplest<00:00:34.980> way<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.280> remove<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.910> tick

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
find the simplest way to remove the tick

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.889 
find the simplest way to remove the tick
is<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.840> simply<00:00:37.200> grasp<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:38.809> actually<00:00:39.809> I've

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
is the simply grasp it actually I've

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.229 
is the simply grasp it actually I've
gone<00:00:40.110> over<00:00:40.170> this<00:00:40.620> dog<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.129> unfortunately<00:00:41.700> he

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
gone over this dog and unfortunately he

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.450 
gone over this dog and unfortunately he
has<00:00:42.510> no<00:00:42.840> ticks<00:00:43.200> but<00:00:43.860> I'm<00:00:44.070> just<00:00:44.190> going<00:00:44.430> to

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
has no ticks but I'm just going to

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.850 
has no ticks but I'm just going to
demonstrate<00:00:44.730> for<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.450> what<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:46.170> would<00:00:46.500> do<00:00:46.680> if

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
demonstrate for you what I would do if

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.880 
demonstrate for you what I would do if
he<00:00:46.890> had<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.340> tick<00:00:47.730> let's<00:00:48.120> just<00:00:48.450> say<00:00:48.750> there<00:00:49.680> was<00:00:49.710> a

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
he had a tick let's just say there was a

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.930 
he had a tick let's just say there was a
tick<00:00:50.570> right<00:00:51.570> here<00:00:52.250> there<00:00:53.250> was<00:00:53.370> a<00:00:53.399> tick<00:00:53.699> right

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
tick right here there was a tick right

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.750 
tick right here there was a tick right
here<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.780> would<00:00:54.930> be<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.110> brown<00:00:55.530> body<00:00:55.920> protruding

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
here it would be a brown body protruding

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.180 
here it would be a brown body protruding
here<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:58.079> would<00:00:58.170> actually<00:00:58.350> be<00:00:58.590> able<00:00:58.949> to

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
here and you would actually be able to

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.110 
here and you would actually be able to
move<00:00:59.930> that<00:01:00.930> tick<00:01:01.320> back<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.920> forth<00:01:02.280> its<00:01:02.640> head

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
move that tick back and forth its head

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.710 
move that tick back and forth its head
would<00:01:03.719> be<00:01:03.960> attached<00:01:04.350> into<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.949> dog<00:01:05.510> what<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.540> do

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
would be attached into the dog what I do

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.740 
would be attached into the dog what I do
and<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:08.040> find<00:01:08.369> this<00:01:08.490> is<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.790> easiest<00:01:09.330> method

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
and I find this is the easiest method

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.450 
and I find this is the easiest method
because<00:01:10.260> what<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.500> want<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.830> do<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.250> don't

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
because what you want to do is you don't

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.760 
because what you want to do is you don't
want<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.700> leave<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.060> head<00:01:12.299> attached<00:01:12.750> if<00:01:13.560> you

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
want to leave the head attached if you

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.649 
want to leave the head attached if you
just<00:01:14.040> take<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.640> body<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> tick<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.600> you

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
just take the body of the tick and you

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.920 
just take the body of the tick and you
pull<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.439> straight<00:01:16.740> out<00:01:17.180> so<00:01:18.180> if<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.390> just<00:01:18.600> pull

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
pull it straight out so if you just pull

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.960 
pull it straight out so if you just pull
it<00:01:18.960> straight<00:01:19.409> out<00:01:19.710> you're<00:01:20.369> typically<00:01:20.759> going

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
it straight out you're typically going

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.170 
it straight out you're typically going
to<00:01:21.200> separate<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.530> abdomen<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.729> tick<00:01:23.970> from

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
to separate the abdomen of the tick from

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.490 
to separate the abdomen of the tick from
the<00:01:24.299> head<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.659> tick<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.110> relieves<00:01:25.380> a

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
the head of the tick and it relieves a

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.969 
the head of the tick and it relieves a
head<00:01:25.740> embedded<00:01:26.250> in<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.490> dog<00:01:26.869> what<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:27.900> do<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.530> I

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
head embedded in the dog what I do is I

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.609 
head embedded in the dog what I do is I
take<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.460> body<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.150> TEC<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:31.140> slowly

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
take the body of the TEC and I slowly

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.850 
take the body of the TEC and I slowly
turn<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.880> twist<00:01:33.270> at<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.780> same<00:01:34.200> time<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.770> I'm

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
turn and twist at the same time that I'm

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.690 
turn and twist at the same time that I'm
gently<00:01:35.430> pulling<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.270> removing<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.350> tick

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
gently pulling and removing the tick

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.330 
gently pulling and removing the tick
this<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.939> great<00:01:39.299> method<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.990> removing<00:01:40.829> the

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
this is a great method of removing the

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.550 
this is a great method of removing the
ticks<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:42.360> only<00:01:42.630> problem<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> lot<00:01:43.500> of

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
ticks the only problem is a lot of

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.950 
ticks the only problem is a lot of
people<00:01:44.009> are<00:01:44.130> squeamish<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:45.450> they<00:01:45.570> don't<00:01:45.780> want

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
people are squeamish and they don't want

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.859 
people are squeamish and they don't want
to<00:01:46.049> touch<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.560> ticks<00:01:47.030> and<00:01:48.030> if<00:01:48.479> that's<00:01:48.659> the

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
to touch the ticks and if that's the

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.190 
to touch the ticks and if that's the
case<00:01:49.159> they<00:01:50.159> make<00:01:50.460> devices<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.869> will<00:01:51.990> help

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
case they make devices that will help

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.950 
case they make devices that will help
you<00:01:52.439> take<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.799> ticks<00:01:53.070> out<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.579> way<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.090> this

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
you take the ticks out this way so this

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.770
