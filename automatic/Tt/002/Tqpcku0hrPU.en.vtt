00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.450
 I have asked for some obviousness to find out why 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:12.030
 a ^ -b = 1 / a ^ b 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.382
 Before giving you this obvious 

00:00:13.382 --> 00:00:17.420
 I want you to realize that this is a definition 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.920
 I do not know 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.950
 The inventor of mathematics was not one person 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.120
 It was just an agreement that had arisen 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.180
 But they knew that 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.634
 And they knew him for several reasons I will explain to you 

00:00:28.634 --> 00:00:30.477
 Well, what I'll explain to you is one of those reasons 

00:00:30.477 --> 00:00:32.593
 And then we will see that it is a good definition 

00:00:32.593 --> 00:00:38.790
 Because when you learn the rules of the fundamentals, all the bases of the other bases will be appropriate to the negative foundations 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.596
 And when a number of forces are also raised 

00:00:41.596 --> 00:00:44.740
 So let us address the positive grounds 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.180
 Because they are intuitive, I think 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:54.200
 If positive grounds, we have a ^ 1, and a ^ 2 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.140
 And a ^ 3, and a ^ 4 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.832
 What is the result of a ^ 1? a ^ 1, as we said earlier, is equal to a 

00:01:01.832 --> 00:01:06.060
 And until we get the output of a ^ 2, what should we do? 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.200
 We hit a, do not we? 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.650
 a ^ 2 is a Ã— a 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.040
 Then a ^ 3, what do we do? 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.160
 We hit a again 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.420
 Then we find a ^ 4, what do we do? 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.920
 We hit a again 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.480
 Or in another way, we can imagine this, we underestimate the value of the exponent, what do you do? 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.560
 Multiply by 1 / a or divide by a 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.140
 Similarly, whenever you reduce, you will divide a 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.479
 To move from a ^ 2 to a ^ 1, divide by a 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.700
 So let's use this sequence to find the output of a ^ 0 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.900
 This is the first difficult issue 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.010
 a ^ 0 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.990
 Suppose you are an inventor of mathematics 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.170
 You need to know the output of a ^ 0 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.420
 As you know, the output will probably be 17 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.100
 I do not know 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.860
 It is up to you to decide what is the output of a ^ 0 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.140
 But would it be good if a ^ 0 followed the same pattern? 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.274
 Any time we underestimate the value of the exponent, we will split on a, do not we? 

00:02:07.274 --> 00:02:11.700
 So, if we move from a ^ 1 to a ^ 0 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.160
 Would it be better if we divided a? 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.189
 Let us do this 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:18.320
 If we move from a ^ 1, ie a 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.078
 And our division on a 

00:02:21.078 --> 00:02:23.848
 So we will move - we will divide on a 

00:02:23.863 --> 00:02:27.235
 How much is a / a product? 

00:02:27.235 --> 00:02:29.730
 Well, it's 1 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:30.994
 If this is the sense - 

00:02:30.994 --> 00:02:37.420
 Or this explains why any number raised to force 0 will equal 1 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.456
 Because you take this number 

00:02:39.456 --> 00:02:43.190
 Divide it on itself one more time, you will get 1 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:44.177
 This is reasonable 

00:02:44.177 --> 00:02:45.890
 But now let's move on to the negative setting 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.891
 So how much product a ^ -1? 

00:02:51.891 --> 00:02:54.410
 Well, again, it would be better if they followed the same system 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.682
 Where each time we subtract from the exponent value, we will divide a 

00:02:57.682 --> 00:03:01.546
 If let 's divide on a again, if 1 / a 

00:03:01.546 --> 00:03:06.140
 Ie we take the output of a ^ 0 and divide it on a 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.610
 a ^ 0 = 1, if the output is 1 / a 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.090
 = 1 / a 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.078
 Now let's do this again 

00:03:13.078 --> 00:03:15.330
 I think later you will understand the pattern 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:16.880
 Well, I think you're already getting it 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.350
 How much is a ^ -2? 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.993
 Well, we want - as you know, it would be silly if the pattern changed now 

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:25.130
 Each time we underestimate the exponent value, we will divide a 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.840
 So we move from a ^ -1 to a ^ -2 

00:03:27.855 --> 00:03:30.470
 Let us divide again on a 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.550
 And what will we get? 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.040
 If we take 1 / a and divide it on a, we will get 1 / a ^ 2 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.146
 This pattern may continue indefinitely 

00:03:39.146 --> 00:03:44.761
 You will still get a ^ -b = 1 / a ^ b 

00:03:44.761 --> 00:03:48.790
 I hope this gives you some of the obviousness to be able to explain why - 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.090
 Well, first, I do not know, the big mystery is, as you know 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.590
 Why are any numbers raised to 0 equals 1? 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.970
 First, keep in mind that this is a definition 

00:03:55.972 --> 00:03:59.134
 Someone decided that this should equal 1, but the reason is good 

00:03:59.134 --> 00:04:02.617
 The reason was to make this pattern sequential 

00:04:02.617 --> 00:04:07.422
 This is also the case for negative grounds 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.654
 It is also good 

00:04:08.654 --> 00:04:13.227
 This pattern does not follow only when we lose the value of the bases, or when we divide on a 

00:04:13.227 --> 00:04:16.138
 Or when we raise the value of the bases, we hit a 

00:04:16.138 --> 00:04:20.457
 But as you see in the base rules, all these rules are repeated 

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:25.574
 All the bases of the bases shall be consistent with this definition of which number is raised to force 

00:04:25.574 --> 00:04:28.472
 And define which number is raised to a negative force 

00:04:28.472 --> 00:04:30.290
 I hope this did not confuse you 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.010
 And gave you some of the obvious and spread anything to you 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.545
 It's puzzling to learn it for the first time
