that was a center defensive mid to send
a<00:00:47.280> mid<00:00:47.430> there<00:00:47.640> but<00:00:47.850> sadly<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.600> wasn't<00:00:48.809> and

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
a mid there but sadly it wasn't and

a mid there but sadly it wasn't and
that's<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.980> bit<00:00:50.100> slow<00:00:50.370> today<00:00:50.430> so<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.910> may<00:00:51.059> take<00:00:51.090> a

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
that's a bit slow today so it may take a

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.810 
that's a bit slow today so it may take a
