 temperate holding the true word 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.119
 I agree with the teachings that he was strong and 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:39.150
 instruct in sound teaching and 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:42.140
 oppose to reprove for there are many 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.720
 and recalcitrant babbler and deceivers 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.640
 especially the cropped 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.450
 what should the mouth block 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.119
 they corrupt whole ladies teach what not 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.640
 must out of shameful self-interest 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:02.460
 of them, one poet himself said 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.820
 Cretans are always liars evil beasts 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.509
 womb lazy evidence this 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:13.170
 fair for this reason reprove them 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:15.920
 strictly so that they are sound in faith 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.590
 disregarding Jewish fables and 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:24.030

 There is nothing pure and unfaithful 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:34.050

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:38.090
 they say they know god and deeds 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:41.760

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.850
 incapable of any good deed 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.300

00:02:51.840 --> 00:03:00.000
 frothy chaste are sound in faith in 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:02.850
