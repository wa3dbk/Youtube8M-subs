00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.720
 Halli hello and welcome to the third 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.420
 Do not follow already from the 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.120
 lonely or in a wonderful series 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.340
 the silver teams are the best silver teams 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.529
 yes, as I put you three today 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.910
 teams at once in front of the stop 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.340
 eyes are so similar 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.140
 that I do not make it three followers 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.240
 but wanted the whole thing in a row 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.529
 packed and I hope that's okay 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.480
 that's why I can not stand up 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.119
 but every single player is concerned 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.369
 is more like a team that's there today 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.860
 is if any of you like it 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.750
 for example, nice patricks unpacks and 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.020
 the whole still in the silver area 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.059
 I would like to join these three teams 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.879
 becomes one of these three teams the three 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.710
 variants I show, but grab 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.829
 Generally they are all relatively equal 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.050
 built that up because yes as I said 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.800
 I decided to do it all 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.530
 just turn it on as a result 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.750
 different teams in gotha ​​putins is 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.600
 always relatively equal in toro rosso 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.290
 we do not drive a leg of the stage 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.409
 presented relatively solid 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.189
 defender but nothing now 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.189
 earth-shattering is German already there 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.650
 better and a gabriel upright 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.570
 intel which is good but unfortunately not 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.220
 work so well but it works 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.869
 abides in borders knows paranormal 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.360
 too good you know her this time 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.570
 defensive position then we have two 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.770
 Outside Arroyo with 15 teams and undulating 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:34.049
 silva yes both are not so mega mega 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.030
 Kassel play integrates but if you 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.670
 once it could really be done with it 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.560
 nice beautiful gate then do the 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.270
 Third, if that's the kess even the 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:48.270
 fourth if the skiff and then another 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:51.810
 vorskla with good willi that would be the whole 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.030
 Rich variations give a little more 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.540
 exhibited on wins is on the 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.060
 top team of a formula yawn ii then 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.030
 right now the shackle I know 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.180
 not 1300 lie v instead 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.360
 zuculini and yes 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.100
 instead of rethinking silver and front 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.600
 it is clear in the intervention 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.480
 final strength but now I want 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.830
 Unfortunately not so many ski moves and 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.030
 Last but not least, the third variant 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:22.130
 she has an aja she is and 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.530
 most creative you want has a league 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.130
 less but in front then then 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.350
 Ravello the little winzling and before that 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.680
 there is still a pretty blatant storm duo with 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:37.970
 pedro pablo hernandez and a lot of shit 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.430
 and luciano viaro also four 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.280
 you had to know all of them 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.530
 meanwhile, these are the three 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.239
 Variations from the team said that first 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.550
 has seen further is really there 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:53.209
 you can be offensive with almost anyone in the 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:56.540
 you want the second team is there for 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:59.000
 if you want but also win 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.800
 So do not want to impossible with the with 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.340
 supposedly to win like ciftci here 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.940
 shows no, but that's the team 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:13.640
 with the volant yes what probably overall 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:16.010
 Seen best adapted to the teams 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.070
 the opponent and so that's it then 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:23.019
 already something where you say that does not look 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:25.400
 quite as bad as I said well 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.410
 and yes, I would like to be any of the three 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.549
 really my favorite team is all 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:34.280
 three really had disadvantages 35 2 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.660
 formation has also been yes I have 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.110
 a bit used to files too 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.519
 But when you are so long 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.930
 mention antec wind quite well with it 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.519
 managed a bit over 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.590
 the outside watch but so much about 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.019
 outside is a whole little one he talks 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.910
 through the middle and there she is 35 2 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.100
 formation with two defensive course 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.620
 still very well placed 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.790
 yes I tried that's not quite 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.019
 as many gates as usual in this one 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.220
 in this video but I tried 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:05.060
 just really only the best 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.799
 Pick out and be a pastor on everyone 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.010
 Fall in to have nice longchamp 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:12.200
 the zuculini theme that's why the gates 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.740
 are relative i hope i look in 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.900
 this case since halt 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.700
 a few nice things are here 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.770
 The best players would say this 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.989
 teams so ciftci is good for me 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:23.940
 liked to have liked how 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.190
 However , it has a great ending 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.270
 that we only really rated 68 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.580
 is 15 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.770
 big hit so really is 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.950
 one of the players from these teams 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:38.220
 mckay stephen was okay too 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:40.680
 yes that was somehow he has not 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.570
 presented as a ship looks civil 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.680
 good with him was surprisingly good, then 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:49.560
 who really played surprisingly well 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.750
 then we come to Arroyo left as 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.490
 said the outside seats not so mega 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.710
 involved in this formation but that 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.110
 But most of the time this is the system 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:02.370
 outside not so responsible for the gates 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.540
 but rather for the wings 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.240
 and so on and then the three 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:09.360
 offensive or so mostly work 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.620
 for goals, but still so strong 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:15.300
 that big very very strong body 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.740
 Ordinary free kick I can resist 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.290
 definitely recommend wellington 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.880
 silva a bit more expensive that was yes 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.900
 I have to go that way in any case 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.850
 number on the right wing 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.340
 try right that betrays itself like that 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.260
 bomb how do you have one another very much 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.330
 strong storm duo again something 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.950
 Greater fellow-India storm as well 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:35.760
 with criminals just a bit much 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:38.250
 Rich and yes defensive always stood 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.020
 relatively stable ultimately most 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.000
 I could then play games with these teams 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:43.980
 still if so we still have 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.440
 I also like it better 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:49.730
 but the players are all relative 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.960
 fast enough with those too 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:55.260
 easy to the wings and gentlemen can 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.300
 and therefore a few nice yes 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.710
 Defensive action can do it today 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.970
 three teams if you liked it 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.320
 I do not want for a rating of 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.400
 I'm happy to see that I am 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.510
 all three teams hopefully the 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.400
 description packer if it is you 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:07.200
 please please do not rate 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.760
 forget and then hopefully 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.450
 be the next video until then 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.450
 people and
