00:00:00.207 --> 00:00:02.069
 - To modify your current fund 

00:00:02.069 --> 00:00:04.278
 For Three Light Frame Frame kit 

00:00:04.278 --> 00:00:06.235
 The issue is simple, namely, cutting the place of two doors into a box 

00:00:06.235 --> 00:00:07.895
 The issue is simple, namely, cutting the place of two doors into a box 

00:00:07.895 --> 00:00:09.575
 So, if you have an old fund 

00:00:09.575 --> 00:00:11.572
 You can use it for frames 

00:00:11.572 --> 00:00:14.204
 The sizes are 147 between the sides 

00:00:14.204 --> 00:00:16.383
 High 150 mm 

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:18.890
 Now, you can increase height if you want 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.223
 It's just a door so you can see the tires 

00:00:22.223 --> 00:00:26.682
 But the size of the width of 147 is the important measurement 

00:00:26.682 --> 00:00:28.599
 The top opening is 152 

00:00:30.303 --> 00:00:32.220
 And 25 mm high 

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:35.012
 You can use a compact disc 

00:00:36.805 --> 00:00:38.571
 To give you a neat rounded edge 

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:41.087
 To follow behind him with a saw of curves 

00:00:41.087 --> 00:00:43.170
 Or anything else round 

00:01:03.576 --> 00:01:06.700
 I think the metal cutting blade cuts better 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.117
 The blade is delicate and beautiful 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.201
 Therefore, the fund will be placed above your current fund 

00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:24.284
 Frames are placed as such 

00:01:29.285 --> 00:01:32.256
 The door to the tools 

00:01:32.256 --> 00:01:36.786
 Door for vision and honey pipes 

00:01:36.786 --> 00:01:39.728
 Now all we need is finishing touches 

00:01:39.728 --> 00:01:41.369
 You need two screws in the back here 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.702
 To install them in place 

00:01:49.896 --> 00:01:53.070
 In order to prevent it from being polluted 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.670
 We will have other frames here at the show 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.481
 And below, inside 

00:01:56.481 --> 00:01:58.175
 We need some other screws 

00:01:58.175 --> 00:02:00.704
 So let's put it here too 

00:02:00.704 --> 00:02:04.329
 Good, lovely, rounded head nail for this 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:05.829
 Which helps him to slide inside 

00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:18.915
 This helps stabilize this frame, 

00:02:18.915 --> 00:02:22.665
 So as not to move from its place, and prevents bees from coming out 

00:02:27.837 --> 00:02:29.748
 And then we need to make two small barriers 

00:02:29.748 --> 00:02:32.276
 To prevent bees from coming out of this small gap here 

00:02:32.276 --> 00:02:35.079
 When you open this door to enter the tires 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.246
 Accordingly, the piece should be pasted there 

00:02:39.168 --> 00:02:43.056
 And a little other piece there, it might be nothing 

00:02:43.056 --> 00:02:47.711
 You can use wood wax frames for other frames 

00:02:47.711 --> 00:02:51.294
 Plastic frames, or any frames you normally use 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:56.552
 And two on the other side as well 

00:03:01.963 --> 00:03:04.865
 So, we now have three flow frame frames 

00:03:04.865 --> 00:03:07.616
 In an ordinary box with eight frames 

00:03:07.616 --> 00:03:10.533
 With two standard frameworks on both sides 

00:03:10.533 --> 00:03:12.547
 Of the three Flow Frames 

00:03:12.547 --> 00:03:14.550
 So I made another piece of wood here 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.300
 To serve as a cover 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.666
 Which fit into the interior as well 

00:03:18.666 --> 00:03:20.134
 We just need to put a handle on it 

00:03:20.134 --> 00:03:22.199
 And some small locksmith tools 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:26.077
 Now, below here, depending on the size of the box 

00:03:26.077 --> 00:03:28.008
 Will end with a gap 

00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:30.446
 We will have to cover this gap 

00:03:30.446 --> 00:03:32.935
 So bees can not get out 

00:03:32.935 --> 00:03:35.802
 This is a piece of wood 

00:03:35.802 --> 00:03:39.969
 They have made it slip down here 

00:03:40.937 --> 00:03:43.543
 And prevent bees from coming out 

00:03:43.543 --> 00:03:45.666
 You can also make a trap for cell beetles 

00:03:45.666 --> 00:03:48.286
 This is what I'll explain to you in the next video 

00:03:48.286 --> 00:03:50.433
 Therefore, because of the piece we set here 

00:03:50.433 --> 00:03:51.958
 The door became a little longer 

00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:54.043
 So, we'll have to remove a few millimeters here 

00:03:54.043 --> 00:03:56.460
 So, we'll have to remove a few millimeters here 

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:07.332
 A simple nail can be placed in the door to be used as a handle 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.310
 It can be made into this shape so you can catch it 

00:04:21.031 --> 00:04:22.583
 Some of the hooks are made of simple suspension 

00:04:22.583 --> 00:04:25.801
 By bending the hook of my eyes 

00:04:25.801 --> 00:04:27.817
 But you can use a nail or piece of wood 

00:04:27.817 --> 00:04:30.035
 Or anything that can rotate on a hub 

00:04:30.035 --> 00:04:32.368
 And fixing the doors in place 

00:04:50.298 --> 00:04:51.834
 Before you put this on your cell 

00:04:51.834 --> 00:04:54.059
 Make sure that the bees will not be able to get out of it 

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:55.031
 Because the last thing you want 

00:04:55.031 --> 00:04:57.957
 Is to open these covers and find bees flying in your face 

00:04:57.957 --> 00:05:00.753
 So make sure here that the bees can not get out at the top here 

00:05:00.753 --> 00:05:02.948
 Make sure he can not get out here 

00:05:02.948 --> 00:05:05.331
 Tires are therefore designed to fit 

00:05:05.331 --> 00:05:09.498
 With the standard box, so you can enjoy honey
