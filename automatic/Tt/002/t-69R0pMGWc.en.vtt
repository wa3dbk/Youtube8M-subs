00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:46.879 
condition still I'm not one to keep
boxes<00:01:40.719> so<00:01:41.049> I'll<00:01:41.979> just<00:01:42.249> rip<00:01:42.490> it<00:01:42.609> open<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:45.209> here

00:01:46.879 --> 00:01:46.889

00:01:56.519 --> 00:01:56.529 
it comes with let's see what this is I

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:59.190 
it comes with let's see what this is I
guess<00:01:57.069> it<00:01:57.279> shows<00:01:57.520> how<00:01:57.849> it<00:01:57.999> moves<00:01:58.240> I<00:01:58.599> guess<00:01:58.929> as

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
guess it shows how it moves I guess as

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.639 
guess it shows how it moves I guess as
you<00:01:59.229> can<00:01:59.499> see<00:01:59.799> and<00:02:00.509> this<00:02:01.509> one<00:02:02.969> again<00:02:03.969> it's<00:02:04.209> all

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
you can see and this one again it's all

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.130 
you can see and this one again it's all
in<00:02:05.649> another<00:02:06.069> language

in another language

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.930 
in another language
I<00:02:08.140> guess<00:02:08.800> this<00:02:08.979> shows<00:02:09.280> you<00:02:09.610> how<00:02:10.179> it<00:02:10.360> moves<00:02:10.630> and

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
I guess this shows you how it moves and

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.570 
I guess this shows you how it moves and
how<00:02:12.940> it's<00:02:13.150> also<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:13.720> do<00:02:13.930> 90-degree<00:02:14.560> turns<00:02:14.860> 180

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
how it's also you do 90-degree turns 180

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.060 
how it's also you do 90-degree turns 180
degree<00:02:15.910> turns

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
degree turns

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.350 
degree turns
on<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:18.160> other<00:02:18.250> side<00:02:18.340> okay<00:02:18.820> so<00:02:18.880> on<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.240> other

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
on the other side okay so on the other

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.460 
on the other side okay so on the other
side<00:02:19.570> as<00:02:19.750> you<00:02:19.840> can<00:02:19.990> see<00:02:20.110> this<00:02:20.260> is<00:02:20.440> a

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
side as you can see this is a

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.290 
with the shape-shifting now as you can
see<00:03:39.690> its<00:03:40.690> shape<00:03:40.959> shifts<00:03:41.350> and<00:03:41.550> that<00:03:42.550> is<00:03:42.910> awesome

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300

I<00:03:43.450> really<00:03:44.260> really<00:03:44.470> enjoy<00:03:44.800> shape-shifting

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
I really really enjoy shape-shifting

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.540 
I really really enjoy shape-shifting
puzzles<00:03:45.760> but<00:03:46.709> when<00:03:47.709> you<00:03:47.830> do<00:03:47.980> shape-shift

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
puzzles but when you do shape-shift

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.190 
puzzles but when you do shape-shift
basically<00:03:49.120> now<00:03:49.269> it's<00:03:49.390> turned<00:03:49.600> into<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:49.870> two<00:03:50.050> by

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
basically now it's turned into a two by

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.960 
basically now it's turned into a two by
two<00:03:50.230> because<00:03:50.709> these<00:03:50.890> extended<00:03:51.489> layers<00:03:51.700> here

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
two because these extended layers here

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.330 
two because these extended layers here
aren't<00:03:52.360> accessible<00:03:52.930> to<00:03:53.140> turn<00:03:53.380> so<00:03:53.980> it's<00:03:54.100> now<00:03:54.310> a

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
aren't accessible to turn so it's now a

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.910 
aren't accessible to turn so it's now a
two<00:03:54.610> by<00:03:55.030> two<00:03:55.090> and<00:03:55.480> you<00:03:56.170> just<00:03:56.590> kinda<00:03:56.769> have<00:03:56.800> to

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
two by two and you just kinda have to

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.290 
two by two and you just kinda have to
get<00:03:57.070> past<00:03:57.310> these<00:03:57.580> blocks<00:03:58.570> here<00:03:59.080> so<00:04:00.269> given<00:04:01.269> that

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
get past these blocks here so given that

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.420 
get past these blocks here so given that
you<00:04:01.959> want<00:04:02.140> to<00:04:02.200> scramble<00:04:02.709> it<00:04:02.800> as<00:04:02.920> a<00:04:02.950> cuboid

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
you want to scramble it as a cuboid

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.100 
you want to scramble it as a cuboid
before<00:04:03.910> you<00:04:04.030> actually<00:04:04.180> shape-shift<00:04:04.780> it<00:04:04.900> so

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
before you actually shape-shift it so

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.960 
before you actually shape-shift it so
let's<00:04:05.709> give<00:04:05.920> it<00:04:05.950> a<00:04:06.070> bit<00:04:06.220> of<00:04:06.340> a<00:04:06.400> scramble<00:04:06.730> here

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
let's give it a bit of a scramble here

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.090 
let's give it a bit of a scramble here
and<00:04:07.810> we'll<00:04:08.019> see<00:04:08.260> what<00:04:08.410> it<00:04:08.500> looks<00:04:08.680> like<00:04:08.769> all

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
and we'll see what it looks like all

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.840 
and we'll see what it looks like all
scrambled<00:04:09.640> up<00:04:10.170> and<00:04:11.170> yes<00:04:11.950> it<00:04:12.130> was<00:04:12.220> very

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
scrambled up and yes it was very

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:19.050 
scrambled up and yes it was very
difficult<00:04:13.180> to<00:04:13.510> turn<00:04:13.900> a<00:04:17.459> couple<00:04:18.459> more<00:04:18.850> here

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
difficult to turn a couple more here

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:23.400 
difficult to turn a couple more here
before<00:04:19.570> I<00:04:19.600> do<00:04:19.780> it<00:04:20.580> just<00:04:21.580> by<00:04:21.730> the<00:04:21.790> fact<00:04:22.180> as<00:04:22.330> I<00:04:22.600> can

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
before I do it just by the fact as I can

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:24.960 
before I do it just by the fact as I can
see<00:04:23.590> that<00:04:23.740> it's<00:04:23.860> a<00:04:23.950> little<00:04:24.160> bit<00:04:24.280> difficult<00:04:24.580> to

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
see that it's a little bit difficult to

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.540 
see that it's a little bit difficult to
scramble<00:04:25.360> because<00:04:25.660> it's<00:04:25.979> it's<00:04:26.979> such<00:04:27.250> a<00:04:27.280> small

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
scramble because it's it's such a small

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.460 
scramble because it's it's such a small
cube<00:04:27.880> that<00:04:28.030> eventually<00:04:28.419> pieces<00:04:28.930> will<00:04:29.140> start

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
cube that eventually pieces will start

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.510 
cube that eventually pieces will start
to<00:04:29.560> go<00:04:29.710> back<00:04:29.919> together

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
to go back together

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.249 
to go back together
so<00:04:31.120> now<00:04:31.270> that<00:04:31.330> it's<00:04:31.509> all<00:04:31.600> I<00:04:31.660> guess<00:04:31.900> I'm<00:04:32.050> going

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:32.259 
so now that it's all I guess I'm going

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:41.870 
so now that it's all I guess I'm going
to<00:04:32.350> go<00:04:32.440> in<00:04:32.620> with<00:04:32.800> the<00:04:32.919> shape-shifting<00:04:33.250> turns

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.920 

now<00:04:42.880> I've<00:04:43.000> never<00:04:43.180> solved<00:04:43.599> one<00:04:43.720> of<00:04:43.750> these

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
now I've never solved one of these

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.920 
now I've never solved one of these
before<00:04:44.080> but<00:04:44.500> I'm<00:04:44.919> guessing<00:04:45.430> that<00:04:45.660> at<00:04:46.660> first

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
before but I'm guessing that at first

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.540 
before but I'm guessing that at first
you<00:04:47.169> probably<00:04:47.199> solved<00:04:47.949> it<00:04:48.069> a<00:04:48.099> little<00:04:48.280> bit<00:04:48.400> like

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
you probably solved it a little bit like

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.360 
you probably solved it a little bit like
a<00:04:48.580> 2x2<00:04:49.229> I'm<00:04:50.229> not<00:04:50.410> sure<00:04:50.590> if<00:04:50.740> I<00:04:50.830> would<00:04:50.889> solve<00:04:51.190> the

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
a 2x2 I'm not sure if I would solve the

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.969 
a 2x2 I'm not sure if I would solve the
middle<00:04:51.610> two<00:04:51.759> first<00:04:52.060> or<00:04:52.300> the<00:04:52.419> n2<00:04:52.930> I'm<00:04:53.560> not<00:04:53.770> sure

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
middle two first or the n2 I'm not sure

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.930 
middle two first or the n2 I'm not sure
about<00:04:54.130> that<00:04:54.310> but<00:04:54.580> I<00:04:54.759> I<00:04:55.750> will<00:04:56.520> get<00:04:57.520> back<00:04:57.669> to<00:04:57.729> you

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
about that but I I will get back to you

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.550 
about that but I I will get back to you
in<00:04:58.180> a<00:04:58.300> little<00:04:58.419> bit<00:04:58.630> because<00:04:58.810> I'm<00:04:59.050> going<00:04:59.139> to

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
in a little bit because I'm going to

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.309 
in a little bit because I'm going to
leave<00:04:59.860> now<00:05:00.069> and<00:05:00.099> go<00:05:00.400> and<00:05:00.699> check<00:05:00.940> it<00:05:01.060> out

00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:01.319 
leave now and go and check it out

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:04.230 
leave now and go and check it out
alright<00:05:02.319> so<00:05:02.500> I<00:05:02.710> played<00:05:03.340> with<00:05:03.490> around<00:05:03.759> us<00:05:04.000> for<00:05:04.150> a

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
alright so I played with around us for a

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.580 
alright so I played with around us for a
while<00:05:04.360> and<00:05:04.570> it's<00:05:04.750> exactly<00:05:04.960> what<00:05:05.259> I<00:05:05.289> thought<00:05:05.530> I

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
while and it's exactly what I thought I

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.770 
while and it's exactly what I thought I
solve<00:05:06.009> it<00:05:06.099> like<00:05:06.190> a<00:05:06.250> two<00:05:06.520> by<00:05:06.669> two<00:05:06.699> using<00:05:07.389> the<00:05:07.419> end

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
solve it like a two by two using the end

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.629 
solve it like a two by two using the end
pieces<00:05:08.110> and<00:05:08.530> then<00:05:08.620> I<00:05:08.650> just<00:05:08.889> solved<00:05:09.190> the<00:05:09.280> middle

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
pieces and then I just solved the middle

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.670 
pieces and then I just solved the middle
ones<00:05:09.840> sometimes<00:05:10.840> when<00:05:11.050> I<00:05:11.080> am<00:05:11.169> solving<00:05:11.440> the

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
ones sometimes when I am solving the

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.409 
ones sometimes when I am solving the
middle<00:05:11.889> ones<00:05:12.070> it<00:05:12.490> screws<00:05:12.849> up<00:05:12.880> the<00:05:13.180> top<00:05:13.389> layer

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
middle ones it screws up the top layer

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:14.909 
middle ones it screws up the top layer
but<00:05:13.630> that's<00:05:13.960> fine<00:05:14.229> you<00:05:14.410> just<00:05:14.440> solve<00:05:14.800> it

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
but that's fine you just solve it

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:16.740 
but that's fine you just solve it
exactly<00:05:15.070> like<00:05:15.460> a<00:05:15.490> keyboard<00:05:15.820> using<00:05:16.300> cuboid

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
exactly like a keyboard using cuboid

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.070 
exactly like a keyboard using cuboid
algorithms<00:05:17.380> and<00:05:17.620> you'll<00:05:17.889> be<00:05:18.009> set<00:05:18.310> in<00:05:18.550> no<00:05:18.789> time

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
algorithms and you'll be set in no time

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.050 
algorithms and you'll be set in no time
so<00:05:20.080> as<00:05:20.560> you<00:05:20.680> can<00:05:20.800> see<00:05:20.860> it<00:05:21.130> turns<00:05:21.370> a<00:05:21.580> lot<00:05:21.759> better

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:22.060 
so as you can see it turns a lot better

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.600 
so as you can see it turns a lot better
now<00:05:22.270> I<00:05:22.509> lubed<00:05:22.780> it<00:05:22.930> with<00:05:23.050> Maru<00:05:23.380> Lube<00:05:23.740> and<00:05:24.070> it's

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
now I lubed it with Maru Lube and it's

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.219 
now I lubed it with Maru Lube and it's
still<00:05:24.820> a<00:05:24.880> little<00:05:25.060> bit<00:05:25.270> stiff<00:05:25.599> I<00:05:25.780> haven't<00:05:26.080> I

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
still a little bit stiff I haven't I

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:27.779 
still a little bit stiff I haven't I
haven't<00:05:26.470> taken<00:05:26.770> it<00:05:26.949> apart<00:05:27.159> to<00:05:27.310> see<00:05:27.340> if<00:05:27.490> I<00:05:27.610> can

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:27.789 
haven't taken it apart to see if I can

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:29.430 
haven't taken it apart to see if I can
pretensions<00:05:28.360> on<00:05:28.509> it<00:05:28.630> or<00:05:28.780> if<00:05:28.930> it's<00:05:29.080> even

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
pretensions on it or if it's even

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.279 
pretensions on it or if it's even
tensional<00:05:29.979> I<00:05:30.099> don't<00:05:30.280> know<00:05:30.400> yet<00:05:30.639> but<00:05:31.630> it<00:05:31.750> is<00:05:31.870> a

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
tensional I don't know yet but it is a

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:34.379 
tensional I don't know yet but it is a
pretty<00:05:32.620> fun<00:05:32.919> puzzle<00:05:33.370> it's<00:05:33.819> not<00:05:34.030> something

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
pretty fun puzzle it's not something

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:35.610 
pretty fun puzzle it's not something
that<00:05:34.419> I'm<00:05:34.599> going<00:05:34.720> to<00:05:34.780> solve<00:05:35.020> all<00:05:35.259> the<00:05:35.380> time

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
that I'm going to solve all the time

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.080 
that I'm going to solve all the time
it's<00:05:35.860> basically<00:05:36.310> probably<00:05:36.520> going<00:05:36.820> to<00:05:36.880> sit<00:05:37.000> on

my shelf as a collector's piece and I'll

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.540 
my shelf as a collector's piece and I'll
solve<00:05:40.570> it<00:05:40.720> once<00:05:41.020> in<00:05:41.199> a<00:05:41.259> while<00:05:41.440> or<00:05:42.070> maybe<00:05:42.099> for

solve it once in a while or maybe for

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
to make videos on how you know all the

algorithms that go along with it I was

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.399 
algorithms that go along with it I was
thinking<00:05:52.060> of<00:05:52.449> doing<00:05:52.570> some<00:05:52.840> videos<00:05:53.080> on<00:05:53.229> that

if<00:05:59.139> you<00:05:59.259> would<00:05:59.409> want<00:05:59.590> me<00:05:59.710> to<00:05:59.740> do<00:06:00.099> like<00:06:00.340> a<00:06:00.370> small

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
if you would want me to do like a small

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.510 
if you would want me to do like a small
little<00:06:01.030> series<00:06:01.389> on<00:06:01.599> understanding<00:06:02.190> the<00:06:03.190> laws

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
little series on understanding the laws

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.029 
little series on understanding the laws
of<00:06:03.550> cue<00:06:04.210> boys<00:06:04.360> and<00:06:04.810> the<00:06:05.080> you<00:06:05.440> know<00:06:05.530> like<00:06:05.889> I<00:06:05.919> said

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:06.039 
of cue boys and the you know like I said

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:08.100 
of cue boys and the you know like I said
the<00:06:06.190> universal<00:06:06.699> algorithms<00:06:07.210> that<00:06:07.719> go<00:06:07.870> along

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
the universal algorithms that go along

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.430 
the universal algorithms that go along
with<00:06:08.139> it<00:06:08.969> I'm<00:06:09.969> not<00:06:10.030> the<00:06:10.330> only<00:06:10.840> the<00:06:11.050> only<00:06:11.289> guy<00:06:11.409> on

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 
with it I'm not the only the only guy on

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.950 
with it I'm not the only the only guy on
YouTube<00:06:11.949> to<00:06:12.130> have<00:06:12.310> that<00:06:12.490> that's<00:06:12.669> for<00:06:12.940> sure<00:06:13.090> but

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
YouTube to have that that's for sure but

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.540 
YouTube to have that that's for sure but
I<00:06:14.020> can<00:06:14.169> definitely<00:06:14.440> give<00:06:14.830> you<00:06:14.919> guys<00:06:15.070> some<00:06:15.520> of

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
I can definitely give you guys some of

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.689 
I can definitely give you guys some of
my<00:06:15.789> opinions<00:06:16.090> on<00:06:16.570> it<00:06:16.719> and<00:06:16.930> some<00:06:17.259> of<00:06:17.289> my<00:06:17.740> ways

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:18.699 
my opinions on it and some of my ways

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:20.070 
my opinions on it and some of my ways
that<00:06:18.880> I<00:06:18.909> do<00:06:19.030> a<00:06:19.150> little<00:06:19.419> bit<00:06:19.599> faster<00:06:19.960> I<00:06:20.050> think

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
that I do a little bit faster I think

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.610 
that I do a little bit faster I think
than<00:06:20.380> some<00:06:20.620> people<00:06:20.740> so<00:06:21.639> that<00:06:22.509> is<00:06:22.719> my<00:06:22.960> review<00:06:23.469> on

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
than some people so that is my review on

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.770 
than some people so that is my review on
this<00:06:23.830> like<00:06:24.520> I<00:06:24.639> said<00:06:24.820> it<00:06:24.969> turns<00:06:25.210> a<00:06:25.330> lot<00:06:25.479> better

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:25.780 
this like I said it turns a lot better

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.350 
this like I said it turns a lot better
now<00:06:26.020> I'm<00:06:26.169> very<00:06:26.229> happy<00:06:26.469> with<00:06:26.889> this<00:06:27.009> puzzle<00:06:27.460> it's

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
now I'm very happy with this puzzle it's

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.480 
now I'm very happy with this puzzle it's
gonna<00:06:28.509> look<00:06:28.719> nice<00:06:28.960> on<00:06:29.199> my<00:06:29.349> shelf<00:06:29.680> but<00:06:30.070> it's<00:06:30.250> not

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
gonna look nice on my shelf but it's not

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.070 
gonna look nice on my shelf but it's not
gonna<00:06:30.789> be<00:06:30.969> one<00:06:31.120> that<00:06:31.150> I<00:06:31.300> solve<00:06:31.599> all<00:06:31.780> the<00:06:31.870> time

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.080 
gonna be one that I solve all the time

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.140 
gonna be one that I solve all the time
like<00:06:32.229> I<00:06:32.380> said<00:06:32.620> alright<00:06:33.430> guys<00:06:33.639> thanks<00:06:34.090> for
