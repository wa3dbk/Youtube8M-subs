00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:13.309
 And today is Akiyama 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:16.960
 Thank you for posting to the free consultation corner 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:26.350
 I want to answer your questions right away 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:29.980
 There are questions from Yasuko-san be doing even under the influence and two-50s women handle 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:37.870
 I read a little sentences I am indebted 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:41.800
 Akiyama teacher seems to have been come fulfill a lot of dreams until now but I'm still the one mocha Asen 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:46.370
 A lot of new dreams come true even at age 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.160
 And I want to go up, but I am still in time 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.340
 Or 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.370
 I have a question 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.660
 Perhaps 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:02.540
 Dream or ability development or desire realization 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:08.679
 I think you also dreams are for the future but there is also a Miruyume by Te dream the desire-fulfilling 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:15.850
 I think is that it is a question that has been received most often a lot until now theme 

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:21.460
 We in a very future serious questions go filled with dream piece doing what my life from this 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:28.820
 Also really really question you started to believe from the bottom of my heart that I wonder if such should 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:31.030
 I think there is an enthusiasm for this kind of enthusiasm I would like to send 30 very much 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.030
 so 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:39.170
 Often 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:44.260
 It has been successful for the past 30 years to realize the image of something positive 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.350
 A thing that has been called out in a field called success philosophy 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.090
 For example 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.090
 It is a book of Dr. Murphy 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.079
 Another such a thing is full spoken in the Toka various this is something this Bashar 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:59.659
 It's gotta 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:02:01.610
 Live like that to win human Tteyuu a lot of medicine in mind that likes a lot of desire 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:07.380
 Space is asking for attitude 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:12.810
 It is the universe was popular really be such a thing that prefer to Bakubaku 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:17.370
 But when I saw the reality, many people were disappointed 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:22.810
 In other words, in this 30 years of popular that kind likely to succeed 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:26.110
 The number of people who are said to be successful people is I have a status quo that has changed little 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:31.450
 2% successful cars in each respective field 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:36.370
 This is a fairly general law, but there is no fact that this law has changed significantly 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.640
 On the contrary , there are people who say that society has been so exhausted since its success philosophy has become popular 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.000
 is not it 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.260
 But this is 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.590
 I have something to imagine 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.330
 It's not the story say it was negative in reverse 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:56.410
 After all it is important 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:58.000
 When everyone wants to get something, they are calm and think that the earth is limited 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.459
 Resource environment 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.970
 So you're going to compete there 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:11.110
 If you have the first image of such a competition, you can not easily get it 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:16.970
 So I feel like I have the image to stop competing 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:23.180
 So I can make my dream come true by pleasing many people 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:25.870
 Or because it is a person who makes dreams come true by being able to make dreams come true 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:30.069
 My dream can come true 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:35.240
 Only by respecting people's freedom can you give me your freedom 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:39.500
 The first to have a competing not the image on which it is based 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.030
 Let me tell you I can get out of the competition karma of the spirit world 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.970
 So Then 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:49.190
 It is said that the power of the soul is radical 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:54.110
 The power at the bottom of our consciousness is the switch from there 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:55.900
 To realize a unique thing that nobody has done because it is basic and no one is basic 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:00.280
 I think 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:04.760
 But I he is a selfish person who is said not that hard to come up with that sort of thing 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:09.560
 But you just have to combine various existing ideas 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:15.680
 To do something that only you can do, to combine what you like and what you like 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:17.120
 So establish something that only you can do with the original t 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.209
 To image 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:24.590
 It is another after it is Ne 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.490
 There are people who say there are lots of dreams, but it's fine if there are many 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.229
 Please give me 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:32.680
 There are a lot of people and there are people who can not be shaped just by coming up with ideas from the next 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:37.750
 Actually there are many people like this 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.229
 I will not work with what you have this talent that there is such a capability that has filled with love 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.229
 There is no 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:49.090
 It's because you don't do it 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:52.700
 Is prioritizing famous work is also a very important Tteyuu squeeze is it that after all now 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:56.570
 For the time being, it is beautiful from the 1st place to the 50th place 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:58.910
 During the incoming line and narrow down after all the famous first place 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:04.700
 We narrow down with top theme at least 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:05.960
 If you narrow down to the top 10 roughly, it is the same task to realize those dreams combinedly 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:12.830
 The 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:13.729
 After all, if you want to fulfill that dream in three years, for example , on a date of three years 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.740
 Allocate 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:20.280
 It is Kagawakaru okay do it what today Once allocated 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:25.849
 For example, it takes 3 million yen to do a shop to do a shop in three years 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:32.659
 You can see how much you should save this month to eat 3 million yen 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:33.980
 So after all the work of the kind of rational thinking was planning also to the realization of a dream very 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:41.600
 I need it 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:47.670
 While spear to walk one little one step at a time while doing exactly such a thing 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:55.320
 But I think it is I'm tight and do not have firmly quite mental in the day-to-day routine work 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:06:01.770
 The mental part is always good in the dream, with the image of the already realized world in mind 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:06.060
 I'll keep the image in. I live in a beautiful room surrounded by nice people 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:11.070
 In a very beautiful location environment 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:14.940
 The very necessary beautiful information comes in. Touch ek own work 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:20.700
 But even nothing in the brochure also in the video even from now I kind of things 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:26.260
 You can experience the Biji Experience What you can not do most by tasting it 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:30.460
 It's such that there is no soba one made of me town of time if I set the kind of image 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:33.910
 I I the success of the image I might hear to this anymore Choi one person so 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:39.880
 When was until about coming Mochokochoko out restlessly in a dream envisioned in my head 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:40.540
 As much as possible, I try to separate myself and concentrate on enjoying my daily routine . 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.830
 Is it 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:48.500
 While enjoying 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:50.169
 That you have tasted dwell the heart to function has already been completed world 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:56.259
 This is important 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:58.590
 I 'm living here to send the red-changed children now It is still China most 

00:06:56.259 --> 00:07:04.569
 I do not do this 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:08.619
 Actually, there are some points and tips to realize the image of success 

00:07:04.569 --> 00:07:12.009
 Also every time there is a question, it will be detailed 

00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:17.919
 Is it the current time? Who do you want to answer ? 

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:22.089
 But after all, hold your eyes first and release it for work 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:23.990
 Because this work is important , it will be shaped when you let go of it 

00:07:22.089 --> 00:07:28.430
 This law is 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:29.960
 It is a law of the mind and the environment of the human being which has been persistently 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:35.720
 Is that okay 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:39.920
 Please hold on first and go to the already completed world in your heart 

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:43.070
 That then taste to enjoy it 

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:47.670
 Too much Do not look forward to as a breast guy 

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:51.480
 It's a body story from your emotions and it takes shape 

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:54.210
 I want that really many people to be free 

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:57.330
 I want many people to be rich 

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:59.870
 I want to be someone new 

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.870
 It was Akiyama
