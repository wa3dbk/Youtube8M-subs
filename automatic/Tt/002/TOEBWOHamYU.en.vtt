00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:08.259
 welcome to the big one 

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:08.259
 nordschleife crossover part of psm 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.980
 this is yamaha yzf r1 m and im 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.480
 reddish one of the fastest on the 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.040
 nordschleife and one of the fastest 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.580
 motorcycles of the year how come the 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.750
 far here with each other clear let yourself 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.309
 say that engine is obviously clear 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.640
 better than the driver but that's yes 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.380
 usual so nowadays yes is natural 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.510
 a great motorcycle what you say the 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.330
 engine roars, the mountains high since 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.610
 this this is the noise was 104 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.830
 no professional it is sensational 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.880
 I have the feeling that the electronics 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.020
 not so one hundred percent like that 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.270
 funny we stretch the we the 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.800
 nordschleife is made but that's it 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.530
 Of course, the motorcycle itself is consistent 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.300
 and no question could be said 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.229
 let's start the amateur like me with the 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.660
 happy on the nordschleife 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.300
 become 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:37.750
 So why not maybe because of me 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.160
 would prefer bmw s1000 xr drive or 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.710
 there will be better start someday 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.789
 the r1 you could do what you want 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.020
 if you take a walk here 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:46.880
 want to go then you can do that with 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.170
 Do your motorcycle if you have 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.420
 want to have a bit of comfort and 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.540
 is and that it's just detention 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.950
 and want to look far from an xr 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.250
 perfect plays for it 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.520
 its ever 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.360
 use costs or just use claim 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.579
 and if you are personally the 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.579
 should take from favorites is what 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.840
 that would be here for the nordschleife 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.870
 vacek almost nothing to say but me 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.450
 I think the DS 1000 would be the 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.720
 works sensational as above 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.400
 all right 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.330
 then a round ride I think 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.330
 you have already revoked
