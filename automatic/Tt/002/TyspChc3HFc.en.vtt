some people you can slide up to five so

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.650 
some people you can slide up to five so
the<00:02:15.360> whole<00:02:15.599> first<00:02:15.870> part<00:02:16.200> should<00:02:16.650> sound<00:02:16.860> like

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.119

out<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.709> timing<00:02:28.920> for<00:02:29.190> yourself<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.880> once<00:02:30.360> you

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
out the timing for yourself and once you

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.720 
out the timing for yourself and once you
understand<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.050> timing<00:02:31.290> it'll<00:02:31.950> fall<00:02:32.519> right
