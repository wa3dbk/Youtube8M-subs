00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:04.279
 We're done, let's finish our title. 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:06.390
 pilots let's hear them 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.560
 very well 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.939
 this on the cover of a photo book 

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:14.509
 The first thing we're going to do is to click on the preview page 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.789
 per page by clicking below 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.680
 in advance page 1 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.289
 page 2 and 3 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.360
 let's advance on every page ten years the driver the way we 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.669
 we wanted 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.419
 note that things are well distributed 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.660
 this book will be inaccurate now as you are seeing in this 

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:37.380
 prior inside the bus 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.600
 he is the most important of all 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.040
 so make sure the complex is always a photobook 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.440
 observing this preview 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.330
 she showed your photo 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.540
 passing from some page of some margin 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.740
 This we'll see soon thereafter. 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.060
 very well 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.210
 I do not think this picture here or there is passing you down a bit. 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.340
 will see once in a while 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.340
 we buy finished 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.340
 the last title already in 2010 this is a title that we arrived here in the cover 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.220
 from our album 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.570
 look that 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.840
 if I had not put the text here 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.610
 forcibly I would have to write a text here 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.100
 the advantage of putting it in the layout 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.920
 Can I customize the color? 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.270
 and the size 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.940
 actually the color 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.460
 and I can customize the background too 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.630
 and to the very important 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.950
 the conclusion 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.710
 even though I have here 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.150
 two deaths one of quality on page 6 medimagem on page 20 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.830
 if you want to leave the stand the way it is, there's no problem 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.080
 but quality notices are important 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.230
 because they show that your photography not only of the company with a quality 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.540
 so good 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.010
 we will observe this warning on page 6 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.010
 the nine of the stage 6 step here 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.450
 this photo here the high level of quality 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.680
 Since then it's not so good 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.850
 let's reduce it 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.630
 ready risk 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.479
 that one will be printed with the quality of the best guarantee for you 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.479
 always notice the quality warnings reduce your photos 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:15.659
 takahashi that do not take adequate 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:20.979
 a very good technique that works if you only have that photograph that 

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:22.129
 great 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.079
 reduces transparency 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.070
 interventions will decrease 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.850
 I think photography is going to look very good is also a technique that 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.039
 You can use 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:33.639
 we try to leave the normal transparency 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:36.169
 and I want this in the quality video 

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:38.099
 sure disappeared 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.159
 now we go on page 27 a margin warning 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:42.770
 also on the subject agents 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.770
 however much it remains to maintain more policing 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.719
 the body of mariana fortis 

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:51.059
 everybody already knows 

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:53.449
 without invading the dotted range 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:55.659
 texana for your turn in march 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:59.549
 you do not have to worry if your goal is to print on the whole page 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:00.739
 a photography 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.559
 now if it is not 

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:04.939
 You can take this warning. 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:09.040
 ney my goal is peace nor do we try to define the way it blows ready 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.250
 Completion save changes ready at once 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.969
 now you will fill in your data would have first and last name phone 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:21.129
 want to export 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:26.180
 here is going to create a master file for printing this asset but there is one that 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.249
 you will send to the website to make your request 

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:32.189
 so you have to do this 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:35.589
 it is always important to make sure that your computer is not changing 

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:36.899
 nothing together 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:40.509
 because if they do they consume a lot of memory from their computer and many are 

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:41.679
 processing 

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:45.179
 I know all the applications let only the deponent open 

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:46.339
 click ok 

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:48.249
 he had the qi again 

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:50.540
 now it will prepare to export 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.779
 this process takes a little 

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:55.779
 So, wait, we'll pause our video. 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.889
 very well 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:05.709
 Good to know it's being closed 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.709
 I say that you are exporting 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.739
 concluding 

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:21.349
 exporting last page ready 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:24.349

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.479
 just as you of these pages as for a year 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:55.360
 this second page that we did not lose was always in white we worry about 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.779
 this here 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:57.710
 W 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.199
 you can observe all the efforts companies lack in them 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:05.309
 all this year with a new 

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:09.409
 the shutdown marked a prior kan announced the company in his book showed 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:10.210
 happy
