00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.670
 the girl today I'm going to make a video 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.110
 about nail elongation using the 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.030
 ahoy 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.240
 This is the stuff I'm going to do is go. 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.190
 everything improvised cup for us to test and 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.099
 see if it really works 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:26.099
 I already did stretching with salt I did not like it 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:28.800
 did not work with wheat flour 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.400
 It worked, this time I'll try. 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.990
 do with the rice I got rice with the 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.540
 world have at home 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:40.380
 I hit the blender until it became 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.770
 flour what you guys see in batico 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:47.700
 I're in the sieve repeatedly tried 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:53.990
 stay close is that I'm going to use the 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:57.080
 rice rubbish here I'm going to use a little brush 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:02.810
 to be able to clean 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:08.100
 if you need one here you have one saved 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:11.910
 a glue base this glue here she 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:16.470
 Your nail is fine if you want 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:18.540

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.909
 pay as well as a super 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:26.760
 bonder only her own lines is a 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:30.300
 being strong here I used a 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:33.659
 milk carton to make the mold that 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.690
 I've already put it here on my fingernail until 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:41.310
 my nail she efe key but she 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:43.350
 break in on outta here you see I 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.700
 I got that lot from the milk carton. 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:51.750
 I made a round that I finished my nail and 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:56.280
 hair all right I closed yet you 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:02:00.000
 See all this stuff value me 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.890
 I only show you step by step that in the 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.290
 my year I'll show you the 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.980
 What am I going to do? 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.920
 I'm going to get a base I'm going to spend here 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:15.530
 at home using risk okay I'll go 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:19.970
 around my fingernail so it does not come 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:23.720
 with the passing is also that around 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:28.040
 with the base just not it can not 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.020
 I'll pass and glue half of it here for me. 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.540
 and I do not want it too big because I do 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.040
 domestic services is very 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.570
 Big for me, it does not even work. 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.340
 little one gets ugly 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.570
 so come on, I'll go get the bag 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.640
 put the flour 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.670
 in the case of that would make the 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:52.459
 Flour rice in here you 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:55.840
 have a notion I will not pass glue place 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:03:01.790
 is rice flour clean with the brush 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:05.420
 play once more to pass glue put 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.120
 draw the flour with the brush and do 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.640
 this same procedure more or less 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.640
 three times I've been born to 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:17.209
 You, girls, I did the procedure. 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:21.920
 that I spoke on eike occasions 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:26.630
 so three times at the base of the nail 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:28.640
 the glue with flour takes out the excess after 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.930
 I did not go, it's all the fourth time. 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:36.260
 once and for all I have already removed the 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:41.299
 She's closing is still very thick. 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:47.660
 here you see I'm going to start leaving 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:51.650
 She lights up the trip. 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:56.660
 rice flour is not sanded 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:58.700
 doing it does not become transparent as the 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.590
 wheat flour wheat flour 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:06.510
 becomes more transparent 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:10.480
 but it gets very hard or hard and full 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.920
 I left a mold that I want to make 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.359
 other areas 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:19.239
 for now after the small monster 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:20.560
 Girls, I'm coming back with my nails. 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:25.300
 made 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:28.300
 It's bad, my rice wedge. 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.190
 I hope you liked it and did not 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.380
 can do as detailed as I can 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.860
 I wanted because I need a support 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.840
 It started there to be able to do even you 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.660
 still but I do not think there's going to be a 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.390
 the basic concept was the same as 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.520
 so help, then you can do it yourself 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.630
 do at home with the products you 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.710
 has 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:52.419
 taeb on good singles hope you guys 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:56.410
 have enjoyed 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:59.370
 this is done in this case a nail 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.370
 stretching done
