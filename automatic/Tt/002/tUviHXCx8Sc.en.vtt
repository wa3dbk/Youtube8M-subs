00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.440
 hello gangsters with you panda I decided 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:11.230
 arrange a classic fight of your favorite 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.700
 midders of millions of people at least 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.829
 about puja for sure you can download 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:18.279
 favorite of millions of people well invoker too 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:20.080
 character is very, very popular it 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.289
 bout puja and invoker of how you already 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.029
 guessed and it is quite obvious of course 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.710
 pooja can be called easier 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.570
 last price rocker but in the end 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.789
 this guy needs to be able to throw the hook 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.590
 some comrades and slopes are clearly not 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.110
 knew how to do it will not show 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.309
 you have a finger from everyone who has some 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.620
 it worked well but 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.390
 invoker chic hero because he 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.760
 stunning versatile and has a huge 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.280
 number of different abilities I think 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.739
 that you yourself know as well as I do 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.920
 as for me directly 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:55.210
 my artifacts were midas most 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.829
 the best the best midas aquila and i 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.109
 decided to farm team artifacts 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.100
 so I took myself a cuirass and took myself 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.260
 live 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.760
 they are not helped in the kneading here 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.259
 increases our survival in my vzgyad 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.100
 they were very nice 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:11.700
 plus i'm a very tricky guy me very 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.520
 it was hard to kill because it was tricky 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.729
 Invoker always has time to go to stealth or 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.869
 at least throw a cold run and run away 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.950
 I played through the cool through ghost wolf and 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.700
 threw 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.740
 just ppd throwing opponents 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.710
 Sunstrike but plus periodically caused 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.060
 fudge to put out 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.939
 the game was interesting in principle 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.090
 equal and it seems to me that such a match 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:42.399
 quite balanced interesting because 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.200
 that pujas can be cool on one side 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.729
 initiate the screen locker's cool 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.210
 other country invoker and by themselves 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.990
 interesting characters a lot of abilities you can 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.829
 experiment with the whole team 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.420
 experiment 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.100
 here we are particularly tried san 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.759
 strikes throw just all the time 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.320
 ppd 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.259
 and given the large number of organs in 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.820
 this team can get good 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.670
 through other options play through 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.470
 cold water and through 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.420
 barges you can just push go up 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.580
 feared meteor business ways 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.259
 shorter interesting match and if you walk 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.830
 among friends of midone it is possible right there 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:17.959
 against invoker of good interesting 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:22.110
 the idea is that in our game the invoker won and 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:24.030
 not without my participation of course in this all 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.730
 me and the rest of the guys on my team 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.430
 played a little bit better than our immediately 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.510
 opponents well and I very much troll 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.310
 puja 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.500
 in the chat probably also affected but to 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.810
 Fortunately, you do not see what I wrote to them 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.730
