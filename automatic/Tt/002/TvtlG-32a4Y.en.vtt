you get something that looks like that

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.790 
you get something that looks like that
because<00:03:28.850> because<00:03:29.850> he<00:03:30.000> does<00:03:30.180> have<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.800> the

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
because because he does have the the

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.229 
because because he does have the the
face<00:03:32.010> paint<00:03:32.340> I<00:03:32.459> think<00:03:32.640> he<00:03:32.700> only<00:03:32.760> has<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.090> face

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
face paint I think he only has the face

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.699 
face paint I think he only has the face
paint<00:03:33.450> in<00:03:33.570> like<00:03:33.750> one<00:03:34.080> episode<00:03:34.470> of<00:03:34.500> two

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
paint in like one episode of two

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.199 
paint in like one episode of two
episodes<00:03:34.830> and<00:03:35.190> he's<00:03:35.340> got<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.489> regular<00:03:35.640> his

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
episodes and he's got the regular his

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.120 
episodes and he's got the regular his
regular<00:03:36.540> face<00:03:36.810> I<00:03:37.019> might<00:03:37.470> probably<00:03:37.650> just<00:03:37.920> have

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
regular face I might probably just have

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.390 
regular face I might probably just have
him<00:03:38.459> with<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.330> the<00:03:40.260> hockey<00:03:40.470> mask<00:03:40.709> on<00:03:40.950> all<00:03:41.190> the

him with the the hockey mask on all the
time

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
time

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.380 
time
I<00:03:42.080> also<00:03:43.080> because<00:03:43.470> it<00:03:43.590> it<00:03:44.070> harks<00:03:44.640> more<00:03:44.910> back<00:03:45.120> to

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
I also because it it harks more back to

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.240 
I also because it it harks more back to
you<00:03:45.810> know<00:03:45.900> Casey<00:03:46.410> Jones<00:03:46.709> in<00:03:46.860> the<00:03:46.950> original

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
you know Casey Jones in the original

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.740 
you know Casey Jones in the original
cartoon<00:03:47.670> which<00:03:48.060> I<00:03:48.120> don't<00:03:48.180> think<00:03:48.360> he<00:03:48.510> ever<00:03:48.540> had

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
cartoon which I don't think he ever had

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.960 
cartoon which I don't think he ever had
his<00:03:49.290> mask<00:03:49.470> off<00:03:49.769> in<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.040> original<00:03:50.280> cartoon<00:03:50.489> it

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
his mask off in the original cartoon it

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.800 
his mask off in the original cartoon it
was<00:03:51.209> always<00:03:51.420> on<00:03:52.580> um<00:03:53.580> as<00:03:53.820> it<00:03:53.910> goes<00:03:54.090> four<00:03:54.360> figures

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
was always on um as it goes four figures

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.949 
was always on um as it goes four figures
he's<00:03:55.410> pretty<00:03:55.890> good<00:03:56.570> surprisingly<00:03:57.570> he<00:03:57.780> has<00:03:57.930> a

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
he's pretty good surprisingly he has a

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.860 
he's pretty good surprisingly he has a
more<00:03:58.260> articulation<00:03:58.890> on<00:03:59.250> him<00:03:59.610> than<00:03:59.820> I<00:03:59.870> expected

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
more articulation on him than I expected

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.500 
more articulation on him than I expected
him<00:04:01.080> to<00:04:01.110> have<00:04:01.340> almost<00:04:02.340> to<00:04:02.550> the<00:04:02.670> level<00:04:03.030> that<00:04:03.060> the

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
him to have almost to the level that the

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.030 
him to have almost to the level that the
turtles<00:04:03.989> have<00:04:04.290> I<00:04:04.620> would<00:04:05.340> say<00:04:06.739> the<00:04:07.739> thing<00:04:07.980> is

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
turtles have I would say the thing is

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.400 
turtles have I would say the thing is
though<00:04:08.370> with<00:04:08.880> the<00:04:09.060> articulation<00:04:09.570> having<00:04:10.290> as

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
though with the articulation having as
