in<00:00:26.130> our<00:00:26.430> Rubicon<00:00:27.800> we're<00:00:28.800> just<00:00:28.949> going<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.099> ride

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
in our Rubicon we're just going to ride

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.130 
in our Rubicon we're just going to ride
over<00:00:29.760> this<00:00:29.880> obstacle<00:00:30.119> with<00:00:30.630> no<00:00:30.869> problem

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
over this obstacle with no problem

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.600 
over this obstacle with no problem
alright<00:00:34.140> now<00:00:34.320> our<00:00:34.350> next<00:00:34.680> obstacle<00:00:35.190> is

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
alright now our next obstacle is

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.600 
alright now our next obstacle is
stability<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:37.200> 30<00:00:37.469> degrees<00:00:37.920> stability<00:00:38.430> wedge

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
stability to 30 degrees stability wedge

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.900 
stability to 30 degrees stability wedge
we're<00:00:38.820> going<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.030> go<00:00:39.090> on<00:00:39.300> our<00:00:39.480> side<00:00:40.910> we're

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
we're going to go on our side we're

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.660 
we're going to go on our side we're
going<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.239> flip<00:00:42.420> right<00:00:42.600> now<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.110> dr.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
going to flip right now is dr.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.810 
going to flip right now is dr.
everything<00:00:44.670> has<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> low<00:00:45.090> center<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.450> gravity

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
everything has a low center of gravity

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.460 
everything has a low center of gravity
pretty<00:00:47.820> cool<00:00:47.940> huh

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:52.470 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.570 

this<00:00:53.470> parts<00:00:53.710> going<00:00:53.800> to<00:00:53.890> get<00:00:53.980> a<00:00:54.010> little<00:00:54.250> bumpy

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
this parts going to get a little bumpy

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:55.830 
this parts going to get a little bumpy
so<00:00:54.640> just<00:00:55.030> hang<00:00:55.210> on

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
so just hang on

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.970 
so just hang on
it's<00:00:56.290> our<00:00:56.410> suspension<00:00:57.810> it<00:00:58.810> was<00:00:59.080> soft<00:00:59.410> coiling

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
it's our suspension it was soft coiling

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.970 
it's our suspension it was soft coiling
suspension<00:01:00.730> with<00:01:00.880> gas-powered<00:01:01.390> shock<00:01:01.980> Savin

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
suspension with gas-powered shock Savin

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.320 
suspension with gas-powered shock Savin
em<00:01:03.100> it's<00:01:03.280> kind<00:01:03.490> of<00:01:03.550> bumpy<00:01:03.730> it's<00:01:04.059> still<00:01:04.300> a

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
em it's kind of bumpy it's still a

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.440 
em it's kind of bumpy it's still a
smooth<00:01:04.690> ride<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:07.510> we<00:01:07.780> have<00:01:07.930> alders<00:01:08.410> coming<00:01:08.890> up

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
smooth ride and we have alders coming up

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.760 
smooth ride and we have alders coming up
and<00:01:10.450> we<00:01:10.540> have<00:01:10.570> a<00:01:10.690> new<00:01:10.900> engine<00:01:11.410> the<00:01:11.740> new

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
and we have a new engine the new

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.380 
and we have a new engine the new
Pentastar<00:01:12.520> 3.6<00:01:13.390> liter<00:01:13.600> v6<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.860> it<00:01:15.160> has<00:01:15.390> 285

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
Pentastar 3.6 liter v6 and it has 285

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.870 
Pentastar 3.6 liter v6 and it has 285
horsepower<00:01:16.420> and<00:01:17.280> 260<00:01:18.280> foot-pounds<00:01:18.310> of<00:01:18.820> torque

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
horsepower and 260 foot-pounds of torque

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.020 
horsepower and 260 foot-pounds of torque
so<00:01:19.870> a<00:01:19.900> lot<00:01:20.140> of<00:01:20.260> power<00:01:20.440> and<00:01:20.890> we<00:01:20.979> get<00:01:21.160> 221<00:01:21.790> miles

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
so a lot of power and we get 221 miles

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.460 
so a lot of power and we get 221 miles
down<00:01:22.420> on<00:01:22.690> the<00:01:22.780> highway

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
down on the highway

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.430 
down on the highway
our<00:01:24.400> completely<00:01:25.360> stock<00:01:25.570> vehicle<00:01:25.780> gets<00:01:26.140> or<00:01:26.290> so

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
our completely stock vehicle gets or so

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.200 
our completely stock vehicle gets or so
no<00:01:26.890> we<00:01:27.100> don't<00:01:27.220> need<00:01:27.280> any<00:01:27.340> modifications<00:01:28.150> to

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
no we don't need any modifications to

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.490 
no we don't need any modifications to
them<00:01:28.510> so<00:01:28.660> if<00:01:28.750> you<00:01:28.840> were<00:01:28.930> to<00:01:29.050> purchase<00:01:29.200> the

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
them so if you were to purchase the

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.650 
them so if you were to purchase the
provide<00:01:29.770> G<00:01:30.040> get<00:01:30.610> one<00:01:30.729> that's<00:01:30.850> trail<00:01:31.180> rated<00:01:31.360> and

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
provide G get one that's trail rated and

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.260 
provide G get one that's trail rated and
you<00:01:31.720> can<00:01:31.869> do<00:01:31.960> this<00:01:32.140> course<00:01:32.350> is<00:01:32.500> no<00:01:32.590> problem

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
you can do this course is no problem

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.510 
you can do this course is no problem
so<00:01:34.270> this<00:01:34.420> right<00:01:34.570> here<00:01:34.660> is<00:01:34.810> articulation<00:01:35.740> with

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
so this right here is articulation with

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.800 
so this right here is articulation with
the<00:01:36.550> Rubicon<00:01:37.090> we<00:01:37.240> have<00:01:37.360> a<00:01:37.390> really<00:01:37.570> cool

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
the Rubicon we have a really cool

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.120 
the Rubicon we have a really cool
feature<00:01:38.080> it's<00:01:38.350> called<00:01:38.560> our<00:01:38.650> sway<00:01:38.890> bar

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
feature it's called our sway bar

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.219 
feature it's called our sway bar
disconnect<00:01:39.160> button<00:01:39.970> so<00:01:40.780> when<00:01:40.869> you<00:01:40.990> go<00:01:41.080> over

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
disconnect button so when you go over

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:42.540 
disconnect button so when you go over
this<00:01:41.320> obstacle<00:01:41.770> with<00:01:42.009> our<00:01:42.130> sway<00:01:42.340> bar

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
this obstacle with our sway bar

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.980 
this obstacle with our sway bar
disconnected<00:01:43.210> it's<00:01:43.360> going<00:01:43.479> to<00:01:43.540> free<00:01:43.750> up<00:01:43.780> our

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
disconnected it's going to free up our

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.350 
disconnected it's going to free up our
suspension<00:01:44.380> and<00:01:44.770> give<00:01:44.890> us<00:01:44.979> 25%<00:01:45.910> greater<00:01:46.060> wheel

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
suspension and give us 25% greater wheel

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.390 
suspension and give us 25% greater wheel
travel<00:01:46.720> so<00:01:47.229> all<00:01:47.350> four<00:01:47.619> of<00:01:47.650> our<00:01:47.830> tires<00:01:48.100> are

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
travel so all four of our tires are

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.160 
travel so all four of our tires are
going<00:01:48.520> to<00:01:48.580> stay<00:01:48.850> in<00:01:48.880> contact<00:01:49.300> with<00:01:49.750> the<00:01:49.900> ground

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
going to stay in contact with the ground

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.910 
going to stay in contact with the ground
it's<00:01:51.100> going<00:01:51.310> to<00:01:51.369> be<00:01:51.490> a<00:01:51.520> different<00:01:52.000> height

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
it's going to be a different height

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.910 
it's going to be a different height
right<00:01:53.920> about<00:01:54.509> we<00:01:55.509> are<00:01:55.630> level<00:01:55.899> inside<00:01:56.440> and<00:01:56.830> all

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
right about we are level inside and all

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.890 
right about we are level inside and all
of<00:01:57.009> our<00:01:57.160> tires<00:01:57.399> are<00:01:57.700> attended

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900
