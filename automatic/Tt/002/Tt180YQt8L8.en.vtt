00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:44.199 
the metal detectors where it says you

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:46.560 
the metal detectors where it says you
need<00:00:44.379> special<00:00:44.830> access<00:00:45.280> or<00:00:45.850> component

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
need special access or component

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.840 
need special access or component
actually<00:00:47.080> and<00:00:47.290> you<00:00:47.949> can<00:00:48.070> put<00:00:48.220> it<00:00:48.309> in<00:00:48.430> there<00:00:48.670> and

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
actually and you can put it in there and

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.090 
actually and you can put it in there and
it'll<00:00:49.629> work<00:00:50.019> it's<00:00:50.260> a<00:00:50.350> free<00:00:50.559> electric<00:00:50.890> barrier

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
it'll work it's a free electric barrier

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.670 
it'll work it's a free electric barrier
I<00:00:51.519> think<00:00:52.180> after<00:00:52.390> the<00:00:52.629> first<00:00:52.839> use<00:00:53.110> it<00:00:53.350> cost<00:00:53.530> a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
I think after the first use it cost a

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.229 
I think after the first use it cost a
thousand<00:00:54.220> but<00:00:54.400> I<00:00:54.430> didn't<00:00:54.729> live<00:00:54.879> long<00:00:54.909> enough

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
thousand but I didn't live long enough

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.560 
thousand but I didn't live long enough
to<00:00:55.809> check<00:00:56.470> it<00:00:56.799> out<00:00:56.920> because<00:00:57.250> I<00:00:57.489> started<00:00:58.449> doing

to check it out because I started doing

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.880 
to check it out because I started doing
other<00:00:58.720> explorations<00:00:59.650> but<00:01:00.549> yeah<00:01:01.540> I<00:01:01.869> hope<00:01:02.739> you

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.770 
know what that is go check it out my
channel<00:01:19.869> it's<00:01:20.170> really<00:01:20.409> cool<00:01:20.880> but<00:01:21.880> I'm<00:01:22.060> going

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
channel it's really cool but I'm going

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.270 
channel it's really cool but I'm going
to<00:01:22.840> get<00:01:22.960> it<00:01:23.020> so<00:01:23.110> we're<00:01:23.229> back<00:01:23.350> in<00:01:23.380> da<00:01:23.619> jump<00:01:24.100> for

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
to get it so we're back in da jump for

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.820 
to get it so we're back in da jump for
joy<00:01:24.310> electric<00:01:24.939> barrier

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.140 

free<00:01:28.830> logic<00:01:29.160> barrier<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:29.760> that's<00:01:29.940> that's

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
free logic barrier so that's that's

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.880 
free logic barrier so that's that's
really<00:01:30.420> cool<00:01:30.600> maybe<00:01:31.440> we<00:01:31.650> can<00:01:31.800> incorporate

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
really cool maybe we can incorporate

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.790 
really cool maybe we can incorporate
that<00:01:32.460> intuitive<00:01:32.790> strategy<00:01:33.690> but<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:33.960> probably

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
that intuitive strategy but I probably

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.580 
that intuitive strategy but I probably
doubt<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.690> anyway<00:01:36.690> I<00:01:36.750> want<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.230> thank<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.470> guys
