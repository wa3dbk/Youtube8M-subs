00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.730
 take a normal sheet in A4 format 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:13.730
 and then alas in two like this 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.769
 open and then at the end on the foot 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.769
 In the center 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.340
 do the same thing on the other side 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.250
 then again towards the center 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.070
 do the same thing on the other side 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.480
 then folded the tip of the end towards 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.900
 inside like these by going over 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.900
 a little bit after 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.750
 walk along the center line 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.450
 now we have to take this part 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.450
 alas foot on the center 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.659
 do the same thing on the other side 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:10.310
 you have to get that folded form in 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.310
 two 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.620
 we 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.360
 now we will create the head at this 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.360
 level 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.050
 no 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.470
 for that makes a crease on the side as 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:40.970
 these and then open the peas is gone 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.890
 outward close pull this 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.849
 part down and then again 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.849
 to get the head 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:56.400
 then you have to make the wings 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:03:05.340
 then from the tip to the top of the 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:14.069
 head is doing the same thing on the other side 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:15.870
 by being as symmetrical as possible and 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.989
 you have finished your glider in shape 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.989
 bird
