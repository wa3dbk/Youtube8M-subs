clay<00:00:12.980> sculpting<00:00:13.640> project<00:00:14.240> in<00:00:14.500> this<00:00:15.500> video<00:00:15.830> I'm

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
clay sculpting project in this video I'm

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:17.439 
clay sculpting project in this video I'm
going<00:00:16.129> to<00:00:16.189> be<00:00:16.279> showing<00:00:16.490> you<00:00:16.730> how<00:00:16.760> I<00:00:16.910> do<00:00:17.119> the

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:17.449 
going to be showing you how I do the

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.760 
going to be showing you how I do the
nose<00:00:17.720> or<00:00:18.500> the<00:00:18.890> front<00:00:19.400> of<00:00:19.550> the<00:00:19.640> snout<00:00:19.880> area<00:00:20.770> it's

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
nose or the front of the snout area it's

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.310 
nose or the front of the snout area it's
all<00:00:21.920> in<00:00:22.070> time-lapse<00:00:22.550> and<00:00:22.900> I<00:00:23.900> really<00:00:24.140> think

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
all in time-lapse and I really think

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.010 
all in time-lapse and I really think
this<00:00:24.470> is<00:00:24.650> coming<00:00:25.190> together<00:00:25.340> pretty<00:00:25.730> nicely

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.020 
this is coming together pretty nicely

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.330 
this is coming together pretty nicely
just<00:00:27.020> with<00:00:27.199> this<00:00:27.289> little<00:00:27.350> bit<00:00:27.680> of<00:00:27.770> defining

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
just with this little bit of defining

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.180 
just with this little bit of defining
that<00:00:28.460> I'm<00:00:28.550> doing<00:00:29.529> starting<00:00:30.529> off<00:00:30.680> I<00:00:30.860> try<00:00:31.130> to

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:31.190 
that I'm doing starting off I try to

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.639 
that I'm doing starting off I try to
correct<00:00:31.880> a<00:00:32.090> little<00:00:32.239> more<00:00:32.539> of<00:00:32.780> the<00:00:32.960> angles<00:00:33.440> of

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
correct a little more of the angles of

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.180 
correct a little more of the angles of
the<00:00:34.219> snout<00:00:35.230> before<00:00:36.230> I<00:00:36.260> get<00:00:36.470> serious<00:00:36.860> in<00:00:37.040> here

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
the snout before I get serious in here

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.819 
the snout before I get serious in here
and<00:00:37.399> then<00:00:37.670> I<00:00:37.700> add<00:00:38.090> the<00:00:38.120> cheeks<00:00:38.630> so<00:00:39.410> I<00:00:39.470> can<00:00:39.649> see

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
and then I add the cheeks so I can see

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:41.920 
and then I add the cheeks so I can see
how<00:00:39.980> everything<00:00:40.280> looks<00:00:40.640> now<00:00:41.390> this<00:00:41.570> is<00:00:41.750> as

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
how everything looks now this is as

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.860 
how everything looks now this is as
simple<00:00:42.230> as<00:00:42.350> it<00:00:42.410> looks<00:00:42.559> I<00:00:43.480> basically<00:00:44.480> folded

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
simple as it looks I basically folded

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.020 
simple as it looks I basically folded
some<00:00:44.989> snakes<00:00:45.290> in<00:00:45.470> half<00:00:45.649> and<00:00:45.890> I<00:00:46.010> cut<00:00:46.220> the<00:00:46.610> ends

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
some snakes in half and I cut the ends

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.299 
some snakes in half and I cut the ends
of<00:00:47.149> them<00:00:47.480> I<00:00:47.630> tapered<00:00:48.079> them<00:00:48.230> to<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:48.559> to<00:00:49.190> the

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
of them I tapered them to the to the

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:49.810 
of them I tapered them to the to the
snout

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
snout

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.000 
snout
then<00:00:50.630> I<00:00:50.719> filled<00:00:50.989> the<00:00:51.170> center<00:00:51.469> of<00:00:51.590> those<00:00:51.739> up

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
then I filled the center of those up

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.880 
then I filled the center of those up
with<00:00:52.219> little<00:00:52.430> pieces<00:00:52.640> of<00:00:52.790> clay<00:00:53.030> and<00:00:53.559> I<00:00:54.559> just

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
with little pieces of clay and I just

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.090 
with little pieces of clay and I just
I'm<00:00:55.460> smoothing<00:00:56.059> everything<00:00:56.469> making<00:00:57.469> you<00:00:57.980> know

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
I'm smoothing everything making you know

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.920 
I'm smoothing everything making you know
cleaning<00:00:58.399> everything<00:00:58.610> up<00:00:58.850> and<00:00:59.570> it's<00:00:59.719> starting

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
cleaning everything up and it's starting

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.329 
cleaning everything up and it's starting
to<00:00:59.989> take<00:01:00.140> shape<00:01:00.200> pretty<00:01:00.739> nicely<00:01:01.010> here<00:01:03.339> doing

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
to take shape pretty nicely here doing

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.960 
to take shape pretty nicely here doing
this<00:01:04.460> nose<00:01:04.810> all<00:01:05.810> I<00:01:05.869> did<00:01:06.560> was<00:01:06.799> I<00:01:06.979> pinched<00:01:07.490> two

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
this nose all I did was I pinched two

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.930 
this nose all I did was I pinched two
pieces<00:01:08.420> of<00:01:08.450> snake<00:01:08.960> two<00:01:09.500> snakes<00:01:09.799> together<00:01:10.040> like

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
pieces of snake two snakes together like

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.649 
pieces of snake two snakes together like
you<00:01:11.090> see<00:01:11.240> right<00:01:11.450> there<00:01:11.479> and<00:01:12.790> I'm<00:01:13.790> using<00:01:14.390> them

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
you see right there and I'm using them

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.120 
you see right there and I'm using them
as<00:01:14.840> guides<00:01:15.760> to<00:01:16.780> kind<00:01:17.780> of<00:01:17.840> create<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:18.770> tip<00:01:18.979> of

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
as guides to kind of create the tip of

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.640 
as guides to kind of create the tip of
the<00:01:19.189> nose<00:01:19.600> cutting<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:20.780> excess<00:01:21.140> off<00:01:21.380> at<00:01:21.560> the

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
the nose cutting the excess off at the

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.399 
the nose cutting the excess off at the
top<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:22.189> then<00:01:22.939> back<00:01:23.119> filling<00:01:23.600> that<00:01:23.869> with<00:01:23.930> more

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
top and then back filling that with more

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.280 
top and then back filling that with more
little<00:01:24.650> pieces<00:01:24.830> of<00:01:25.100> clay<00:01:25.900> smoothing<00:01:26.900> it<00:01:27.049> then

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
little pieces of clay smoothing it then

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.880 
little pieces of clay smoothing it then
you<00:01:27.560> know<00:01:27.680> repairing<00:01:28.280> it<00:01:28.400> doctoring<00:01:28.939> it<00:01:29.060> and

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
you know repairing it doctoring it and

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.670 
you know repairing it doctoring it and
it<00:01:30.890> basically<00:01:31.820> helped<00:01:32.479> me<00:01:32.570> to<00:01:32.960> make<00:01:33.259> the<00:01:33.439> tip

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
it basically helped me to make the tip

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.310 
it basically helped me to make the tip
of<00:01:33.830> the<00:01:33.890> nose<00:01:34.420> kind<00:01:35.420> of<00:01:35.479> bring<00:01:35.689> it<00:01:35.810> into<00:01:35.990> focus

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
of the nose kind of bring it into focus

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.130 
of the nose kind of bring it into focus
so<00:01:37.159> to<00:01:37.220> speak<00:01:37.659> another<00:01:38.659> thing<00:01:38.869> I<00:01:38.960> like<00:01:39.110> to

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159

they are heading to the house now

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.010 
they are heading to the house now
and<00:01:57.850> I'm<00:01:58.850> really<00:01:59.060> really<00:01:59.270> excited<00:01:59.420> about

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
and I'm really really excited about

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.399 
and I'm really really excited about
getting<00:02:00.320> them<00:02:00.619> because<00:02:00.920> they<00:02:01.490> look<00:02:01.520> really

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
getting them because they look really

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.039 
getting them because they look really
really<00:02:03.409> good<00:02:03.590> I<00:02:04.240> think<00:02:05.240> it<00:02:05.390> would<00:02:05.570> really<00:02:05.750> take

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
really good I think it would really take

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.589 
really good I think it would really take
this<00:02:06.229> to<00:02:06.290> another<00:02:06.500> level<00:02:06.710> using<00:02:07.450> tiger<00:02:08.450> eyes

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
this to another level using tiger eyes

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.729 
this to another level using tiger eyes
and<00:02:09.019> they<00:02:09.920> were<00:02:09.979> only<00:02:10.250> eight<00:02:10.670> or<00:02:10.729> nine<00:02:11.000> dollars

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
and they were only eight or nine dollars

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.440 
and they were only eight or nine dollars
so<00:02:12.739> I<00:02:12.980> just<00:02:13.159> couldn't<00:02:13.309> resist<00:02:13.730> I<00:02:13.999> ordered<00:02:14.329> them

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
so I just couldn't resist I ordered them
