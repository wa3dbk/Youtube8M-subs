00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
through this and that rubber band is

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.510 
through this and that rubber band is
going<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.050> take<00:00:49.320> some<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.620> your<00:00:49.739> weight<00:00:50.250> away

from the exercise allowing you to do an

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.580 
from the exercise allowing you to do an
assisted<00:00:54.030> pull-up<00:00:54.390> without<00:00:54.899> having<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.320> rely

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
assisted pull-up without having to rely

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.099 
assisted pull-up without having to rely
on<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.800> Machine<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.280> free-form<00:00:57.180> assisted

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
on the Machine a free-form assisted

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.410 
on the Machine a free-form assisted
pull-up<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.530> far<00:00:58.949> superior<00:00:59.129> so<00:00:59.879> now<00:01:00.030> let's<00:01:00.300> go

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
pull-up is far superior so now let's go

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.000 
pull-up is far superior so now let's go
over<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.660> basics<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.710> actual

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
over the basics this is the actual

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.830 
over the basics this is the actual
pull-up<00:01:02.309> as<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.699> see<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:02.910> put<00:01:03.239> my<00:01:03.359> knee<00:01:03.420> right

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
pull-up as you see I put my knee right

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.140 
pull-up as you see I put my knee right
through<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.199> it's<00:01:04.350> helping<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.100> displace<00:01:05.640> some

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
through it it's helping to displace some

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.969 
through it it's helping to displace some
of<00:01:06.299> my<00:01:06.390> body<00:01:06.659> weight<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.049> then<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.590> just<00:01:07.799> go

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
of my body weight and then I just go

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.219 
of my body weight and then I just go
ahead<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.430> do<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.880> proper<00:01:09.180> pull-up<00:01:09.630> don't

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
ahead and do the proper pull-up don't

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.690 
ahead and do the proper pull-up don't
worry<00:01:10.470> if<00:01:10.680> you've<00:01:10.920> never<00:01:11.100> done<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.430> pull-up

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
worry if you've never done a pull-up

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.219 
worry if you've never done a pull-up
before<00:01:12.030> I'm<00:01:12.240> going<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.479> break<00:01:12.720> down<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.930> form

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229

hard as I can with those hands

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.390 
hard as I can with those hands
so<00:01:39.900> you<00:01:39.990> retract<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.500> shoulder<00:01:40.799> blades<00:01:41.009> you

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
so you retract the shoulder blades you

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.359 
so you retract the shoulder blades you
pull<00:01:41.820> back<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.659> down<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.799> you're<00:01:43.920> coming<00:01:44.159> up

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
pull back and down so you're coming up

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.249 
pull back and down so you're coming up
you<00:01:44.610> explode<00:01:45.060> up<00:01:45.180> keeping<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.780> upright

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
you explode up keeping that upright

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.080 
you explode up keeping that upright
chest<00:01:46.560> position<00:01:46.710> here<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.579> from<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.850> front

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
chest position here it is from a front

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.880 
chest position here it is from a front
angle<00:01:48.360> my<00:01:48.570> chest<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:49.049> up<00:01:49.200> it's<00:01:49.500> pulling

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
angle my chest is up it's pulling

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.490 
angle my chest is up it's pulling
towards<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.939> actual<00:01:51.119> bar<00:01:51.570> my<00:01:51.930> elbows<00:01:52.320> are

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
towards the actual bar my elbows are

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.350

down and my shoulder blades are back
that's<00:01:54.899> how<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.229> probably<00:01:55.680> do<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.979> pull-up

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
that's how you probably do the pull-up

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.219 
that's how you probably do the pull-up
I'm<00:01:56.460> going<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.670> show<00:01:56.790> multiple<00:01:57.360> angles<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.110> the

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
I'm going to show multiple angles so the

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.810 
I'm going to show multiple angles so the
key<00:01:58.439> essential<00:01:58.950> point<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.340> want<00:01:59.579> to<00:01:59.670> mention

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
key essential point I want to mention

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.480 
key essential point I want to mention
however<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:01.200> with<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.649> resistance<00:02:01.799> band<00:02:02.369> the

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
however is with the resistance band the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.160 
however is with the resistance band the
rubber<00:02:02.670> band<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.299> use<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.689> assist<00:02:03.960> with

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
rubber band that you use to assist with

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.780 
rubber band that you use to assist with
the<00:02:04.259> pull-up<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.920> might<00:02:05.189> want<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.460> start<00:02:05.670> off

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
the pull-up you might want to start off

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.389 
the pull-up you might want to start off
with<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.210> heavier<00:02:06.689> rubber<00:02:07.350> band<00:02:07.649> so<00:02:08.039> start<00:02:08.310> off

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
with a heavier rubber band so start off

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.639 
with a heavier rubber band so start off
perhaps<00:02:08.879> with<00:02:09.179> two<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.720> once<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.289> get<00:02:10.410> better

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
perhaps with two and once you get better

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.500 
perhaps with two and once you get better
you<00:02:11.009> could<00:02:11.160> go<00:02:11.370> from<00:02:11.520> there<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:11.879> by<00:02:12.030> two<00:02:12.090> you

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
you could go from there so by two you

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
you could go from there so by two you
know<00:02:12.629> thirty<00:02:12.959> pounds

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
know thirty pounds
