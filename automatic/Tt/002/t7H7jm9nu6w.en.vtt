00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:02.880
 want to introduce the first variant density 

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.070
 Called Havixbeck Beats Solo that sounds maybe very complicated it means 

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.500
 but only the 2 also maintains a percussive effect 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:14.129
 Jan Bast has been playing 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.129
 no trash the Torque a chord so there is one 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.060
 the first game is just the click 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.669
 and this is 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:25.669
 easy to do 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:29.929
 a few 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:32.780
 sda can accomplish with the right hand so that means there are 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.850
 various 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.170
 possibilities 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.550
 in like you have the rights 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.030
 is to generate this war general 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.860
 Sestak is created by the 2 fast with speed 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.560
 the bast sides 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.560
 on the 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.350
 lets open 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.890
 goes away again 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.110
 it will be like this 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.110
 one wishes for oneself and one, so to speak 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.880
 High heels or all 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.020
 hard to bear 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.480
 or at percussion instruments or clapping 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.480
 to imitate 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.600
 I'll show you a variant that consists in it 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.880
 the hand 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.610
 in the wrist cancer that is the movement must be by a rotary motion of the 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.970
 wrist 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.130
 after that, see a variant 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.970
 that arises 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.250
 JÃ¼licher will probably not use her, but not his view 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.020
 fit 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.500
 it arises because of that 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.659
 in the wrist upwards from autumn and then down place 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.700
 So a Klopp movements wrist 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.910
 US showed a move 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.910
 and yes I believe that I use them 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.370
 I would be in the video then 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.270
 can control 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.030
 ice-t is in it 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.160
 who have and indeed 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.160
 uses now takes off and then drops 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.860
 towards the sides 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.410
 Rubiales and looked for that from the best movie or what's best
