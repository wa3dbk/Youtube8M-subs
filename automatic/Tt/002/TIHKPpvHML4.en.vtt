times digital so I mean you can see far

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.720 
times digital so I mean you can see far
away<00:00:53.840> whose<00:00:54.840> numbers<00:00:55.320> it's<00:00:55.949> actually<00:00:56.610> got<00:00:56.699> a

and<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.660> half<00:01:03.719> inches<00:01:04.080> from<00:01:04.140> what<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.409> recall

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
and a half inches from what I recall

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.160 
and a half inches from what I recall
it's<00:01:05.489> touch<00:01:05.729> screen<00:01:05.760> too<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.479> if<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:06.960> want<00:01:07.020> to

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
get to any of the functions there you

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.580 
get to any of the functions there you
can<00:01:08.640> basically<00:01:08.850> just<00:01:09.689> hit<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.260> functions

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
can basically just hit the the functions

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.320 
can basically just hit the the functions
on<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.830> side<00:01:11.040> right<00:01:11.580> now<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:11.729> mean<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.000> visual

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
on the side right now I mean the visual

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.580 
on the side right now I mean the visual
index<00:01:12.600> these<00:01:12.720> are<00:01:12.869> some<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.140> clips<00:01:13.350> that

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590

once<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.400> plug<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.060> into<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.420> base<00:01:42.570> station

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
once you plug this into the base station

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.620 
once you plug this into the base station
this<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.110> where<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.470> magic<00:01:43.860> happens<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.729> so

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
this is where the magic happens and so

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.330 
this is where the magic happens and so
you<00:01:45.689> can<00:01:45.810> get<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.140> right<00:01:46.320> base<00:01:46.979> station

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
you can get that in right base station

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.969 
you can get that in right base station
has<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.520> power<00:01:48.060> cord<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.960> USB<00:01:49.229> 2<00:01:49.530> connector

has the power cord and a USB 2 connector

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.550 
has the power cord and a USB 2 connector
and<00:01:50.450> you'll<00:01:51.450> actually<00:01:51.600> get<00:01:51.840> recognized<00:01:52.380> by

the computer here pretty quickly plug it

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.700 
the computer here pretty quickly plug it
in<00:01:56.159> here<00:01:56.810> and<00:01:57.810> that's<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.170> nice<00:01:58.320> thing<00:01:58.350> all
