that but I'm just going to share with
you<00:00:19.410> all<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:20.070> tips<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.430> tricks<00:00:20.939> we<00:00:21.180> use<00:00:21.210> to

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
you all the tips and tricks we use to

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.820 
you all the tips and tricks we use to
get<00:00:21.779> through<00:00:22.020> this<00:00:22.170> for<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.650> hopefully

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
get through this for it and hopefully

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.920 
get through this for it and hopefully
you<00:00:23.189> can<00:00:23.670> then<00:00:23.820> use<00:00:24.090> them<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.510> get<00:00:24.720> through

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
you can then use them and get through

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.700 
you can then use them and get through
the<00:00:25.050> fort<00:00:25.289> first<00:00:25.650> on<00:00:25.949> yourself<00:00:27.410> so<00:00:28.410> before<00:00:28.560> we

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
the fort first on yourself so before we

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.410 
the fort first on yourself so before we
get<00:00:28.890> into<00:00:29.220> how<00:00:29.400> we<00:00:29.460> actually<00:00:29.670> beat<00:00:29.970> scholars

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
get into how we actually beat scholars

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.790 
get into how we actually beat scholars
I'll<00:00:30.570> just<00:00:30.840> quickly<00:00:31.080> talk<00:00:31.380> for<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.650> moment

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
I'll just quickly talk for a moment

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.459 
I'll just quickly talk for a moment
about<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.579> changes<00:00:33.120> they<00:00:33.540> have<00:00:33.570> made<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:34.290> the

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
about the changes they have made to the

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.340 
about the changes they have made to the
actual<00:00:34.680> scholars<00:00:35.340> fight<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.780> first<00:00:37.020> being

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
actual scholars fight so the first being

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.330 
actual scholars fight so the first being
that<00:00:37.440> they've<00:00:37.649> taken<00:00:37.980> away<00:00:38.520> burns<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:40.340> snipers

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
that they've taken away burns so snipers

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.700 
that they've taken away burns so snipers
Rockets<00:00:42.210> all<00:00:42.360> your<00:00:42.629> weapons<00:00:42.750> with<00:00:43.140> elemental

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
Rockets all your weapons with elemental

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.950 
Rockets all your weapons with elemental
damage<00:00:43.829> are<00:00:44.250> going<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.879> cause<00:00:45.300> less<00:00:45.750> damage

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
damage are going to cause less damage

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.229 
damage are going to cause less damage
than<00:00:46.170> they<00:00:46.410> would<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.920> burn<00:00:47.129> week<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.910> where

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
than they would in a burn week so where

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.540 
than they would in a burn week so where
we<00:00:48.450> were<00:00:48.600> doing<00:00:48.930> eight<00:00:49.170> nine<00:00:49.710> thousand

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
we were doing eight nine thousand

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.790 
we were doing eight nine thousand
upwards<00:00:50.940> we're<00:00:51.690> only<00:00:51.870> going<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.199> be<00:00:52.289> hitting<00:00:52.500> I

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
upwards we're only going to be hitting I

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.490 
upwards we're only going to be hitting I
believe<00:00:53.039> with<00:00:53.340> FX<00:00:53.789> fear<00:00:54.059> or<00:00:54.239> hit<00:00:54.420> 2000<00:00:55.230> without

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
believe with FX fear or hit 2000 without

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.000 
believe with FX fear or hit 2000 without
weapons<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.980> lot<00:00:56.300> 3000<00:00:57.300> with<00:00:58.020> weapons<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.590> lot<00:00:58.739> so

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
weapons a lot 3000 with weapons a lot so

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.069 
weapons a lot 3000 with weapons a lot so
it<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.399> big<00:00:59.760> decrease<00:01:00.300> but<00:01:00.690> they<00:01:00.840> have

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
it is a big decrease but they have

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.869 
it is a big decrease but they have
lowered<00:01:01.590> his<00:01:01.770> health<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.160> compensate<00:01:02.670> for

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
lowered his health to compensate for

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.429 
lowered his health to compensate for
this<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.780> does<00:01:03.930> balance<00:01:04.439> out<00:01:04.680> quite<00:01:05.010> nicely

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
this so it does balance out quite nicely

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.410 
this so it does balance out quite nicely
they've<00:01:07.439> also<00:01:07.740> made<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.760> enemies

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
they've also made it so that the enemies

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.359 
they've also made it so that the enemies
such<00:01:09.630> as<00:01:09.780> shanks<00:01:10.200> captain's<00:01:10.710> etcetera<00:01:11.159> moves

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
such as shanks captain's etcetera moves

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.789 
such as shanks captain's etcetera moves
forward<00:01:11.790> based<00:01:12.119> on<00:01:12.479> damage<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.229> scholars<00:01:13.650> his

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
forward based on damage to scholars his

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.520 
forward based on damage to scholars his
health<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:15.090> can<00:01:15.390> make<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.840> very<00:01:16.020> easy<00:01:16.170> to

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
health so this can make it very easy to

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.679 
health so this can make it very easy to
control<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.250> room<00:01:17.460> what<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.240> mean<00:01:18.390> but<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.630> is

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
control the room what I mean but this is

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.870 
control the room what I mean but this is
if<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.380> know<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.100> poisons<00:01:20.549> about<00:01:20.700> to

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
if you know that the poisons about to

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.539 
if you know that the poisons about to
kick<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:21.210> soon<00:01:21.540> if<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.320> know<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:23.070> mines<00:01:23.369> are

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
kick in soon if you know the mines are

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.280 
kick in soon if you know the mines are
about<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.880> kick<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.240> soon<00:01:24.509> then<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.110> can

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
about to kick in soon then you can

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.260 
about to kick in soon then you can
ignore<00:01:25.439> scholars<00:01:26.189> keep<00:01:26.460> away<00:01:26.759> from<00:01:26.790> him<00:01:27.119> and

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
ignore scholars keep away from him and

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.300 
ignore scholars keep away from him and
clear<00:01:27.900> out<00:01:27.930> some<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.590> enemies<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
clear out some of the enemies in the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.249 
clear out some of the enemies in the
room<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.790> way<00:01:30.360> when<00:01:30.600> you've<00:01:30.720> gotta<00:01:30.930> go<00:01:31.079> for

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
room that way when you've gotta go for

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.690 
room that way when you've gotta go for
the<00:01:31.350> morns<00:01:31.710> you've<00:01:31.860> got<00:01:32.009> less<00:01:32.310> things<00:01:32.610> to

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
the morns you've got less things to

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.190 
the morns you've got less things to
worry<00:01:32.939> about<00:01:33.000> letting<00:01:33.689> stuff<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.200> deal<00:01:34.409> with

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
worry about letting stuff to deal with

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.620 
worry about letting stuff to deal with
and<00:01:36.710> that<00:01:36.890> is<00:01:37.009> what<00:01:37.250> we<00:01:37.280> primarily<00:01:37.700> tried<00:01:38.390> to

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
and that is what we primarily tried to

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.510 
and that is what we primarily tried to
do<00:01:38.840> before<00:01:39.590> it<00:01:39.680> probably<00:01:40.009> could<00:01:40.130> have<00:01:40.159> done<00:01:40.399> a

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
do before it probably could have done a

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.179 
do before it probably could have done a
lot<00:01:40.729> quicker<00:01:40.789> if<00:01:41.119> we<00:01:41.240> went<00:01:41.960> more<00:01:42.380> at<00:01:42.619> skol<00:01:42.979> us

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
lot quicker if we went more at skol us

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.039 
lot quicker if we went more at skol us

then you will need to have all of your

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.219 
then you will need to have all of your
lives<00:01:55.490> keep<00:01:55.819> passing<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.360> talent<00:01:56.689> around<00:01:56.810> as

lives keep passing the talent around as
if<00:01:57.920> someone<00:01:58.369> takes<00:01:58.490> a<00:01:58.700> time<00:01:58.939> from<00:01:59.179> you<00:01:59.420> then

you<00:01:59.899> then<00:02:00.170> become<00:02:00.319> immune<00:02:01.009> so<00:02:01.640> you<00:02:02.000> can't<00:02:02.270> just

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
you then become immune so you can't just

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.179 
you then become immune so you can't just
take<00:02:02.659> it<00:02:02.719> back<00:02:02.929> so<00:02:03.319> you<00:02:03.380> gotta<00:02:03.679> try<00:02:03.950> and<00:02:04.069> keep

to save myself as you can see there so

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.020

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
and then we realized that one of our

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.490 
and then we realized that one of our
fighting<00:02:14.239> was<00:02:14.480> about<00:02:14.660> to<00:02:14.780> go<00:02:14.930> from<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.260> town

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.199 
fighting was about to go from the town
and<00:02:15.739> always<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.010> only<00:02:16.069> want<00:02:16.250> to<00:02:16.340> take<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:16.910> so<00:02:17.180> I

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
and always the only want to take it so I

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.449 
and always the only want to take it so I
used<00:02:17.599> the<00:02:17.720> cell<00:02:17.930> frères<00:02:18.290> nearly<00:02:19.160> didn't<00:02:19.430> make

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
used the cell frères nearly didn't make

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.610 
used the cell frères nearly didn't make
the<00:02:19.730> jump<00:02:19.970> there<00:02:20.269> but<00:02:20.750> managed<00:02:21.049> to<00:02:21.170> quickly

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
the jump there but managed to quickly

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.400 
the jump there but managed to quickly
get<00:02:21.799> to<00:02:21.860> him<00:02:22.160> and<00:02:22.370> absorb<00:02:22.819> the<00:02:22.970> tank<00:02:23.239> so<00:02:23.480> this

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
get to him and absorb the tank so this

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.930

the best way to move around the room as

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.410 
the best way to move around the room as
well<00:02:59.209> was<00:02:59.989> to<00:03:00.230> go<00:03:00.410> from<00:03:01.069> side<00:03:01.519> to<00:03:01.910> side<00:03:01.940> as

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.440 
been taking a lap around the room and I

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
believe at this point we're getting four

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.780 
believe at this point we're getting four
votes<00:03:08.720> to<00:03:08.900> mines<00:03:09.109> you<00:03:09.380> can<00:03:09.530> see<00:03:09.739> there<00:03:10.069> I'm

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
votes to mines you can see there I'm

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.250 
votes to mines you can see there I'm
actually<00:03:11.000> not<00:03:11.389> hitting<00:03:11.690> that<00:03:11.720> much<00:03:12.019> with<00:03:12.230> a

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
actually not hitting that much with a

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.020 
actually not hitting that much with a
sniper<00:03:12.500> you<00:03:13.040> can<00:03:13.310> cause<00:03:13.579> them<00:03:13.790> a<00:03:13.850> lot<00:03:13.970> of

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
sniper you can cause them a lot of

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.069 
sniper you can cause them a lot of
damage<00:03:14.209> it<00:03:14.480> would<00:03:14.600> probably<00:03:14.810> could<00:03:15.049> have

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
damage it would probably could have

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:16.479 
damage it would probably could have
killed<00:03:15.350> him<00:03:15.500> off<00:03:15.650> there<00:03:15.889> if<00:03:15.980> we<00:03:16.010> carried<00:03:16.370> on

really going to be able to send one
person<00:03:21.620> for<00:03:22.099> these<00:03:22.250> mines<00:03:22.519> because<00:03:22.790> you've

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
person for these mines because you've

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.750 
person for these mines because you've
still<00:03:23.329> got<00:03:23.599> to<00:03:23.750> deal<00:03:23.900> with<00:03:24.109> the<00:03:24.260> time<00:03:24.530> and<00:03:24.799> also

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
still got to deal with the time and also

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.819 
still got to deal with the time and also
the<00:03:26.299> time<00:03:26.540> they<00:03:26.750> spawn<00:03:27.019> in<00:03:27.109> the<00:03:27.200> distance<00:03:27.620> way

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
the time they spawn in the distance way

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.800 
the time they spawn in the distance way
they<00:03:28.010> are<00:03:28.160> is<00:03:28.340> best<00:03:29.090> if<00:03:29.299> you<00:03:29.389> can<00:03:29.540> get<00:03:29.690> at<00:03:29.780> least

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
they are is best if you can get at least

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.920 
they are is best if you can get at least
two<00:03:30.290> of<00:03:30.470> your<00:03:30.650> teammates<00:03:30.819> to<00:03:31.819> the<00:03:32.060> mines<00:03:32.269> we

two of your teammates to the mines we

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.080 
two of your teammates to the mines we

actually go for all three together and

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.479 
actually go for all three together and

then back into a safe or nets finished
goalless<00:03:37.700> up<00:03:38.060> but<00:03:38.599> if<00:03:38.690> you<00:03:38.720> get<00:03:39.049> to<00:03:39.260> this<00:03:39.349> point

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
goalless up but if you get to this point

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.440 
goalless up but if you get to this point
in<00:03:39.859> the<00:03:39.950> fight<00:03:40.160> then<00:03:40.459> you<00:03:40.609> nearly<00:03:41.000> done<00:03:41.269> it

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
in the fight then you nearly done it

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.420 
in the fight then you nearly done it
once<00:03:41.900> you<00:03:42.049> get<00:03:42.260> to<00:03:42.290> that<00:03:42.410> second<00:03:42.950> set<00:03:43.099> of<00:03:43.130> mines

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
once you get to that second set of mines

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.150 
once you get to that second set of mines
all<00:03:43.760> you<00:03:43.880> have

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
all you have

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.820 
all you have
to<00:03:44.220> do<00:03:44.370> it<00:03:44.850> work<00:03:45.150> as<00:03:45.390> a<00:03:45.420> team<00:03:45.720> keep<00:03:46.110> sharing<00:03:46.500> and

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
to do it work as a team keep sharing and

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.830 
to do it work as a team keep sharing and

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
passing around that tight and then

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.990 
passing around that tight and then
eventually<00:03:49.080> you<00:03:49.980> have<00:03:50.010> no<00:03:50.340> morons<00:03:50.670> like<00:03:50.760> you

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
eventually you have no morons like you

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.300 
eventually you have no morons like you
can<00:03:51.270> just<00:03:51.300> deal<00:03:51.600> primarily<00:03:52.080> with<00:03:52.440> scholar<00:03:52.980> so

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
can just deal primarily with scholar so

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
up in the phone about getting the ball

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.290 
up in the phone about getting the ball
in<00:04:10.500> a<00:04:10.560> mine<00:04:10.830> which<00:04:11.400> was<00:04:11.580> quite<00:04:11.820> lucky<00:04:12.150> because

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
in a mine which was quite lucky because

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.300 
in a mine which was quite lucky because
we've<00:04:12.570> got<00:04:12.720> a<00:04:12.780> bit<00:04:12.930> of<00:04:12.990> cover<00:04:13.230> here<00:04:13.500> and<00:04:13.710> now<00:04:14.250> we

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
we've got a bit of cover here and now we

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.430 
we've got a bit of cover here and now we
can<00:04:14.700> just<00:04:14.730> focus<00:04:15.090> on<00:04:15.510> bringing<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:16.019> last<00:04:16.230> bit

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
can just focus on bringing the last bit

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.380 
can just focus on bringing the last bit
of<00:04:16.470> scholars<00:04:16.950> his<00:04:17.130> helped<00:04:17.400> out<00:04:17.580> before<00:04:18.239> he

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
of scholars his helped out before he

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.180 
of scholars his helped out before he
spawns<00:04:18.660> in<00:04:18.870> any<00:04:19.140> more<00:04:19.320> enemies<00:04:19.500> for<00:04:19.890> herself

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
spawns in any more enemies for herself

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.860 
spawns in any more enemies for herself
to<00:04:20.400> deal<00:04:20.610> with<00:04:23.450> personally<00:04:24.450> I<00:04:24.510> think<00:04:24.600> before

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
to deal with personally I think before

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.380 
to deal with personally I think before
it's<00:04:25.140> a<00:04:25.260> lot<00:04:25.620> better<00:04:25.800> this<00:04:26.070> way<00:04:26.340> I<00:04:26.640> think<00:04:27.240> it

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
it's a lot better this way I think it

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.510 
it's a lot better this way I think it
will<00:04:27.450> be<00:04:27.510> more<00:04:27.780> accessible<00:04:28.770> to<00:04:29.010> people<00:04:29.190> who

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
will be more accessible to people who

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.640 
will be more accessible to people who
say<00:04:29.550> did<00:04:30.000> not<00:04:30.180> have<00:04:30.270> gala<00:04:30.510> horns<00:04:30.810> before<00:04:31.140> did

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
say did not have gala horns before did

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.500 
say did not have gala horns before did
not<00:04:31.830> have<00:04:32.010> more<00:04:32.250> impact<00:04:32.580> snipers<00:04:33.180> with<00:04:33.480> a

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
not have more impact snipers with a

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.500 
not have more impact snipers with a
certain<00:04:34.050> specs<00:04:34.680> on<00:04:35.010> so<00:04:35.640> I<00:04:35.670> think<00:04:35.940> this<00:04:36.270> way

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
certain specs on so I think this way

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.330 
certain specs on so I think this way
around<00:04:36.840> it's<00:04:37.080> going<00:04:37.260> to<00:04:37.290> be<00:04:37.410> a<00:04:37.440> lot<00:04:37.770> better<00:04:37.830> and

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
around it's going to be a lot better and

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.640 
around it's going to be a lot better and
a<00:04:38.400> lot<00:04:38.520> more<00:04:38.580> enjoyable<00:04:39.030> for<00:04:39.300> everyone

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:39.650 
a lot more enjoyable for everyone

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.540 
a lot more enjoyable for everyone
