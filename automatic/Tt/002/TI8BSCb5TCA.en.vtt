hi everyone this is David from geek toys

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.960 
hi everyone this is David from geek toys
and<00:00:14.960> in<00:00:15.050> this<00:00:15.170> video<00:00:15.410> I'll<00:00:15.950> give<00:00:16.370> you<00:00:16.490> my<00:00:16.670> full

review of the medium eraser x six eight

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.769 
review of the medium eraser x six eight
one<00:00:20.600> three<00:00:20.869> gaming<00:00:21.439> laptop<00:00:21.890> now<00:00:22.700> also<00:00:23.330> in<00:00:23.689> this

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
one three gaming laptop now also in this

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:25.330 
one three gaming laptop now also in this
video<00:00:23.960> I'm<00:00:24.170> going<00:00:24.260> to<00:00:24.380> be<00:00:24.470> running<00:00:24.680> the<00:00:24.950> unit

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.340 
video I'm going to be running the unit

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.970 
video I'm going to be running the unit
in<00:00:25.490> heaven<00:00:25.990> benchmark<00:00:26.990> so<00:00:27.320> you<00:00:27.380> get<00:00:27.530> an<00:00:27.620> idea

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
in heaven benchmark so you get an idea

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.440 
in heaven benchmark so you get an idea
of<00:00:28.039> the<00:00:28.280> actual<00:00:28.400> performance<00:00:28.730> of<00:00:29.300> this

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.450 
of the actual performance of this

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.350 
of the actual performance of this
machine<00:00:29.840> and<00:00:30.220> also<00:00:31.220> look<00:00:31.610> around<00:00:31.910> some<00:00:32.180> of<00:00:32.210> the

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
machine and also look around some of the

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.640 
machine and also look around some of the
ports<00:00:32.720> and<00:00:32.870> connectivity

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
ports and connectivity

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.740 
ports and connectivity
so<00:00:34.489> I'm<00:00:34.550> going<00:00:34.699> to<00:00:34.760> set<00:00:34.940> this<00:00:35.059> running<00:00:35.540> just

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
so I'm going to set this running just

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.000 
so I'm going to set this running just
what<00:00:35.870> I<00:00:35.930> talked<00:00:36.140> a<00:00:36.170> little<00:00:36.379> bit<00:00:36.590> about<00:00:36.710> my

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
what I talked a little bit about my

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.820 
what I talked a little bit about my
thoughts<00:00:37.340> on<00:00:37.640> this<00:00:38.480> laptop<00:00:38.750> now<00:00:39.559> I'm<00:00:39.620> going<00:00:39.770> to

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:39.830 
thoughts on this laptop now I'm going to

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.240 
thoughts on this laptop now I'm going to
run<00:00:40.010> this<00:00:40.190> at<00:00:40.400> full<00:00:40.960> sort<00:00:41.960> of<00:00:42.020> resolution<00:00:42.320> just

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
run this at full sort of resolution just

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.040 
run this at full sort of resolution just
so<00:00:43.310> you<00:00:43.399> get<00:00:43.520> a<00:00:43.579> real<00:00:43.940> feel<00:00:44.390> about<00:00:44.899> the

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
so you get a real feel about the

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.180 
so you get a real feel about the
performance<00:00:45.170> and<00:00:45.680> I<00:00:45.710> will<00:00:45.890> give<00:00:46.040> you<00:00:46.130> a

and<00:01:04.220> a<00:01:04.339> good<00:01:04.580> look<00:01:04.820> around<00:01:04.850> the<00:01:05.270> machine<00:01:05.600> what

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
and a good look around the machine what

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.370 
and a good look around the machine what
I<00:01:06.590> will<00:01:06.890> say<00:01:07.220> is<00:01:07.460> this<00:01:07.580> is<00:01:07.759> a<00:01:07.789> core<00:01:08.180> i7<00:01:08.420> laptop

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
I will say is this is a core i7 laptop

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.510 
I will say is this is a core i7 laptop
it's<00:01:10.220> got<00:01:10.550> plenty<00:01:11.000> of<00:01:11.680> connectivity<00:01:12.680> and<00:01:12.920> it's

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
it's got plenty of connectivity and it's

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.250 
it's got plenty of connectivity and it's
also<00:01:14.000> running<00:01:14.299> I've<00:01:14.540> got<00:01:14.720> a<00:01:14.750> remind<00:01:15.140> myself

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
also running I've got a remind myself

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.250 
also running I've got a remind myself
the<00:01:15.590> exact<00:01:15.860> model<00:01:16.010> number<00:01:16.390> GTX<00:01:17.390> 460<00:01:17.780> and

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
the exact model number GTX 460 and

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.990 
the exact model number GTX 460 and
graphics<00:01:18.860> card<00:01:19.130> with<00:01:19.340> 1<00:01:19.369> and<00:01:19.729> a<00:01:19.760> half

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
graphics card with 1 and a half

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.680 
graphics card with 1 and a half
gigabytes<00:01:20.690> of<00:01:20.930> dedicated<00:01:21.740> video<00:01:22.040> memory<00:01:22.690> so

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
gigabytes of dedicated video memory so

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.359 
gigabytes of dedicated video memory so
anyway<00:01:23.960> let's<00:01:24.170> get<00:01:24.380> this<00:01:24.470> up<00:01:24.650> and<00:01:24.770> running<00:01:24.860> so

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
anyway let's get this up and running so

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.120 
anyway let's get this up and running so
just<00:01:25.580> bear<00:01:25.790> with<00:01:25.820> me<00:01:26.150> while<00:01:26.360> I<00:01:26.420> set<00:01:26.689> this

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
just bear with me while I set this

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.050 
just bear with me while I set this
running<00:01:28.130> we're<00:01:28.250> going<00:01:28.340> to<00:01:28.460> turn<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:28.820> sound

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
running we're going to turn the sound

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.060 
running we're going to turn the sound
off<00:01:29.299> and<00:01:30.290> we're<00:01:30.439> going<00:01:30.560> to<00:01:30.619> set<00:01:30.890> this<00:01:31.010> to

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
off and we're going to set this to

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.460 
off and we're going to set this to
benchmark<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.119> machine<00:01:32.479> so<00:01:33.020> this<00:01:33.200> is<00:01:33.320> now

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
benchmark the machine so this is now

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.050 
benchmark the machine so this is now
going<00:01:33.530> to<00:01:33.799> give<00:01:33.920> us<00:01:34.040> a<00:01:34.159> real<00:01:34.430> good<00:01:34.460> idea<00:01:34.939> in

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
going to give us a real good idea in

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.320 
going to give us a real good idea in
performance<00:01:35.689> now<00:01:36.619> mention<00:01:37.040> connectivity<00:01:37.790> we

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
performance now mention connectivity we

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.210 
performance now mention connectivity we
got<00:01:38.540> Gigabit<00:01:39.049> Ethernet<00:01:39.140> round<00:01:39.680> the<00:01:39.799> back<00:01:39.979> and

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
got Gigabit Ethernet round the back and

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.510 
got Gigabit Ethernet round the back and
also<00:01:40.340> eSATA<00:01:41.060> we<00:01:41.840> also<00:01:42.020> got<00:01:42.320> a<00:01:42.350> couple<00:01:42.500> of<00:01:42.710> USB<00:01:43.009> 3

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
also eSATA we also got a couple of USB 3
