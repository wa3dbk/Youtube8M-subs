 Donald 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:17.400
 that is our problem 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.099
 Tell 3000 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:21.470
 This device is fully automatic 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.759
 so rehearses or 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.569
 when she drives out of the apartment in the morning and starts to act on her 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:29.310
 Apartment velvet 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.419
 recognizes 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.420
 heavy pollution in the apartment due to its sensors 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.880
 Unholy these places are particularly intense 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.050
 in protection he during the day 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.489
 He brings to his NADA stations and docking stations at the 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:46.649
 Spurs lie there and empties during his breaks 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.590
 we have been undergoing a social transformation in recent years 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.480
 we go to leisure people 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.089
 and 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:04.769
 probably therefore more and more time for our professionals 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.049
 important things like cleaning in the household 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.969
 and going on that was the motivation for us to create a system with the 

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:14.829
 one against the annoying house has been completely raffled off housework 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.930
 which is red or silver 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.500
 Today the acceptance is in the domestic area 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.560
 Percent given 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.730
 So here are the people around today already percent too ready due to the 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.180
 Furnishing from the consumer electronics ditty 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.280
 intelligent functions such Bingen 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.789
 In the budget, Thielen told industry 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.130
 is it percent only partially the case so if to the automation 

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:45.870
 going 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.450
 clearly it is the technology 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.120
 but also good systems 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.220
 a of autonomous robotic systems that drive him through minimum rules are available today 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.250
 only limited 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.380
 and that's because the security requirements are very high today 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.710
 if a big machine is moving autonomously then the Captain da fishing Tom 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.290
 a challenge to safety technology and that's what 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.020
 today 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.440
 to make robots not yet appear in the shape of year in the industry like 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.440
 the impulses are already possible 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:21.819
 they are the driving forces for robot op-technology 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.640
 though in the next few years 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.090
 out for development of the automotive industry and dar 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.770
 Consumer electronics then come which are essentially to call the 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.370
 Processors so the towers 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.970
 the machines the EMA 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.559
 become more efficient 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:41.020
 and the sensors are, so to say, the percent sensory organs of the machines 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.370
 Plenty marker more sensitive 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.370
 Euro more accurate and also most carriers in total 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:52.379
 these two percent of components the processors and this summer 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:56.669
 Dogs the sense organs because the machines are becoming increasingly attractive 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:58.609
 let the robot systems 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.999
 always be 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:05.010
 to understand more about their environment Â»and especially to understand the human being 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.299
 for example his criticism Nik 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.579
 Percent and also his instructions will give you better if you are in the future 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.579
 could understand 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.769
 Holter if in the future in particular 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:23.899
 only in the industrial world 

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:26.229
 the work takes over 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:29.579
 Attention that are easy so bring delivery services 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.489
 around 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.489
 but also Teddy me where the robot can play his strengths again 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:36.859
 are percent 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:41.019
 For example, tasks where precision is required which the robot brings 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.309
 Man may not be able to bring to that degree 

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:46.779
 although repeatability, it will always approach the same precision 

00:03:46.779 --> 00:03:49.039
 that that is still or better than the human 

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:52.010
 or even for example, transport of large weights 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.799
 and even the mobile phone of great weight, moreover, humans actually need 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.649
 always new auxiliary system 

00:03:56.649 --> 00:04:00.549
 Percent off per unhealthy but he also has Robert a 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.159
 Per cent clear he will be able to take on these tasks in the future 

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:09.859
 that means that teachers need to focus on us at last 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.809
 the more sophisticated work to take over is the simple one in 

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:15.809
 Future still open 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:22.649
 we will of course be in the future Roberta generations 

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:26.229
 the system is getting more and more into the fighting a bunch 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.999
 Brand the problem of in Minseln. Cheerful divorced in the test vehicle 

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:33.460
 we are trying to integrate more and more sensors so the robot 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.949
 More and more information from the environment has to be processed 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.370
 and percent at easy 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.479
 He is even better able to fulfill his tasks than he is today 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:46.889
 without any problems actually take care of the house so to speak if you 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.270
 not there 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.789
 also in addition or in the future, the injury will not matter so 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:52.190
 the 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.819
 The robot will be networked with its particular home environment 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:00.250
 Per cent of many houses today already have outside net before round and percent 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.180
 Intelligence in the individual components attached in the house that is with Jules 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.719
 just 

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:07.740
 could yes communicate the doors independently on, for example 

00:05:07.739 --> 00:05:10.939
 or if something is not ok in the house so 

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:12.349
 around 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:15.020
 Nana burglar waiter or something similar 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.360
 yes signal to the outside to the phone, for example, KNA min 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.680
 Signal transmission Measurement approx 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.870
 that the owner knows what 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.870
 at home 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:34.970
 So it is important to really invest in your own education 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:39.440
 because the vocation without education was with pace very little education necessary 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.860
 the future will not be the most important, he said 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.650
 Mr. in particular 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.720
 Occupations that require the action level of education are the ones 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.139
 Occupations of the future 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:56.479
 such as while in the technological field lie in the 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:58.759
 Field of electrical engineering of mechanical engineering 

00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:00.169
 that's yes 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:03.169
 DuMont future careers 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:13.650
 SID No that is in Germany is much more restrained than in Asia 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.800
 in the US, for example 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.230
 Gallen research programs research funds 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.940
 handled differently than ten percent in Germany 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.180
 we are also there from his 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.220
 forward 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.660
 Vivier set up research projects and Vitesse note something 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.729
 conservative 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:35.289
 but surprisingly they are not entirely unsuccessful so we want to 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:39.139
 We use what we get obviously very efficiently 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:40.449
 but not us 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:42.659
 not to do it anyway 

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:45.139
 should get more chances so speak 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:47.509
 it would be an open one 

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:49.069
 a 

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:53.759
 Promotion of research program and and more intensive percent promotion 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:56.759
 already highly desirable 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.509
 because quite human learn the factories 

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:06.610
 Helbing never be so at Seymour the honor nobody needs 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.149
 Percent of the machine guarded would have to do machines 

00:07:10.149 --> 00:07:14.709
 yes and the 7 briefly ipv4 evolved or neighbors cared for 

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:16.259
 so 

00:07:16.259 --> 00:07:18.149
 but the trend is towards 

00:07:18.149 --> 00:07:22.229
 Rehearsals hear car with Matti she tion of which will give it in particular 

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:25.229
 Life full of tasks that you can automate 

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:27.330
 the alternative 

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.779
 But it is that we do not produce anymore 

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:34.279
 here in Germany because if we do not go in that 

00:07:34.279 --> 00:07:37.399
 PrÃ¶ll at a certain cost rate then do Sander 

00:07:37.399 --> 00:07:40.399
 So we have to be forced to go the way 

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.340
 then maybe there will still be some increase 

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:49.330
 give 

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.580
 APA at any leads 

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:52.949
 certain stagnation 

00:07:52.949 --> 00:07:56.029
 So, productivity probably gives 

00:07:56.029 --> 00:07:57.449
 is formulated 

00:07:57.449 --> 00:08:00.860
 So reach light and lack of plateau if we are already today 

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:01.909
 very well 

00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:04.749
 and to automate about it 

00:08:04.749 --> 00:08:08.279
 and there will be areas on the Whale that you can not 

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:10.509
 worthwhile to automate where just man 

00:08:10.509 --> 00:08:12.209
 think of the machine for quite a while
