00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.670 
epaulette which is a tab fabric up there
that's<00:01:30.630> what's<00:01:30.900> going<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.079> help<00:01:31.170> make<00:01:31.530> your

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
that's what's going to help make your

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.550 
that's what's going to help make your
shoulders<00:01:32.100> appear<00:01:32.549> wider<00:01:33.030> or<00:01:33.420> straighter<00:01:34.320> if

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
shoulders appear wider or straighter if

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.230 
shoulders appear wider or straighter if
they're<00:01:34.740> very<00:01:34.920> sloping<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.610> want<00:01:35.790> them<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:35.970> go

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
they're very sloping you want them to go

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.190 
they're very sloping you want them to go
more<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:36.720> way<00:01:36.960> instead<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.320> down<00:01:37.950> because

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
more this way instead of down because

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.249 
more this way instead of down because
again<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.430> makes<00:01:41.430> us<00:01:41.670> look<00:01:41.960> taller<00:01:42.960> and

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
again it makes us look taller and

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.710 
again it makes us look taller and
thinner<00:01:43.500> when<00:01:43.770> there's<00:01:44.009> more<00:01:44.399> up<00:01:44.610> here<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.240> if

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
thinner when there's more up here and if

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.630 
thinner when there's more up here and if
