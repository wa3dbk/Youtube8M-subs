00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.650
 hands camp nou chocolate tart 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.660
 the chocolate lovers tart is 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.690
 the beautiful rich 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.470
 let's see the ingredients together 85 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:26.609
 grams of butter 85 grams of sugar a 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:30.240
 egg 25 grams of cocoa 130 grams of 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.630
 flour 00 nice pinch of salt 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:39.380
 nice pinch of yeast 250 ml of cream 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.380
 pastry and 250 billion jaws 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.650
 let's move on to the proceedings 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:55.000
 first let's warm up the 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.000
 cream or boil it 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.820
 proposal that always boils with fire 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.739
 switched on 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.110
 I thought chocolate and we turn 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.290
 quickly to melt it with one 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.290
 whip 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.060
 once the chocolate will be 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.810
 melted we can put out the fire e 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.810
 leave aside 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.070
 meanwhile we prepare the dough of 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:35.929
 pie 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.070
 so we work and soft butter together 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:39.070
 with sugar and vanilla 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.170
 we pass very well that it will not have absorbed 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.170
 most of the sugar 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.170
 so we can also add the egg 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.640
 we then discover the desire for the sea 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.660
 I know you can set a pastry 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.660
 also use a boule 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.580
 at this point we also add the 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.990
 cocoa and yeast flour 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.990
 and we continue to knead 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.580
 to finish we also add some 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.580
 salt as required by the recipe of g 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.049
 once a ball of 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.409
 dough let rest for at least three 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.319
 hours 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:07.420
 I of course didn't make it 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.879
 same only half an hour in the meantime that 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.629
 widened taseer learned we put the two together 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.610
 creams 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:16.180
 I've done the cream before 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.670
 pastry was not advanced right luxury 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.890
 they were 250 grams towards the cream 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.049
 pastry in a bubble yes 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.900
 look for a go then also the ganache al 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.670
 chocolate 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.430
 for this necessary provision 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.709
 gradually mix slowly 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.750
 so 32 creams are not confined to yes 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.849
 mount too much during their union 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.030
 in fact I found a problem 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.709
 during culture the cream swells from 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.720
 too much the strips of is broken 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.290
 cross then I recommend you must 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.629
 be careful in this step 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.890
 after the time needed to give 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:51.379
 the dough 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.560
 let's hear it and position its the 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:57.050
 pan of about 20 centimeters we go to 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.330
 add the two creams 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.940
 we use strips and 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.740
 put in a preheated oven and about 35 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.740
 minutes at 170 degrees 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.910
 try the game was used america 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.700
 I think it's the best cause since 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.820
 chocolate you can ever make me do it 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.840
 know if even the rare ones will read 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.840
 let me know how it happened 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.300
 it will be said to write to the channel for non 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:49.680
