00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.190
 uh hi with you i'm mega here and today i 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.610
 I will tell how for so that in the right 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:34.960
 top corner you could see and everything 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:38.900
 almost characteristic not characteristics but 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.059
 statistics of your computer when playing on 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.920
 as it is loaded and how much of 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:47.210
 lose for how much video card memory 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:50.390
 busy playing how much the processor is clogged and 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:54.320
 let's get down to setting up programs and so 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:01:00.440
 we will need two programs this is rts 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:02.780
 stage what are you there and then they are in 645 460 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.540
 But I already adopted these programs 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.500
 threw off when under the video so go in 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.800
 of the first program we press sung 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.530
 for 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.660
 and run and it will be a little long 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.759
 digging can be like you say 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:22.790
 statistics of your computer is all 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:28.300
 finished it fashionably closed here go 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:31.940
 here you can put those 200 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.850
 milliseconds and and everything seems to go in about 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:40.369
 z d o rt c s see the title 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:44.030
 equally and so i renamed wounds to 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:46.550
 something else you will understand here and here 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.550
 it was a little different written in the morning i 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.929
 I put it then put the first 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.110
 line and first 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:57.860
 then I i chose one processor 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.899
 how much he is clogged mods 2 3 and 4 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.479
 processes here but me alone enough 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:06.369
 yourself then you have too much information and 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:11.120
 leaf through this so we'll wash down 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:14.390
 hdd disks so it is them and reading of record yes 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.310
 Well, it is clear here just from invidia to read 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.290
 and the temperature is wrong I repent yes yes 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.599
 okay go down and see how u 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:28.000
 memorial credit card you so what is it 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:31.720
 this parameter shows how much 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.650
 the game requires memory from the video card 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:40.150
 and then this is our internet but this 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:43.240
 how much is here about this download this is not 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:47.230
 that yes loading is up well of type 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:50.350
 give here all these settings and we 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.770
 here we press ok and now everything is 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:56.220
 showed us and in the game we open 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.190
 here this program give it open 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.510
 the program is the problem is that 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.570
 when you learn the program for some reason 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.730
 some programs do not create shortcuts to 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.340
 the desktop is our program 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:13.600
 it opened for some reason it lies here and 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:16.420
 so here the settings can be changed to 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.510
 Russian is not known well, but here you can 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.640
 never check and here is nothing 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.930
 you should choose it simply because she chose 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:27.730
 chose for fun 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:30.070
 and so here it is responsible for the color and 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:35.500
 indicator but it is there in the game because 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:39.190
 we choose to your taste and color so it 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:42.250
 I'm not so why is there nothing like 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:47.920
 need to touch and you can turn it on 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:50.320
 my yes and here it is in my family and yet 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.840
 not drowned shorter will be such 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.060
 news little black so let's all 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.209
 let's go back to the game and see what 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.390
 we did there and so you see for yourself 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.610
 our performance is the first to crawl 3 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.340
 giga use i have 6 gigs first 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.200
 it is a processor loaded and but it is 1 core 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.040
 but the rest can also be chosen but 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.299
 somehow 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:15.370
 and she second is 188 im afraid how much 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:18.190
 busy video card me 2 gigs to me 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:22.510
 Generally shit on all games here she and 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.310
 the last is fps and who likes it 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.510
