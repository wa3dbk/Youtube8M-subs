00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
the sky and we will call it bolt and for

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.150 
the sky and we will call it bolt and for
our<00:00:30.599> bolt<00:00:30.840> we<00:00:31.080> want<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.380> use<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.769> scratchboard

you really kind of make your hand move

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.100 
you really kind of make your hand move
around<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:45.059> lot<00:00:45.210> that's<00:00:45.480> going<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.719> make<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.870> more

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
around a lot that's going to make a more

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.779 
around a lot that's going to make a more
interesting<00:00:46.379> lightning<00:00:46.920> bolt<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.460> something

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
interesting lightning bolt so something

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.270 
interesting lightning bolt so something
like<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:48.210> works<00:00:49.190> want<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.370> try<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.610> be<00:00:50.879> a

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
like that works want it to try to be a

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.110 
like that works want it to try to be a
little<00:00:53.280> more<00:00:53.340> angular<00:00:53.789> rather<00:00:54.210> than<00:00:54.449> smooth

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
little more angular rather than smooth

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.689 
little more angular rather than smooth
so<00:00:57.120> I'm<00:00:57.210> really<00:00:57.329> just<00:00:57.510> kind<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:58.550> whittling<00:00:59.550> my

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
so I'm really just kind of whittling my

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.330 
so I'm really just kind of whittling my
hand<00:01:00.000> as<00:01:00.210> I'm<00:01:00.359> drawing<00:01:00.660> now<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.920> trick<00:01:02.190> to

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
hand as I'm drawing now the trick to

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.310 
hand as I'm drawing now the trick to
making<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.699> glow<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.449> we<00:01:03.600> want<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.899> duplicate

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
making this glow is we want to duplicate

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.750 
making this glow is we want to duplicate
this<00:01:04.500> layer<00:01:04.619> twice<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.339> I'm<00:01:05.430> going<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.640> right

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
this layer twice so I'm going to right

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.390 
this layer twice so I'm going to right
click<00:01:05.790> on<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.299> go<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.510> duplicate<00:01:07.020> layer

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
click on it and go to duplicate layer

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.920 
click on it and go to duplicate layer
I'm<00:01:08.400> gonna<00:01:08.580> do<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.790> one<00:01:08.909> more<00:01:08.939> time<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.630> we'll

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
I'm gonna do it one more time and we'll

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.100 
I'm gonna do it one more time and we'll
call<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.729> bolt<00:01:12.229> glow<00:01:13.229> one<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:14.479> a<00:01:15.479> bolt<00:01:15.689> glow

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
call this bolt glow one and a bolt glow

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.859 
call this bolt glow one and a bolt glow
two<00:01:16.280> we'll<00:01:17.280> set<00:01:17.610> both<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.880> these<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.390> screen

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
two we'll set both of these to screen

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.770 
two we'll set both of these to screen
for<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.830> composite<00:01:20.340> method<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.970> then<00:01:21.659> now

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
for the composite method and then now

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.039 
for the composite method and then now
we'll<00:01:21.960> just<00:01:22.170> hide<00:01:22.350> these<00:01:22.560> layers<00:01:22.860> temporarily

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
we'll just hide these layers temporarily

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.080 
we'll just hide these layers temporarily
go<00:01:25.049> back<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.470> bolt<00:01:25.680> layer<00:01:25.920> we<00:01:26.790> will<00:01:26.939> go<00:01:27.030> to

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
go back to the bolt layer we will go to

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.510 
go back to the bolt layer we will go to
effects<00:01:28.070> focus<00:01:29.360> soften<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:31.100> we<00:01:32.100> want<00:01:32.340> to

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
effects focus soften and we want to

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.679 
effects focus soften and we want to
apply<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:33.619> one-point<00:01:34.619> somewhere<00:01:35.610> around<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:36.030> 1.8

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
apply a one-point somewhere around a 1.8

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.850 
apply a one-point somewhere around a 1.8
or<00:01:36.720> 1.7<00:01:38.210> circular<00:01:39.210> blur<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.259> just<00:01:40.439> blurs<00:01:40.650> it

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
or 1.7 circular blur so it just blurs it

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.819 
or 1.7 circular blur so it just blurs it
a<00:01:40.920> little<00:01:41.100> bit<00:01:42.110> makes<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.290> look<00:01:43.439> more<00:01:43.649> like

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
a little bit makes it look more like

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.370 
a little bit makes it look more like
glowing<00:01:44.250> light<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.939> then<00:01:45.509> we'll<00:01:45.659> unhide<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
glowing light and then we'll unhide the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.340 
glowing light and then we'll unhide the
bolt<00:01:46.799> glow<00:01:47.159> one<00:01:47.850> layer<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.479> we<00:01:49.049> will<00:01:49.200> go<00:01:49.290> to

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
bolt glow one layer and we will go to

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.910 
bolt glow one layer and we will go to
effects<00:01:49.950> focus<00:01:50.729> soften<00:01:51.540> again<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:52.860> time

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
effects focus soften again and this time

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.280 
effects focus soften again and this time
we<00:01:53.340> will<00:01:53.460> increase<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.240> radius<00:01:54.420> until<00:01:54.899> you

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
we will increase the radius until you

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.819 
we will increase the radius until you
see<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:55.850> halo<00:01:57.200> surrounding<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.530> lightning

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
see this halo surrounding the lightning

00:01:58.829 --> 00:01:59.959 
see this halo surrounding the lightning
bolt<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.100> don't<00:01:59.219> want<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.460> be<00:01:59.579> too<00:01:59.759> big<00:01:59.939> so

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
bolt you don't want it to be too big so

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.499 
bolt you don't want it to be too big so
I'm<00:02:00.270> going<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.450> use<00:02:00.630> seven<00:02:01.020> point<00:02:01.259> nine<00:02:02.509> there

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
I'm going to use seven point nine there

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.020 
I'm going to use seven point nine there
we<00:02:03.600> have<00:02:03.719> our<00:02:03.899> first<00:02:04.200> halo<00:02:04.649> we<00:02:05.520> will<00:02:05.700> unhide

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
we have our first halo we will unhide

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.910 
we have our first halo we will unhide
the<00:02:06.240> bolt<00:02:06.420> glow<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.750> layer<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.469> we'll<00:02:07.619> apply

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
the bolt glow to layer and we'll apply

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
the bolt glow to layer and we'll apply
another<00:02:08.369> effects<00:02:08.940> focus<00:02:09.629> soften<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:11.670> we<00:02:11.790> will

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
another effects focus soften and we will

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.460 
another effects focus soften and we will
make<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.209> radius<00:02:12.510> even<00:02:12.930> bigger

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
make the radius even bigger

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.070 
make the radius even bigger
something<00:02:14.470> like<00:02:14.620> that<00:02:15.450> now<00:02:16.450> we<00:02:16.510> will<00:02:16.690> turn<00:02:16.930> on

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
something like that now we will turn on

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.950 
something like that now we will turn on
preserve<00:02:17.470> transparency<00:02:17.770> and<00:02:18.700> select<00:02:19.510> the

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
preserve transparency and select the

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.310 
preserve transparency and select the
bolt<00:02:20.440> glow<00:02:20.830> one<00:02:21.130> layer<00:02:21.450> we<00:02:22.450> will<00:02:22.570> use<00:02:22.930> the

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
bolt glow one layer we will use the

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.270 
bolt glow one layer we will use the
scratchboard<00:02:23.710> tool<00:02:24.240> to<00:02:25.240> fill<00:02:25.450> this<00:02:25.630> with

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
scratchboard tool to fill this with

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.470 
scratchboard tool to fill this with
maybe<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.690> purple<00:02:28.690> color<00:02:28.840> like<00:02:29.200> this<00:02:30.360> see<00:02:31.360> how

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
maybe a purple color like this see how

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.020 
maybe a purple color like this see how
this<00:02:31.630> looks<00:02:31.870> it<00:02:32.110> gives<00:02:32.140> it<00:02:32.380> a<00:02:32.440> bit<00:02:32.530> of<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.740> glow

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
this looks it gives it a bit of a glow

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.670 
this looks it gives it a bit of a glow
go<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.210> bolt<00:02:34.390> glow<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.720> layer<00:02:35.110> and<00:02:35.470> we'll

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
go to the bolt glow to layer and we'll

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.220 
go to the bolt glow to layer and we'll
select<00:02:35.950> maybe<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:36.790> blue<00:02:37.390> like<00:02:37.660> this

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
select maybe a blue like this

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.370 
select maybe a blue like this
and<00:02:39.630> then<00:02:40.630> you<00:02:40.780> can<00:02:40.930> use<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.230> digital

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
and then you can use the digital

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.780 
and then you can use the digital
airbrush<00:02:41.950> if<00:02:42.190> you<00:02:42.310> want<00:02:42.550> to<00:02:43.030> kind<00:02:43.270> of<00:02:43.450> vary<00:02:44.080> the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
airbrush if you want to kind of vary the

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.140 
airbrush if you want to kind of vary the
color<00:02:45.790> of<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.090> lightning<00:02:46.450> bolt<00:02:46.660> glow<00:02:48.000> so<00:02:49.000> for

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
color of the lightning bolt glow so for

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.580 
color of the lightning bolt glow so for
instance<00:02:49.450> I<00:02:49.540> used<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:49.780> little<00:02:49.930> bit<00:02:50.020> of<00:02:50.200> red<00:02:50.350> and

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
instance I used a little bit of red and

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.780 
instance I used a little bit of red and
then<00:02:50.680> will<00:02:50.770> use<00:02:50.890> a<00:02:50.980> little<00:02:51.220> bit<00:02:51.430> of<00:02:51.550> yellow

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
then will use a little bit of yellow

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.940 
then will use a little bit of yellow
there<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:52.209> now<00:02:52.300> there's<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.600> kind<00:02:52.900> of<00:02:52.959> rainbow

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
there and now there's a kind of rainbow

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.130 
there and now there's a kind of rainbow
effect<00:02:54.640> going<00:02:54.970> on<00:02:55.240> through<00:02:55.600> this<00:02:55.690> lightning

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
effect going on through this lightning

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.410 
effect going on through this lightning
bolt<00:02:56.170> here<00:02:56.670> now<00:02:57.670> when<00:02:57.880> you're<00:02:58.000> done<00:02:58.150> with<00:02:58.330> your

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
bolt here now when you're done with your

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.640 
bolt here now when you're done with your
lightning<00:02:58.660> bolt<00:02:58.990> you<00:02:59.140> can<00:02:59.170> go<00:02:59.380> ahead<00:02:59.470> and

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
lightning bolt you can go ahead and

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.260 
lightning bolt you can go ahead and
select<00:02:59.830> all<00:03:00.100> of<00:03:00.160> the<00:03:00.370> bolt<00:03:00.580> layers<00:03:00.850> together

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
select all of the bolt layers together

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.360 
select all of the bolt layers together
and<00:03:02.880> you<00:03:03.880> can<00:03:04.180> merge<00:03:04.810> them<00:03:05.170> into<00:03:05.380> a<00:03:06.070> single

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
and you can merge them into a single

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.150 
and you can merge them into a single
layer<00:03:06.700> want<00:03:07.330> to<00:03:07.420> make<00:03:07.570> it<00:03:07.780> a<00:03:07.959> screen<00:03:08.380> composite

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
layer want to make it a screen composite

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.100 
layer want to make it a screen composite
method<00:03:09.310> again<00:03:09.730> so<00:03:10.360> that<00:03:10.510> it<00:03:10.630> blends<00:03:10.840> up<00:03:11.020> the

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
method again so that it blends up the

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.020 
method again so that it blends up the
background<00:03:11.560> more<00:03:11.709> naturally<00:03:12.280> and<00:03:12.490> then<00:03:12.790> turn

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
background more naturally and then turn

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.090 
background more naturally and then turn
off<00:03:13.060> preserve<00:03:13.540> transparency<00:03:13.840> and<00:03:14.620> create<00:03:15.070> a

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
off preserve transparency and create a

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.430 
off preserve transparency and create a
mask<00:03:15.490> because<00:03:16.030> we<00:03:16.180> want<00:03:16.360> to<00:03:16.450> mask<00:03:16.780> off<00:03:17.050> some<00:03:17.320> of

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
mask because we want to mask off some of

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.930 
mask because we want to mask off some of
the<00:03:17.500> upper<00:03:17.739> edge<00:03:17.920> so<00:03:18.250> it<00:03:18.400> looks<00:03:18.580> like<00:03:18.670> it's

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
the upper edge so it looks like it's

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.720 
the upper edge so it looks like it's
covered<00:03:19.300> by<00:03:19.330> the<00:03:19.510> cloud<00:03:20.040> so<00:03:21.040> make<00:03:21.400> sure<00:03:21.430> you're

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
covered by the cloud so make sure you're

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.050 
covered by the cloud so make sure you're
in<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:21.970> mask<00:03:22.180> select<00:03:22.780> black<00:03:23.080> and<00:03:23.470> then<00:03:24.280> select

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
in the mask select black and then select

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.870 
in the mask select black and then select
the<00:03:25.650> digital<00:03:26.650> airbrush<00:03:27.040> tool<00:03:27.310> and<00:03:27.700> then<00:03:27.850> just

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
the digital airbrush tool and then just

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.140 
the digital airbrush tool and then just
paint<00:03:28.800> along<00:03:29.800> the<00:03:29.980> edge<00:03:30.160> a<00:03:30.190> little<00:03:30.400> bit<00:03:30.640> here

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
paint along the edge a little bit here

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.990 
paint along the edge a little bit here
to<00:03:31.300> make<00:03:31.450> it<00:03:31.570> look<00:03:31.690> like<00:03:31.810> it's<00:03:31.989> kind<00:03:32.260> of

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
to make it look like it's kind of

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.210 
to make it look like it's kind of
covered<00:03:34.000> up<00:03:34.260> just<00:03:35.260> in<00:03:35.380> a<00:03:35.440> couple<00:03:35.739> little<00:03:35.890> spots

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
covered up just in a couple little spots

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.820 
covered up just in a couple little spots
there<00:03:36.690> now<00:03:37.690> we<00:03:37.810> want<00:03:37.989> to<00:03:38.080> put<00:03:38.200> a<00:03:38.230> little<00:03:38.410> bit<00:03:38.530> of

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
there now we want to put a little bit of

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.650 
there now we want to put a little bit of
a<00:03:38.950> glow<00:03:39.280> where<00:03:39.610> it's<00:03:39.790> popping<00:03:40.300> out<00:03:40.510> of<00:03:40.540> the

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
a glow where it's popping out of the

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.470 
a glow where it's popping out of the
cloud<00:03:40.900> there<00:03:41.170> so<00:03:41.440> we'll<00:03:41.590> create<00:03:41.830> a<00:03:41.950> new<00:03:42.070> layer

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
cloud there so we'll create a new layer

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.210 
cloud there so we'll create a new layer
we'll<00:03:43.480> call<00:03:43.660> it<00:03:43.840> bolt<00:03:44.200> glow

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
we'll call it bolt glow

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.610 
we'll call it bolt glow
we'll<00:03:45.519> set<00:03:45.850> the<00:03:46.060> composite<00:03:46.600> method<00:03:46.750> to<00:03:47.170> screen

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
we'll set the composite method to screen

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.420 
we'll set the composite method to screen
and<00:03:48.130> we'll<00:03:48.850> select<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.570> glow<00:03:49.870> brush<00:03:50.440> we'll

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
and we'll select the glow brush we'll
