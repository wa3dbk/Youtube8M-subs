accurately<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.410> course<00:00:25.590> because<00:00:25.769> ultimately

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
accurately of course because ultimately

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.650 
accurately of course because ultimately
those<00:00:26.369> are<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:26.519> two<00:00:26.640> things<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.449> really

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
those are the two things that you really

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.210 
those are the two things that you really
are<00:00:27.810> looking<00:00:27.930> for<00:00:28.289> with<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.650> voice<00:00:28.800> assistant

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
are looking for with the voice assistant

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.320 
are looking for with the voice assistant
so<00:00:29.400> let's<00:00:29.519> go<00:00:29.609> ahead<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.880> start<00:00:30.029> our<00:00:30.179> first

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
so let's go ahead and start our first

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.150 
so let's go ahead and start our first
test<00:00:30.570> ask<00:00:30.960> for<00:00:31.260> something<00:00:31.410> like<00:00:31.619> weather

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:42.110 

what's<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.309> weather<00:00:35.489> like<00:00:40.640> so<00:00:41.640> we<00:00:41.760> got<00:00:41.940> the

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
what's the weather like so we got the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.389 
what's the weather like so we got the
weather<00:00:42.329> forecasts<00:00:42.870> on<00:00:43.079> both<00:00:43.379> one<00:00:43.680> loaded<00:00:44.309> up

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
weather forecasts on both one loaded up

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.920 
weather forecasts on both one loaded up
a<00:00:44.520> little<00:00:44.730> bit<00:00:44.879> faster<00:00:45.000> on<00:00:45.270> Siri<00:00:45.570> than<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.840> did

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
a little bit faster on Siri than it did

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.380 
a little bit faster on Siri than it did
on<00:00:45.989> s<00:00:46.230> voice<00:00:46.440> but<00:00:46.770> pretty<00:00:47.129> good<00:00:47.340> for<00:00:48.030> both<00:00:48.210> of

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
on s voice but pretty good for both of

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.790 
on s voice but pretty good for both of
them<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:48.539> let's<00:00:48.989> go<00:00:49.079> ahead<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.230> ask<00:00:49.410> another

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
them so let's go ahead and ask another

00:00:49.800 --> 00:01:00.760 
them so let's go ahead and ask another
question<00:00:50.930> who<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.469> president<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.070> Brazil

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.619 

got<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.920> answer<00:01:02.160> here<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.850> we<00:01:03.359> got<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
got the answer here and we got the

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.479 
got the answer here and we got the
answer<00:01:03.660> here<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.799> splits<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.280> maybe

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
answer here so this is splits that maybe

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.280 
answer here so this is splits that maybe
a<00:01:05.549> second<00:01:05.909> or<00:01:05.970> two<00:01:06.030> faster<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:06.780> series<00:01:07.110> than<00:01:07.200> it

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
a second or two faster on series than it

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.160 
a second or two faster on series than it
is<00:01:07.409> on<00:01:07.619> s<00:01:08.189> voice<00:01:08.510> and<00:01:09.510> that's<00:01:09.689> been<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.960> theme

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
is on s voice and that's been the theme

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.539 
is on s voice and that's been the theme
I<00:01:10.320> mean<00:01:10.439> generally<00:01:10.740> when<00:01:11.040> I'm<00:01:11.130> using<00:01:11.310> both

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
I mean generally when I'm using both

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.880 
I mean generally when I'm using both
these<00:01:11.670> guys<00:01:11.820> I've<00:01:12.150> noticed<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.680> Siri<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.860> a

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
these guys I've noticed that Siri is a

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.560 
these guys I've noticed that Siri is a
little<00:01:14.189> bit<00:01:14.310> faster<00:01:14.640> especially<00:01:14.970> when<00:01:15.420> you're

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
little bit faster especially when you're

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.420 
little bit faster especially when you're
actually<00:01:15.689> having<00:01:16.500> them<00:01:16.590> closed<00:01:16.830> out<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.280> for

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
actually having them closed out so for

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.310 
actually having them closed out so for
example<00:01:17.820> further<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.450> actually<00:01:18.750> close<00:01:19.049> s

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
example further to actually close s

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.170 
example further to actually close s
voice<00:01:19.590> out<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.100> background<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.640> try<00:01:21.119> it

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
voice out in the background and try it

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.810 
voice out in the background and try it
again<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.659> let's<00:01:21.780> try<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.930> same<00:01:22.170> question<00:01:22.820> so

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
again so let's try the same question so

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.130 
again so let's try the same question so
I'll<00:01:24.119> just<00:01:24.360> tap<00:01:24.630> this<00:01:24.810> guy<00:01:26.840> who<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:27.990> the

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
I'll just tap this guy who is the

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.780 
I'll just tap this guy who is the
president<00:01:28.590> of<00:01:28.710> Brazil<00:01:32.990> okay<00:01:34.400> so<00:01:35.400> we<00:01:35.520> got<00:01:35.610> the

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
president of Brazil okay so we got the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.160 
president of Brazil okay so we got the
answer<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.570> can<00:01:36.659> see<00:01:36.750> this<00:01:36.869> time<00:01:37.049> was

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
answer and you can see this time was

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.859 
answer and you can see this time was
taking<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.439> little<00:01:37.680> bit<00:01:37.799> longer<00:01:38.570> that's<00:01:39.570> been

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
taking a little bit longer that's been

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.030 
taking a little bit longer that's been
the<00:01:39.960> general<00:01:40.079> thing<00:01:40.409> but<00:01:40.560> go<00:01:40.680> ahead<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:40.920> ask

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
the general thing but go ahead and ask

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.840 
the general thing but go ahead and ask
it<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.310> make<00:01:41.850> us<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.210> reminder<00:01:43.549> remind<00:01:44.549> me<00:01:44.670> to

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
it to make us a reminder remind me to

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:54.469 
it to make us a reminder remind me to
walk<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.270> dog<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.740> 37<00:01:46.740> minutes<00:01:53.030> so<00:01:54.030> both<00:01:54.329> of

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
walk the dog in 37 minutes so both of

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.639 
walk the dog in 37 minutes so both of
them<00:01:54.600> seem<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.810> work<00:01:54.990> correctly<00:01:55.170> I'm<00:01:55.530> gonna

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
them seem to work correctly I'm gonna

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.330 
them seem to work correctly I'm gonna
hit<00:01:55.740> cancel<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.740> suppose<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:58.920> pretty<00:01:59.100> quick

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
hit cancel and I suppose is pretty quick

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.590 
hit cancel and I suppose is pretty quick
they're<00:01:59.549> pretty<00:01:59.969> much<00:02:00.060> open<00:02:00.329> at<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.450> same

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
they're pretty much open at the same

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.990 
they're pretty much open at the same
time<00:02:00.810> suited<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:01.409> that's<00:02:01.649> pretty<00:02:01.799> good<00:02:02.009> let's

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
time suited so that's pretty good let's

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.330 
time suited so that's pretty good let's
ask<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.479> something<00:02:03.689> like<00:02:03.979> for<00:02:04.979> movie<00:02:05.219> show

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
ask it something like for movie show

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.720 
ask it something like for movie show
times<00:02:05.579> nearby<00:02:05.880> so<00:02:07.129> movie<00:02:08.129> show<00:02:08.369> times<00:02:08.670> nearby

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.490 

I<00:02:11.760> found<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.629> Weatherby<00:02:13.050> theaters<00:02:15.260> so<00:02:16.260> we<00:02:16.379> got

so<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:24.090> could<00:02:24.420> tell<00:02:24.629> you<00:02:25.050> can<00:02:25.170> speak<00:02:25.319> a<00:02:25.379> little

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
so you could tell you can speak a little

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.960 
so you could tell you can speak a little
bit<00:02:25.590> more<00:02:25.769> naturally<00:02:26.129> to<00:02:26.250> Siri<00:02:26.459> than<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:26.700> can

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
bit more naturally to Siri than you can

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.839 
bit more naturally to Siri than you can
to<00:02:27.420> s<00:02:27.720> voice<00:02:28.340> let's<00:02:29.340> try<00:02:29.489> one<00:02:29.670> more<00:02:29.700> thing

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
to s voice let's try one more thing

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.620 
to s voice let's try one more thing
let's<00:02:30.300> say<00:02:31.250> when<00:02:32.250> was<00:02:32.550> Martin<00:02:33.330> Luther<00:02:33.480> King

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
let's say when was Martin Luther King

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:41.259 
let's say when was Martin Luther King
born<00:02:33.840> so<00:02:34.790> when<00:02:35.790> was<00:02:36.000> Martin<00:02:36.360> Luther<00:02:36.569> King<00:02:36.810> born

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.440 

and<00:02:42.379> you<00:02:43.379> can<00:02:43.500> see<00:02:43.650> Siri<00:02:43.920> is<00:02:44.220> voting<00:02:44.700> not<00:02:45.330> we

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
and you can see Siri is voting not we

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.330 
and you can see Siri is voting not we
static<00:02:45.780> transcription<00:02:46.380> got<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.830> answer<00:02:47.130> on

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
static transcription got the answer on

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.600 
static transcription got the answer on
theory<00:02:47.700> and<00:02:48.290> now<00:02:49.290> we<00:02:49.349> got<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.709> answer<00:02:50.040> on<00:02:50.220> s4

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
theory and now we got the answer on s4

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.430 
theory and now we got the answer on s4
so<00:02:50.819> means<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.480> see<00:02:51.690> how<00:02:51.780> both<00:02:51.989> of<00:02:52.170> them<00:02:52.260> work

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
so means you see how both of them work

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.170 
so means you see how both of them work
they're<00:02:52.680> pretty<00:02:52.860> good<00:02:53.130> obviously<00:02:53.940> if<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:54.060> do

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
they're pretty good obviously if you do

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.759 
they're pretty good obviously if you do
certain<00:02:54.360> things<00:02:54.480> like<00:02:54.690> say<00:02:55.140> I'm<00:02:55.260> drunk<00:02:55.620> on

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
certain things like say I'm drunk on

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.800 
certain things like say I'm drunk on
Siri<00:02:56.340> it'll<00:02:56.610> probably<00:02:56.849> understand<00:02:57.630> what<00:02:57.750> I'm

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
Siri it'll probably understand what I'm

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.900 
Siri it'll probably understand what I'm
saying<00:02:57.989> it'll<00:02:58.200> ask<00:02:58.319> you<00:02:58.590> know<00:02:58.709> for<00:02:59.130> me<00:02:59.640> to<00:02:59.760> call

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
saying it'll ask you know for me to call

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.080 
saying it'll ask you know for me to call
a<00:02:59.940> taxi<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.450> CL<00:03:00.660> responds<00:03:01.049> on<00:03:01.230> s<00:03:01.349> voice<00:03:02.090> I'm

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
a taxi the CL responds on s voice I'm

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:10.370 
a taxi the CL responds on s voice I'm
drunk<00:03:08.120> so<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:09.900> can<00:03:09.989> see<00:03:10.079> it<00:03:10.140> gives<00:03:10.230> me<00:03:10.319> an

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
drunk so you can see it gives me an

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.080 
drunk so you can see it gives me an
option<00:03:10.470> called<00:03:10.769> taxi<00:03:11.190> nothing<00:03:11.700> happens<00:03:12.030> here

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
option called taxi nothing happens here

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.309 
option called taxi nothing happens here
in<00:03:12.329> s<00:03:12.420> voice<00:03:12.709> let's<00:03:13.709> try<00:03:13.860> something<00:03:14.040> else<00:03:14.280> like

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
in s voice let's try something else like

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.920 
in s voice let's try something else like
asking<00:03:16.319> it<00:03:16.440> how<00:03:16.560> it's<00:03:16.769> doing<00:03:17.600> how<00:03:18.600> are<00:03:18.630> you

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
asking it how it's doing how are you

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:26.000 
asking it how it's doing how are you
doing<00:03:23.720> so<00:03:24.720> both<00:03:25.079> of<00:03:25.109> them<00:03:25.319> give<00:03:25.500> actually<00:03:25.980> I

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
doing so both of them give actually I

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.650 
doing so both of them give actually I
like<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.250> answer<00:03:26.489> over<00:03:26.609> here<00:03:26.760> on<00:03:27.060> s<00:03:27.450> voice

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
like the answer over here on s voice

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.379 
like the answer over here on s voice
more<00:03:27.930> but<00:03:28.609> both<00:03:29.609> of<00:03:29.639> them<00:03:29.850> worked<00:03:30.060> pretty<00:03:30.209> well

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
more but both of them worked pretty well

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.020 
more but both of them worked pretty well
as<00:03:30.510> you<00:03:30.600> can<00:03:30.720> see<00:03:30.900> overall<00:03:31.709> I'd<00:03:31.950> say<00:03:31.980> s<00:03:32.730> voice

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
as you can see overall I'd say s voice

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.090 
as you can see overall I'd say s voice
is<00:03:33.299> a<00:03:33.359> little<00:03:33.720> bit<00:03:33.810> slower<00:03:34.109> than<00:03:34.410> serious

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
is a little bit slower than serious

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.559 
is a little bit slower than serious
let's<00:03:35.340> go<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.579> ask<00:03:35.639> a<00:03:35.850> math<00:03:36.030> question<00:03:36.269> really

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
let's go and ask a math question really

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.059 
let's go and ask a math question really
quick<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:36.930> that'd<00:03:37.079> be<00:03:37.200> my<00:03:37.319> last<00:03:37.470> question<00:03:37.859> for

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
quick and that'd be my last question for

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.800 
quick and that'd be my last question for
this<00:03:38.220> video<00:03:38.459> I<00:03:38.700> just<00:03:39.239> want<00:03:39.359> to<00:03:39.420> wrap<00:03:39.540> this<00:03:39.569> guy

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
this video I just want to wrap this guy

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:48.020 
this video I just want to wrap this guy
up<00:03:39.959> so<00:03:40.790> what's<00:03:41.790> 37<00:03:42.510> times<00:03:42.780> 80<00:03:44.930> okay<00:03:46.579> so<00:03:47.579> we<00:03:47.819> got

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
up so what's 37 times 80 okay so we got

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.059 
up so what's 37 times 80 okay so we got
the<00:03:48.420> answer<00:03:48.780> already<00:03:49.049> is<00:03:49.549> 2016<00:03:51.620> and<00:03:52.620> you<00:03:52.950> can

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069 
the answer already is 2016 and you can

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.460 
the answer already is 2016 and you can
see<00:03:53.250> Jack<00:03:53.609> s<00:03:54.000> voice<00:03:54.269> didn't<00:03:54.720> really<00:03:55.200> get<00:03:55.410> what

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
see Jack s voice didn't really get what

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.229 
see Jack s voice didn't really get what
I<00:03:55.650> was<00:03:55.769> saying<00:03:56.069> correctly<00:03:56.519> just<00:03:56.849> said<00:03:56.970> what's

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
I was saying correctly just said what's

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.379 
I was saying correctly just said what's
37<00:03:57.959> s<00:03:58.049> and<00:03:58.250> where<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.549> know<00:03:59.639> Surya<00:03:59.910> understood

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
37 s and where you know Surya understood

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.210 
37 s and where you know Surya understood
me<00:04:00.540> perfectly<00:04:00.569> so<00:04:01.260> you<00:04:01.709> know<00:04:01.829> overall<00:04:02.069> you

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
me perfectly so you know overall you

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.069 
me perfectly so you know overall you
could<00:04:02.310> say<00:04:02.549> not<00:04:02.880> only<00:04:03.120> faster<00:04:03.720> but<00:04:03.750> it's<00:04:03.959> also

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
could say not only faster but it's also

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.020 
could say not only faster but it's also
more<00:04:04.349> accurate<00:04:04.829> and<00:04:05.099> also<00:04:05.609> you<00:04:05.670> could<00:04:05.819> talk<00:04:06.000> to

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
more accurate and also you could talk to

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.460 
more accurate and also you could talk to
it<00:04:06.239> a<00:04:06.299> little<00:04:06.420> bit<00:04:06.510> more<00:04:06.690> naturally<00:04:07.049> so<00:04:07.260> you

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
it a little bit more naturally so you

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.530 
it a little bit more naturally so you
know<00:04:07.650> and<00:04:07.799> then<00:04:07.919> it<00:04:08.130> is<00:04:08.250> better<00:04:08.519> but<00:04:09.090> s<00:04:09.359> voice

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
know and then it is better but s voice

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.580 
know and then it is better but s voice
isn't<00:04:09.810> all<00:04:10.109> that<00:04:10.139> bad

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
isn't all that bad

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.280 
isn't all that bad
however<00:04:11.069> you<00:04:11.549> know<00:04:11.639> I<00:04:11.669> did<00:04:11.880> test<00:04:12.290> Android

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
however you know I did test Android

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.720 
however you know I did test Android
jelly<00:04:13.560> bean<00:04:13.620> for<00:04:13.889> Poland<00:04:14.160> we<00:04:14.280> search<00:04:14.549> and

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
jelly bean for Poland we search and

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.190 
jelly bean for Poland we search and
that's<00:04:15.150> a<00:04:15.329> lot<00:04:15.510> better<00:04:15.720> actually<00:04:15.780> like<00:04:16.079> in

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
that's a lot better actually like in
