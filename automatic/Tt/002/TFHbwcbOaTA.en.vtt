00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.059
 Hello, we are doing a short review on 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.950
 ultraviolet baby ear thermometer 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.380
 so there were so many wishes that 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.940
 made this review as unpacked 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.580
 I can not do because of the lack 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.199
 batteries do and so in principle 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.439
 the device did not like her accuracy 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.330
 good ergonomics too keep it 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.949
 very comfortable scanning is also 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.080
 has a cap 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.420
 how to measure the overall temperature 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.610
 body is taken turns 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.770
 throat to make measurement 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.380
 from the ear of the present would be approximate 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.350
 body temperature also has a thermometer 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.000
 the function of measuring the temperature of the room and 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.579
 that's all 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.770
 on the back we turn on the buttons 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.039
 the green screen lights up and we see 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.600
 Immediately some data show us 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.710
 temperature in Celsius can also be 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.610
 configure transits 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.219
 has three modes first eye it is with us 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.129
 measuring the approximate body temperature of 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.989
 ear then smiley it froze from the total 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.820
 body temperature here can any 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.090
 condition from forehead 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.040
 from the hand from the leg as you want and the third 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.290
 the house mode is the temperature measurement in 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.369
 indoors button scan in principle 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.549
 the cascade is done quite quickly push 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:24.150
 1 2 1 written 1 second but triggered 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.460
 true for 2 seconds xi yes the same 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.960
 on / off button has mode 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:33.450
 settings by holding it 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.090
 we go into settings mode and also it 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.970
 can be turned off 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:42.229
 through this button we hold the inclusion 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:47.040
 just click and everything works for us 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:50.450
 device on three volt batteries we fly 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.100
 I do not know how lithium it is 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.670
 its formats are 2032 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.610
 the thickest wide batteries are enough 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.130
 as described in the instructions for the whole year 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.079
 use and if still 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.560
 rarely use something they would think about more 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.729
 will note the batteries are very good also 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.580
 there are holes 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.360
 and when notified or what to call 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.640
 Peak peaks not and about the assembly I 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.980
 I will say that very high quality and now 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.080
 let's talk about mercury 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.730
 our Soviet thermometers gives both 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.940
 you can say and electrons 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.950
 what actually budget to choose 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.700
 which shows here exactly or 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.390
 expensive battery- powered device 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.849
 working 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.970
 can also say long if i would 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:41.370
 schoolchildren I would be 12 there 11 10 years 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.769
 13 i would always be i would put a plus 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.140
 all 10 points so i think all 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.989
 guess everyone did it when not 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.910
 would you like this school or something else 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:54.319
 and in the morning over the dead until all doing 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.360
 torments and the like graduate in tea 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:01.019
 slapped his thermometer he's little there 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:04.349
 jumped 38 39 to for example 40 you are a little 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:07.530
 shot down there 37 537 8 somewhere before all 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:10.319
 temperature mom and it's not going Uhura 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.720
 happiness can not go to school also 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.480
 there were ways their mustard and smear under 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.670
 mouse how many ways it was also possible 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.370
 wear rub himself this thermometer 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.730
 so the pros if the schoolchildren 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.940
 to this but since I am a father myself and adults 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.099
 then of course I prefer our time 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.150
 electronic which makes measurements immediately 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:34.620
 in a second and in accuracy as well 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.030
 identical only wait no need for it 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.540
 will make measurements unlike 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.970
 mercurial small children usually do not like 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.879
 once the theater mercury they stand know 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:48.090
 according to his son, well, very intolerable 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:52.049
 cuts these thermometer now i'm all 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:54.510
 simplified called clicked everything is fine and 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:56.360
 baby is free no sitting 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.689
 this armpit or some calls and 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.340
 all well and and the child and parents 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:04.230
 let's do the test right away a couple of times 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.269
 let's see the accuracy of this 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.420
 We will do the generic 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:11.099
 her body temperature test approximate 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.459
 just by hand 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:15.690
 roughly speaking may be small 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:23.540
 small differences 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:23.540
 1 36 and 6 no temperature excellent 365 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:37.590
 365 365 365 and all 365 are shorter than four five 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.130
 365 times the first time was 36 but maybe this 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.320
 here is a little tpo body arm here such 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.100
 cases about the premises as well as possible 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:50.100
 to set 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:53.400
 and press 27 6 degrees rooms by 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:56.850
 celsius and so our experimental came 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.690
 will try on animals and so 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:03.539
 Turn on the body temperature because 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.960
 the cat has little hair like that 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:07.440
 find the place where they are few and we will 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.349
 sample 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.349
 there may be errors doing the first time 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:27.780
 369 2 1 3 6 9 and 3 1 369 in principle exactly 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:29.820
 showed and about the settings here you can 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:33.419
 set now blinking now with us 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:37.710
 Celsius can be set to Fahrenheit as well 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:41.150
 chain 2 menu we have to configure but 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:43.260
 the accuracy of the measurement itself is new ear mode 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:48.000
 but here we don't need to tune anything 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:50.250
 so we set it back to 0 because 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.820
 what it shows exactly you on 5 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.820
 jumped 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:04.870
 there are also 3 smiley faces 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:08.080
 and 4 on or off here such here 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.460
 Do things guys all if such a look 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:13.750
 like put huskies 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:15.760
 sharing this video moms and dads advise 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:19.450
 must buy this thermometer 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:22.030
 there is an analogue cheaper all 8 dollars 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:24.100
 but little functional he gave he does 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:26.590
 just stopped ear well approximate 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:28.570
 body temperature of the rest of the floor modes 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.320
 I do not know exactly because I did not order 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.800
 can read 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:35.650
 I will lay out a reference and this and analog 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.740
 under cheaper all guys all thanks all 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:37.740
 until
