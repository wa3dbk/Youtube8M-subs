00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hi to all today we will talk about 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.990
 my bodies for jumping cookies 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.510
 well soft for that we will need in 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.380
 game assures g of chocolate chips this 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.920
 what I did was that I took a 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.340
 tablet that I started in pieces of 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.430
 250 g of sugar bounce of 5 130 g of 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.750
 flour 75 g white powdered sugar 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.670
 2.2 of 250 g of tax butter 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.250
 of vanilla extracts of some walnuts 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.360
 pecan and half a teaspoon of 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.140
 baking powder for them to mount 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.450
 sky 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.129
 we start by adding the half 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:45.719
 teaspoon of baking powder in 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:47.010
 the room cleans even very complicated I 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.870
 take my butter that I previously 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:55.460
 leave a little softened and I 'm there 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.460
 add sugar 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.530
 but to the electric mixer to get 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.850
 a smooth paste 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.850
 I mix mud 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:18.720
 you can also wait for your 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.720
 shelter I do not like waiting 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.310
 so yes but a friend who is good 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:42.280
 smooth we'll be able to continue to rachel 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:50.130
 but both play a spoon at 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:53.729
 coffee salt and 2 teaspoons 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.729
 family extract 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.170
 to mix another minute we learn 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.550
 we add the eggs and now 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.550
 but flour and baking powder 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:23.490
 gently mix good port and the 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.490
 family 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.330
 continue a little bit to work the dough and 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:52.750
 then we add these nuggets 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:54.100
 hidden and pecans and in 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.319
 function of the consistency of the dough 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.920
 me it is quite dense so suddenly I 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.120
 have not a little flattened with the wto have 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.470
 never your past really badly 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.910
 when she made rather doing 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.620
 because they will tend to his daughter 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.239
 greenhouse and cooking who knows they are 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:11.950
 beautiful and perfectly in order 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.689
 that's no, but what are the costs 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.069
 whether they're ready america's that 's 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:17.069
 clean on the outside it comes 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.560
 pay it's the 20 minutes it's cooked 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.030
 we will go out of the oven and we will 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.770
 let stand two minutes on the 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.570
 hob and then we 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.900
 will remove the end of cooking are very 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.900
 soft 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.630
 wanted to cool two minutes 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.730
 after leaving them on the plate of 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.230
 cooking we put them on a rack for 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.300
 that they can not dry underneath and 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.310
 above 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:06.000
 but if we make friends we will not go 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.670
 the links time the costs they are 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.470
 ready no I'm kidding I have no child 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.470
