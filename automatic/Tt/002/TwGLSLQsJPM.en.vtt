00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.750
 This fall I like to wear a 

00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:07.759
 futuristic and modern makeup 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.759
 using the cosmopolitan collection 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.180
 the first step I will use the fix it or 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.790
 because he is a corrector and in the middle 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.830
 has a soft focus heart the best 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.720
 of fix it or is it helps to decrease 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.090
 dark circles and you can apply it in 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.670
 imperfections and you can also 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.660
 use it on the lips to create a 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.670
 good foundation for lipstick 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.680
 after the fix it I will choose dior 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.500
 addict and fitch ago 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.270
 it's really liquid before you start 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.309
 apply it you have to decide if you want 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.100
 a result with effect on the enet or 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:45.450
 shadow effect all over the eyelid 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.450
 I have decided to apply it in the whole eye 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.120
 once applied is very important 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.510
 keep your eyes open without moving them 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.320
 until it has dried wait about 15 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.320
 30 seconds 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.370
 now I'm going to write my eyebrows 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.009
 using this eyebrow pencil that 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.930
 soft put flame 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:08.570
 he usually drew a thin line here 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.720
 to create the shape at the base and then 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:15.220
 I'm going up lightly and gently to 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.220
 emulate the hair on my eyebrow 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:22.100
 then he applied my gold mask 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.220
 his iconic belcorp started at the base and 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.650
 I make slight oscillating movements and 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.950
 then stretch lengthening them and at the same 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.590
 time separating the this is worse blogs 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.500
 chiquis tics starts on one side like 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.970
 this and then use your fingers to 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.970
 blur softly 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.979
 has a powdery finish is not creamy 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.869
 in this way that one more time at a time 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.880
 that melts with the skin that feels 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:53.119
 really good and it seems natural 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.280
 this lipstick is just the reason 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.530
 why I use it is very soft it is 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.869
 and compensates lie look to be 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.909
 natural with a fresh look for 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.829
 finish this look I decide for these 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.829
 two nail lacquers and I choose the color 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.660
 cosmopolitan and milva in effect at the end 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:11.619
 I have made a French manicure and I have 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.619
 changed just a little 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.520
 ah
