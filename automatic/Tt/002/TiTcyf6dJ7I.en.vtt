00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
training intelligently listening to your

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.550 
training intelligently listening to your
body<00:02:19.910> when<00:02:20.910> something<00:02:21.330> is<00:02:21.480> hurting<00:02:21.660> you

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
body when something is hurting you

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.560 
body when something is hurting you
should<00:02:22.770> know<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.040> difference<00:02:23.340> between<00:02:23.570> just

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
should know the difference between just

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.200 
should know the difference between just
burning<00:02:25.140> from<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.410> workout<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.100> actual<00:02:26.910> pain

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
burning from the workout and actual pain

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.580 
burning from the workout and actual pain
like<00:02:27.540> injury<00:02:27.960> so<00:02:28.710> if<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.610> don't<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.870> don't

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
like injury so if you don't and I don't

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.380 
like injury so if you don't and I don't
know<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.010> don't<00:02:32.340> know<00:02:32.400> what<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:32.580> tell<00:02:32.760> you

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
know I don't know what to tell you

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.690 
know I don't know what to tell you
so<00:02:34.020> basically<00:02:34.410> I<00:02:35.040> scale<00:02:35.430> back<00:02:35.610> my<00:02:35.640> training

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
so basically I scale back my training

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.870 
so basically I scale back my training
analyze<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.880> problem<00:02:40.010> worked<00:02:41.010> at<00:02:41.190> it<00:02:41.370> rebuilt

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
analyze the problem worked at it rebuilt

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.810 
analyze the problem worked at it rebuilt
rehabilitated<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.520> best<00:02:44.700> of<00:02:44.760> my

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
rehabilitated it to the best of my

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.620 
rehabilitated it to the best of my
ability<00:02:45.300> and<00:02:45.660> I'm<00:02:46.130> back<00:02:47.130> squatting<00:02:47.700> actually

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
ability and I'm back squatting actually

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.000 
ability and I'm back squatting actually
