00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:17.360
Welcome to the instructional video for the
Burley Nomad.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:28.869
First remove the contents, and start by installing
the side panels.

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.700
Slide the panels into their receiver on the
lower frame, and then lock them into place

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:41.960
with the C-clips, which are highlighted here
in red.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:53.100
Note the orientation of the panels, sloping
downward towards the back of the trailer.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.050
Next install the cover and central roll bar.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:16.500
The roll bar and cover are both locked into
place with the provided screws.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.479
Place the roll bar in the middle and align
it with the holes in the frame.

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:24.360
Then place the screw through the cover and
twist it into the threaded interior of the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.960
roll bar.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.829
The tailgate and splashguard can by locked
into place by pulling their straps over the

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.600
top of the frame, and clipping them inside.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:49.070
Note the orientation of the panels, sloping
downward towards the back of the trailer.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:02:08.420
Lastly install the quick release wheels and
tow bar.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:19.220
The Nomad has a handy central divider, that
velcros into place on top of the roll bar.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.109
