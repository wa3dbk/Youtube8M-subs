00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
demonstration to show how HAARP could

demonstration to show how HAARP could

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
manipulate the atmosphere so what we've

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.910 
manipulate the atmosphere so what we've
done<00:02:50.180> is<00:02:50.359> we've<00:02:50.510> got<00:02:50.720> a<00:02:50.900> cloud<00:02:51.170> generator<00:02:51.709> up

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
done is we've got a cloud generator up

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.770 
done is we've got a cloud generator up
here<00:02:52.130> it's<00:02:52.250> an<00:02:52.370> ultrasonic<00:02:52.940> nebulizer<00:02:53.450> it's

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
here it's an ultrasonic nebulizer it's

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.840 
here it's an ultrasonic nebulizer it's
going<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:53.989> create<00:02:54.230> real<00:02:54.859> water<00:02:55.310> particles

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.250 
going to create real water particles
just<00:02:56.180> like<00:02:56.390> you<00:02:56.540> would<00:02:56.630> find<00:02:56.810> in<00:02:56.989> a<00:02:57.079> cloud<00:02:59.260> what

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
just like you would find in a cloud what

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.300 
just like you would find in a cloud what
we're<00:03:00.410> seeing<00:03:00.590> now<00:03:00.709> is<00:03:01.040> we're<00:03:01.220> actually

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
we're seeing now is we're actually

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.880 
we're seeing now is we're actually
filling<00:03:01.880> this<00:03:02.030> chamber<00:03:02.480> with<00:03:02.890> microscopic

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
water particles you can see that it's

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.569 
water particles you can see that it's
almost<00:03:06.620> completely<00:03:07.010> filled<00:03:07.280> with<00:03:07.459> water
