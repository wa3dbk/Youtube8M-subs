00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.289
 Vienna 

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:12.289
 Vienna 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.460
 only at the markets the profit Bop Decameron be closed one 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.499
 aging population 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:24.210
 there is nothing for children 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.369
 something 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.670
 We can not see it anyway, but Rasmussen can exist 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:31.470
 exist 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.910
 the central big is actually the secret that's right on the 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.890
 we never get an answer 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.570
 So I find it much more interesting 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.570
 in two parts disassemble 1 no need it 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.490
 we would not stand it 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.510
 when we are somewhere percent in a dead end 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.980
 I have the impression 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.659
 only expansion 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:58.610
 we forecast and 2 to be able to 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:00.740
 a notebook stock market reports 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.060
 that's too little for society 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.500
 and I have the impression 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.500
 that they do not really care about that 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.200
 The book is mainly a trip to the culture 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.640
 "That's the bitterest flow 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.260
 from the text 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.850
 to rush over which politics have always played in the 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.170
 the world of human history 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.480
 in the abbey 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.940
 furthermore, it rises to the modern day 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.040
 No 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.350
 that not only 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.040
 the Schufa is 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.259
 and percent 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.800
 or a whim of people 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.910
 have that becomes clear 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.159
 I look at the lye Infineon and staged 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.240
 It's a bit provocative, of course 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.880
 passes 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.010
 for this program and 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.329
 Percent means that Isabel, of course, does not intend to immigrate to India 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.170
 Cuxhaven 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.270
 I do not need to stop that 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.219
 Maybe it will be possible that is awkward is skeptical now 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.219
 he old masters or something else 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.420
 but I can be controversial here 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.420
 to be discussed that was crazy 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:20.749
 more music in my life 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:22.309
 unbelievable 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:24.469
 but very dark times 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:28.119
 I do not think they come off the leash, it just sets mine 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:29.679
 subjective becomes 

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:32.179
 I think we want to be asked already 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:35.139
 and tilted and the interest earned 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:37.799
 I think it comes in the Philippines 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.269
 on a hill Michael 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.019
 the possibilities are certainly not
