00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:10.269 
hello this is work x 365 with a tutorial

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.230 
hello this is work x 365 with a tutorial
on<00:00:10.660> how<00:00:10.750> to<00:00:11.139> make<00:00:11.709> pass<00:00:12.039> go<00:00:12.309> underwater<00:00:12.879> and

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
on how to make pass go underwater and

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.010 
on how to make pass go underwater and
underground<00:00:15.029> now<00:00:16.029> I'm<00:00:16.359> first<00:00:16.720> going<00:00:16.779> to<00:00:16.930> show

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.020 
underground now I'm first going to show

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.510 
underground now I'm first going to show
you<00:00:17.170> how<00:00:17.320> to<00:00:17.410> make<00:00:17.529> Pat's<00:00:17.830> go<00:00:18.130> underground<00:00:18.520> so

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
you how to make Pat's go underground so

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.260 
you how to make Pat's go underground so
basically<00:00:21.520> if<00:00:21.730> you<00:00:21.880> just<00:00:23.010> take<00:00:24.010> that<00:00:24.270> stretch

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
basically if you just take that stretch

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.710 
basically if you just take that stretch
and<00:00:25.660> then<00:00:26.560> if<00:00:26.740> you<00:00:26.830> try<00:00:27.039> pressing<00:00:27.280> down

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
and then if you try pressing down

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.470 
and then if you try pressing down
doesn't<00:00:28.720> work<00:00:29.220> it'll<00:00:30.220> just<00:00:30.250> that<00:00:30.460> one<00:00:30.760> so

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
doesn't work it'll just that one so

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.470 
doesn't work it'll just that one so
that's<00:00:32.349> probably<00:00:33.010> what<00:00:33.280> a<00:00:33.309> beginner<00:00:33.850> would<00:00:34.180> do

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
that's probably what a beginner would do

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.000 
that's probably what a beginner would do
i'm<00:00:34.690> not<00:00:34.870> gonna<00:00:35.020> sure<00:00:35.230> but<00:00:35.469> they<00:00:35.710> might<00:00:35.890> do

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
i'm not gonna sure but they might do

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.319 
i'm not gonna sure but they might do
that<00:00:36.039> and<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:38.649> not<00:00:38.829> so<00:00:39.190> good<00:00:39.220> looking<00:00:39.970> way<00:00:40.120> of

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
that and the not so good looking way of

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:41.520 
that and the not so good looking way of
doing<00:00:40.600> this<00:00:40.630> i'll<00:00:41.020> show<00:00:41.170> you<00:00:41.230> the<00:00:41.350> better

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
doing this i'll show you the better

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.360 
doing this i'll show you the better
looking<00:00:41.680> regulator<00:00:42.250> is<00:00:42.570> um<00:00:43.570> you<00:00:44.110> just<00:00:44.370> click

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
looking regulator is um you just click

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.319 
looking regulator is um you just click
on<00:00:45.399> the<00:00:45.820> single<00:00:46.829> pushing<00:00:47.829> up<00:00:47.980> thing<00:00:48.280> and<00:00:48.520> then

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
on the single pushing up thing and then

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.780 
on the single pushing up thing and then
you<00:00:49.600> just<00:00:49.750> go<00:00:49.930> up<00:00:50.200> i<00:00:50.500> eating<00:00:51.280> more<00:00:51.550> of<00:00:51.579> these

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
you just go up i eating more of these

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.799 
you just go up i eating more of these
because<00:00:52.380> it<00:00:53.380> takes<00:00:53.620> more<00:00:53.920> paths<00:00:54.760> to<00:00:55.059> go<00:00:55.210> to

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
because it takes more paths to go to

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.840 
because it takes more paths to go to
take<00:00:56.050> time<00:00:56.590> to<00:00:56.770> go<00:00:56.890> underground<00:00:57.250> you<00:00:57.640> can't

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
take time to go underground you can't

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.450 
take time to go underground you can't
just<00:00:58.030> have<00:00:58.239> it<00:00:58.390> like<00:00:58.540> a<00:00:58.570> 90<00:00:58.960> degree<00:00:59.079> drop<00:00:59.530> so

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
just have it like a 90 degree drop so

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.209 
just have it like a 90 degree drop so
you<00:01:01.090> put<00:01:01.750> about<00:01:01.930> three<00:01:02.110> of<00:01:02.320> them<00:01:02.440> maybe<00:01:02.860> that

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
you put about three of them maybe that

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:08.340 
you put about three of them maybe that
would<00:01:03.340> be<00:01:03.370> good<00:01:03.489> and<00:01:03.820> then<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.880> just<00:01:07.170> click<00:01:08.170> on

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
would be good and then you just click on

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.230 
would be good and then you just click on
that<00:01:08.409> and<00:01:09.390> then<00:01:10.390> go<00:01:11.080> down<00:01:11.610> now<00:01:12.610> you<00:01:12.670> can<00:01:13.060> see

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
that and then go down now you can see

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.180 
that and then go down now you can see
there's<00:01:13.420> a<00:01:13.540> transparency<00:01:14.170> when<00:01:14.560> this<00:01:14.740> happens

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
there's a transparency when this happens

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.670 
there's a transparency when this happens
and<00:01:15.430> then<00:01:16.390> when<00:01:16.659> you<00:01:16.780> try<00:01:16.900> going<00:01:17.200> up<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:20.500> is

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
and then when you try going up this is

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.789 
and then when you try going up this is
what<00:01:20.860> happens<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:22.390> doesn't<00:01:23.200> look<00:01:23.439> like<00:01:23.650> it's

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
what happens it doesn't look like it's

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:25.890 
what happens it doesn't look like it's
actually<00:01:24.130> coming<00:01:24.310> up<00:01:24.580> so<00:01:25.240> what<00:01:25.540> you<00:01:25.720> really

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
actually coming up so what you really

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.800 
actually coming up so what you really
need<00:01:26.170> to<00:01:26.290> do<00:01:26.439> is<00:01:28.350> first<00:01:29.350> we<00:01:29.590> shall<00:01:29.950> toggle<00:01:30.460> the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
need to do is first we shall toggle the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.410 
need to do is first we shall toggle the
transparency<00:01:31.810> at<00:01:32.080> old<00:01:32.229> times<00:01:32.790> so<00:01:33.790> we<00:01:34.030> can<00:01:34.240> um

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
transparency at old times so we can um

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.700 
transparency at old times so we can um
see<00:01:35.020> underground<00:01:35.650> while<00:01:36.520> we're<00:01:36.790> doing<00:01:37.000> this

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.130 

now<00:01:42.570> video<00:01:43.570> is<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:45.640> click<00:01:45.909> on<00:01:46.060> terrain<00:01:46.420> and

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
now video is you click on terrain and

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.180 
now video is you click on terrain and
then<00:01:47.580> take<00:01:48.580> the<00:01:48.729> single<00:01:49.119> block<00:01:49.330> again<00:01:49.690> a

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
then take the single block again a

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:58.590 
then take the single block again a
little<00:01:51.190> friend<00:01:51.490> and<00:01:52.140> then<00:01:55.830> we<00:01:57.330> start<00:01:58.330> going

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
little friend and then we start going

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.350 
little friend and then we start going
down<00:01:58.840> with<00:01:59.259> these<00:01:59.940> that<00:02:00.940> should<00:02:01.180> be<00:02:01.270> about

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
down with these that should be about

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.950 
down with these that should be about
enough<00:02:01.780> to<00:02:02.020> get<00:02:02.290> this<00:02:02.440> up<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.909> we<00:02:04.300> click<00:02:04.690> there

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
enough to get this up so we click there

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:13.830 
enough to get this up so we click there
and<00:02:05.729> then<00:02:06.729> we<00:02:06.909> try<00:02:07.210> to<00:02:07.720> get<00:02:07.869> that<00:02:10.500> off<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:12.840> well

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
and then we try to get that off and well

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.070 
and then we try to get that off and well
try<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.350> get<00:02:14.530> that<00:02:14.790> back<00:02:15.790> on<00:02:15.850> top<00:02:16.330> of<00:02:16.600> ground

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
try to get that back on top of ground

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.630 
try to get that back on top of ground
level<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:19.350> that's<00:02:20.350> exactly<00:02:20.739> how<00:02:21.310> you<00:02:21.370> do<00:02:21.519> it

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
level and that's exactly how you do it

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.770 
level and that's exactly how you do it
now<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.570> better-looking<00:02:23.110> way<00:02:23.590> is<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:24.780> better

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
now the better-looking way is a better

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.420 
now the better-looking way is a better
bit<00:02:26.739> better<00:02:27.459> so<00:02:27.970> of<00:02:28.540> course<00:02:28.750> and<00:02:29.220> I'll<00:02:30.220> just

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
bit better so of course and I'll just

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.910 
bit better so of course and I'll just
turn<00:02:30.610> off<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:30.820> transparency<00:02:31.690> for<00:02:31.959> now<00:02:32.140> so<00:02:32.830> it

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
turn off the transparency for now so it

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.090 
turn off the transparency for now so it
looks<00:02:32.950> nicer<00:02:33.489> here<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.650> I'll<00:02:35.650> just<00:02:35.860> use<00:02:36.070> this

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
looks nicer here and I'll just use this

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.940 
looks nicer here and I'll just use this
because<00:02:36.580> we<00:02:37.390> basically<00:02:37.750> already<00:02:38.050> started

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
because we basically already started

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:47.330 
because we basically already started
that<00:02:39.130> and<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:44.290> I'll<00:02:44.380> click<00:02:44.500> there<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:45.360> then

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
that and so I'll click there and then

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:56.690 
that and so I'll click there and then
start<00:02:48.340> going<00:02:48.880> up<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:50.489> then

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:08.809 

I'll<00:02:57.330> just<00:03:02.060> yes<00:03:05.720> okay<00:03:06.830> now<00:03:07.830> this<00:03:08.459> may<00:03:08.640> take

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
I'll just yes okay now this may take

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.979 
I'll just yes okay now this may take
some<00:03:09.000> time<00:03:09.060> so<00:03:09.300> I'll<00:03:10.230> just<00:03:10.290> um<00:03:11.690> finish<00:03:12.690> it<00:03:12.840> and

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
some time so I'll just um finish it and

this<00:03:21.720> out<00:03:21.989> as<00:03:22.349> you<00:03:22.860> can<00:03:23.069> see<00:03:23.340> before<00:03:23.700> it<00:03:23.880> was

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
this out as you can see before it was

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.520 
this out as you can see before it was
actually<00:03:24.390> really<00:03:24.599> blocky<00:03:25.019> there<00:03:25.319> were<00:03:25.380> just

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
actually really blocky there were just

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.890 
actually really blocky there were just
three<00:03:25.739> little<00:03:26.160> blocks<00:03:26.519> and<00:03:26.910> they<00:03:27.420> also<00:03:27.569> made

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
three little blocks and they also made

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.830 
three little blocks and they also made
it<00:03:28.049> like<00:03:28.230> curvy<00:03:28.680> around<00:03:28.950> here<00:03:29.510> this<00:03:30.510> sort<00:03:30.780> of

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
it like curvy around here this sort of

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.059 
it like curvy around here this sort of
looks<00:03:30.989> like<00:03:31.080> you're<00:03:31.290> going<00:03:31.560> through<00:03:31.769> a<00:03:31.799> cable

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
looks like you're going through a cable

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.680 
looks like you're going through a cable
that's<00:03:32.519> what<00:03:32.700> I<00:03:32.730> think<00:03:32.849> and<00:03:35.360> so<00:03:36.360> what<00:03:36.569> i<00:03:36.599> did

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
that's what I think and so what i did

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.780 
that's what I think and so what i did
was<00:03:36.840> i<00:03:37.170> click<00:03:37.380> donna<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:38.010> terrain<00:03:38.519> tools

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
was i click donna the terrain tools

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.199 
was i click donna the terrain tools
there<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:40.140> then<00:03:40.290> uh<00:03:40.319> I<00:03:40.739> just<00:03:41.610> click<00:03:41.790> on<00:03:41.970> that

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
there and then uh I just click on that

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.170 
there and then uh I just click on that
and<00:03:42.269> started<00:03:42.780> going<00:03:43.140> up<00:03:43.410> random<00:03:44.130> blocking<00:03:44.910> and

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
and started going up random blocking and

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.520 
and started going up random blocking and
Lola<00:03:45.769> smoothing<00:03:46.769> out<00:03:47.010> all<00:03:47.519> those<00:03:48.170> cliffs<00:03:49.170> or

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
Lola smoothing out all those cliffs or

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.759 
Lola smoothing out all those cliffs or
somewhat<00:03:50.130> things<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.700> if<00:03:51.630> this<00:03:51.900> um<00:03:52.200> looks<00:03:52.620> a

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
somewhat things and if this um looks a

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.500 
somewhat things and if this um looks a
little<00:03:52.920> cut<00:03:53.370> like<00:03:53.700> their<00:03:53.880> cuts<00:03:54.150> in<00:03:54.329> the

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
little cut like their cuts in the

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.360 
little cut like their cuts in the
terrain<00:03:55.079> you<00:03:55.200> can<00:03:55.349> also<00:03:55.500> go<00:03:55.769> here<00:03:56.099> and<00:03:56.130> then

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
terrain you can also go here and then

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.470 
terrain you can also go here and then
click<00:03:56.849> on<00:03:56.970> that<00:03:59.000> so<00:04:00.000> that's<00:04:00.180> basically

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
click on that so that's basically

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.830 
click on that so that's basically
exactly<00:04:01.380> how<00:04:01.739> you<00:04:01.799> make<00:04:02.040> them<00:04:02.569> pass<00:04:03.569> go

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
exactly how you make them pass go

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.250 
exactly how you make them pass go
underground<00:04:04.230> now<00:04:05.190> this<00:04:06.090> is<00:04:06.269> how<00:04:06.480> to<00:04:07.079> make

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
underground now this is how to make

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.670 
underground now this is how to make
paths<00:04:07.530> go<00:04:07.769> underwater<00:04:08.660> um<00:04:09.660> click<00:04:09.989> on<00:04:10.019> the<00:04:10.200> pats

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
paths go underwater um click on the pats

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.029 
paths go underwater um click on the pats
and<00:04:11.069> then<00:04:12.230> you'll<00:04:13.230> extend<00:04:13.829> it<00:04:14.160> straight<00:04:14.370> out

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
and then you'll extend it straight out

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:20.240 
and then you'll extend it straight out
to<00:04:17.039> the<00:04:17.090> water<00:04:18.090> and<00:04:18.329> then<00:04:19.049> we<00:04:19.350> switch<00:04:19.829> the<00:04:20.070> path

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
to the water and then we switch the path

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:29.310 
to the water and then we switch the path
type<00:04:20.609> to<00:04:20.970> underwater<00:04:21.450> tunnel<00:04:23.510> and

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.830 

there's<00:04:29.950> a<00:04:30.070> body<00:04:30.370> of<00:04:30.640> water<00:04:30.820> underneath<00:04:31.330> us<00:04:31.630> so

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
there's a body of water underneath us so

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.160 
there's a body of water underneath us so
we<00:04:31.990> can<00:04:32.140> go<00:04:32.350> down<00:04:32.590> and<00:04:33.420> you<00:04:34.420> can<00:04:34.690> see<00:04:34.900> how<00:04:35.050> it

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
we can go down and you can see how it

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.070 
we can go down and you can see how it
goes<00:04:35.380> through<00:04:35.920> and<00:04:36.220> then<00:04:37.180> you<00:04:37.480> can<00:04:37.630> also<00:04:37.780> make

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
goes through and then you can also make

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.490 
goes through and then you can also make
it<00:04:38.110> come<00:04:38.440> back<00:04:38.470> up<00:04:39.210> if<00:04:40.210> you<00:04:40.600> desire<00:04:41.110> whatever

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
it come back up if you desire whatever

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.800 
it come back up if you desire whatever
you<00:04:41.740> whatever<00:04:42.310> you<00:04:42.610> want<00:04:42.820> and<00:04:43.090> then<00:04:45.570> well<00:04:46.570> I

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
you whatever you want and then well I

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.920 
you whatever you want and then well I
haven't<00:04:47.080> built<00:04:47.350> enough<00:04:47.680> space<00:04:48.250> but<00:04:48.720> you<00:04:49.720> can

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
haven't built enough space but you can

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.840 
haven't built enough space but you can
you<00:04:50.320> see<00:04:50.530> the<00:04:50.710> idea<00:04:51.010> you<00:04:51.190> can<00:04:51.280> just<00:04:51.490> lower<00:04:51.670> the

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
you see the idea you can just lower the

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.690 
you see the idea you can just lower the
train<00:04:52.120> a<00:04:52.150> little<00:04:52.390> bit<00:04:52.600> so<00:04:53.260> those<00:04:54.190> people<00:04:54.580> who

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.700 
train a little bit so those people who

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.720 
train a little bit so those people who
don't<00:04:54.880> know<00:04:54.970> how<00:04:55.090> to<00:04:55.500> put<00:04:56.500> water<00:04:56.740> make<00:04:57.310> bodies

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
don't know how to put water make bodies

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.700 
don't know how to put water make bodies
of<00:04:58.060> water<00:04:58.300> you<00:04:58.540> just<00:04:58.570> go<00:04:58.870> to<00:04:58.930> terrain<00:04:59.290> tools

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
of water you just go to terrain tools

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.160 
of water you just go to terrain tools
click<00:05:00.040> on<00:05:00.220> that<00:05:00.400> button<00:05:00.460> and<00:05:01.030> then<00:05:01.690> you<00:05:01.960> go<00:05:02.110> to

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
here you go down you exit out of that

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.760 
here you go down you exit out of that
and<00:05:06.160> then<00:05:06.730> you<00:05:06.910> go<00:05:07.060> two<00:05:07.170> bodies<00:05:08.170> of<00:05:08.290> water<00:05:08.440> and

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
and then you go two bodies of water and

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:15.630 
and then you go two bodies of water and
click<00:05:10.800> so<00:05:11.820> that<00:05:12.820> is<00:05:13.030> how<00:05:13.210> you<00:05:13.270> make<00:05:14.400> Pat's<00:05:15.400> go

how it looks I'll just finish this up
here<00:05:20.370> the<00:05:21.370> water<00:05:21.610> will<00:05:21.820> actually<00:05:21.880> go<00:05:22.390> away

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
here the water will actually go away

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.890 
here the water will actually go away
once<00:05:22.870> in<00:05:23.050> start<00:05:23.320> doing<00:05:23.620> this<00:05:23.880> process<00:05:24.900> by

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
once in start doing this process by

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:32.670 
once in start doing this process by
lowering<00:05:26.710> the<00:05:26.800> terrain<00:05:27.280> down<00:05:31.470> see<00:05:32.470> how<00:05:32.620> the

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
lowering the terrain down see how the

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.510 
lowering the terrain down see how the
water's<00:05:33.130> going<00:05:33.340> down<00:05:34.050> um<00:05:35.050> we<00:05:35.800> can<00:05:35.950> just<00:05:36.130> put

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 
water's going down um we can just put

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:42.830 
water's going down um we can just put
more<00:05:36.700> water<00:05:36.880> and<00:05:37.030> later<00:05:37.390> on<00:05:37.630> if<00:05:38.530> you<00:05:39.070> want<00:05:39.780> and
