00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060 

so<00:00:00.630> we<00:00:00.780> have<00:00:00.900> now<00:00:01.020> based<00:00:01.260> offenses<00:00:01.589> and<00:00:01.890> let's

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
so we have now based offenses and let's

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.550 
so we have now based offenses and let's
go<00:00:02.310> on<00:00:02.520> so<00:00:03.179> next<00:00:03.419> thing<00:00:03.659> what<00:00:03.840> we<00:00:03.959> need<00:00:04.140> to<00:00:04.290> do

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
go on so next thing what we need to do

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.660 
go on so next thing what we need to do
is<00:00:04.890> make<00:00:05.190> a<00:00:05.430> rare<00:00:05.700> or<00:00:06.029> building<00:00:06.720> where<00:00:07.620> you<00:00:08.370> can

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
is make a rare or building where you can

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.780 
is make a rare or building where you can
capture<00:00:09.059> it<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:10.170> what<00:00:11.010> you<00:00:11.160> need<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.429> hold

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
capture it and what you need to hold

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.330 
capture it and what you need to hold
under<00:00:12.210> your<00:00:12.300> control<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:13.139> get<00:00:13.290> points<00:00:13.679> so<00:00:14.280> I'm

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
under your control to get points so I'm

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.430 
under your control to get points so I'm
going<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.490> go<00:00:14.639> into<00:00:14.820> object<00:00:15.360> selection<00:00:15.690> ops

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
going to go into object selection ops

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.760 
going to go into object selection ops
and<00:00:16.890> I'm<00:00:17.130> going<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.310> go<00:00:17.490> into<00:00:17.699> neutral<00:00:18.420> and

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
and I'm going to go into neutral and

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.800 
and I'm going to go into neutral and
structures<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:20.430> there<00:00:20.760> we<00:00:20.939> have<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.510> lot<00:00:21.779> of

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
structures so there we have a lot of

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.870 
structures so there we have a lot of
structures<00:00:22.560> what<00:00:22.740> you<00:00:22.890> can<00:00:23.130> actually<00:00:23.279> use<00:00:23.670> in

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
structures what you can actually use in

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.109 
structures what you can actually use in
your<00:00:24.000> mission<00:00:24.330> maps<00:00:24.539> for<00:00:25.410> example<00:00:26.119> factor

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
your mission maps for example factor

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.929 
your mission maps for example factor
where<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.630> can<00:00:27.779> make<00:00:27.960> mutant<00:00:28.529> stuff<00:00:28.859> then<00:00:29.580> air

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
where you can make mutant stuff then air

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.630 
where you can make mutant stuff then air
anti-air<00:00:30.779> stuff<00:00:31.470> what<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.949> can<00:00:32.099> capture<00:00:32.309> and

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
anti-air stuff what you can capture and

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.819 
anti-air stuff what you can capture and
it<00:00:32.759> will<00:00:32.910> ultimately<00:00:33.180> start<00:00:33.840> be<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.290> here

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
it will ultimately start be and here

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.490 
it will ultimately start be and here
just<00:00:35.700> remember<00:00:36.210> that<00:00:36.390> if<00:00:36.540> there's<00:00:36.750> an<00:00:36.960> tiara

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
just remember that if there's an tiara

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.889 
just remember that if there's an tiara
anti-aircraft<00:00:38.309> whole<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:39.239> Santa<00:00:39.690> here

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
anti-aircraft whole you Santa here

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.740 
anti-aircraft whole you Santa here
because<00:00:40.590> after<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.190> stuff<00:00:41.730> or<00:00:41.940> pointless<00:00:42.300> at

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
because after that stuff or pointless at

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.709 
because after that stuff or pointless at
least<00:00:43.020> at<00:00:43.200> what<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.440> EA<00:00:43.620> told<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.120> we<00:00:45.600> are

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
least at what I EA told so and we are

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.479 
least at what I EA told so and we are
going<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.260> use<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:47.250> there<00:00:47.910> we<00:00:48.030> go<00:00:49.489> neutral

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
going to use the there we go neutral

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.709 
going to use the there we go neutral
struck<00:00:50.879> kool<00:00:51.270> kool<00:00:51.719> structure<00:00:53.480> there<00:00:54.480> we<00:00:54.600> go

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
struck kool kool structure there we go

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.420 
struck kool kool structure there we go
and<00:00:54.960> I'm<00:00:55.079> gonna<00:00:55.260> put<00:00:55.440> them<00:00:55.620> exactly<00:00:56.100> in<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
and I'm gonna put them exactly in the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.869 
and I'm gonna put them exactly in the
middle<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.789> map<00:00:57.590> so<00:00:58.590> make<00:00:58.980> sure<00:00:59.010> these<00:00:59.370> neutral

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
middle of map so make sure these neutral

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.849 
middle of map so make sure these neutral
don't<00:01:00.210> put<00:01:00.449> it<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:00.660> any<00:01:00.840> players<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.559> because

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
don't put it on any players on because

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.189 
don't put it on any players on because
it<00:01:01.980> doesn't<00:01:02.489> birth<00:01:02.670> as<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:03.359> should<00:01:03.629> then<00:01:03.930> and

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
it doesn't birth as it should then and

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.950 
it doesn't birth as it should then and
it<00:01:04.830> will<00:01:05.460> be<00:01:05.610> bak<00:01:05.880> just<00:01:06.240> make<00:01:06.630> sure<00:01:06.810> it's

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
it will be bak just make sure it's

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.330 
it will be bak just make sure it's
always<00:01:07.409> neutral<00:01:08.869> there<00:01:09.869> we<00:01:09.990> go<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.920> now<00:01:10.950> it's

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
always neutral there we go so now it's

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.039 
always neutral there we go so now it's
neutral<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.210> we<00:01:13.200> have<00:01:13.380> left<00:01:13.799> thing<00:01:14.340> called<00:01:15.049> so

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
neutral and we have left thing called so

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.560 
neutral and we have left thing called so
we<00:01:16.259> have<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.409> area<00:01:17.100> now<00:01:17.700> we<00:01:17.759> have<00:01:17.970> left<00:01:18.180> thing<00:01:18.420> to

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
we have a area now we have left thing to

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.560 
we have a area now we have left thing to
do<00:01:18.750> that<00:01:18.990> tiberium<00:01:19.770> comix<00:01:20.580> zone<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:21.150> where<00:01:21.390> did

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
do that tiberium comix zone so where did

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.469 
do that tiberium comix zone so where did
I<00:01:21.689> pairing<00:01:22.110> will<00:01:22.290> land<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:23.400> let's<00:01:23.700> go<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.210> is

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
I pairing will land so let's go it is

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.499 
I pairing will land so let's go it is
again<00:01:24.930> in<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.549> neutral<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.790> structure<00:01:27.299> and

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
again in the neutral and structure and

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.300 
again in the neutral and structure and
this<00:01:27.930> time<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.320> will<00:01:28.470> be<00:01:28.530> lost<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:29.100> parent

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
this time it will be lost a parent

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.359 
this time it will be lost a parent
landing<00:01:29.729> zone<00:01:29.970> landing<00:01:30.750> pad<00:01:31.040> and<00:01:32.040> I'm<00:01:32.280> gonna

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
landing zone landing pad and I'm gonna

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:39.290 
landing zone landing pad and I'm gonna
make<00:01:32.460> four<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.030> them<00:01:33.950> actually<00:01:34.950> one

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:49.700 

two<00:01:42.350> three<00:01:44.540> and<00:01:45.540> four<00:01:47.090> so<00:01:48.090> now<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:48.960> want<00:01:49.410> to<00:01:49.500> make

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
two three and four so now I want to make

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.400 
two three and four so now I want to make
this<00:01:49.740> area<00:01:50.280> that<00:01:50.340> choose<00:01:51.120> to<00:01:51.150> will<00:01:52.080> be<00:01:52.380> a

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
this area that choose to will be a

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.410 
this area that choose to will be a
advanced<00:01:53.400> I<00:01:53.520> varium<00:01:55.670> now<00:01:56.670> actually<00:01:57.210> I'm<00:01:57.270> going

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
advanced I varium now actually I'm going

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.030 
advanced I varium now actually I'm going
to<00:01:57.570> make<00:01:57.720> these<00:01:57.960> 2's<00:01:58.290> advanced<00:01:58.620> player<00:01:58.830> to

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
to make these 2's advanced player to

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.890 
to make these 2's advanced player to
sell<00:01:59.220> both<00:01:59.430> them<00:01:59.670> can<00:01:59.910> make<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.390> I'm<00:02:00.720> going<00:02:00.870> to

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
sell both them can make and I'm going to

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.720 
sell both them can make and I'm going to
make<00:02:00.960> them<00:02:01.260> a<00:02:01.290> screen<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:01.980> there<00:02:02.220> will<00:02:02.370> be<00:02:02.400> blue

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
make them a screen so there will be blue

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.820 
make them a screen so there will be blue
and<00:02:02.760> they<00:02:03.060> will<00:02:03.210> degree<00:02:03.540> so<00:02:04.230> we<00:02:04.650> have<00:02:04.800> a

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
and they will degree so we have a

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.590 
and they will degree so we have a
landing<00:02:05.280> zones<00:02:05.520> but<00:02:05.760> this<00:02:06.060> doesn't<00:02:06.420> mean<00:02:06.450> that

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
landing zones but this doesn't mean that

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.690 
landing zones but this doesn't mean that
there<00:02:06.960> will<00:02:07.260> come<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.740> barium<00:02:08.070> right<00:02:08.250> now<00:02:08.399> so

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
there will come to barium right now so

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.320 
there will come to barium right now so
you<00:02:08.760> need<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.180> make<00:02:09.210> a<00:02:09.390> way<00:02:09.690> points<00:02:10.050> over<00:02:10.200> there

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
you need to make a way points over there

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.270 
you need to make a way points over there
there<00:02:12.330> we<00:02:12.420> go<00:02:12.600> and<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:13.320> going<00:02:13.710> to<00:02:13.800> go<00:02:13.890> i<00:02:13.920> stop

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
there we go and I going to go i stop

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.900 
there we go and I going to go i stop
town<00:02:14.580> few<00:02:14.880> so<00:02:15.090> i<00:02:15.120> can<00:02:15.270> put<00:02:15.420> them<00:02:15.660> better<00:02:16.550> to<00:02:17.550> end

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
town few so i can put them better to end

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.970 
town few so i can put them better to end
up<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.120> little<00:02:18.540> bit<00:02:18.660> moment<00:02:19.080> miss<00:02:19.230> right<00:02:19.530> now<00:02:19.740> so

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
up a little bit moment miss right now so

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.460 
up a little bit moment miss right now so
i<00:02:20.010> can<00:02:20.250> rename<00:02:20.730> them<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.000> little<00:02:21.300> bit<00:02:21.450> later<00:02:21.690> so

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
i can rename them a little bit later so

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.680 
i can rename them a little bit later so
I'm<00:02:23.010> gonna<00:02:23.130> make<00:02:23.340> things<00:02:23.700> just<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.330> normal

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
I'm gonna make things just a normal

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.600 
I'm gonna make things just a normal
green<00:02:25.560> tiberium<00:02:26.190> so<00:02:26.310> we're<00:02:26.400> going<00:02:26.490> to<00:02:26.580> go

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
green tiberium so we're going to go

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.390 
green tiberium so we're going to go
select<00:02:27.210> it<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.540> set<00:02:28.080> us<00:02:28.290> up<00:02:30.260> prayed<00:02:31.400> crystal

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
select it and set us up prayed crystal

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.020 
select it and set us up prayed crystal
and<00:02:32.720> one<00:02:33.720> so<00:02:34.530> this<00:02:34.920> means<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.340> this<00:02:35.670> will<00:02:36.000> be

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
and one so this means that this will be

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.160 
and one so this means that this will be
just<00:02:36.480> normal<00:02:37.760> upgrade<00:02:38.760> or<00:02:39.090> normal<00:02:39.570> clean<00:02:39.990> up

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
just normal upgrade or normal clean up

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.340 
just normal upgrade or normal clean up
grade<00:02:40.500> level<00:02:40.890> one<00:02:41.190> crystal<00:02:41.730> and<00:02:41.940> one<00:02:42.810> is<00:02:43.050> for<00:02:43.080> a

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
grade level one crystal and one is for a

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.860 
grade level one crystal and one is for a
reason<00:02:43.440> that<00:02:44.070> if<00:02:44.280> I<00:02:44.430> make<00:02:44.640> more<00:02:45.000> than<00:02:45.060> one<00:02:45.300> then

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
reason that if I make more than one then

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.229 
reason that if I make more than one then
I<00:02:46.050> can<00:02:46.200> just<00:02:46.230> name<00:02:46.739> two<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.220> three<00:02:47.430> four<00:02:47.459> so<00:02:48.000> if

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
I can just name two and three four so if

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.630 
I can just name two and three four so if
so<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.110> does<00:02:49.320> it<00:02:49.560> means<00:02:49.770> that<00:02:49.920> I<00:02:50.040> don't<00:02:50.250> need<00:02:50.400> to

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
so it does it means that I don't need to

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.729 
so it does it means that I don't need to
make<00:02:50.820> I<00:02:51.090> can<00:02:51.390> make<00:02:51.570> more<00:02:51.840> crystals<00:02:52.320> than<00:02:52.530> one

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
make I can make more crystals than one

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:55.100 
make I can make more crystals than one
so<00:02:53.550> we're<00:02:53.640> gonna<00:02:53.730> select<00:02:54.120> name<00:02:54.540> this<00:02:54.810> one<00:02:54.840> as

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
so we're gonna select name this one as

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:02.330 
so we're gonna select name this one as
well<00:02:57.140> upgrade<00:02:59.000> crystal<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:00.410> two<00:03:01.410> there<00:03:02.130> we<00:03:02.190> go

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
well upgrade crystal and two there we go

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.000 
well upgrade crystal and two there we go
then<00:03:02.940> we<00:03:03.060> have<00:03:03.180> our<00:03:03.390> normal<00:03:03.989> green<00:03:04.350> crystals

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
then we have our normal green crystals

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.310 
then we have our normal green crystals
but<00:03:05.520> I<00:03:05.580> want<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:06.060> blue<00:03:06.420> crystals<00:03:06.930> over<00:03:07.140> there

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
but I want to blue crystals over there

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.660 
but I want to blue crystals over there
so<00:03:07.500> I'm<00:03:07.560> going<00:03:07.709> to<00:03:07.739> select<00:03:07.890> that<00:03:08.160> I'm<00:03:08.459> gonna

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
so I'm going to select that I'm gonna

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:15.650 
so I'm going to select that I'm gonna
fry<00:03:09.350> super<00:03:10.489> up<00:03:11.489> great<00:03:12.590> crystal<00:03:13.590> 1<00:03:14.510> i'm<00:03:15.510> going

fry super up great crystal 1 i'm going

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.260 
fry super up great crystal 1 i'm going
to<00:03:15.750> go<00:03:15.840> with<00:03:15.959> basic<00:03:16.350> there<00:03:16.950> we<00:03:17.130> go<00:03:17.310> now<00:03:17.940> we<00:03:18.000> have

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
to go with basic there we go now we have

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.150 
to go with basic there we go now we have
a<00:03:18.300> super<00:03:18.750> upgrade<00:03:19.140> crystal<00:03:19.590> and<00:03:19.800> it<00:03:19.950> will

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
a super upgrade crystal and it will

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.520 
a super upgrade crystal and it will
arrive<00:03:20.489> over<00:03:20.700> there<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.270> second<00:03:22.200> thing<00:03:22.350> what

i'm<00:03:22.620> going<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:22.830> do<00:03:23.040> is<00:03:23.070> select<00:03:23.459> that<00:03:23.670> one<00:03:23.700> i'm

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
i'm going to do is select that one i'm

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.000 
i'm going to do is select that one i'm
going<00:03:24.480> to<00:03:24.660> use<00:03:25.020> the<00:03:25.260> pace<00:03:25.530> you're<00:03:25.709> gonna<00:03:25.860> be

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
going to use the pace you're gonna be

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.250 
going to use the pace you're gonna be
just<00:03:26.220> you<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:26.459> now<00:03:26.910> there<00:03:27.360> will<00:03:27.600> erratic

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
just you and now there will erratic

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.610 
just you and now there will erratic
super<00:03:28.860> cup<00:03:29.310> crystal<00:03:30.030> as<00:03:30.150> well<00:03:30.410> there<00:03:31.410> we<00:03:31.470> go

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
super cup crystal as well there we go

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.780 
super cup crystal as well there we go
and<00:03:31.860> uh<00:03:32.660> can<00:03:33.660> correct<00:03:34.080> that<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:34.620> one<00:03:35.580> more

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
and uh can correct that and one more

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.699 
and uh can correct that and one more
thing<00:03:35.820> when<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.209> need<00:03:36.360> actual<00:03:36.660> to<00:03:36.900> do<00:03:37.620> you

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
thing when you need actual to do you

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.560 
thing when you need actual to do you
need<00:03:37.860> to<00:03:38.010> select<00:03:38.160> waypoint<00:03:38.820> more<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.330> make

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
need to select waypoint more and make

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.820 
need to select waypoint more and make
five<00:03:40.050> utd<00:03:40.739> I<00:03:40.769> side

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.449 

and<00:03:44.830> fight<00:03:45.280> it<00:03:45.310> outside<00:03:46.290> and<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:48.040> reason<00:03:48.370> is

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
and fight it outside and the reason is

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.869 
and fight it outside and the reason is
very<00:03:48.519> simple<00:03:48.810> if<00:03:49.810> there<00:03:50.650> happens<00:03:51.159> that<00:03:51.849> our

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:51.879 
very simple if there happens that our

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:55.140 
very simple if there happens that our
one<00:03:52.780> player<00:03:53.080> loses<00:03:53.379> i'm<00:03:53.830> 8<00:03:53.980> at<00:03:54.129> six<00:03:54.159> if<00:03:54.640> one

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
one player loses i'm 8 at six if one

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.690 
one player loses i'm 8 at six if one
player<00:03:55.450> loses<00:03:55.959> the<00:03:56.260> scroller<00:03:56.590> then<00:03:57.129> if<00:03:57.519> you

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
player loses the scroller then if you

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.699 
player loses the scroller then if you
press<00:03:58.239> every<00:03:58.690> button<00:03:58.720> then<00:03:59.319> he<00:03:59.530> can

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
press every button then he can

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.160 
press every button then he can
immediately<00:04:00.129> go<00:04:00.549> into<00:04:00.579> that<00:04:01.150> way<00:04:01.540> point<00:04:01.840> so

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
immediately go into that way point so

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.589 
immediately go into that way point so
you<00:04:03.010> just<00:04:03.250> need<00:04:03.430> to<00:04:03.549> make<00:04:03.700> the<00:04:03.909> SAS<00:04:04.209> home

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
you just need to make the SAS home

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.940 
you just need to make the SAS home
waypoint<00:04:06.360> so<00:04:07.360> we're<00:04:07.510> going<00:04:07.629> to<00:04:07.690> make<00:04:07.900> 21<00:04:08.530> to

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
waypoint so we're going to make 21 to

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.899 
waypoint so we're going to make 21 to
file<00:04:09.250> a<00:04:09.280> CDI<00:04:10.319> 125<00:04:11.319> RTD<00:04:12.069> our<00:04:12.250> players<00:04:12.579> to

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:12.909 
file a CDI 125 RTD our players to

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:15.180 
file a CDI 125 RTD our players to
remember<00:04:13.299> that<00:04:13.480> and<00:04:13.720> another<00:04:14.290> thing<00:04:14.440> why<00:04:15.129> this

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
remember that and another thing why this

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.210 
remember that and another thing why this
important<00:04:16.120> is<00:04:16.329> because<00:04:16.630> this<00:04:17.350> decides<00:04:17.829> how

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
important is because this decides how

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.990 
important is because this decides how
many<00:04:18.549> players<00:04:18.970> will<00:04:19.570> be<00:04:19.810> in<00:04:19.989> game<00:04:20.260> and<00:04:21.010> if<00:04:21.789> you

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
many players will be in game and if you

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
basic stuff that you need to build to

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.760 
basic stuff that you need to build to
make<00:05:07.490> your<00:05:07.700> mapper<00:05:07.970> so<00:05:08.840> blissed<00:05:09.200> you<00:05:09.350> can<00:05:09.530> use

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
a lot of texture stuff folks make

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.070 
a lot of texture stuff folks make
something<00:05:14.450> just<00:05:14.630> you<00:05:15.500> know<00:05:15.620> fun<00:05:16.130> no

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
something just you know fun no

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.310 
something just you know fun no
particular<00:05:18.080> reason

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.690 

so<00:05:22.000> it<00:05:23.000> will<00:05:23.180> be<00:05:23.210> Taipei<00:05:23.720> our<00:05:23.900> air<00:05:24.700> actually

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
so it will be Taipei our air actually

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.970 
so it will be Taipei our air actually
should<00:05:26.120> use<00:05:26.330> that<00:05:26.360> in<00:05:26.690> my<00:05:26.720> own<00:05:26.990> map<00:05:27.170> so<00:05:27.710> and

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 
should use that in my own map so and

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.680 
should use that in my own map so and
there<00:05:28.100> we<00:05:28.190> go<00:05:28.220> now<00:05:28.760> only<00:05:29.030> thing<00:05:29.300> what<00:05:29.420> is<00:05:29.510> left

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
there we go now only thing what is left

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.200 
there we go now only thing what is left
going<00:05:30.050> into<00:05:30.440> in<00:05:30.950> game<00:05:31.190> and<00:05:31.370> testing<00:05:31.730> it<00:05:31.820> out<00:05:31.910> so

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
going into in game and testing it out so

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.500 
going into in game and testing it out so
let's<00:05:32.420> go<00:05:32.570> and<00:05:32.720> test<00:05:32.870> it<00:05:32.960> out<00:05:33.970> there<00:05:34.970> we<00:05:35.090> go<00:05:35.240> and

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:35.510 
let's go and test it out there we go and

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:37.300 
let's go and test it out there we go and
we<00:05:35.720> can<00:05:35.840> see<00:05:35.870> the<00:05:36.050> tutorial<00:05:36.230> is<00:05:36.740> in<00:05:36.890> game<00:05:37.100> we

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
we can see the tutorial is in game we

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.790 
we can see the tutorial is in game we
have<00:05:37.460> a<00:05:37.490> already<00:05:38.450> made<00:05:38.720> mini<00:05:38.990> map<00:05:39.230> so<00:05:39.470> let's<00:05:39.650> go

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
have a already made mini map so let's go

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.370 
have a already made mini map so let's go
and<00:05:40.010> launch<00:05:40.310> the<00:05:40.520> game<00:05:40.930> let's<00:05:41.930> go<00:05:42.080> check<00:05:42.260> it

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
and launch the game let's go check it

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.130 
and launch the game let's go check it
out<00:05:42.910> there<00:05:43.910> we<00:05:44.000> go<00:05:44.150> and<00:05:44.420> there's<00:05:44.690> our<00:05:44.810> mission

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
out there we go and there's our mission

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.500 
out there we go and there's our mission
as<00:05:45.380> usually<00:05:46.010> starts<00:05:46.550> and<00:05:46.700> just<00:05:46.910> sent<00:05:47.120> me<00:05:47.300> down

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
as usually starts and just sent me down

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.860 
as usually starts and just sent me down
there<00:05:47.810> and<00:05:48.050> there<00:05:49.010> we<00:05:49.100> go<00:05:49.300> so<00:05:50.300> I<00:05:50.330> can<00:05:50.450> unselect

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
there and there we go so I can unselect

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.380 
there and there we go so I can unselect
the<00:05:51.080> board<00:05:51.470> I'm<00:05:51.710> gonna<00:05:51.800> put<00:05:52.040> that<00:05:52.070> there<00:05:52.430> so<00:05:53.180> as

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:53.390 
the board I'm gonna put that there so as

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:55.120 
the board I'm gonna put that there so as
you<00:05:53.540> know<00:05:53.600> this<00:05:53.990> it's<00:05:54.170> ended<00:05:54.470> me<00:05:54.590> too<00:05:54.800> far<00:05:55.010> away

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
you know this it's ended me too far away

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.220 
you know this it's ended me too far away
so<00:05:55.310> it<00:05:55.970> actually<00:05:56.150> sends<00:05:56.510> me<00:05:56.660> to<00:05:56.810> the<00:05:56.840> example

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:57.230 
so it actually sends me to the example

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.900 
so it actually sends me to the example
the<00:05:57.500> middle<00:05:57.770> so<00:05:57.920> it<00:05:57.950> means<00:05:58.250> that<00:05:58.370> i<00:05:58.490> made<00:05:58.880> that

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910 
the middle so it means that i made that

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.720 
the middle so it means that i made that
are<00:05:59.270> a<00:05:59.300> little<00:05:59.960> bit<00:06:00.140> too<00:06:00.530> long<00:06:00.830> off<00:06:01.070> the<00:06:01.460> data

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:01.730 
are a little bit too long off the data

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.120 
are a little bit too long off the data
off<00:06:02.660> the<00:06:02.720> power<00:06:03.230> but<00:06:03.440> you<00:06:03.470> can<00:06:03.740> see<00:06:03.920> right<00:06:03.950> now

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
off the power but you can see right now

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.280 
off the power but you can see right now
nicely<00:06:04.490> fact<00:06:05.030> that<00:06:05.270> there<00:06:05.480> are<00:06:05.510> off<00:06:05.840> to<00:06:06.140> that

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:06.290 
nicely fact that there are off to that

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.010 
nicely fact that there are off to that
line<00:06:06.500> as<00:06:06.620> well<00:06:06.830> so<00:06:07.370> it<00:06:07.520> looks<00:06:08.210> like<00:06:08.360> there<00:06:08.840> will

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
line as well so it looks like there will

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.560 
line as well so it looks like there will
be<00:06:09.260> a<00:06:09.290> lot<00:06:09.560> of<00:06:09.590> more<00:06:09.920> area<00:06:10.250> after<00:06:11.090> that<00:06:11.300> or<00:06:11.420> as

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570 
be a lot of more area after that or as

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.110 
be a lot of more area after that or as
well<00:06:11.810> then<00:06:12.710> we<00:06:12.800> have<00:06:12.920> a<00:06:12.950> based<00:06:13.760> offenses

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
well then we have a based offenses

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.020 
well then we have a based offenses
working<00:06:14.780> as<00:06:14.930> they<00:06:14.960> should<00:06:15.140> and<00:06:16.030> making

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
working as they should and making

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.340 
working as they should and making
barrier<00:06:17.420> so<00:06:17.750> we<00:06:17.840> got<00:06:17.990> news<00:06:18.290> on<00:06:19.930> again<00:06:20.930> move<00:06:21.140> on

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:21.350 
barrier so we got news on again move on

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.590 
barrier so we got news on again move on
with<00:06:21.530> my<00:06:21.560> MCB<00:06:22.100> now<00:06:22.310> and<00:06:22.520> we<00:06:23.000> can<00:06:23.120> see<00:06:23.360> right<00:06:23.570> now

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.600 
with my MCB now and we can see right now

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.320 
with my MCB now and we can see right now
that<00:06:23.830> there<00:06:24.830> will<00:06:25.130> be<00:06:25.160> five<00:06:25.610> for<00:06:25.850> the<00:06:25.880> middle
