00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
want to call it so that when I when I

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.250 
want to call it so that when I when I
prop<00:01:09.729> this<00:01:09.939> case<00:01:10.270> up<00:01:10.510> because<00:01:10.840> this<00:01:11.020> case

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
prop this case up because this case

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.080 
prop this case up because this case
becomes<00:01:11.619> a<00:01:11.799> stand<00:01:12.130> so<00:01:12.369> when<00:01:12.490> I<00:01:12.520> prop<00:01:12.790> up<00:01:12.939> the

becomes a stand so when I prop up the
tablet<00:01:13.540> in<00:01:13.659> the<00:01:13.810> case<00:01:14.020> I<00:01:14.200> should<00:01:14.380> say<00:01:14.590> I<00:01:14.799> can

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
tablet in the case I should say I can

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.630 
tablet in the case I should say I can
prop<00:01:15.880> it<00:01:16.060> up<00:01:16.180> in<00:01:16.659> either<00:01:17.229> direction<00:01:17.770> so<00:01:18.460> if<00:01:18.549> I

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
prop it up in either direction so if I

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.320 
prop it up in either direction so if I
want<00:01:18.909> it<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.240> to<00:01:20.140> be<00:01:20.170> propped<00:01:20.590> up<00:01:20.799> like<00:01:21.009> this<00:01:21.330> so

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
want it to to be propped up like this so

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.149 
want it to to be propped up like this so
that's<00:01:22.450> in<00:01:22.750> more<00:01:23.259> of<00:01:23.380> the<00:01:23.530> portrait

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
that's in more of the portrait

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.539 
that's in more of the portrait
orientation<00:01:24.400> versus<00:01:25.330> landscape<00:01:25.960> I<00:01:26.200> can<00:01:26.860> so<00:01:27.520> I

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
orientation versus landscape I can so I

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.640 
orientation versus landscape I can so I
can<00:01:27.729> sit<00:01:27.970> here<00:01:28.000> I<00:01:28.390> could<00:01:28.810> be<00:01:28.930> eating<00:01:29.350> a<00:01:29.470> bowl<00:01:29.619> of

portrait<00:01:42.490> orientation<00:01:42.640> for<00:01:43.149> but<00:01:43.509> then<00:01:43.630> you

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
portrait orientation for but then you

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.219 
portrait orientation for but then you

orientation<00:01:48.100> and<00:01:48.790> this<00:01:48.939> is<00:01:49.060> what<00:01:49.240> I<00:01:49.270> would<00:01:49.509> I

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
orientation and this is what I would I

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.630 
orientation and this is what I would I
would<00:01:50.020> do<00:01:50.140> my<00:01:50.290> viewing<00:01:50.619> on<00:01:50.890> if<00:01:51.130> I'm<00:01:51.250> watching<00:01:51.579> a

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
would do my viewing on if I'm watching a

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.940 
would do my viewing on if I'm watching a
movie<00:01:51.780> or<00:01:52.780> if<00:01:52.899> I'm<00:01:53.020> watching<00:01:53.170> a<00:01:53.380> youtube<00:01:53.770> video

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
movie or if I'm watching a youtube video

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.550 
movie or if I'm watching a youtube video
whatever<00:01:54.340> I'm<00:01:54.579> doing<00:01:54.880> there<00:01:55.060> so<00:01:55.869> now<00:01:55.990> I've<00:01:56.320> got

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
whatever I'm doing there so now I've got

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.959 
whatever I'm doing there so now I've got
it<00:01:56.590> like<00:01:56.860> that<00:01:57.040> and<00:01:57.310> it<00:01:57.490> could<00:01:57.610> sit<00:01:57.820> in<00:01:57.850> front

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:57.969 
it like that and it could sit in front

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:59.910 
it like that and it could sit in front
of<00:01:58.119> me<00:01:58.210> I<00:01:58.360> could<00:01:58.689> even<00:01:58.810> be<00:01:58.990> talking<00:01:59.500> to<00:01:59.770> you

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
of me I could even be talking to you

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.380 
of me I could even be talking to you
fine<00:02:00.159> folks<00:02:00.520> out<00:02:00.700> there<00:02:00.759> in<00:02:01.030> internet<00:02:01.180> land

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
fine folks out there in internet land

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.870 
fine folks out there in internet land
and<00:02:01.869> I<00:02:02.530> could<00:02:02.770> be<00:02:02.860> sitting<00:02:03.130> here<00:02:03.310> and<00:02:03.520> looking

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
and I could be sitting here and looking

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.639 
and I could be sitting here and looking
up<00:02:04.030> stuff<00:02:04.299> and<00:02:04.509> whatnot<00:02:04.689> using<00:02:05.200> this<00:02:05.290> as<00:02:05.469> like

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
up stuff and whatnot using this as like

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.850 
up stuff and whatnot using this as like
a<00:02:05.680> little<00:02:05.950> laptop<00:02:06.159> this<00:02:06.640> way<00:02:07.170> which<00:02:08.170> I<00:02:08.500> think

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
a little laptop this way which I think

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.400 
a little laptop this way which I think
actually<00:02:09.039> is<00:02:09.310> probably<00:02:09.459> a<00:02:09.670> great<00:02:10.000> idea<00:02:10.390> to<00:02:11.050> add

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
actually is probably a great idea to add

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.860 
actually is probably a great idea to add
a<00:02:11.920> keyboard<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.489> this<00:02:12.580> if<00:02:12.790> we<00:02:12.940> can<00:02:13.180> which

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
a keyboard to this if we can which

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.500 
a keyboard to this if we can which
maybe<00:02:14.049> another<00:02:14.260> video<00:02:14.560> anyways<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:16.180> then<00:02:16.390> on

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
maybe another video anyways and then on

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.759 
maybe another video anyways and then on
top<00:02:16.690> of<00:02:16.750> that<00:02:16.900> I<00:02:17.019> don't<00:02:17.230> know<00:02:17.290> if<00:02:17.379> I<00:02:17.440> showed<00:02:17.620> you

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
top of that I don't know if I showed you

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.699 
top of that I don't know if I showed you
there<00:02:17.920> -<00:02:18.099> there's<00:02:18.580> two<00:02:18.909> slots<00:02:19.690> for<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.140> angle

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
there - there's two slots for the angle

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.199 
there - there's two slots for the angle
so<00:02:21.040> you<00:02:21.129> can<00:02:21.340> have<00:02:21.519> this<00:02:21.670> on<00:02:21.879> the<00:02:22.000> two

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
so you can have this on the two

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.030 
so you can have this on the two
different<00:02:22.390> angles<00:02:23.019> so<00:02:23.080> there's<00:02:23.379> there's<00:02:23.890> the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
different angles so there's there's the

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.710 
different angles so there's there's the
first<00:02:24.220> angle<00:02:24.700> in<00:02:24.879> landscape<00:02:25.299> mode<00:02:25.330> and

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
first angle in landscape mode and

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.869 
first angle in landscape mode and
there's<00:02:26.319> the<00:02:26.470> second<00:02:26.890> angle<00:02:27.010> in<00:02:27.340> landscape

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
there's the second angle in landscape

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:30.569 
there's the second angle in landscape
mode<00:02:27.909> and<00:02:28.299> you<00:02:28.659> can<00:02:28.810> do<00:02:28.900> that<00:02:29.019> too<00:02:29.430> when<00:02:30.430> you

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
mode and you can do that too when you

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:34.080 
mode and you can do that too when you
swivel<00:02:30.909> it<00:02:31.440> so<00:02:32.440> that<00:02:32.590> it<00:02:32.709> can<00:02:32.920> be<00:02:33.040> in<00:02:33.250> in<00:02:33.760> in

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
swivel it so that it can be in in in

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.210 
swivel it so that it can be in in in
that<00:02:34.239> angle<00:02:34.840> and<00:02:35.019> then<00:02:35.500> you<00:02:35.530> could<00:02:35.739> slope<00:02:36.069> it

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
that angle and then you could slope it

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.860 
that angle and then you could slope it
even<00:02:36.459> more<00:02:36.610> depending<00:02:37.209> on<00:02:37.360> where<00:02:37.720> you're

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
even more depending on where you're

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.390 
even more depending on where you're
sitting<00:02:38.079> or<00:02:38.440> if<00:02:38.530> you're<00:02:38.709> in<00:02:38.799> bed<00:02:39.040> or<00:02:39.250> what

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
sitting or if you're in bed or what

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.509 
sitting or if you're in bed or what
you're<00:02:39.549> doing<00:02:39.790> with<00:02:39.909> it<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:41.230> how<00:02:42.010> you<00:02:42.069> want<00:02:42.430> it

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
you're doing with it and how you want it

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.180 
you're doing with it and how you want it
what<00:02:42.819> works<00:02:43.030> for<00:02:43.150> you<00:02:43.390> best<00:02:43.659> that<00:02:43.900> way<00:02:44.079> now<00:02:44.769> the

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
what works for you best that way now the

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.589 
what works for you best that way now the
other<00:02:45.310> thing<00:02:45.579> like<00:02:45.819> I<00:02:45.940> said<00:02:45.970> that's<00:02:46.329> really

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
other thing like I said that's really

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.330 
other thing like I said that's really
cool<00:02:46.780> about<00:02:46.810> this<00:02:47.260> is<00:02:47.470> when<00:02:47.620> you<00:02:47.739> close<00:02:47.980> it<00:02:48.040> up

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
cool about this is when you close it up

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.789 
cool about this is when you close it up
it's<00:02:49.030> like<00:02:49.150> when<00:02:49.599> it<00:02:49.690> has<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:49.840> has<00:02:50.200> a<00:02:50.230> cutout<00:02:50.530> for

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
it's like when it has a has a cutout for

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.500 
it's like when it has a has a cutout for
your<00:02:50.950> camera<00:02:51.370> so<00:02:51.579> you<00:02:51.790> don't<00:02:52.030> have<00:02:52.239> to<00:02:52.299> take<00:02:52.420> it

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
your camera so you don't have to take it

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.630 
your camera so you don't have to take it
out<00:02:52.599> of<00:02:52.629> the<00:02:52.780> case<00:02:52.959> to<00:02:53.109> use<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.260> camera<00:02:53.650> but

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
out of the case to use the camera but

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.360 
out of the case to use the camera but
and<00:02:55.120> and<00:02:55.420> all<00:02:55.599> the<00:02:55.810> and<00:02:56.260> all<00:02:56.590> the<00:02:56.709> buttons<00:02:57.069> -<00:02:57.340> I

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
and and all the and all the buttons - I

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.309 
and and all the and all the buttons - I
should<00:02:57.640> note<00:02:57.849> that<00:02:57.879> as<00:02:58.090> well<00:02:58.420> there's<00:02:58.659> all<00:02:59.200> the

00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 
should note that as well there's all the

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.960 
should note that as well there's all the
buttons<00:02:59.620> are<00:02:59.709> accessible<00:03:00.280> here<00:03:00.459> on<00:03:00.640> the<00:03:00.730> side

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
buttons are accessible here on the side

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.690 
buttons are accessible here on the side
even<00:03:01.329> the<00:03:01.420> infrared<00:03:01.900> if<00:03:02.049> you're<00:03:02.170> using<00:03:02.349> this

even the infrared if you're using this

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.280 
even the infrared if you're using this
but<00:03:03.700> you<00:03:03.819> can<00:03:04.000> take<00:03:04.209> the<00:03:04.390> strap<00:03:04.750> then<00:03:05.049> once

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
but you can take the strap then once

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.660 
but you can take the strap then once
you've<00:03:05.440> closed<00:03:05.739> it<00:03:05.920> and<00:03:06.040> just<00:03:06.220> pull<00:03:06.459> it<00:03:06.489> over

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
you've closed it and just pull it over

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.729 
you've closed it and just pull it over
the<00:03:06.879> side<00:03:07.060> like<00:03:07.329> that<00:03:07.359> and<00:03:07.840> it<00:03:08.290> just<00:03:08.530> it<00:03:08.709> looks

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
have the note 10 as well so I would say

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.420 
have the note 10 as well so I would say
that's<00:03:50.379> probably<00:03:50.590> that<00:03:50.829> one<00:03:51.069> of<00:03:51.160> the<00:03:51.220> best

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
that's probably that one of the best

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.250 
that's probably that one of the best
cases<00:03:51.790> on<00:03:51.910> the<00:03:52.000> market<00:03:52.359> not<00:03:52.780> that<00:03:53.019> it's<00:03:53.169> the

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
cases on the market not that it's the

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.199 
cases on the market not that it's the
absolute<00:03:53.889> best<00:03:54.160> because<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:54.669> Samsung<00:03:55.060> Galaxy

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
absolute best because the Samsung Galaxy

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.990 
absolute best because the Samsung Galaxy
makes<00:03:55.720> their<00:03:55.900> own<00:03:56.019> case<00:03:56.579> but<00:03:57.579> that<00:03:57.699> things

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
makes their own case but that things

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.300 
makes their own case but that things
like<00:03:58.209> 40<00:03:58.660> or<00:03:58.750> 50<00:03:59.139> bucks<00:03:59.410> which<00:03:59.620> is<00:03:59.650> ridiculous

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
like 40 or 50 bucks which is ridiculous

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.909 
like 40 or 50 bucks which is ridiculous
this<00:04:00.760> was<00:04:00.970> only<00:04:01.209> like<00:04:01.359> was<00:04:01.540> $10<00:04:02.049> or<00:04:02.169> under<00:04:02.199> so
