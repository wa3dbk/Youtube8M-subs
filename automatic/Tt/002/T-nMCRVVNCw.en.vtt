 strong and repellent this smell is 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.100
 nice to many people but its 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:19.210
 most do not like the smell 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.369
 [Music] 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.119
 here we see the rue plant as 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:28.180
 can see has green leaves green gray 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:31.119

 leaves are also used the flowers is 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.619
 advisable to cut twigs between 15 and 20 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.200
 centimeters which we put them to 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.990
 dry not directly to the sun but in a 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.909
 ventilated area with a temperature between 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.520
 18 to 30 degrees centigrade 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:55.640
 the leaves change in hue be the 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.830
 green turns brown and that's when 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:03.490
 we begin to crumble the leaves 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:06.130
 It is advisable not to consume more than one 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.200
 teaspoon of rue leaves in a 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.340
 quarter of a liter of water this is when 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.340
 we consume it as tea 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.060
 [Music] 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.520
 for the spread of rue 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.350
 we need the following materials 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.850
 matera 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.850
 pruning shears 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.370
 for the gardening 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.260
 watering can with water 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:39.560
 container for substrates 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:43.250
 let's proceed to propagate the rue of 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.670
 sexual way by cuttings we are going to 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:51.270
 cut the cuttings of a 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:55.190
 length of 28 centimeters 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.190
 which we do with the scissors 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.880
 we are cleaning 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.880
 and be free of twigs 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.390
 until obtaining a cutting 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.060
 once obtained the cuttings 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:17.780
 we proceed to sow in the matter the 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.510
 substrate used is a mixture of 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.750
 ground sand and rice husk 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.030
 previously disinfected which is going 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.000
 to find the propagation conditions 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:33.040
 of skiing 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:37.079
 [Music] 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.079
 we adjust the floor a little 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.370
 you have to moisten 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.879
 we leave it 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.710
 I filtered a little bit about two minutes and 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:54.320
 we proceed to plant the cuttings 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.880
 once we have the substrate ready inside 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.910
 of the matter we proceed to sow the 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.600
 cutting must not exceed 23 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.270
 centimeters 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:04.570
 the idea is to make it a slight force 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:07.810
 adjust substrate so they do not remain 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:10.710
 air mattresses that could harm us 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.570
 plant 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.580
 is the right way to plant whiskey 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.950
 there will remain about two 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.690
 months later you can leave it inside the 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.050
 matter or we pass it to the final site 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:28.129
 in the garden 

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:31.020
 [Music] 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:35.270
 ah
