crossed<00:02:24.390> out<00:02:24.540> motional<00:02:24.930> relays<00:02:25.200> but<00:02:25.470> I<00:02:25.500> find

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
crossed out motional relays but I find

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.500 
crossed out motional relays but I find
it<00:02:26.160> more<00:02:26.489> because<00:02:26.580> I<00:02:26.760> both<00:02:27.030> found<00:02:27.330> it

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
it more because I both found it

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.170 
it more because I both found it
absolutely<00:02:28.069> incredible<00:02:29.069> that<00:02:29.549> anyone<00:02:30.120> would

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
absolutely incredible that anyone would

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.430 
absolutely incredible that anyone would
even<00:02:30.299> put<00:02:30.599> such<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.840> thing<00:02:31.049> here<00:02:31.230> in

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
interpolator I swear this sort of thing

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.660 
interpolator I swear this sort of thing
happened<00:02:33.239> but<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:33.569> know<00:02:34.220> hundred<00:02:35.220> thousand

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
happened but you know hundred thousand

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.420 
happened but you know hundred thousand
people<00:02:35.700> were<00:02:36.269> massacres<00:02:37.200> in<00:02:37.799> a<00:02:37.950> place<00:02:38.190> not<00:02:38.370> far

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
people were massacres in a place not far

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.460 
people were massacres in a place not far
from<00:02:38.760> here<00:02:38.970> during<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.600> Second<00:02:39.959> World<00:02:39.989> War<00:02:40.140> so

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
from here during the Second World War so

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.840 
from here during the Second World War so
you<00:02:40.530> know<00:02:40.769> it's<00:02:41.220> not<00:02:41.370> a<00:02:41.430> place<00:02:41.640> where<00:02:41.790> things

you know it's not a place where things

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.449 
you know it's not a place where things
should<00:02:42.480> sign<00:02:42.840> but<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:43.410> guess<00:02:43.829> it<00:02:44.100> just<00:02:44.130> shows

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
should sign but I guess it just shows

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.090 
should sign but I guess it just shows
you<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:45.420> significance<00:02:46.049> of<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.859> sort<00:02:47.070> of

kind of a beacon of hope in the city
giving<00:03:44.250> people<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:45.570> then<00:03:45.690> a<00:03:45.720> pride<00:03:46.020> in

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
giving people and then a pride in

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:47.600 
giving people and then a pride in
occupying<00:03:46.680> forces<00:03:47.040> certainly<00:03:47.370> don't<00:03:47.550> want

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
occupying forces certainly don't want

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.940 
occupying forces certainly don't want
that<00:03:47.850> so<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.930> German<00:03:49.290> said<00:03:49.470> right<00:03:49.680> we're

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
that so the German said right we're

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.350 
that so the German said right we're
going<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.280> put<00:03:50.670> an<00:03:50.790> end<00:03:50.940> to<00:03:51.030> this<00:03:51.120> we're<00:03:51.300> gonna

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
don't know what would have been here

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.190 
don't know what would have been here
movies<00:03:55.800> and<00:03:55.950> fans<00:03:56.250> or<00:03:56.550> people<00:03:57.000> standing<00:03:57.930> but

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
movies and fans or people standing but

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.470 
movies and fans or people standing but
it<00:03:58.320> would<00:03:58.470> have<00:03:58.560> certainly<00:03:58.770> had<00:03:59.100> a<00:03:59.790> large

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
it would have certainly had a large

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.500 
it would have certainly had a large
audience<00:04:00.780> and<00:04:01.680> they<00:04:01.770> came<00:04:02.040> here<00:04:02.370> and<00:04:02.520> and<00:04:03.090> the

audience and they came here and and the

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.800 
audience and they came here and and the
Kiev<00:04:03.840> boys<00:04:04.020> whip<00:04:04.290> them<00:04:04.470> 53<00:04:05.370> which<00:04:06.000> flattered

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
Kiev boys whip them 53 which flattered

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:07.790 
Kiev boys whip them 53 which flattered
them<00:04:06.900> a<00:04:06.960> little<00:04:07.080> bit<00:04:07.260> they<00:04:07.380> reckon<00:04:07.680> it

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
them a little bit they reckon it

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.350 
them a little bit they reckon it
halftime<00:04:08.250> a<00:04:08.310> German<00:04:08.790> officer<00:04:08.850> might<00:04:09.270> have

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
halftime a German officer might have

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.480 
halftime a German officer might have
come<00:04:09.540> into<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:09.930> dressing<00:04:10.470> room<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:11.190> said

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
come into the dressing room and said

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.160 
come into the dressing room and said
it's<00:04:11.610> within<00:04:11.850> your<00:04:12.000> best<00:04:12.510> interest<00:04:12.930> not<00:04:13.020> to

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
it's within your best interest not to

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.310 
it's within your best interest not to
win<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.160> game<00:04:14.370> but<00:04:14.640> but<00:04:14.910> they<00:04:15.030> did<00:04:15.270> and<00:04:15.570> and<00:04:16.200> it

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
win the game but but they did and and it

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.780 
win the game but but they did and and it
goes<00:04:16.470> down<00:04:16.709> in<00:04:16.890> history<00:04:16.920> it<00:04:17.340> is<00:04:17.370> called<00:04:17.700> the

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
goes down in history it is called the

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.010 
goes down in history it is called the
death<00:04:17.970> match<00:04:18.209> which<00:04:18.390> I<00:04:18.540> think<00:04:18.780> slightly

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
death match which I think slightly

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.990 
death match which I think slightly
misleading<00:04:19.350> because<00:04:20.190> it<00:04:20.430> wasn't<00:04:20.670> as<00:04:20.760> clear

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
misleading because it wasn't as clear

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.880 
misleading because it wasn't as clear
cut<00:04:21.030> as<00:04:21.270> as<00:04:21.630> some<00:04:22.500> of<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:22.770> stories<00:04:23.490> say<00:04:23.880> but

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.120 
cut as as some of the stories say but
it's<00:04:26.030> one<00:04:27.030> of<00:04:27.180> the<00:04:27.390> great<00:04:27.720> football<00:04:28.680> stories

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
it's one of the great football stories

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.890 
it's one of the great football stories
in<00:04:29.340> the<00:04:29.580> history<00:04:29.610> of<00:04:29.970> the<00:04:30.120> game<00:04:30.270> it<00:04:30.450> really<00:04:30.480> is

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
in the history of the game it really is

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.920 
in the history of the game it really is
and<00:04:31.400> and<00:04:32.400> good<00:04:32.730> definitely<00:04:33.150> triumphs<00:04:33.780> over
