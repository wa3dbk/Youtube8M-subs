00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
airport into Coventry I think will

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.410 
airport into Coventry I think will
actually<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:02.190> will<00:01:02.340> be<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.489> real<00:01:02.699> catalyst<00:01:03.239> to

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
actually this will be a real catalyst to

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.870 
actually this will be a real catalyst to
ensuring<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.840> we<00:01:03.989> get<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> network<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.920> middle

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
ensuring that we get a network of middle

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.670 
ensuring that we get a network of middle
Metro<00:01:06.240> right<00:01:06.570> away<00:01:06.810> through<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.080> region

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
Metro right away through the region

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.010 
Metro right away through the region
I<00:01:07.710> think<00:01:08.280> once<00:01:08.520> once<00:01:08.850> people<00:01:09.180> see<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.540> tram<00:01:09.780> in

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
I think once once people see the tram in

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.050 
I think once once people see the tram in
the<00:01:10.170> city<00:01:10.380> centre<00:01:10.860> there's<00:01:11.250> no<00:01:11.460> doubt<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:11.880> my

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
the city centre there's no doubt in my

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.910 
the city centre there's no doubt in my
mind<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.689> this<00:01:13.170> lack'd<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.770> big

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
mind that this lack'd is the big

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.770 
mind that this lack'd is the big
catalyst<00:01:14.400> for<00:01:14.549> people<00:01:14.850> say<00:01:15.060> come<00:01:15.450> on<00:01:15.479> let's

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
catalyst for people say come on let's

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.539 
catalyst for people say come on let's
get<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.229> investment<00:01:16.799> right<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.369> let's

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
get this investment right and let's

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.460 
get this investment right and let's
build<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.090> network<00:01:18.509> we<00:01:18.720> really<00:01:19.020> want<00:01:19.200> for<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
build the network we really want for the

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.289 
build the network we really want for the
West<00:01:19.619> Midlands<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.790> what's<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.150> difference

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
West Midlands so what's the difference

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.690 
West Midlands so what's the difference
between<00:01:21.630> these<00:01:22.290> new<00:01:22.710> trams<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.460> old

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
between these new trams and the old

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.940 
between these new trams and the old
trams<00:01:24.119> well<00:01:24.570> these<00:01:24.900> neutrons<00:01:25.439> will<00:01:25.680> be<00:01:25.799> able

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
trams well these neutrons will be able

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.980 
trams well these neutrons will be able
to<00:01:26.100> carry<00:01:26.310> around<00:01:26.640> 25<00:01:27.420> percent<00:01:27.600> more

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
to carry around 25 percent more

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.260 
to carry around 25 percent more
passengers<00:01:28.650> that's<00:01:29.100> more<00:01:29.310> than<00:01:29.490> 200<00:01:30.090> people

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
passengers that's more than 200 people

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.840 
passengers that's more than 200 people
also<00:01:30.900> there'll<00:01:31.680> be<00:01:31.740> more<00:01:32.009> frequent<00:01:32.640> with

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
also there'll be more frequent with

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.270 
also there'll be more frequent with
trams<00:01:33.360> around<00:01:33.750> every<00:01:34.110> five<00:01:34.380> or<00:01:34.619> six<00:01:34.890> minutes

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
but how are they gonna do this well

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.410
