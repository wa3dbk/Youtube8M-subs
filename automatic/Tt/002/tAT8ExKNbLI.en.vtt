00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.099
 almost a month I settled his car for 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.190
 an overheating disorder because a 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.539

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.869
 a little bit on the internet 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.580

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.680

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.969
 mirabel the car starts to heat up 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.800
 the car was ok all the way 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.340
 time but the time comes started 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.239
 overheat then to inch of cold air 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.520

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.640
 you have it only at the servant's stop 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.489
 potted report to myself my car I 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.300
 still looks obvious to your property 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.800

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.190
 go ahead I have to fill them said before 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.830
 you were trying scholarship that gives me 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.850
 will go up on a photo l on a photo 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.850
 that gives 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:24.930
 it was very beautiful to see so 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:27.480
 there the piece that let go froze right here 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.360
 I'm just leaving here his services and his 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.460
 beautiful pieces there too so that's her 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.480
 dealers only 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.320
 unfortunately it'll be watching 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:41.310

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.280
 like that the room like it's here before 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.590
 engine revenge on that to raise 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.150
 but it connects to the referral of the 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.000
 pump if I remember of course that's 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.760
 the return of the pump refers to the support 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.830
 constant and and in the summer for the referral of 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:02.790
 the pump but anyway that's it 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:07.229

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.479

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:14.130

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.430
