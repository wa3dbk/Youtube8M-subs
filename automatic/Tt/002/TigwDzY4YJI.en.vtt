mhm 600 visor this Buster's actually

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.120 
mhm 600 visor this Buster's actually
really<00:00:19.830> gnarly<00:00:20.810> if<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:22.439> take<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.680> look<00:00:22.890> at<00:00:23.010> the

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
really gnarly if you take a look at the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.980 
really gnarly if you take a look at the
cut<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:23.820> kind<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.029> reminds<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:24.480> it

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
cut of that it kind of reminds you it

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.060 
cut of that it kind of reminds you it
reminds<00:00:25.350> me<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.890> oval<00:00:26.580> shape<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.480> knee

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
reminds me of the oval shape of the knee

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.840 
reminds me of the oval shape of the knee
of<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.340> itec<00:00:30.170> pro<00:00:31.170> wave<00:00:31.439> visor<00:00:31.800> but<00:00:32.640> it

of the itec pro wave visor but it

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.610 
of the itec pro wave visor but it
actually<00:00:33.030> what's<00:00:33.750> really<00:00:33.899> cool<00:00:34.170> about<00:00:34.230> this

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
actually what's really cool about this

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.819 
actually what's really cool about this
is<00:00:35.540> this<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.840> straight<00:00:37.200> up<00:00:37.410> here<00:00:37.620> which<00:00:37.800> is

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
is this is straight up here which is

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.560 
is this is straight up here which is
perfect<00:00:38.160> but<00:00:38.520> most<00:00:38.700> even<00:00:38.910> really<00:00:39.120> fucking<00:00:39.420> out

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
perfect but most even really fucking out

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.270 
perfect but most even really fucking out
about<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.930> high-tech<00:00:40.079> probe<00:00:40.620> wave<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.250> that

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
about the high-tech probe wave is that

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.270 
about the high-tech probe wave is that
it<00:00:41.640> has<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.090> up<00:00:42.899> here<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:43.770> automatically

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
it has this up here so it automatically

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.580

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
out of me one other really cool thing

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.660 
out of me one other really cool thing
about<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.770> this<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.280> little<00:00:50.550> bit

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
about this is that this is a little bit

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.090 
about this is that this is a little bit
longer<00:00:50.850> than<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.239> eye<00:00:51.270> tech<00:00:51.780> Pro<00:00:52.440> way<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
longer than the eye tech Pro way of the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.830 
longer than the eye tech Pro way of the
eye<00:00:53.129> tech<00:00:53.520> aviators<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.210> longest<00:00:54.600> visor

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
eye tech aviators the longest visor

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.619 
eye tech aviators the longest visor
possible<00:00:55.649> but<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.430> eye<00:00:56.460> tech<00:00:56.789> per<00:00:57.000> wave<00:00:57.270> is

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
possible but the eye tech per wave is

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.869 
possible but the eye tech per wave is
one<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.710> shortest<00:00:59.010> most<00:00:59.609> there's

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
one of the shortest most there's

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.790 
one of the shortest most there's
everyone's<00:01:00.420> also<00:01:00.870> especially<00:01:01.440> we've<00:01:01.590> got

with<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:01.949> big<00:01:02.190> nose<00:01:02.430> because<00:01:03.059> it's<00:01:03.210> just

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
with the big nose because it's just

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.719 
with the big nose because it's just
going<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.539> cover<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.080> I'm<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:05.339> know<00:01:05.369> it's

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
going to cover and I'm you know it's

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.140 
going to cover and I'm you know it's
gonna<00:01:05.880> suck<00:01:06.979> now<00:01:07.979> on<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.549> details<00:01:08.729> about

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150

time for for you don't hate those visors

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.420 
time for for you don't hate those visors
to<00:01:21.840> be<00:01:21.990> that's<00:01:22.200> what<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.500> was<00:01:22.619> pretty<00:01:22.799> big<00:01:23.070> over

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
to be that's what it was pretty big over

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.810 
to be that's what it was pretty big over
and<00:01:23.640> female<00:01:24.450> Europe<00:01:24.810> Europe<00:01:25.560> leave<00:01:25.830> but<00:01:26.189> you

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
and female Europe Europe leave but you

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.070 
and female Europe Europe leave but you
know<00:01:26.970> over<00:01:27.180> here<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.540> was<00:01:27.659> kind<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.900> hard<00:01:28.049> to

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
know over here it was kind of hard to

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.929 
know over here it was kind of hard to
get<00:01:28.229> into<00:01:28.290> them<00:01:28.650> though<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.549> wise<00:01:29.759> there's

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
get into them though this wise there's

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.370 
get into them though this wise there's
pretty<00:01:30.150> good<00:01:30.299> as<00:01:30.390> far<00:01:30.420> as<00:01:30.600> protection<00:01:31.110> I've

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
pretty good as far as protection I've

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.499 
pretty good as far as protection I've
taken<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.770> few<00:01:31.799> parks<00:01:32.340> off<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.759> off<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.119> visor

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
taken a few parks off the off the visor

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.270 
taken a few parks off the off the visor
and<00:01:33.780> it's<00:01:34.020> really<00:01:34.290> good<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.189> the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
and it's really good this is the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.010 
and it's really good this is the
shortest<00:01:35.670> part<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.030> believe<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.479> about<00:01:36.810> two<00:01:36.990> and

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
shortest part I believe is about two and

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.350 
shortest part I believe is about two and
a<00:01:37.200> half<00:01:37.380> inches<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.070> over<00:01:38.759> here<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.180> lot

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
a half inches and over here is a lot

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.080 
a half inches and over here is a lot
furthest<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.990> mean<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.259> covers<00:01:40.650> down<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:41.159> you

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
furthest I mean this covers down to you

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.639 
furthest I mean this covers down to you
know<00:01:42.180> below<00:01:42.450> my<00:01:42.630> cheek<00:01:42.869> bone<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.320> it's<00:01:43.439> great

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
know below my cheek bone so it's great

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.929 
know below my cheek bone so it's great
think<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.490> as<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.610> coverage<00:01:45.090> of<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:46.939> saving

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
think of it as a coverage of a saving

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.530 
think of it as a coverage of a saving
Oakley<00:01:48.930> pro<00:01:49.439> modified<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:51.210> one<00:01:51.390> is
