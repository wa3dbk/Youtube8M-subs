00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 an anime in which the love of 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.899
 stepbrothers has no limits and it's up to 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.830
 a little sickly unanimous that although 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.240
 seems to have incest does not have it 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:17.719
 unanimously that the xxi scenes are 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.719
 countless an animal called keys for 6 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:37.550
 [Music] 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.800
 before the video starts I want 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.260
 inform them that if this video is not 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.120
 associated with the time account by 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.490
 please report it for missing the 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.070
 good copyrights well now to 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.559
 all as they are I hope that well as 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.280
 some will know and perhaps others will not 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.860
 interese I am daily as I had them 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.440
 reiterated before this type of videos the 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.960
 perform in almost two reviews per month 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.479
 because I'm not getting too much left 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.119
 time but in any case not the 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.550
 I'll leave youtube community and 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.460
 as the previous criticism I did almost the 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.640
 last week I guess this will be the 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.860
 last of this month and as you already know from 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.470
 that I'm going to talk to myself better let's start 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.810
 at once 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.760
 the anime is about the twins to 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.520
 rich colin that always beset 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.310
 constantly to his brother keita and that 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.650
 although it seems like I said before something 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.530
 this myth is not because the twins 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.990
 that rich come other parents only 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.390
 that his father abandoned them and the mother of 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.520
 keita abandoned him to this one so his 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.560
 parents of both came together and it is 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.870
 married and in fact these three live 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.730
 together 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.920
 the story is explaining that although 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.990
 they want to have that both 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.930
 work together to eliminate any 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.300
 another girl who approaches itself both 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.430
 they try to fight because she but both 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.440
 they realize that that is not the way 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.410
 and they are doing it wrong 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.600
 and well, that's where his story is free to 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.420
 start as the first chapters 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.910
 of the moon this can not be explained very 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.490
 well when I started seeing it I thought that 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.070
 it was one of those extremely rare series 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:21.160
 Chinese who keep the damn mistake do not 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.110
 do it was Japanese xd good what 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.360
 I want to explain is that when I saw the 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.610
 intentions of the sack and rich twins 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.220
 to his brother immediately I was 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.470
 came to mind the idea of ​​incest and if 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.840
 it's not that a friend tells me that they do not 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.450
 They had no consanguineous link 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.940
 they play and nectar like that 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.489
 what I'm saying is that if an anime wants 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.650
 get to get many works as it is 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.019
 doing sometimes at least 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.060
 I have to explain very well how the 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.700
 plot and the characters until the 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.370
 first two or up to three chapters but 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.890
 in this one he finds out completely how 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.780
 is the story from chapter 7 to 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.970
 9 and you only have three or four left 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.060
 chapters so you can enjoy the topic at 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.790
 100% which is for itself apart from being a 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.370
 exile at a step fan service I think it's 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.560
 passes two issues in this accepted that 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.660
 pitifully many before these 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.849
 times necessarily have to 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.549
 contain some risque scenes 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.590
 so that some types of people do not 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.920
 sleep while watching the anime because 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.200
 only interested in giving them see the romance 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.599
 I love but there are also some 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.970
 people that we are not so interested in seeing 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:32.220
 this but the plot and to raze the 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.099
 story in mind in addition these scenes 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.799
 every five seconds in my opinion and 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.190
 although accepting that they contain some 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.010
 for 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.260
 can solve these are others already 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.720
 almost these scenes are becoming 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.520
 in the game filled with this new era 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:52.030
 in friends 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:54.520
 happening in front of me something very interesting 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.380
 and good about this is that although the 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.900
 history is not very clear to the 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.780
 first chapters this goes from little to 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.880
 little letting you understand could you say 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.980
 that the story is very synchronized 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.770
 according to what is happening in the plot 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.930
 from this is to say arms are appearing 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.420
 of the story that happened before with the 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.550
 protas according to the plot is becoming 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.709
 more interesting or need it 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:21.130
 truly for when the anime has 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:23.290
 come to that part in plot something else 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.870
 good of the mls of the events that 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.800
 realize this are not exits from the 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.680
 nothing like in some series 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.169
 that is to say in many years that I have seen 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.759
 whenever they finish something like a party 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.520
 or after having made an interest 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:39.949
 new character to the distribution of water almost 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:42.169
 always happens in an electorate in the 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:44.300
 which many times discarded that it does not have 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.639
 almost nothing to do with the story but 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.740
 that however these angels need 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:51.020
 of these elements exist for the 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.419
 ties between the anime characters are 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.030
 get stronger but this child does not 

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:58.430
 he needs them almost at all and 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.069
 although there are some things similar to 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.110
 these will be for the same purpose but in 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:06.080
 kish in case is at least the cons 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:09.319
 extreme as in others according to my 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.620
 qualification to design environments 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:15.639
 I put an 80 out of 100 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:19.479
 in credibility I give an 82 in design 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:23.199
 of personality I give an 83 in terms of 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:26.639
 art and anime drawing I give an 81 and in 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:30.280
 story and plot I give an 82 of 100 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:33.130
 giving a final score of 82 points 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.880
 100 giving him the honorary degree of very 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.880
 good and recommendable 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.970
 now I forgot good as you 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.490

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.560
