00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.040 
vocals now I'm going to show you two
methods<00:00:48.040> of<00:00:48.550> doing<00:00:48.880> that<00:00:49.059> if<00:00:49.239> one<00:00:49.600> does<00:00:49.840> not

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
methods of doing that if one does not

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.470 
methods of doing that if one does not
work<00:00:50.380> for<00:00:50.620> any<00:00:50.890> particular<00:00:51.160> track<00:00:51.700> the<00:00:52.210> other

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
work for any particular track the other

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.070 
work for any particular track the other
should<00:00:52.840> probably<00:00:53.200> I<00:00:53.680> mean<00:00:53.950> definitely<00:00:54.250> work

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.080 
should probably I mean definitely work

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.020 
should probably I mean definitely work
so<00:00:56.080> let's<00:00:56.380> get<00:00:56.530> started<00:00:56.920> we<00:00:57.100> need<00:00:57.280> to<00:00:57.400> get<00:00:57.730> into

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
so let's get started we need to get into

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.229 
so let's get started we need to get into
effect<00:00:58.450> the<00:00:58.750> first<00:00:58.930> one<00:00:59.170> is<00:00:59.320> pretty<00:00:59.530> easy<00:00:59.860> and

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
effect the first one is pretty easy and

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.960 
effect the first one is pretty easy and
click<00:01:01.239> and<00:01:01.449> vocal<00:01:01.900> remover<00:01:02.379> and<00:01:02.610> with<00:01:03.610> all<00:01:03.850> the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
click and vocal remover and with all the

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.250 
click and vocal remover and with all the
default<00:01:04.330> settings<00:01:04.390> we're<00:01:04.870> going<00:01:05.019> to<00:01:05.080> click<00:01:05.230> on

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
default settings we're going to click on

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.400 
default settings we're going to click on
okay<00:01:05.940> so<00:01:06.940> this<00:01:07.390> should<00:01:07.600> probably<00:01:07.870> remove

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
okay so this should probably remove

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.500 
okay so this should probably remove
everything<00:01:08.980> almost<00:01:09.220> all<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:09.970> vocals<00:01:10.330> but

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
everything almost all the vocals but

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.110 
everything almost all the vocals but
then<00:01:10.840> this<00:01:11.470> is<00:01:11.530> not<00:01:11.830> going<00:01:12.100> to<00:01:12.250> remove<00:01:12.490> that

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
then this is not going to remove that

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.960 
then this is not going to remove that
perfectly<00:01:13.930> you<00:01:14.200> will<00:01:14.230> still<00:01:14.710> hear<00:01:14.980> the<00:01:15.550> vocals

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
perfectly you will still hear the vocals

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.780 
perfectly you will still hear the vocals
like<00:01:16.300> me<00:01:16.570> it's<00:01:16.780> good<00:01:17.320> for<00:01:17.560> all<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:18.010> karaoke

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.300 
like me it's good for all the karaoke
purposes<00:01:19.330> but<00:01:19.540> not<00:01:19.750> completely<00:01:20.650> complete

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:33.900 
purposes but not completely complete
extraction<00:01:21.850> of<00:01:21.940> the<00:01:22.030> background<00:01:22.420> music<00:01:32.910> so

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910
