happens is when you roll over
that<00:02:01.060> water<00:02:01.420> will<00:02:01.600> act<00:02:01.780> as<00:02:01.960> glue<00:02:02.140> and<00:02:02.800> it<00:02:03.760> will

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
that water will act as glue and it will

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.760 
that water will act as glue and it will
stick<00:02:04.120> these<00:02:04.240> guys<00:02:04.480> together<00:02:04.750> and<00:02:05.200> I<00:02:05.500> like<00:02:05.650> to

know fold it up and do a crown or you

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.740 
know fold it up and do a crown or you
can<00:02:14.590> do<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:14.770> crinkle<00:02:15.220> thing<00:02:15.490> like<00:02:15.790> you<00:02:16.480> fold

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
can do the crinkle thing like you fold

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.830 
can do the crinkle thing like you fold
side<00:02:17.670> options<00:02:18.670> so<00:02:18.820> many<00:02:19.000> options<00:02:19.180> you<00:02:19.600> can<00:02:19.720> do

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
here is we've got a cast iron you can

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.670 
here is we've got a cast iron you can
use<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.209> regular<00:02:43.570> pan<00:02:43.780> cast<00:02:44.140> irons<00:02:44.440> are<00:02:44.530> great

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
use a regular pan cast irons are great

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.750 
use a regular pan cast irons are great
though<00:02:44.800> because<00:02:44.890> they<00:02:45.040> hold<00:02:45.220> the<00:02:45.370> heat<00:02:45.550> and

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
though because they hold the heat and

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.310 
though because they hold the heat and
when<00:02:45.850> you're<00:02:45.970> frying<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.810> heats<00:02:46.959> gonna<00:02:47.170> want

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
when you're frying the heats gonna want

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.840 
when you're frying the heats gonna want
to<00:02:47.380> go<00:02:47.470> like<00:02:47.620> this<00:02:47.830> up<00:02:48.100> and<00:02:48.310> down<00:02:48.400> and<00:02:48.670> up<00:02:48.730> and

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
to go like this up and down and up and

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.070 
to go like this up and down and up and
down<00:02:48.940> up<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:49.330> down<00:02:49.420> because<00:02:49.690> you're<00:02:49.930> putting

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
down up and down because you're putting

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.020 
down up and down because you're putting
in<00:02:50.290> stuff<00:02:50.440> so<00:02:51.220> it's<00:02:51.340> nice<00:02:51.489> to<00:02:51.520> have<00:02:51.730> a<00:02:51.790> cast

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
in stuff so it's nice to have a cast

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.240 
in stuff so it's nice to have a cast
iron<00:02:52.270> and<00:02:52.900> what<00:02:53.050> you<00:02:53.170> do<00:02:53.350> is<00:02:53.500> you<00:02:53.590> test<00:02:53.830> it<00:02:54.070> and

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
iron and what you do is you test it and

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.460 
iron and what you do is you test it and
we're<00:02:55.209> actually<00:02:55.300> doing<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.660> shallow<00:02:55.870> fry<00:02:56.080> so

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
we're actually doing a shallow fry so

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.900 
we're actually doing a shallow fry so
instead<00:02:56.650> of<00:02:56.709> using<00:02:56.890> a<00:02:57.100> ton<00:02:57.280> of<00:02:57.310> oil<00:02:57.550> and<00:02:57.790> deep

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
instead of using a ton of oil and deep

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.390 
instead of using a ton of oil and deep
fryer<00:02:58.150> you<00:02:58.660> just<00:02:58.840> put<00:02:59.080> about<00:02:59.200> a<00:02:59.650> half<00:02:59.800> an<00:03:00.250> inch

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
fryer you just put about a half an inch

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.590 
fryer you just put about a half an inch
of<00:03:00.489> oil<00:03:00.670> in<00:03:00.910> there<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.090> it<00:03:01.300> will<00:03:01.360> fry

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
of oil in there and it will fry

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.000 
of oil in there and it will fry
perfectly<00:03:02.110> this<00:03:02.230> actually<00:03:02.620> brings<00:03:02.860> up

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
perfectly this actually brings up

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.920 
perfectly this actually brings up
