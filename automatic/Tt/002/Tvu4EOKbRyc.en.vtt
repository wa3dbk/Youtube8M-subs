of the days when I was really little I

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.660 
of the days when I was really little I
looked<00:00:55.260> up<00:00:55.470> in<00:00:55.650> the<00:00:55.739> school<00:00:56.040> look<00:00:56.220> huge<00:00:56.460> like

pretty crappy hillbilly towns so they

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:03.740 
pretty crappy hillbilly towns so they
actually<00:01:02.159> weren't<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.580> great<00:01:02.909> and<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.449> didn't

very<00:01:07.920> interesting<00:01:08.190> and<00:01:08.490> then<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.700> back<00:01:08.909> of

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
very interesting and then the back of

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:09.680 
very interesting and then the back of
the<00:01:09.210> building

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
the building

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.120 
the building
I<00:01:09.720> love<00:01:10.080> how<00:01:10.200> it's<00:01:10.290> got<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.500> kind<00:01:10.619> of<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.799> exit

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
I love how it's got the kind of the exit

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.830 
I love how it's got the kind of the exit
and<00:01:11.430> runs<00:01:11.580> out<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.880> reminds<00:01:12.119> me<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> little<00:01:12.510> TV

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
and runs out it reminds me a little TV

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.550 
and runs out it reminds me a little TV
show<00:01:12.869> like<00:01:13.140> resets<00:01:13.620> I<00:01:13.770> think<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.040> was<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.430> I

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
show like resets I think it was and I

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.870 
show like resets I think it was and I
used<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.680> love<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.040> show<00:01:17.100> when<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.490> was<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.640> kid

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
I loved it and this kind of makes me

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.710 
I loved it and this kind of makes me
think<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.550> that<00:01:20.610> school<00:01:20.940> in<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.210> building<00:01:21.420> I

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
think of that school in that building I

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.000 
think of that school in that building I
don't<00:01:22.080> know<00:01:22.170> if<00:01:22.260> it<00:01:22.350> actually<00:01:22.650> looked<00:01:22.890> in

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
don't know if it actually looked in

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.470 
don't know if it actually looked in
anything<00:01:23.520> like<00:01:23.760> that<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:24.060> course<00:01:24.090> it's<00:01:24.360> been

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
anything like that of course it's been

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.550 
anything like that of course it's been
years<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.810> years<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.080> years<00:01:25.290> since<00:01:25.440> I've

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
years and years and years since I've

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.830 
years and years and years since I've
seen<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.800> but<00:01:25.980> it<00:01:26.820> still<00:01:26.910> makes<00:01:27.450> me<00:01:27.630> think<00:01:27.810> of

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
seen that but it still makes me think of

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.570 
seen that but it still makes me think of
that<00:01:27.990> for<00:01:28.170> some<00:01:28.200> reason<00:01:28.320> so<00:01:29.130> as<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.310> can<00:01:29.400> see

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
that for some reason so as you can see

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.610 
that for some reason so as you can see
the<00:01:29.700> back<00:01:29.910> yard<00:01:30.540> here<00:01:30.780> we<00:01:30.930> kind<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.140> have<00:01:31.200> a

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
the back yard here we kind of have a

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.560 
the back yard here we kind of have a
basketball<00:01:32.550> court<00:01:32.850> we<00:01:33.030> got<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.180> Foursquare

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
basketball court we got a Foursquare

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.080 
basketball court we got a Foursquare
area<00:01:34.080> which<00:01:34.290> was<00:01:34.740> dominant<00:01:35.280> at<00:01:35.430> my<00:01:35.640> school<00:01:36.060> I

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
area which was dominant at my school I

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.030 
area which was dominant at my school I
tell<00:01:36.510> you<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.660> was<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.870> beast<00:01:37.200> at<00:01:37.380> Foursquare<00:01:37.740> and

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
tell you I was a beast at Foursquare and

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.090 
tell you I was a beast at Foursquare and
then<00:01:38.520> over<00:01:38.910> here<00:01:38.940> we<00:01:39.840> have<00:01:39.870> some<00:01:40.320> swings<00:01:40.710> as

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
then over here we have some swings as

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.170 
then over here we have some swings as
well<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.460> one<00:01:41.550> thing<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.730> want<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.910> point<00:01:42.030> out

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
well and one thing I want to point out

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.420 
well and one thing I want to point out
is<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.390> grass<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.230> think<00:01:43.620> the<00:01:43.710> grass<00:01:44.040> looks

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
is the grass I think the grass looks

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.750 
is the grass I think the grass looks
really<00:01:45.000> cool<00:01:45.210> too<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.510> like<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:45.900> design<00:01:46.200> that

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
really cool too I like that design that

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.480 
really cool too I like that design that
kind<00:01:46.940> of<00:01:47.000> smooth<00:01:47.660> Dover<00:01:48.260> freshly<00:01:49.190> cut<00:01:49.460> grass

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
kind of smooth Dover freshly cut grass

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.360 
kind of smooth Dover freshly cut grass
just<00:01:50.240> adds<00:01:50.450> to<00:01:50.720> the<00:01:50.900> preppy<00:01:51.650> effect<00:01:52.010> in<00:01:52.160> this

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
just adds to the preppy effect in this

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.160 
just adds to the preppy effect in this
school<00:01:52.730> so<00:01:52.970> again<00:01:53.480> just<00:01:53.510> a<00:01:53.720> really<00:01:54.020> cool

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
assignment leave most of the inside for

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.190 
assignment leave most of the inside for
you<00:01:55.970> to<00:01:56.090> check<00:01:56.240> out<00:01:56.360> but<00:01:56.780> I'm<00:01:56.840> going<00:01:56.960> to<00:01:57.020> show

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
you just one classroom you know we're

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.240 
you just one classroom you know we're
going<00:01:59.120> to<00:01:59.210> go<00:01:59.270> in<00:01:59.420> this<00:01:59.930> back<00:02:00.590> door<00:02:00.830> here<00:02:01.070> which

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.440 
detail in this map that I really like
that's<00:03:00.740> a<00:03:00.980> little<00:03:01.400> odd<00:03:01.580> looking<00:03:01.910> up<00:03:02.000> there<00:03:02.270> but
