lower than the procedure just because

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
not everybody wants to get the quadrotor

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.740 
not everybody wants to get the quadrotor
not<00:03:17.650> everybody<00:03:17.980> has<00:03:18.130> money<00:03:18.460> to<00:03:18.520> pay<00:03:18.760> for<00:03:18.790> 149

not everybody has money to pay for 149

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.840 
not everybody has money to pay for 149
99<00:03:19.960> which<00:03:20.710> is<00:03:20.800> I'm<00:03:20.950> only<00:03:21.130> assuming<00:03:21.310> that<00:03:21.610> would

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
99 which is I'm only assuming that would

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.230 
99 which is I'm only assuming that would
be<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.060> price<00:03:22.270> but<00:03:23.200> um<00:03:23.380> I<00:03:23.710> think<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.790> part<00:03:25.150> in

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:25.240 
be the price but um I think the part in

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.310 
be the price but um I think the part in
this<00:03:25.300> would<00:03:25.480> be<00:03:25.570> a<00:03:25.600> hundred<00:03:25.750> bucks<00:03:25.960> but<00:03:26.290> I

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
this would be a hundred bucks but I

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.420 
this would be a hundred bucks but I
don't<00:03:26.500> know<00:03:26.560> what<00:03:26.680> that<00:03:26.710> what<00:03:27.100> that<00:03:27.130> would

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
don't know what that what that would

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.860 
don't know what that what that would
come<00:03:27.610> with<00:03:27.640> I<00:03:27.970> would<00:03:28.270> assume<00:03:28.360> where<00:03:28.630> we<00:03:28.720> come

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
come with I would assume where we come

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.360 
come with I would assume where we come
with<00:03:29.110> the<00:03:29.200> soundtrack<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.830> coin<00:03:30.070> and
