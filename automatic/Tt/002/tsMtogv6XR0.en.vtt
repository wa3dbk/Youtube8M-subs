00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
Wi-Fi off I don't like that but again if

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.199 
Wi-Fi off I don't like that but again if
you<00:03:07.020> are<00:03:07.170> using<00:03:07.410> Wi-Fi<00:03:07.830> calling<00:03:08.310> you<00:03:08.730> need<00:03:09.030> to

you are using Wi-Fi calling you need to
have<00:03:09.390> that<00:03:09.420> but<00:03:10.320> there's<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.860> trick<00:03:11.070> if

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
have that but there's the trick if

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.270 
have that but there's the trick if

need<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:15.000> have<00:03:15.209> that<00:03:15.480> so<00:03:15.930> let's<00:03:16.530> change<00:03:16.799> it<00:03:16.980> to

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
need to have that so let's change it to
