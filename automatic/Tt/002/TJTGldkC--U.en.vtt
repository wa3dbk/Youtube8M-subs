00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:04.149
 yes hello here is Emma Byrne of multimedia dubbed in this boxing 

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:08.710
 Video I pack my new camera from the Sony HD he Alex 2000 w 

00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:12.279
 and I can now open the packaging 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:22.710
 and here are the included cables 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.310
 You can see the teams asparagus 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.900
 and the charger that you then directly into the camera connects 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.630
 then crawl a component 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.230
 the usb cable 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.840
 Staudt go on with all the instructions for use and papers 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.840
 were there 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.030
 here once in addition, and here the different languages 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.140
 instructions for use 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.140
 including German 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.700
 then there are still 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.570
 once the Ako 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.170
 this is the smallest version of the 3a COS available 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.700
 and the remote control 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.550
 and then there is still the privacy of the viewfinder 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.540
 now to the camera 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.620
 the packaging material still off 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.900
 and here's the Sony he had as a 2000 thing missing, of course 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.470
 the foil off 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.830
 and there she is 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.830
 and now I'll show you the camera again from the side 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.940
 Up here Vauxhall goes up he's small LCD screen 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.700
 and again from the side 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.610
 he now again it makes sense what was there and what was included 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.330
 It is once the honor camera itself 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.420
 then the change crawl edition lived 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.420
 USB cable components Korbel 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.640
 Instruction manual remote control Orco soffit protection and the DVD 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.839
 Hero that was growing video I know that the camera is very good pictures 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:16.729
 I've already tried it and I speak the text 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:19.659
 now just dubbing Heiner beautiful many settings options 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.749
 such as focus or shutter 

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:26.199
 Of course, there are many more options, such as zoom 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:29.489
 Wrestling or wrestling or six programmable keys 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.200
 Of course I can say a lot more, but I think that would 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.529
 the timeframe pretty much 

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:39.499
 Well, I'll tell you two little things now, and there are 2xl he 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:42.889
 Connections the two channels speak left and right one can separately 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:46.999
 You can either edit Xella 1 for the left and Insua 2 for the 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:49.339
 adjust right channel or you can also 

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:53.079
 Series 1 for both no light and you can still 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.939
 the microphone as left, so the integrated microphone as the left channel 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:59.659
 or between or as both 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:03.140
 the second feature would bring the weakness breeding closer this is moz lol 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:07.489
 Chord Functions in the function takes the camera for 6 seconds with 200 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:08.869
 Frames per second 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:11.739
 and stretched Dirrell for about 24 seconds 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.170
 but enough now I hope that on Boxing Day the other stuff will fall and until the 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:15.970
 Next time, look
