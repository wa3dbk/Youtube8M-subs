here<00:05:02.900> and<00:05:02.990> then<00:05:03.440> you<00:05:03.530> did<00:05:03.680> that<00:05:03.830> know<00:05:04.039> what<00:05:04.310> you

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
here and then you did that know what you

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.500 
here and then you did that know what you
want<00:05:04.550> to<00:05:04.580> do<00:05:04.700> is<00:05:04.789> put<00:05:04.940> your<00:05:05.030> left<00:05:05.210> foot<00:05:05.300> out

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
want to do is put your left foot out

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.150 
want to do is put your left foot out
here<00:05:05.539> oh<00:05:05.840> so<00:05:06.169> that<00:05:06.289> you<00:05:06.380> can<00:05:06.530> push<00:05:06.710> like<00:05:06.950> that

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
here oh so that you can push like that

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.310 
here oh so that you can push like that
and<00:05:07.430> then<00:05:07.970> put<00:05:08.240> your<00:05:08.360> foot<00:05:08.539> on<00:05:08.570> to<00:05:08.780> here<00:05:09.020> see

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
and then put your foot on to here see

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:17.409 
and then put your foot on to here see
what<00:05:09.410> I<00:05:09.470> mean<00:05:15.639> transition<00:05:16.639> and<00:05:16.880> then<00:05:17.090> put<00:05:17.300> your

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:17.419 
what I mean transition and then put your

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:19.300 
what I mean transition and then put your
foot<00:05:17.599> on<00:05:17.630> don't<00:05:18.380> worry<00:05:18.560> you<00:05:18.710> have<00:05:18.740> nothing<00:05:19.160> to

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
foot on don't worry you have nothing to

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.010 
foot on don't worry you have nothing to
slide<00:05:19.550> back<00:05:19.729> into<00:05:19.789> you<00:05:20.300> could<00:05:20.449> slide<00:05:20.630> back<00:05:20.840> for

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
slide back into you could slide back for

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.450 
slide back into you could slide back for
like<00:05:21.139> that<00:05:21.320> do<00:05:21.500> I<00:05:21.560> put<00:05:21.740> my<00:05:21.800> next<00:05:22.250> one<00:05:22.430> up<00:05:22.580> there

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
like that do I put my next one up there

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.040 
like that do I put my next one up there
once<00:05:25.460> you're<00:05:25.729> sitting<00:05:26.060> down<00:05:26.090> then<00:05:26.720> you<00:05:26.870> put

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
once you're sitting down then you put

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.629 
once you're sitting down then you put
your<00:05:27.169> right<00:05:27.320> foot<00:05:27.349> on<00:05:27.680> the<00:05:27.830> thing<00:05:28.039> you<00:05:28.460> have<00:05:28.580> to

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
your right foot on the thing you have to

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.390 
your right foot on the thing you have to
sit<00:05:28.880> down<00:05:28.940> first<00:05:29.349> it's<00:05:30.349> a<00:05:30.470> bit<00:05:30.590> of<00:05:30.710> a<00:05:30.800> leap<00:05:31.250> of

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
sit down first it's a bit of a leap of

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.770 
sit down first it's a bit of a leap of
faith<00:05:31.639> but<00:05:31.820> it<00:05:31.970> used<00:05:32.090> to<00:05:32.210> be<00:05:32.330> way<00:05:32.510> harder

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
faith but it used to be way harder

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.320 
faith but it used to be way harder
remember<00:05:33.289> before<00:05:33.470> I<00:05:33.650> add<00:05:33.740> that<00:05:33.770> dead<00:05:34.520> that<00:05:35.030> is

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
remember before I add that dead that is

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.570 
remember before I add that dead that is
like<00:05:35.900> an<00:05:36.110> ingenious<00:05:36.680> part<00:05:36.979> of<00:05:37.130> drift<00:05:37.370> triking

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
like an ingenious part of drift triking

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.460 
like an ingenious part of drift triking
that<00:05:37.880> little<00:05:38.120> bar<00:05:38.270> I<00:05:38.300> put<00:05:38.539> there<00:05:38.720> I<00:05:38.930> haven't

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
that little bar I put there I haven't

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.500 
that little bar I put there I haven't
seen<00:05:39.680> anyone<00:05:39.979> else<00:05:40.099> use<00:05:40.520> that<00:05:40.729> bar<00:05:40.970> and<00:05:41.210> man

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
seen anyone else use that bar and man

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.810 
seen anyone else use that bar and man
does<00:05:41.720> it<00:05:41.870> make<00:05:41.990> it<00:05:42.080> a<00:05:42.139> million<00:05:42.289> times<00:05:42.410> easier

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:42.820 
does it make it a million times easier

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.210 
does it make it a million times easier
transition

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:46.220 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.190 

yeah<00:05:46.970> don't<00:05:47.830> nice<00:05:49.480> got<00:05:50.480> a<00:05:50.510> bit<00:05:50.690> of<00:05:50.810> resistance

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200 
yeah don't nice got a bit of resistance

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.040 
yeah don't nice got a bit of resistance
before<00:05:51.620> I<00:05:51.830> starts<00:05:52.190> to<00:05:52.280> drift<00:05:52.600> it's<00:05:53.600> got<00:05:53.780> a<00:05:53.810> bit

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
before I starts to drift it's got a bit

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:55.810 
before I starts to drift it's got a bit
of<00:05:54.170> resistance<00:05:54.500> before<00:05:54.890> it<00:05:55.160> starts<00:05:55.430> to<00:05:55.490> drift

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:55.820 
of resistance before it starts to drift

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.450
