00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 good afternoon everyone this is another issue in 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.510
 As a section of the release of our first 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.440
 stories about windows 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.900
 dedicated total aluminum llama 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.160
 the previous issue we talked about 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.050
 plastic windows about their pros and cons 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.060
 absolutely in the same format we will do and 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.680
 now 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.330
 what are windows themselves 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.849
 aluminum windows aluminum 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:33.030
 are an aluminum profile 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:35.280
 but if the aluminum profile was completely 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.860
 well, that is, you would be exclusively 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.540
 whether from this on his profile they would be 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.160
 absolutely not meant for 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.260
 operating in our climate 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.570
 because my aluminum is practically 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.020
 100 percent thermal conductivity if 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.660
 you were made entirely of aluminum in general 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.449
 they either froze right through 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:59.010
 absolutely therefore windows are used 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:02.100
 special more peaceful stakes i you 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.100
 Now I will show on the example of the sample which 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.780
 I have here is an example of not quite 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.330
 let's say standard aluminum 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.189
 the system is a sample and any wooden 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.500
 systems that is a system which 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.770
 inside has decorative wooden 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.720
 such squatting which allow 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.140
 perceive this window from the room as 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.549
 wooden window such a system too 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.030
 there is a little talk about them there 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.090
 seem to be 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.909
 about and talked about in terms of 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.030
 polyamide machine that is it is plastic 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.310
 special very hard who share 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.560
 outer and inner side of the profile 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.689
 answer components 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.820
 the principle is very simple how cold it is 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.530
 goes goes goes here is chosen in topic 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.659
 thermo insulating plastic like 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.280
 further he does not pass that is logic 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.850
 the handle then she is so if we talk about 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.070
 pros 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.810
 aluminum window army doom it 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.000
 definitely super reliable i mean 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.340
 aluminum you got that metal he doesn't 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.210
 rust does not oxidize practically if 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.390
 He normally processed painted very 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.819
 stable there can not be 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:11.790
 any change in geometric terms 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.500
 profile sag if they say 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.150
 naturally extension associated with 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.799
 heating or cooling in general for 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.540
 a huge number of window objects from 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.220
 aluminum is probably the best 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.530
 option if we talk about such objects 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.549
 like some state enterprises 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.200
 shopping centers 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:34.890
 why aluminum windows 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.440
 not so popular in terms of a contour housing 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.849
 because if you look at the window 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.180
 aluminum from wooden linings 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:44.190
 just like metal, they are probably not 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.340
 aesthetic and aesthetically attractive 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.680
 This is the second time all the same in aluminum 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.350
 profile is very difficult to make a normal 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.060
 thermal insulation coefficient is due to this 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.930
 What is the reason for this ? 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.290
 vastochka plastic she certainly what 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.840
 then questions decide in general then she 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.850
 allows you to make these windows 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.030
 insulating per se but you 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:13.019
 compare the size of this stavochka with 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.480
 pvc window where all five five 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.859
 seven or eight centimeters this is solid 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.470
 plastic that is it is solid 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:23.160
 heat insulator here this heat insulator 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.470
 he is quite small that is very 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.990
 difficult to clean technologically from a point 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.850
 view of design exactly 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.310
 it make aluminum profile 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.510
 make profile enough 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.950
 insulating within 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:39.350
 housing is a very important factor because 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.750
 you do not want to live along 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.890
 1 class you filed some 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.470
 condensation any other 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.290
 representative elements of course 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.890
 modern manufacturers 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.750
 let's say we have a photo here 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.610
 Reynolds Company Profile is one of 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.790
 market leaders in general if you 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.920
 look here is this thermo bridge from 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:05.420
 plastic that we use between 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:07.190
 aluminum profiles it is already sectional 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.810
 i.e. it is more complex black 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.540
 which naturally provides a lot 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.200
 more good ratio 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.720
 thermal insulation than some 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:19.850
 standard element but somehow it 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:21.830
 still less than a pvc window entirely 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.320
 this plan is probably certain 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:26.210
 completely minus aluminum windows 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.420
 that is, if plus is reliability 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.850
 durability and indestructibility then minus 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.370
 This of course indicators yes of course 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.500
 any aluminum window manufacturer 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.990
 he will check and will show 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.360
 certificates which a huge amount 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.370
 described the advantages that they have super 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.660
 coefficient so on but trust my 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.180
 I have experienced more than once 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.070
 Backgammon and where in the two adjacent 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.440
 the apartments have windows like wooden 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.200
 or plastic aluminum 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:55.540
 Well, actually the difference is obvious 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.730
 sensations on how you touch 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:01.980
 the profile is much colder 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:04.870
 sensations are certainly not so pleasant 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.250
 plus what moment is still negative 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.290
 aluminum windows 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.260
 aluminum itself as a material 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.520
 is a very large material 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.710
 thermal expansion coefficient 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.230
 what does it mean it means that when 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:21.270
 heating or cooling aluminum 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:23.950
 expands or shrinks ie profile 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:27.070
 let's say a two-meter he can for 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:30.670
 years in width and length 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:33.880
 pulled out and shrunk by 12 centimeter 

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:35.980
 completely calm in our climate where 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.090
 temperature drops on a very Bolshevik 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.000
 naturally not the most beneficial 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:43.090
 way affects the installation seam on the foam 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.580
 Of course, if you, too, bag is made by 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.800
 all the norms that should not even be 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.330
 no problem well, anyway, I know 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.850
 our country and how it is often with us 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.700
 going on probably i would still 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:58.060
 recommended window name as window for 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.740
 housing yes this is a great design for 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.880
 some kind of public spaces inside 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:06.620
 housing I probably 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:08.930
 not recommended next section 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:12.590
 our first release we will talk side by side 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:16.000
 on wooden windows and we will probably not be able to 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.000
 it's all tormented
