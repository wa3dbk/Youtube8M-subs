00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.580
 proxy is we are a campaign one 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.830
 battle of a poor but today I want 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.720
 show the demo of naples and yours 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.670
 work 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.660
 we can do or the tutorial of 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.849
 war by land or in battles in the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:35.420
 I just wanted this thing to be 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:37.559
 we make war by land 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.210
 since it is a game that I want 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:46.559
 it's worth trying the demo 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:48.090
 since he pulled me a lot so vi 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.149
 I will say that in a little while I lived 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.879
 birthday I do show with two 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:58.430
 expect Napoleon no longer a 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:02.489
 video game parma of the birth nation 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:08.000
 ok now pure heroin barely clean up 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.000
 an ibra advised party chose something 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.730
 wait for me to go to Milan a little bit 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.870
 wait for me to go back at least e 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.920
 lower the settings 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:23.460
 ok so unfortunately lower the settings 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.510
 because I have a video card that does 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.550
 disgust literally sucks and does not 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.390
 worry I have to do it again 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.850
 we will play a hostage and less middle-high 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.650
 welcome to the siege of tolone here at 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.580
 you will take the basics to give orders 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.600
 to your army on the battlefield 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.910
 you're in command of the army now 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.009
 French of Napoleon overall 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.470
 in and around this 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.190
 strong rivals are camped out 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.750
 British your job and hunt the 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.900
 an enemy of toulon 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.970
 let's start by selecting the fees 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.580
 above with the left demo button 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.430
 shut up the cursor in the classroom 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.250
 an enemy unit and click the button 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.789
 right ska we should as always seem 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.939
 a 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.859
 a tutorial from the country the fact that there 

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:16.890
 you have played mail must enter 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:19.079
 bomb the enemy accustomed to friends 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:24.030
 lovers and neat micro under next e 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:26.659
 We will perhaps see that route 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.659
 unit 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.740
 21 men 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.900
 however this is a demo you have put 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.260
 en route an enemy unit the uniform o 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.090
 this sosa the w keys already complete not 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.250
 are these are a little different indeed it is 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:59.960
 been optimized we don't give them the funk 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:03:02.450
 this is the militia bunch with cables not 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.520
 you can also rotate the camera view 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.110
 were of life select units of 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.600
 line infantry 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.150
 by clicking the left button above 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.920
 the corresponding icon located in the 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.850
 review panel dancing again 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:19.280
 press the right button on fire at will 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.530
 from this moment the unit opened 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.740
 automatically fire against each 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.110
 opponent attracts of rich musket of 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.660
 new on the button to cancel 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.540
 order or all while troops 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:36.350
 enemies with well-made walls 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:39.610
 on the indicated positions silent 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.610
 of the mixed moment stoning 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.370
 let's see here 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.620
 this too 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.000
 you can accelerate unit movements 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:58.970
 at least it was almost music while 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.970
 march with their own motion pin 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.580
 by right clicking and 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.910
 dragging the pointer to the measure of 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.910
 this type 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.870
 ok i have to march up here 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.630
 what now 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.909
 each combined with a series of skills 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.620
 special usable in battle 

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:37.780
 these skills can be 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.270
 select at the bottom of the screen e 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.539
 range from the formations is coming 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.400
 a second wave of enemies 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:49.080
 keep if it is convenient to put the shots in 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:52.569
 machine gun since it is still close 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:55.030
 obviously waiting a little buggy 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:58.360
 this too obvious artillery ones for 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.750
 however, this is a thousand watts now 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:07.990
 it's a demo 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:07.990
 complete and shoot 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:16.710
 and now there is no killing ahead 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:16.710
 despair 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.990
 our men shoot but 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.400
 broken 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:33.640
 I seriously reduced my strength 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:37.420
 British select a unit of 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:40.650
 PÃ² Leone infantry fell in served of 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:42.800
 Napoleon wisely and protect 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.819
 also your general 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.830
 a series of skills uses the commands ad 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:51.590
 at least we can incite our unity 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.440
 to summon in case they should 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.130
 to go 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.130
 of course 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.909
 yes yes I do load up 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:09.410
 but when all is well 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:18.030
 no assuring 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:31.800
 I don't think this is how much it moves 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.800
 my cellar shoots 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:47.669
 let's stick like cannons with 

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:50.419
 useful to make a good decision e 

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:50.419
 to watch 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.820
 won the game 

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:11.430
 ok we obviously won this not 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.830
 it was a great battle it was a tutorial 

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:16.260
 the working demo against the wall then 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:18.570
 don't expect much 

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:22.520
 we had an atelier and six books 

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:27.990
 two rifle shots and take of 

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:30.900
 napoleone buonaparte and then it will be all there 

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:33.330
 let's see to the next video and know well 

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.890
 patience that I will take Napoleon like that 

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.510
 I will make the video of the complete game not 

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:40.970
 we can bye bye 

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:40.970
