00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:09.480
 We fell in the zon today. 1st went very well. 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.580
 It's quick for you and it's only to vaccinate 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.130
 make paper mache suffers in a way 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.109
 different from the one you know you 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.029
 It has to be an object. 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:23.130
 then you get the glue to the water and mix 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.320
 This cuts a piece of paper but what today 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.769
 is no different for you need only 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.170
 normal glue is 500 grams already 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:39.450
 I decided to buy more even if I have 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:46.860
 to buy several dots of A4 paper 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:54.500
 It can not be any other, but now it 's 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.500
 optional nÃ© a stylus says to a brush 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:12.570
 and some basis to do here 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.330
 So I came back up here for the best. 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.650
 Good guys are you going to do this? 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.650
 People are going to pick up a sheet of paper. 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:22.159
 normal 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:35.220
 the paper puts on top there glue stick 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:37.829
 spread over here to show me here 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.270
 I'm going to make only one layer, you see more 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.799
 spreads on top so you do not need 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.860
 put a lot of time I thought too 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:47.840
 I need to put more so it's already good 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.840
 pick up the brush spreads well for everything 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:04.590
 Ok guys, pick it, right it 's 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:06.060
 the animal has sky and oh can see I still have 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.700
 you can see that a little the marks on the 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.610
 which is so can not put too much glue 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.470
 okay to not get in because it bubbles 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.170
 bubble - type bubble 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.830
 tell the boy's ways 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.500
 This is where it gets bigger than this. 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.660
 When will I set fire to 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.060
 sheet gets all pie understood that's it 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.770
 well so now what you have to do is 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.940
 remembering not to put lap - she 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.800
 You have to choose everything for this. 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.560
 I recommend doing bigger commercial 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:39.630
 simply position glue as the sheet 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:41.880
 up here and looking for strength and 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:46.650
 squeeze without to collaborate on all 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:52.019
 sides and now you do it 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:58.080
 Is it that I recommend Pharaoh ten 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:03:02.250
 leaves still thin can be well 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.739
 bigger than she was and she a good not to stay 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.120
 mole what areas are you 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.590
 so I think I listened to the leaves I 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.630
 I recommend doing more or less with 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.230
 10 also because if you did there with 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:16.980
 20 30 to get really thick there 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:20.040
 You will not be able to cut after 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.230
 make with ten leaves each of the leaves 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.739
 if you have anything to think better 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.220
 late with an old book something of 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.220
 s 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:43.590
 so I think you can see a 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:45.900
 bulge here you can do 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.280
 anything that is here can be 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.700
 used as if it were a plastic of 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.130
 of those of ice cream box only knows that 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.709
 sometimes do not have also need today 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:04:00.420
 Here, for example, I'm going to do a 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:02.370
 who I'm going to draw here cut it out 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.019
 draw one more time and put it over 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.150
 to get thicker and so if you 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:10.220
 want to make more goals and can still 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.220
 Then I'll do it already. 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.140
 Ok guys here I cut only you guys. 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.940
 to see a table, I was going to glue another 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.830
 up to drawing here as you can see 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:24.930
 It was unfortunate and five minutes anyway 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:26.370
 because she does but I was going to talk a lot 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.020
 but I found that even if that 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.090
 make yourself more goals and stay up bad for 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.340
 play and it's kind of weird that she 's 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.170
 tiny to be very very thick one 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.180
 and good people 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.130
 this is what tutorial shows is one is well 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.110
 cool I know you have home on time 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:44.640
 Do you want to do something suddenly? 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.830
 do some aim a gun thing is to 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.710
 It took more than that to cut a 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.870
 Ice cream thing only that sometimes does not have 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:56.360
 so I recommend and let's see is this 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.360
 I hope you liked the Czech spoken video. 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.290
 Hum is here
