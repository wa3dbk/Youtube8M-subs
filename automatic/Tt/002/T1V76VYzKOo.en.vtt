watch<00:00:00.359> the<00:00:00.570> Saturn<00:00:00.960> launches<00:00:01.469> in<00:00:01.740> fort<00:00:02.190> and<00:00:03.500> he

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
watch the Saturn launches in fort and he

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.309 
watch the Saturn launches in fort and he
wants<00:00:04.740> to<00:00:04.859> fly<00:00:05.040> in<00:00:05.220> space<00:00:05.339> too<00:00:05.819> and<00:00:06.180> he<00:00:07.109> has<00:00:07.290> a

wants to fly in space too and he has a

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.070 
wants to fly in space too and he has a
vision<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:08.010> he<00:00:08.130> has<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.429> courage<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:09.240> to<00:00:09.870> say

listen<00:00:10.440> let's<00:00:10.740> try<00:00:11.040> this<00:00:11.099> and<00:00:11.690> I<00:00:12.690> was<00:00:12.870> very

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
listen let's try this and I was very

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.890 
listen let's try this and I was very
fortunate<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.920> get<00:00:14.070> all<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.490> funding<00:00:14.969> that<00:00:15.179> I

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
fortunate to get all the funding that I

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.970 
fortunate to get all the funding that I
felt<00:00:16.320> was<00:00:16.500> necessary<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:17.160> do<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.490> program<00:00:18.980> the

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
felt was necessary to do the program the

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.580 
felt was necessary to do the program the
program<00:00:20.160> was<00:00:20.609> started<00:00:20.730> was<00:00:21.689> funded<00:00:22.199> as<00:00:22.410> you

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
program was started was funded as you

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.359 
program was started was funded as you

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
made was funded in March of 2001 we

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.820 
made was funded in March of 2001 we
started<00:00:27.060> work<00:00:27.330> on<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.810> about<00:00:28.800> May<00:00:29.160> of<00:00:29.420> 2001<00:00:30.830> we

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
started work on it about May of 2001 we

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.280 
started work on it about May of 2001 we
right<00:00:32.040> away<00:00:32.369> we<00:00:32.910> started<00:00:33.360> on<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.540> rocket<00:00:34.050> motor

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
right away we started on a rocket motor

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.040 
right away we started on a rocket motor
and<00:00:34.739> we<00:00:35.040> started<00:00:35.460> building<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.840> white

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
and we started building the the white

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.470 
and we started building the the white
knight<00:00:37.399> we<00:00:38.399> didn't<00:00:38.760> start<00:00:38.940> building<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
knight we didn't start building the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.920 
knight we didn't start building the
spaceship<00:00:39.960> how<00:00:40.320> about<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> year<00:00:40.980> later<00:00:41.930> because

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
spaceship how about a year later because

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.310 
spaceship how about a year later because
we<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:44.040> integration<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.420> spaceship<00:00:45.960> with

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
we the integration of the spaceship with

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.889 
we the integration of the spaceship with
its<00:00:46.469> rocket<00:00:46.920> motor<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:48.210> sizing<00:00:48.750> of

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
its rocket motor and the sizing of

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.650 
its rocket motor and the sizing of
everything<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:50.309> has<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:50.700> much<00:00:50.879> inner

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
everything is so it has so much inner

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.630 
everything is so it has so much inner
interplay<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:52.890> didn't<00:00:53.219> want<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.430> build

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
interplay that I didn't want to build

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.060 
interplay that I didn't want to build
things<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.120> had<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.390> do<00:00:54.510> over<00:00:54.840> again

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070 
things that I had to do over again

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.380 
things that I had to do over again
another<00:00:56.070> thing<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.399> I<00:00:56.550> did<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:57.059> was<00:00:57.180> very

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
another thing that I did that was very

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.810 
another thing that I did that was very
unusual<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.320> I'm<00:00:58.500> very<00:00:58.739> glad<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.460> did<00:00:59.699> it

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
unusual and I'm very glad that I did it

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.990 
unusual and I'm very glad that I did it
and<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.230> as<00:01:01.410> even<00:01:01.920> though<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.430> was<00:01:02.670> going

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
and that is as even though I was going

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000 
and that is as even though I was going
out<00:01:03.210> in<00:01:03.809> developing<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.799> brand<00:01:05.339> new<00:01:05.820> man<00:01:06.540> rated

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
out in developing a brand new man rated

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.380 
out in developing a brand new man rated
rocket<00:01:08.010> engine<00:01:08.520> for<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.750> manned<00:01:10.020> spacecraft<00:01:10.380> I

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
rocket engine for a manned spacecraft I

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.510 
rocket engine for a manned spacecraft I
decided<00:01:12.390> for<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.750> very<00:01:13.020> start<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.710> we<00:01:14.280> would

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
decided for the very start that we would

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.410 
decided for the very start that we would
never<00:01:14.790> do<00:01:15.060> any<00:01:15.600> boilerplate<00:01:16.560> testing<00:01:17.490> we

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
never do any boilerplate testing we

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.810 
never do any boilerplate testing we
would<00:01:18.600> never<00:01:18.780> build<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.409> big<00:01:19.619> metal<00:01:20.009> tank<00:01:20.490> to

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
would never build a big metal tank to

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.899 
would never build a big metal tank to
test<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.360> component<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.200> motor<00:01:22.460> it<00:01:23.460> was<00:01:23.700> all

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
test a component of the motor it was all

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.999 
test a component of the motor it was all
up<00:01:23.939> from<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.509> start<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:25.020> very<00:01:25.259> first<00:01:25.560> time<00:01:25.950> we

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
up from the start the very first time we

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.359 
up from the start the very first time we
fired<00:01:26.610> our<00:01:26.909> rocket<00:01:27.450> engine<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.200> was<00:01:28.799> with<00:01:29.040> on

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
fired our rocket engine it was with on

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.810 
fired our rocket engine it was with on
the<00:01:29.970> same<00:01:30.210> tank<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.810> flies<00:01:31.729> exactly<00:01:32.729> the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
the same tank that flies exactly the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.240 
the same tank that flies exactly the
same<00:01:33.060> tank<00:01:33.299> design<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:34.020> flies<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.860> was<00:01:35.100> in

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
same tank design that flies it was in

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.819 
same tank design that flies it was in
the<00:01:35.369> motor<00:01:35.579> case<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.810> flies<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.530> space

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
the motor case that that flies to space

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.530 
the motor case that that flies to space
it<00:01:38.189> was<00:01:38.909> flight<00:01:39.329> waiting<00:01:40.040> everything<00:01:41.540> because

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
it was flight waiting everything because

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.660 
it was flight waiting everything because
I<00:01:42.689> thought<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.200> learning<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.829> bad<00:01:44.040> news<00:01:44.369> is

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
I thought that learning the bad news is

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.550 
I thought that learning the bad news is
better<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.540> learn<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.840> early<00:01:46.170> rather<00:01:46.409> than

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
better to learn it early rather than

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.580 
better to learn it early rather than
later<00:01:48.259> so<00:01:49.259> we<00:01:49.470> didn't<00:01:49.740> we<00:01:50.040> did<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> very<00:01:50.490> unusual

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
later so we didn't we did a very unusual

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.350 
later so we didn't we did a very unusual
rocket<00:01:52.590> motor<00:01:52.770> test<00:01:53.070> development<00:01:53.939> we

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
rocket motor test development we

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.840 
rocket motor test development we
committed<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.079> build<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.619> develop<00:01:55.740> this<00:01:56.159> this

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
committed to build and develop this this

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.870 
committed to build and develop this this
big<00:01:57.210> tank<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:59.250> holds<00:01:59.640> more<00:01:59.820> than

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
big tank this is a it holds more than

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.600 
big tank this is a it holds more than
3,000<00:02:00.719> pounds

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610

nitrous oxide and we committed to build

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.710 
nitrous oxide and we committed to build
this<00:02:05.630> very<00:02:06.200> difficult<00:02:06.470> composite<00:02:07.400> part<00:02:07.720> which

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
this very difficult composite part which

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.310
