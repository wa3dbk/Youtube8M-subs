00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.380

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
60 P at 50 megabits per second I think

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.690 
60 P at 50 megabits per second I think
this<00:02:13.989> is<00:02:14.140> easily<00:02:14.440> one<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:14.980> best<00:02:15.099> cameras

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
this is easily one of the best cameras

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.369 
this is easily one of the best cameras
in<00:02:15.819> its<00:02:15.940> class<00:02:16.239> kind<00:02:16.750> of<00:02:16.840> setting<00:02:17.170> a<00:02:17.260> new

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
in its class kind of setting a new

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.520 
in its class kind of setting a new

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
standard and one final zoom I see a

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.229 
standard and one final zoom I see a
ferry<00:02:20.890> over<00:02:21.190> there<00:02:21.370> in<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.580> distance<00:02:21.880> let's

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
ferry over there in the distance let's

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.780 
ferry over there in the distance let's
take<00:02:22.420> a<00:02:22.450> look<00:02:22.890> see<00:02:23.890> how<00:02:23.950> quickly<00:02:24.190> we<00:02:24.340> can<00:02:24.580> lock

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
take a look see how quickly we can lock

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.199 
take a look see how quickly we can lock
on

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.970 

and<00:02:32.209> if<00:02:32.599> I<00:02:32.690> were<00:02:32.870> to<00:02:33.019> turn<00:02:33.140> on<00:02:33.319> digital<00:02:33.739> zoom

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
and if I were to turn on digital zoom

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.369 
and if I were to turn on digital zoom
you<00:02:34.190> would<00:02:34.340> have<00:02:34.489> even<00:02:34.670> more<00:02:35.290> granted<00:02:36.290> it

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
you would have even more granted it

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:44.970 
you would have even more granted it
would<00:02:36.440> just<00:02:36.590> be<00:02:36.680> magnified

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:52.550 

see<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:45.640> cars<00:02:45.850> on<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.090> Westside<00:02:46.480> Highway

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.670 

but<00:02:53.130> I<00:02:53.160> think<00:02:53.370> that<00:02:53.760> serves<00:02:54.209> as<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.569> fairly<00:02:55.500> good

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
but I think that serves as a fairly good

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.339 
but I think that serves as a fairly good
