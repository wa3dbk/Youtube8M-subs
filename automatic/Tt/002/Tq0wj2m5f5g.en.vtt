is<00:01:53.619> run<00:01:53.800> this<00:01:53.890> alongside<00:01:54.190> your<00:01:54.910> amplifier<00:01:55.539> to

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
is run this alongside your amplifier to

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.719 
is run this alongside your amplifier to
give<00:01:55.869> you<00:01:55.959> a<00:01:56.050> stereo<00:01:56.500> effect<00:01:56.830> you<00:01:57.429> could<00:01:57.580> run

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
give you a stereo effect you could run

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.339 
give you a stereo effect you could run
this<00:01:57.849> off<00:01:58.000> to<00:01:58.149> a<00:01:58.179> mixer<00:01:58.539> or<00:01:58.660> interface<00:01:59.080> and

00:01:59.339 --> 00:01:59.349 
this off to a mixer or interface and

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:00.809 
this off to a mixer or interface and
record<00:01:59.619> the<00:01:59.709> direct<00:02:00.009> signal<00:02:00.369> using

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:00.819 
record the direct signal using

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:02.699 
record the direct signal using
essentially<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.599> whole<00:02:01.750> pedal<00:02:02.080> as<00:02:02.200> an

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:02.709 
essentially the whole pedal as an

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:05.219 
essentially the whole pedal as an
amplifier<00:02:03.209> on<00:02:04.209> top<00:02:04.390> of<00:02:04.509> that<00:02:04.599> you<00:02:04.929> can<00:02:04.959> run<00:02:05.170> the

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
amplifier on top of that you can run the

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:06.960 
amplifier on top of that you can run the
cab<00:02:05.410> simulation<00:02:05.920> out<00:02:06.069> to<00:02:06.220> a<00:02:06.250> friends<00:02:06.670> effects

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
cab simulation out to a friends effects

return<00:02:07.330> which<00:02:07.780> will<00:02:07.810> allow<00:02:08.080> you<00:02:08.140> to<00:02:08.289> use
