00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.890
 hello good to all success keep people 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.500

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.140
 pico likes in the last video in 24 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.820
 hours to start this great series for 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:30.279
 me that's going to be mysteries of the campaign 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.869
 and relationship with zombies I do not know yet 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.580
 how will I call it but good hands 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.129
 more or less to be like that is going to be like that 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.400
 what mystery about the campaign and its 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:43.440
 relationship with the zombies then before 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:46.239
 to start before you start and because 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.640
 we will start tomorrow the day after tomorrow in 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:52.120
 these next days I want to clarify 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.760
 several things first I do not know how I'm going to 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:59.170
 start I think 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.839
 my point of view is that the best is 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.479
 start from guard guard we start 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.610
 from word war and we continue with black ops 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.040
 1 and then black ops 2 doing it in 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.689
 I want you to tell me what I want 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.009
 give me your point of view then 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:14.560
 look how we want it to start 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.080
 from white 2 down or from 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.810
 guard war up i my thought 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.070
 my advice I think it would be better to start 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.220
 from word war 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.710
 point number 2 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.280
 this this I'm going to do this relationship 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.680
 of the zombie color campaign does not want 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.290
 say and I want what is clear not 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.200
 means that what we find in 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.479
 the campaign is the direct relationship 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.720
 with history 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:48.770
 because this is here because they are not going to 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:52.400
 be mysteries that is to say that the relationship as 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:55.009
 they related from the beginning in the 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.700
 campaign the story in the campaign with 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:01.789
 the zombies or be a possible future 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.060
 relationship in the history of the zombies 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:07.490
 with the campaign that does not mean that 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.959
 from that moment, then feng rite 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:14.780
 I was compinchado with menéndez and not 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:18.739
 I know what's not that we're not going to get in there 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.380
 because we do not know from where that part 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:25.100
 link with the story but I want that 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.500
 it is clear that if all those clues are 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.940
 have been putting in the campaign is because 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.450
 in the future 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.100
 of relationship and I have not said it I have 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.580
 said the lord 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.340
 the sergeant kutz that possibly in a 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.080
 future yes there is then I want that 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.360
 it is clear that we are going to put 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.300
 the clues that have been leaving us but 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.070
 we are not going to roll in this has been 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.560
 for this and this has been for the other 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.810
 because we do not know for sure how 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.240
 it's everything but I want it to be clear 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.600
 From the first moment, it is worth going to 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.820
 put the mysteries that there are we are going to 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.980
 put the clues that are in each site 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.870
 but we're not going to roll up much with 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.070
 that because we do not know either 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:13.790
 then making it clear that I want 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:16.790

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.660
 Well now I want to tell you a 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.690
 little of the external theme of the relationship 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:18.630
 of the story with the zombies with the 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.970
 campaign as you well know when we are 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.400
 here at the beginning you see here these 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.290
 numbers that look like they were forming 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.670
 part of the campaign the history of the 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:31.860
 campaign but if you remember apart from the 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:35.249
 story of the campaign in which they come out 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:38.609
 also these politicians 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:40.349
 what relationship do you have then look at what 

00:04:38.609 --> 00:04:43.559
 related to the story of zombies 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:46.090
 and these numbers were already in five 

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:48.930
 like politicians 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:52.790
 yes or yes you know well 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:55.130
 when there are wars there are conspiracies 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.350
 and when there are conspiracies in the 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:01.310
 wars are also groups 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:03.200
 Secret secret groups like the 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.350
 illuminati 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:09.050
 that they will have to see so much in all 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.660
 this story and you know it so much 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:15.740
 in the zombie story as in the 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:17.120
 history of the wars campaign 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.970
 the bell 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.100
 and everything started at the beginning and here 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:26.570
 I saw in black ops 1 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:29.420
 when we teleported in fire 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:32.210
 see this numbering and not only here 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:33.610
 but on the loading screen nas 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.909
 a totem 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:39.610
 how important it is and what relationship 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:43.539
 will have with the campaign 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:47.319
 from now on we begin the relationship 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:51.099
 of the campaign with the story of zombies 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:53.650
 what relationship will they have with the zombies and 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:57.080
 with all these conspiracies 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:59.340
 Sergeant Woods Menéndez 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.760
 the presidents 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:06.500
 and all the other mysteries are 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:09.680
 hide about these campaigns 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.950

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.950
