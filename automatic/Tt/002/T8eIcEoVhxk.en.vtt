 loaded butt you put it in create 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.969
 a file in your office so here you go 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.829
 it's in my ftp files I create 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.879
 a file and you put this little trick 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.960

 you double click on it for 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.920
 launch it here so at the beginning you have 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.710
 that the little file here and that you 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.530
 run this and it will create files for you 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.650
 in fact that you install the modes 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.409
 automatically then for your 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.140
 profile front created a profile you create 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.439
 to be profile who you put your words of 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.340
 pass and a nickname of your minecraft 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.490
 normal since it is necessary that minecraft 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.850
 premium to have this lunch hours fred 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.600
 premium so there you have plenty of 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.159
 easter words 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.439
 so that's all the different modes 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.560
 pack that exist so there is the 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:46.470
 besides rolf wine which is the word of 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.619
 easter ftb with modes with modes 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:54.210
 case there so bureaucrats baffle horse 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:57.149
 to jane will compose as daft all that and 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.780
 in taxes 4.6 that's also robbery so 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.580
 it is in fact c 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.990
 it's on that one that I'm going to turn 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.159
 my series in trouble on the elsewhere wolf 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.350
 20 that 's what I'll macerate 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.729
 live feed the beast so we leave all 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.080
 the son of beast not know if he will 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.050
 started with the hawk the other when 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:18.010
 I will have put this video I do not know I 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.590
 so here they are wolf it's 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.620
 on that I turned in taxes 4.6 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.910
 then there is the master craque it is 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.550
 same is different packs a 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.290
 ready there are different things it depends 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.040
 near to see what you want there is 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.540
 it depends on what fashion wanted 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.070
 for example in the myth cracks I 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.890
 believe that there is no kraft mist that 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.530
 allows to have two dimensions 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.269
 here you have many different 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.560
 thing 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.819
 here is there am here too one and who has 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.010
 not two points in fact it's the 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.230
 same as that but we do not need 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.720
 from simply nothing to a pocket 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.920
 mancelle does not really know what it is 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.900
 nothing full demand after a full of 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.390
 modes after you choose so that 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.830
 it is in the category mode pack 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.799
 then flew into the options category 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.780
 or who can do it inforsud deit 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.360
 that's where you recorded all 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.940
 your stuff I beg crappy after and here 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.200
 you can rent oars to your 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.459
 feed the beast i put it to 1.75 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.310
 I put two gigas at your house for 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.200
 that generate 75 yes that you go to 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.880
 geeks as you want after that depends 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.670
 of your computer a month I was talking that 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.370
 up to 2 75 me I go to 1.75 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.950
 that's enough if you have a friend 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.340
 then go to 3 3 giga is 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.989
 very well I'm here 75 if you get in 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.820
 said not very powerful then you 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.090
 choose the language so mingli angers 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.989
 ch 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.900
 here and then you do not touch the rest 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.549
 news you do not touch 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.760
 teichmann mode you do not touch either 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.620
 it will be nothing this cd maps games not too much to 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:54.340
 what does it fit but well do not touch 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:58.599
 then wear the easter texture 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:04:00.310
 this cd on easter women after you 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:02.739
 can after you can add some 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.230
 friends textures like that so here we have 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.660
 finished for the explanation all this so we 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:10.090
 will leave here so do not especially 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.099
 remove the console i 'm going to have the 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.209
 reopen 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:15.700
 especially not to not close the console 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.930
 especially not kept open is launched 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.840
 after you do not show it needs to be 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.310
 a beach 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.660
 then you have modes that go from 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.240
 stuff like that they will show up 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.620
 so that's different stuff so 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:32.020
 for example by the way wolf 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:34.060
 if you I relenched venture here by 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.010
 example if you choose to play on 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.090
 Besides the wall that you clutch 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.970
 you load the easter words 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.520
 how are you going to install the modes and that 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.470
 you're going to put a folder like that 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.360
 which will correspond a little to your point 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.550
 minecraft so there you have you are 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.740
 minecraft and it fits like like 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.060
 your normal minecraft you see you 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.590
 can put it pack textures 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:58.180
 in it you can put can 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.850
 add maths 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.669
 now that's like yours 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.690
 normal minecraft so that's it for 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.880
 that there are modes so that's 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:10.210
 by the way wolf it's the beta ftb that's 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.289
 the 1.4.2 it's nice 4.6 ftp this one the 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.990
 son of patrick what I had 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:16.349
 downloaded here if I did not know 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.830
 hungry that's normally I recognize you 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:22.660
 so here I think we did everything 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.510
 now let's go on the launcher 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:32.440
 that I already launched so we 'll say it 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:32.860
 but here we go and if by 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.470
 example 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.099
 so here we will be interested to add 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.690
 modes 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:38.860
 because we can still add 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.240
 because you have to know that in 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.490
 all young players at the small fail 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.650
 nieppe and the little fans it serves 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.610
 a lot to for when you have some 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.660
 easter textures 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:54.280
 when you have when you want laguÃ« 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:56.680
 - all that is good in the ft b &amp; b there 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.910
 is not there is no small fine so 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:59.320
 to add it is very simple you 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.310
 select your password that you 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:05.409
 want to the fact and say Easter word 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:08.890
 you are going to dangeard mode not in mode 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:10.360
 in the fashion genre and there normally he 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:14.099
 is that minecraft forge is not 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:16.690
 small fine up 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:19.570
 so you only have that and that 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:23.950
 obvious and good to put to small 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:26.560
 file you just fair and fashion here 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.960
 and you will selected nine months these 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.760
 tax modes 4.6 what I have different 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.039
 files with me firm points 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.080
 all my files this has ranked me this 

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:36.520
 that I like that it suits and and 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.260
 then you simply choose 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.360
 what mode you add to it so 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.620
 you click on it at the small fine cop16 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.560
 because that's the launcher 1 could 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:47.020
 3,6 and you have it open and it's okay 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.729
 the master here or here for example if he 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.710
 is here you just have to do that and 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:52.270
 hello there it 'll put you there and if 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.770
 you want to uninstall you are you 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.360
 put it there if you want to install it 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.810
 you 're here just here 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:01.140
 you do not say time to me 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:04.180
 so here we go 

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:05.560
 after I have it is because I have to do 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.950
 be careful if you want to add 

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.660
 modes 

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.580
 be careful that they are well 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:11.020
 compatible with other modes which 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:13.780
 quantify it's sure it's compatible 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:17.520
 after careful not necessary either 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:21.270
 to add modes like that and everything 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:25.450
 so I think we went around 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:27.790
 my let's play with the lady the enap to 

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:30.580
 4.6 so I think we went around 

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:32.170
 of this tutorial to install your son's 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:37.120
 beast is a point that helped mode it's 

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:38.500
 a bit of a rather complete here I am 

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.980
 tell you no more for a next 

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.900
 video 

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.100
 if you liked do not hesitate to 

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:42.580
 leave a small thumb to a small 

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.500
 favorite 

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:47.820
 and if you are still not subscribed b 

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:52.170
 go ahead it's not hard before 

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:52.170
 Come on me, I play much more 

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.320
 exceeded soon comes to the test
