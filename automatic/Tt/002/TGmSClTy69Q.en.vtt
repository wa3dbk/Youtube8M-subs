know if they approve it and like it
whatever<00:03:53.769> and<00:03:54.070> then<00:03:54.310> i<00:03:55.200> guess<00:03:56.200> if<00:03:56.650> they<00:03:56.980> like

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
whatever and then i guess if they like

whatever and then i guess if they like
it<00:03:57.400> as<00:03:57.790> they'll<00:03:58.209> make<00:03:58.840> me<00:03:59.049> a<00:03:59.079> director<00:03:59.620> i'm<00:03:59.769> not

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
it as they'll make me a director i'm not

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.039 
it as they'll make me a director i'm not
sure<00:04:00.190> exactly<00:04:00.340> how<00:04:00.910> it<00:04:01.060> works<00:04:01.269> because<00:04:01.780> I've

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
sure exactly how it works because I've

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:03.720 
sure exactly how it works because I've
never<00:04:02.079> done<00:04:02.380> it<00:04:02.590> before<00:04:02.680> so<00:04:02.890> I<00:04:03.069> have<00:04:03.370> no<00:04:03.579> clue

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
never done it before so I have no clue

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.569 
never done it before so I have no clue
but<00:04:04.720> um<00:04:05.019> I<00:04:05.350> know<00:04:05.920> it<00:04:06.100> seemed<00:04:06.220> like<00:04:06.370> a<00:04:06.400> really

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
but um I know it seemed like a really

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:10.699 
but um I know it seemed like a really
great<00:04:06.760> opportunity<00:04:07.109> so<00:04:08.109> i<00:04:09.239> don't<00:04:10.239> know<00:04:10.299> i
