00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.559
 hi friends, how are you here 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.569
 with a new video and good in this 

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:09.660
 occasion I bring you how to prepare some 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.730
 very short in cream and good for that 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.039
 We need a few chubby as you see here 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.039
 of margarine or butter 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:25.110
 and obviously cream without cream 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.110
 a little cream cheese 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.730
 and we are going to need to be able to do them 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.700
 a pot then 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.540
 first of all we must know well 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:43.650
 the cries and I have cooked 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.410
 I do not know if he would be the only one in the camera 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.880
 so 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.910
 need 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.220
 well there are two ways to do it 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.320
 How am I going to do it? 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.860
 make a cut 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.690
 in this way 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.309
 a cut in four for all 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.080
 musicians and we're all going to get 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:10.960
 prepared 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:14.560
 or you can crush 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.280
 all the gap and then I prefer 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.650
 do it on the bits 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.710
 but it will be depending on how 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.490
 you are going to want the widgets 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.580
 then I will finish cutting here 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.730
 the wikis and we go to the stove already with 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.280
 the pot with fire 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.010
 good friends since we have 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.210
 our very correct ones got into 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.620
 our pot with fire on the stove 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.290
 let's add a little margarine and 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.490
 let's let it melt then 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.490
 while melting 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:58.970
 he is going to return them in a way that he 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.220
 the week today go as detaching the 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.900
 the seeds 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.900
 so that they do not come out so 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.290
 pieces that's why there are many people who 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.840
 like to crush before putting them here 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:15.350
 but we can not do once here 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.900
 in then I gave him a little bit of 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.890
 margarine we are going to wait for a 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.980
 to dissolve I think we're going to see 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.600
 is well dissolved well then to the 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.959
 time that we met our 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.000
 Today is our very beautiful and 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.130
 I recommend that you sew it with a little 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.630
 salt a tablespoon of salt I bought a 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:40.400
 bandejita brought 366 and coditos then 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.910
 I gave him a spoonful of salt the truth 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:47.880
 is that it comes out a very good taste 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.880
 and good since it gave me 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.650
 butter and margarine that 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:03:00.010
 we take a tablespoon and a half 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.010
 of this go of cream cheese 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.690
 any brand 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:11.040
 and let's go 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:12.480
 to let it melt then when 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.020
 melts we go back to throw the 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.810
 good cream friends and friends as it is 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:21.560
 melted our cream cheese and diluted 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.810
 with margarine and the game that 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.900
 that give off the holes we are going to 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.360
 apply let's take it for granted what 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.220
 It is our cream 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.540
 if we are not going to add a lot of gravel 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.540
 because I was already pretty 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.900
 as our errand has enough 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:46.200
 our deposits deliver us 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:49.300
 for terminals to give the flavor s 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.520
 we believe milestone that we like 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.890
 as I repeat it, there are people who like it 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.100
 Crush the chicks and serve them maybe 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:00.310
 like as a salsita then I 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:05.020
 I prefer that it be those like salsita 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:08.080
 and have the good taste the pieces 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.760
 of wii coitus then there if you guys 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:16.170
 they want they can crush here here 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:16.170
 same or just leave it here to sew it 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.889
 and now that it is very good 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.410
 so we're going to leave it maybe for a 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:28.919
 minute and a half while heating 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.919
 and everything is going to cover it 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.310
 let's wait minute and I'm going to 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:37.520
 show how our plate would look 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:40.280
 final good friends since we have 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.750
 our well-cooked cries are going to 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:46.860
 serve even if you see the texture 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.860
 and how would they be 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:56.469
 then that's how our 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:56.469
 victories in cream 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.460
 good to accompany with any meat 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.660
 white meat or it can be from networks or 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.660
 any meat that you want 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:11.269
 it's a pretty tasty dish has a lot 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:13.159
 flavor then I hope you like it and 

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:15.309
 good profit will be until next time 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:15.309
 bye
