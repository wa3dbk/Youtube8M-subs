a little toggle here at the bottom and

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.130 
a little toggle here at the bottom and
this<00:01:52.069> will<00:01:52.280> let<00:01:52.429> you<00:01:52.579> push<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.270> eye<00:01:53.299> to<00:01:53.840> either

this will let you push the eye to either

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.050 
this will let you push the eye to either
direction<00:01:54.619> so<00:01:54.770> that<00:01:54.799> you<00:01:55.310> can<00:01:55.520> choose<00:01:55.729> how<00:01:56.030> to

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
direction so that you can choose how to

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
display the way he looks now the torso

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.910 
display the way he looks now the torso
itself<00:01:59.179> there<00:01:59.420> is<00:01:59.450> a<00:01:59.569> ball<00:02:00.289> joint<00:02:00.499> right<00:02:00.740> at

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
itself there is a ball joint right at

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.520 
itself there is a ball joint right at
the<00:02:01.039> waist<00:02:01.249> and<00:02:01.639> these<00:02:02.450> hoses<00:02:02.749> here<00:02:03.200> you<00:02:03.409> may

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
the waist and these hoses here you may

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.080 
the waist and these hoses here you may
think<00:02:03.829> they<00:02:03.979> they<00:02:04.369> restrict<00:02:04.789> but<00:02:04.969> it's

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
think they they restrict but it's

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.809 
think they they restrict but it's
actually<00:02:05.630> the<00:02:06.530> design<00:02:06.859> of<00:02:07.249> the<00:02:07.369> waist<00:02:07.579> skirt

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
actually the design of the waist skirt

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:09.219 
actually the design of the waist skirt
that<00:02:07.999> really<00:02:08.209> does<00:02:08.360> most<00:02:08.599> of<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.810> restriction

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
that really does most of the restriction

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.630 
that really does most of the restriction
but<00:02:09.379> that<00:02:09.890> said<00:02:10.129> he<00:02:10.250> can<00:02:10.369> still<00:02:10.549> move

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
but that said he can still move

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.940 
but that said he can still move
side-to-side<00:02:10.909> you<00:02:11.510> can<00:02:11.659> also<00:02:11.900> pull<00:02:12.560> slightly

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
side-to-side you can also pull slightly

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:13.930 
side-to-side you can also pull slightly

with<00:03:12.590> it<00:03:12.740> now<00:03:12.980> of<00:03:13.190> course<00:03:13.460> the<00:03:14.180> hosing<00:03:14.630> here<00:03:14.780> on

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
with it now of course the hosing here on

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.450 
with it now of course the hosing here on
the<00:03:14.960> sides<00:03:15.170> does<00:03:15.560> limit<00:03:15.800> outward<00:03:16.250> movement

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
the sides does limit outward movement

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:19.120 
the sides does limit outward movement
but<00:03:16.820> forward<00:03:17.480> extension<00:03:17.900> is<00:03:18.020> okay<00:03:18.350> and<00:03:18.560> the

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
but forward extension is okay and the

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.820 
but forward extension is okay and the
back<00:03:19.310> side<00:03:19.580> does<00:03:20.030> not<00:03:20.060> move<00:03:20.390> at<00:03:20.600> all<00:03:20.630> of<00:03:21.140> course

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
back side does not move at all of course

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.040 
back side does not move at all of course
this<00:03:22.040> does<00:03:22.280> make<00:03:22.550> hip<00:03:23.150> rotation<00:03:23.900> and

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
this does make hip rotation and

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.870 
this does make hip rotation and
articulation<00:03:24.530> a<00:03:24.590> bit<00:03:24.709> limited<00:03:25.070> however<00:03:25.250> when

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
articulation a bit limited however when

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.490 
articulation a bit limited however when
you<00:03:25.970> move<00:03:26.150> the<00:03:26.270> light<00:03:26.420> forward<00:03:26.870> they<00:03:27.050> nicely

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
you move the light forward they nicely

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.460 
you move the light forward they nicely
split<00:03:28.070> and<00:03:28.340> they<00:03:28.580> give<00:03:28.730> you<00:03:28.880> a<00:03:28.910> pretty<00:03:29.150> decent

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
split and they give you a pretty decent

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.130 
split and they give you a pretty decent
forward<00:03:30.470> kick<00:03:30.680> our<00:03:31.430> kick<00:03:31.820> is<00:03:31.970> again<00:03:32.540> limited

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
forward kick our kick is again limited

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.440 
forward kick our kick is again limited
but<00:03:33.290> pretty<00:03:33.530> decent<00:03:33.950> there's<00:03:34.580> a<00:03:34.640> thigh<00:03:34.880> swivel

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
but pretty decent there's a thigh swivel

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.170 
but pretty decent there's a thigh swivel
and<00:03:35.600> they<00:03:36.230> double<00:03:36.740> joint<00:03:36.920> a<00:03:37.010> knee<00:03:37.190> with<00:03:37.430> a<00:03:37.459> semi

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
and they double joint a knee with a semi

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.060 
and they double joint a knee with a semi
floating<00:03:38.690> knee<00:03:39.110> pad<00:03:39.320> so<00:03:39.500> that's<00:03:39.650> pretty<00:03:39.860> cool

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
floating knee pad so that's pretty cool

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.670 
floating knee pad so that's pretty cool
as<00:03:40.340> for<00:03:40.850> the<00:03:40.940> ankle<00:03:41.240> it's<00:03:41.420> a<00:03:41.540> large<00:03:42.080> hinge<00:03:42.500> on<00:03:42.650> a

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
as for the ankle it's a large hinge on a

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.680 
as for the ankle it's a large hinge on a
ball<00:03:42.950> joint<00:03:42.980> that<00:03:43.489> can<00:03:44.030> do<00:03:44.120> a<00:03:44.180> good<00:03:44.420> amount<00:03:44.570> of

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
ball joint that can do a good amount of

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.420 
ball joint that can do a good amount of
rotation<00:03:45.170> side<00:03:45.410> to<00:03:45.590> side<00:03:45.800> and<00:03:46.070> up<00:03:46.220> and<00:03:46.400> down

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
rotation side to side and up and down

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.210 
rotation side to side and up and down
but<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.300> toe<00:03:47.480> has<00:03:47.750> this<00:03:47.900> really<00:03:48.290> good<00:03:48.980> wide

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
but the toe has this really good wide

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.330 
but the toe has this really good wide
range<00:03:49.459> of<00:03:49.610> movement<00:03:50.030> for<00:03:50.810> for<00:03:51.140> kicking<00:03:51.530> so

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
range of movement for for kicking so

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.400 
range of movement for for kicking so
that's<00:03:52.520> really<00:03:52.910> great<00:03:53.120> on<00:03:53.360> a<00:03:53.390> very<00:03:53.900> good
