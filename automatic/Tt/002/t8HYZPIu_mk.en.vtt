00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:15.459 
hey guys this is tax 87 love a quick

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:18.390 
hey guys this is tax 87 love a quick
retro<00:00:15.969> one<00:00:16.180> for<00:00:16.390> you<00:00:16.480> today<00:00:16.890> if<00:00:17.890> you<00:00:18.099> want<00:00:18.220> a

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:18.400 
retro one for you today if you want a

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.359 
retro one for you today if you want a
platform<00:00:19.029> to<00:00:19.570> only<00:00:19.779> be<00:00:20.439> able<00:00:20.560> to<00:00:20.710> be<00:00:20.800> stood<00:00:21.220> on

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
platform to only be able to be stood on

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.760 
platform to only be able to be stood on
so<00:00:21.700> you<00:00:21.790> can<00:00:21.939> jump<00:00:22.180> through<00:00:22.630> it<00:00:22.779> like<00:00:23.380> you<00:00:23.529> can

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:23.770 
so you can jump through it like you can

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.479 
so you can jump through it like you can
an<00:00:23.980> old<00:00:24.250> retro<00:00:25.000> game<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.980> that<00:00:27.130> the<00:00:27.250> game

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:27.489 
an old retro game so that the game

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:30.240 
an old retro game so that the game
physics<00:00:27.910> only<00:00:28.570> apply<00:00:28.960> when<00:00:29.649> you're<00:00:29.770> on<00:00:29.919> top<00:00:30.220> of

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:30.250 
physics only apply when you're on top of

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.950 
physics only apply when you're on top of
the<00:00:30.489> object<00:00:30.610> not<00:00:31.360> when<00:00:31.509> you're<00:00:31.630> underneath

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
the object not when you're underneath

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:40.000 
the object not when you're underneath
the<00:00:32.230> object

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.910 

you

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.800 

okay<00:00:45.580> so<00:00:45.640> to<00:00:45.850> do<00:00:46.090> this<00:00:46.240> you're<00:00:46.450> going<00:00:46.480> to<00:00:46.690> need

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:46.810 
okay so to do this you're going to need

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.340 
okay so to do this you're going to need
a<00:00:47.170> broadcast<00:00:47.680> microchip<00:00:48.280> a<00:00:48.460> tag<00:00:49.240> and<00:00:49.510> a

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
a broadcast microchip a tag and a

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.060 
a broadcast microchip a tag and a
physics<00:00:50.740> Tweaker<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:53.440> we're<00:00:53.590> going<00:00:53.710> to<00:00:53.800> start

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
physics Tweaker so we're going to start

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.830 
physics Tweaker so we're going to start
off<00:00:54.220> by<00:00:54.250> making<00:00:54.550> our<00:00:54.790> platform<00:00:55.330> this<00:00:55.540> can<00:00:55.750> be

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
off by making our platform this can be

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.930 
off by making our platform this can be
made<00:00:56.020> out<00:00:56.050> of<00:00:56.170> any<00:00:56.380> material<00:00:56.920> as<00:00:57.580> long<00:00:57.730> as<00:00:57.850> you

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
made out of any material as long as you

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.110 
made out of any material as long as you
make<00:00:58.120> it<00:00:58.150> static<00:00:58.540> it<00:00:58.900> will<00:00:59.080> hover<00:00:59.440> in<00:00:59.710> the<00:00:59.740> sky

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
make it static it will hover in the sky

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.860 
make it static it will hover in the sky
so<00:01:01.120> it<00:01:01.690> can<00:01:01.900> also<00:01:02.080> be<00:01:02.260> any<00:01:02.590> thickness<00:01:03.870> but

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
so it can also be any thickness but

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.300 
so it can also be any thickness but
we're<00:01:05.050> going<00:01:05.170> to<00:01:05.260> go<00:01:05.380> for<00:01:05.650> a<00:01:05.740> two<00:01:06.040> block

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
we're going to go for a two block

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.870 
we're going to go for a two block
thickness<00:01:08.850> then<00:01:09.850> using<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.540> small<00:01:10.930> grid

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
thickness then using the small grid

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.400 
thickness then using the small grid
we're<00:01:12.880> going<00:01:13.060> to<00:01:13.180> place<00:01:13.390> a<00:01:13.420> sticker<00:01:13.870> panel<00:01:14.290> of

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
we're going to place a sticker panel of

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.969 
we're going to place a sticker panel of
one<00:01:15.340> square<00:01:15.850> and<00:01:16.570> it's<00:01:16.869> going<00:01:17.140> to<00:01:17.259> be<00:01:17.380> over<00:01:17.650> the

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
one square and it's going to be over the

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.400 
one square and it's going to be over the
hole<00:01:18.250> of<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.580> platform<00:01:19.060> then<00:01:20.050> we're<00:01:20.170> going<00:01:20.350> to

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
hole of the platform then we're going to

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.800 
hole of the platform then we're going to
turn<00:01:20.680> that<00:01:21.340> invisible<00:01:21.850> so<00:01:22.300> that<00:01:22.450> it<00:01:22.540> cannot<00:01:22.750> be

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
turn that invisible so that it cannot be

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.550 
turn that invisible so that it cannot be
seen<00:01:23.080> in<00:01:23.110> play<00:01:23.380> mode<00:01:23.590> and<00:01:25.020> then<00:01:26.020> we<00:01:26.200> are<00:01:26.320> going

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
seen in play mode and then we are going

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.130 
seen in play mode and then we are going
to<00:01:26.650> place<00:01:26.890> a<00:01:27.130> broadcast<00:01:27.790> microchip<00:01:28.479> onto<00:01:28.990> the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
to place a broadcast microchip onto the

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.320 
to place a broadcast microchip onto the
sticker<00:01:29.350> pass<00:01:31.950> this<00:01:32.950> broadcast<00:01:33.490> microchip<00:01:34.149> is

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
sticker pass this broadcast microchip is

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.580 
sticker pass this broadcast microchip is
going<00:01:34.720> to<00:01:34.899> be<00:01:35.020> set<00:01:35.259> to<00:01:35.290> all<00:01:35.800> in<00:01:35.979> contact<00:01:36.490> and

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
going to be set to all in contact and

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.320 
going to be set to all in contact and
allow<00:01:38.590> touching<00:01:39.160> to<00:01:39.369> include<00:01:39.880> touching<00:01:42.330> then

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
allow touching to include touching then

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.600 
allow touching to include touching then
inside<00:01:43.930> the<00:01:44.200> broadcast<00:01:44.380> microchip<00:01:45.190> we<00:01:45.490> are

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
inside the broadcast microchip we are

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.999 
inside the broadcast microchip we are
just<00:01:45.790> going<00:01:45.970> to<00:01:46.119> place<00:01:46.330> a<00:01:46.570> tag<00:01:46.840> I'm<00:01:47.440> going<00:01:47.920> to

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
just going to place a tag I'm going to

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.160 
just going to place a tag I'm going to
have<00:01:48.160> this<00:01:48.310> as<00:01:48.460> a<00:01:48.490> blue<00:01:48.759> tag<00:01:49.060> and<00:01:49.330> I'm<00:01:49.870> going<00:01:50.080> to

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
have this as a blue tag and I'm going to

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.520 
have this as a blue tag and I'm going to
name<00:01:50.320> it<00:01:50.350> on<00:01:50.590> top<00:01:54.090> then<00:01:55.090> we<00:01:55.570> place<00:01:55.810> our<00:01:56.080> physics

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
name it on top then we place our physics

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.240 
name it on top then we place our physics
Tweaker<00:01:57.000> onto<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.409> actual<00:01:59.409> platform<00:01:59.620> itself

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
Tweaker onto the actual platform itself

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.090 
Tweaker onto the actual platform itself
and<00:02:01.710> we<00:02:02.710> want<00:02:02.950> it<00:02:03.190> to<00:02:03.430> only<00:02:04.060> affect<00:02:05.100> tagged

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
and we want it to only affect tagged

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:12.540 
and we want it to only affect tagged
objects<00:02:06.760> of<00:02:07.049> blue<00:02:08.049> and<00:02:08.260> on<00:02:08.769> top

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.360 

and<00:02:12.870> believe<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:14.020> or<00:02:14.140> not<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:14.530> is<00:02:14.680> that<00:02:15.130> simple

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
and believe it or not it is that simple

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.160 
and believe it or not it is that simple
now<00:02:18.370> we<00:02:18.430> have<00:02:18.760> our<00:02:19.060> object<00:02:19.570> that<00:02:19.690> we<00:02:19.840> can<00:02:19.990> pass

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
now we have our object that we can pass

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.830 
now we have our object that we can pass
through<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:20.920> jump<00:02:21.220> through<00:02:21.490> it<00:02:21.640> but<00:02:22.570> that<00:02:22.720> we

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
through to jump through it but that we

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.800 
through to jump through it but that we
can<00:02:22.960> also<00:02:23.050> stand<00:02:23.650> on<00:02:24.030> it<00:02:25.030> is<00:02:25.180> also<00:02:25.360> worth

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
can also stand on it is also worth

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.550 
can also stand on it is also worth
noting<00:02:26.110> that<00:02:26.410> if<00:02:27.100> you<00:02:27.280> place<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:28.560> another

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
noting that if you place a another

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.740 
noting that if you place a another
platform<00:02:30.070> above<00:02:30.400> it<00:02:30.610> you<00:02:31.120> need<00:02:31.330> to<00:02:31.360> leave

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
platform above it you need to leave

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.530 
platform above it you need to leave
enough<00:02:32.260> room<00:02:32.470> for<00:02:32.760> your<00:02:33.760> player<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.060> come

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
enough room for your player to come

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.200 
enough room for your player to come
outside<00:02:34.810> so<00:02:35.620> no<00:02:35.980> longer<00:02:36.130> in<00:02:36.430> contact<00:02:36.610> with<00:02:37.120> the
