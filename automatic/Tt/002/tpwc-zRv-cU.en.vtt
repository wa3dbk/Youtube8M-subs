in<00:00:00.329> this<00:00:00.450> video<00:00:00.690> we're<00:00:00.840> going<00:00:00.930> to<00:00:01.050> take<00:00:01.199> a<00:00:01.230> look

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:01.380 
in this video we're going to take a look

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.530 
in this video we're going to take a look
at<00:00:01.589> our<00:00:01.890> remaining<00:00:02.310> sub-object<00:00:03.030> modes<00:00:03.240> in

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
at our remaining sub-object modes in

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.349 
at our remaining sub-object modes in
edit<00:00:04.020> guides<00:00:04.259> which<00:00:04.859> are<00:00:05.190> going<00:00:05.460> to<00:00:05.580> be<00:00:05.819> strand

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
edit guides which are going to be strand

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.020 
edit guides which are going to be strand
and<00:00:06.690> route<00:00:07.160> first<00:00:08.160> let's<00:00:08.460> take<00:00:08.580> a<00:00:08.639> look<00:00:08.820> at<00:00:08.940> the

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
and route first let's take a look at the

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.700 
and route first let's take a look at the
strand<00:00:09.360> sub<00:00:09.570> object<00:00:09.900> mode<00:00:10.050> which<00:00:10.260> is<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.410> great

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
strand sub object mode which is a great

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.160 
strand sub object mode which is a great
sub<00:00:10.980> object<00:00:11.400> mode<00:00:11.580> in<00:00:12.150> order<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:12.570> get<00:00:12.750> finer

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
sub object mode in order to get finer

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.010 
sub object mode in order to get finer
detail<00:00:13.679> out<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.340> your<00:00:14.580> grooming<00:00:15.120> so<00:00:15.690> if<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.870> just

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
detail out of your grooming so if I just

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.140 
detail out of your grooming so if I just
turn<00:00:16.170> off<00:00:16.379> show<00:00:16.410> end<00:00:16.800> result<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.460> zoom<00:00:17.970> in<00:00:18.119> a

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
turn off show end result and zoom in a

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.200 
turn off show end result and zoom in a
little<00:00:18.300> bit<00:00:18.830> we<00:00:19.830> could<00:00:19.980> see<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.369> we<00:00:20.970> kind<00:00:21.150> of

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
little bit we could see that we kind of

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.900 
little bit we could see that we kind of
have<00:00:21.390> these<00:00:21.600> little<00:00:21.900> vertex<00:00:22.859> ticks<00:00:23.340> here<00:00:23.730> at

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
have these little vertex ticks here at

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.330 
have these little vertex ticks here at
the<00:00:24.180> edge<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.810> let<00:00:25.740> me<00:00:25.800> just<00:00:25.980> bring<00:00:26.130> this<00:00:26.279> down

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
the edge and let me just bring this down

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.370 
the edge and let me just bring this down
a<00:00:26.670> little<00:00:26.849> bit

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
a little bit

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.999 
a little bit
grab<00:00:28.380> my<00:00:28.529> move<00:00:28.710> tool<00:00:29.960> and<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.710> can<00:00:31.830> select

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
grab my move tool and you can select

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.310 
grab my move tool and you can select
these<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:33.210> can<00:00:33.420> move<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.170> can

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
these and you can move and you can

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.200 
these and you can move and you can
adjust<00:00:34.680> them<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:35.040> if<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.489> have<00:00:35.700> some<00:00:35.969> guides

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
adjust them so if you have some guides

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.810 
adjust them so if you have some guides
that<00:00:36.630> are<00:00:37.100> misbehaving<00:00:38.100> or<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.520> need<00:00:38.700> to

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
that are misbehaving or you need to

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.200 
that are misbehaving or you need to
place<00:00:39.090> you<00:00:39.390> know<00:00:39.510> very<00:00:39.809> very<00:00:40.790> precisely<00:00:41.790> you

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
place you know very very precisely you

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.819 
place you know very very precisely you
can<00:00:42.390> go<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:43.020> can<00:00:43.170> adjust<00:00:43.290> them<00:00:43.649> and

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
can go in and you can adjust them and

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.369 
can go in and you can adjust them and
these<00:00:44.399> behave<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:45.300> really<00:00:45.809> great<00:00:46.110> and

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
these behave in a really great and

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.170 
these behave in a really great and
intuitive<00:00:47.070> way<00:00:47.190> as<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.579> kind<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.850> click<00:00:48.030> and

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
intuitive way as I kind of click and

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.639 
intuitive way as I kind of click and
drag<00:00:48.390> them<00:00:48.600> you<00:00:48.750> can<00:00:48.899> see<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.289> they<00:00:49.410> move

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
drag them you can see that they move

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.240 
drag them you can see that they move
kind<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:50.730> fluids<00:00:51.600> blind<00:00:52.260> ik'<00:00:52.469> way<00:00:52.980> and

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
kind of in this fluids blind ik' way and

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.639 
kind of in this fluids blind ik' way and
that's<00:00:53.399> really<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.600> truth<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.289> that

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
that's really the truth of it is that

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.330 
that's really the truth of it is that
they<00:00:55.860> are<00:00:56.420> set<00:00:57.420> up<00:00:57.570> with<00:00:57.780> spline<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.289> K<00:00:58.500> as<00:00:59.039> you

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
they are set up with spline I K as you

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.700 
they are set up with spline I K as you
move<00:00:59.550> them<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.629> allows<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.320> kind<00:01:01.590> of

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
move them and this allows you to kind of

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.349 
move them and this allows you to kind of
position<00:01:02.190> them<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.640> get<00:01:02.789> really<00:01:02.969> used<00:01:03.059> to

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
position them and you get really used to

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.420 
position them and you get really used to
you<00:01:04.080> know<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.409> might<00:01:04.739> kind<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.129> go<00:01:05.280> this

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
you know that I might kind of go this

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.730 
you know that I might kind of go this
way<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.670> make<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.880> wave<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.479> then<00:01:06.570> back<00:01:06.780> here<00:01:06.810> in

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
way to make a wave and then back here in

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.920 
way to make a wave and then back here in
order<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.130> kind<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.520> get<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.450> type<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.780> look

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
order to kind of get the type of look

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.020 
order to kind of get the type of look
that<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.170> would<00:01:10.380> want<00:01:10.619> out<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.920> hair<00:01:11.100> in<00:01:11.549> my

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
that I would want out of the hair in my

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.050 
that I would want out of the hair in my
positioning<00:01:12.950> so<00:01:13.950> this<00:01:14.310> gives<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> great

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
positioning so this gives you a great

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.660 
positioning so this gives you a great
ability<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.680> you<00:01:16.680> know<00:01:16.710> just<00:01:16.799> position<00:01:17.460> a

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
ability to you know just position a

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.219 
ability to you know just position a
couple<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:18.090> these<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.600> move<00:01:18.840> them<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.080> where

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
couple of these and move them to where

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.859 
couple of these and move them to where
you<00:01:19.500> need<00:01:19.619> them<00:01:19.830> to<00:01:19.950> be<00:01:20.119> and<00:01:21.119> adjust<00:01:21.540> them<00:01:21.720> the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
you need them to be and adjust them the

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.330 
you need them to be and adjust them the
way<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.259> would<00:01:22.409> want<00:01:22.619> them<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.799> be<00:01:22.920> so

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
way that you would want them to be so

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.560 
way that you would want them to be so
kind<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.119> move<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.450> there<00:01:25.880> like<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.119> if<00:01:27.450> I

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
kind of move that there like so if I

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.910 
kind of move that there like so if I
want<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.840> grab<00:01:28.020> all<00:01:28.409> these<00:01:28.680> guys<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.430> can<00:01:30.000> do<00:01:30.119> so

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
want to grab all these guys I can do so

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.960 
want to grab all these guys I can do so
and<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.009> can<00:01:32.220> kind<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.490> move<00:01:32.640> them<00:01:32.790> together

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
and I can kind of move them together

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.870 
and I can kind of move them together
another<00:01:33.930> thing<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.380> can<00:01:34.650> do<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.759> can

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
another thing that you can do is you can

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.120 
another thing that you can do is you can
use<00:01:36.090> all<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.509> your<00:01:36.560> well<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.680> can<00:01:37.799> use<00:01:37.950> the

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
use all of your well you can use the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.940 
use all of your well you can use the
scale<00:01:38.610> tools<00:01:38.939> as<00:01:39.210> well<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:40.290> scale<00:01:40.710> these

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
scale tools as well to scale these

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.260 
scale tools as well to scale these
things<00:01:41.220> together<00:01:41.369> so<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.729> lot<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:41.939> times<00:01:42.090> if

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
things together so a lot of times if

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.330 
things together so a lot of times if
you're<00:01:42.390> making<00:01:42.540> clumps<00:01:43.170> or<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.890> want<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.159> push

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
you're making clumps or you want to push

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.069 
you're making clumps or you want to push
some<00:01:44.549> hairs<00:01:44.759> away<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.119> can<00:01:45.540> kind<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.810> scale

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
some hairs away you can kind of scale

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.749 
some hairs away you can kind of scale
these<00:01:46.290> together<00:01:46.560> or<00:01:46.829> away<00:01:47.220> from<00:01:47.250> each<00:01:47.549> other

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
these together or away from each other

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.539 
these together or away from each other
which<00:01:48.420> works<00:01:48.689> out<00:01:48.930> pretty<00:01:49.110> well<00:01:49.369> you<00:01:50.369> have<00:01:50.490> a

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
which works out pretty well you have a

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.210 
which works out pretty well you have a
little<00:01:50.670> bit<00:01:50.850> more<00:01:51.060> control<00:01:51.540> on<00:01:51.840> these<00:01:52.590> down<00:01:53.070> at

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
little bit more control on these down at

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.249 
little bit more control on these down at
the<00:01:53.340> bottom<00:01:53.640> here<00:01:53.880> in<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.090> strand<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.960> case

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
the bottom here in the strand I case

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.230 
the bottom here in the strand I case
Oliver<00:01:55.680> in<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.219> way<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.700> they<00:01:56.820> perform

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
Oliver in the way that they perform

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.639 
Oliver in the way that they perform
first<00:01:57.570> you<00:01:57.689> can<00:01:57.840> check<00:01:58.049> whether<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.380> want<00:01:58.560> to

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
first you can check whether you want to

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.130 
first you can check whether you want to
use<00:01:58.680> strand<00:01:59.130> eye<00:01:59.219> care<00:01:59.520> or<00:01:59.729> not<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.119> if<00:02:00.869> you

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
use strand eye care or not and if you

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.899 
use strand eye care or not and if you
don't<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.829> can<00:02:01.950> get<00:02:02.100> them<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.310> kind<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.520> move<00:02:02.640> a

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
don't you can get them to kind of move a

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.319 
don't you can get them to kind of move a
little<00:02:03.299> bit<00:02:03.479> more<00:02:03.810> as<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.860> clump<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:06.030> this<00:02:06.180> might

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
little bit more as a clump so this might

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.999 
little bit more as a clump so this might
be<00:02:06.360> what<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:06.930> would<00:02:07.049> expect<00:02:07.469> if<00:02:07.710> you<00:02:07.799> were<00:02:07.890> to

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
be what you would expect if you were to

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.070 
be what you would expect if you were to
kind<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.280> come<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.550> here<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:08.879> move<00:02:09.060> them<00:02:09.270> but

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
kind of come in here and move them but

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.390 
kind of come in here and move them but
you<00:02:10.530> know<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.800> can<00:02:10.979> definitely<00:02:11.520> be<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.730> useful

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
you know that can definitely be a useful

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.119 
you know that can definitely be a useful
a<00:02:13.489> useful<00:02:14.120> way<00:02:14.239> to<00:02:14.269> move<00:02:14.569> these<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:15.170> it<00:02:15.560> can<00:02:15.680> be

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
a useful way to move these and it can be

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:17.500 
a useful way to move these and it can be
a<00:02:16.159> little<00:02:16.400> bit<00:02:16.519> more<00:02:16.640> predictable<00:02:17.180> in<00:02:17.299> some

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
a little bit more predictable in some

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.330 
a little bit more predictable in some
ways<00:02:17.659> and<00:02:18.409> you<00:02:18.470> can<00:02:18.590> also<00:02:18.709> choose<00:02:19.010> that

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
ways and you can also choose that

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.860 
ways and you can also choose that
whether<00:02:19.610> you<00:02:19.730> want<00:02:19.909> history<00:02:20.090> dependent<00:02:20.750> or

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
whether you want history dependent or

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.309 
whether you want history dependent or
independent<00:02:21.430> okay<00:02:22.780> down<00:02:23.780> here<00:02:23.810> in<00:02:24.200> the

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
independent okay down here in the

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.069 
independent okay down here in the
control<00:02:24.590> point<00:02:24.920> section<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:26.150> have<00:02:26.180> even<00:02:27.019> a

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:27.079 
control point section you have even a

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.229 
control point section you have even a
little<00:02:27.110> bit<00:02:27.409> more<00:02:27.620> control<00:02:27.980> which<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.790> really

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
little bit more control which I really

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.330 
little bit more control which I really
like<00:02:29.390> to<00:02:29.510> use<00:02:29.720> quite<00:02:29.959> a<00:02:30.019> bit<00:02:30.109> first<00:02:30.859> is<00:02:31.069> how

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
like to use quite a bit first is how

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.640 
like to use quite a bit first is how
much<00:02:31.519> this<00:02:32.239> these<00:02:32.629> control<00:02:33.019> points<00:02:33.049> kind<00:02:33.560> of

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
much this these control points kind of

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.399 
much this these control points kind of
influence<00:02:34.189> of<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.239> hair<00:02:35.450> so<00:02:35.750> if<00:02:35.900> I<00:02:35.989> kind<00:02:36.170> of<00:02:36.260> go

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:36.409 
influence of the hair so if I kind of go

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.550 
influence of the hair so if I kind of go
in<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:37.430> can<00:02:37.579> see<00:02:37.760> that<00:02:38.170> you<00:02:39.170> know<00:02:39.290> it's

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
in you can see that you know it's

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.009 
in you can see that you know it's
adjusting<00:02:40.129> the<00:02:40.670> I<00:02:40.700> K<00:02:40.909> is<00:02:41.239> affecting<00:02:41.720> kind<00:02:41.930> of

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
adjusting the I K is affecting kind of

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.770 
adjusting the I K is affecting kind of
just<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.319> end<00:02:42.500> points<00:02:43.010> here<00:02:43.340> when<00:02:44.299> you<00:02:44.420> adjust

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
just the end points here when you adjust

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.720 
just the end points here when you adjust
that<00:02:44.930> influence<00:02:45.590> there<00:02:45.799> usually<00:02:46.400> I'll

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
that influence there usually I'll

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.119 
that influence there usually I'll
probably<00:02:47.000> leave<00:02:47.299> that<00:02:47.359> at<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:48.500> high<00:02:48.739> value

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:49.129 
probably leave that at that high value

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:50.649 
probably leave that at that high value
of<00:02:49.220> one<00:02:49.400> so<00:02:49.639> it<00:02:49.760> kind<00:02:49.940> of<00:02:50.000> does<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.329> entire

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:50.659 
of one so it kind of does the entire

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:51.339 
of one so it kind of does the entire
piece

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
piece

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.460 
piece
the<00:02:52.220> next<00:02:52.790> piece<00:02:52.970> or<00:02:53.480> actually<00:02:53.959> the<00:02:54.049> top<00:02:54.260> piece

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
the next piece or actually the top piece

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.860 
the next piece or actually the top piece
here<00:02:54.500> is<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:54.920> position<00:02:55.299> which<00:02:56.299> is<00:02:56.510> really

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
here is the position which is really

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.589 
here is the position which is really
useful<00:02:57.319> I<00:02:57.470> feel<00:02:57.739> because<00:02:58.549> you<00:02:58.849> can<00:02:59.000> grab<00:02:59.239> a

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
useful I feel because you can grab a

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:01.390 
useful I feel because you can grab a
bunch<00:03:00.079> of<00:03:00.170> these<00:03:00.290> guys<00:03:00.349> and<00:03:00.859> of<00:03:00.950> course<00:03:01.189> you

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
bunch of these guys and of course you

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.649 
bunch of these guys and of course you
know<00:03:01.519> you<00:03:01.579> can<00:03:01.819> affect<00:03:02.120> them<00:03:02.239> at<00:03:02.359> the<00:03:02.510> end

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:02.659 
know you can affect them at the end

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:04.899 
know you can affect them at the end
point<00:03:02.959> which<00:03:03.200> is<00:03:03.379> great<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:04.459> you<00:03:04.519> may<00:03:04.700> take

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:04.909 
point which is great so you may take

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:06.879 
point which is great so you may take
these<00:03:05.060> and<00:03:05.299> kind<00:03:05.389> of<00:03:05.510> move<00:03:05.689> them<00:03:05.870> like<00:03:05.900> so<00:03:06.260> but

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:06.889 
these and kind of move them like so but

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:08.379 
these and kind of move them like so but
then<00:03:07.099> after<00:03:07.579> you<00:03:07.609> have<00:03:07.760> them<00:03:07.879> selected<00:03:08.299> you

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:08.389 
then after you have them selected you

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:12.520 
then after you have them selected you
can<00:03:08.480> kind<00:03:08.720> of<00:03:08.780> move<00:03:08.989> that<00:03:09.260> position<00:03:11.319> down<00:03:12.319> the

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
can kind of move that position down the

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.440 
can kind of move that position down the
Strand<00:03:12.829> so<00:03:13.189> you<00:03:13.280> can<00:03:13.519> kind<00:03:13.730> of<00:03:13.790> move<00:03:13.909> that<00:03:14.120> more

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
Strand so you can kind of move that more

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.179 
Strand so you can kind of move that more
towards<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.930> middle<00:03:15.260> or<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:15.650> base<00:03:15.859> of<00:03:16.099> the

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:16.189 
towards the middle or the base of the

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:18.849 
towards the middle or the base of the
route<00:03:16.430> and<00:03:16.670> now<00:03:17.449> you<00:03:17.510> can<00:03:17.870> affect<00:03:18.230> you<00:03:18.739> know

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
route and now you can affect you know

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.009 
route and now you can affect you know
that<00:03:19.099> portion<00:03:19.519> of<00:03:19.669> the<00:03:19.760> hair<00:03:19.970> so<00:03:20.480> this<00:03:20.840> is<00:03:20.989> a

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
that portion of the hair so this is a

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.369 
that portion of the hair so this is a

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.750 
position points you can kind of move
that<00:03:39.829> along<00:03:40.099> I<00:03:40.430> scroll<00:03:40.819> up<00:03:40.849> unto<00:03:41.810> the<00:03:42.760> strand

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
that along I scroll up unto the strand

so<00:04:56.629> you<00:04:57.169> know<00:04:57.259> for<00:04:57.439> instance<00:04:57.590> I<00:04:57.949> wanted<00:04:58.219> to

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
so you know for instance I wanted to

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.790 
so you know for instance I wanted to
twist<00:04:58.460> these<00:04:58.759> guys<00:04:59.030> in<00:04:59.270> here<00:04:59.650> you<00:05:00.650> can

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
twist these guys in here you can

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.550 
twist these guys in here you can
actually<00:05:01.159> bring<00:05:01.430> that<00:05:01.460> into<00:05:02.120> the<00:05:02.900> guides<00:05:03.139> by

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
actually bring that into the guides by

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.589 
actually bring that into the guides by
choosing<00:05:03.919> a<00:05:04.159> dot<00:05:04.340> from<00:05:04.520> stack<00:05:04.789> and<00:05:05.060> people

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:05.599 
choosing a dot from stack and people

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:07.570 
choosing a dot from stack and people
have<00:05:05.719> maybe<00:05:05.990> use<00:05:06.199> the<00:05:06.409> cloth<00:05:06.680> modifier<00:05:06.949> max

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
have maybe use the cloth modifier max

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.339 
have maybe use the cloth modifier max
will<00:05:07.789> be<00:05:07.879> used<00:05:08.090> to<00:05:08.180> something<00:05:08.569> like<00:05:08.719> this<00:05:08.930> so<00:05:09.169> I

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:09.349 
will be used to something like this so I

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:14.019 
will be used to something like this so I
can<00:05:09.650> select<00:05:10.129> all<00:05:10.279> these<00:05:10.430> guys<00:05:12.699> and<00:05:13.699> I<00:05:13.849> could

00:05:14.019 --> 00:05:14.029 
can select all these guys and I could

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:20.379 
can select all these guys and I could
say<00:05:14.150> adopt<00:05:14.479> from<00:05:14.599> stack<00:05:18.610> and<00:05:19.610> there<00:05:20.180> you<00:05:20.270> go

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
say adopt from stack and there you go

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:22.719 
say adopt from stack and there you go
they<00:05:20.569> kind<00:05:20.750> of<00:05:20.810> grab<00:05:21.349> those<00:05:21.620> that<00:05:22.250> stuff<00:05:22.550> with

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
they kind of grab those that stuff with

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:25.540 
they kind of grab those that stuff with
the<00:05:22.759> twist<00:05:23.169> I'll<00:05:24.169> just<00:05:24.379> kind<00:05:24.680> of<00:05:24.710> deselect<00:05:25.129> and

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
the twist I'll just kind of deselect and

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.879 
the twist I'll just kind of deselect and
you<00:05:25.669> can<00:05:25.819> see<00:05:26.000> we'll<00:05:26.960> just<00:05:27.199> turn<00:05:27.349> that<00:05:27.409> twist

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:27.889 
you can see we'll just turn that twist

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:31.329 
you can see we'll just turn that twist
off<00:05:28.069> and<00:05:28.539> those<00:05:29.539> guys<00:05:29.810> have<00:05:30.590> kind<00:05:30.830> of<00:05:30.860> adopted

00:05:31.329 --> 00:05:31.339 
off and those guys have kind of adopted

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:32.800 
off and those guys have kind of adopted
their<00:05:31.520> shape<00:05:31.789> from<00:05:32.000> the<00:05:32.180> stack<00:05:32.389> which<00:05:32.659> is

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
their shape from the stack which is

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:35.439 
their shape from the stack which is
pretty<00:05:33.020> interesting<00:05:33.740> so<00:05:34.339> that's<00:05:34.909> one<00:05:35.210> little

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:35.449 
pretty interesting so that's one little

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:37.659 
pretty interesting so that's one little
feature<00:05:35.659> there<00:05:36.020> the<00:05:36.889> next<00:05:37.039> sub<00:05:37.219> object<00:05:37.550> mode

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
feature there the next sub object mode

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:39.700 
feature there the next sub object mode
I'd<00:05:37.819> like<00:05:37.940> to<00:05:38.029> look<00:05:38.150> at<00:05:38.330> is<00:05:38.539> the<00:05:38.870> roots<00:05:39.110> and<00:05:39.529> if

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
I'd like to look at is the roots and if

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.399 
I'd like to look at is the roots and if
we<00:05:39.830> go<00:05:39.949> into<00:05:40.129> the<00:05:40.370> roots

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:41.409 
we go into the roots

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:44.379 
we go into the roots
I'll<00:05:42.409> turn<00:05:42.620> the<00:05:42.680> guides<00:05:43.370> back<00:05:43.669> on<00:05:43.879> so<00:05:44.120> we<00:05:44.240> can

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:44.389 
I'll turn the guides back on so we can

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:48.879 
I'll turn the guides back on so we can
kind<00:05:44.599> of<00:05:44.659> select<00:05:44.810> them<00:05:45.199> here<00:05:46.569> you<00:05:47.569> have<00:05:47.889> some

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:48.889 
kind of select them here you have some

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:50.950 
kind of select them here you have some
different<00:05:49.250> things<00:05:50.089> to<00:05:50.240> edit<00:05:50.599> like<00:05:50.750> the

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
different things to edit like the

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.339 
different things to edit like the
interpolation<00:05:52.000> you<00:05:53.000> can<00:05:53.180> set<00:05:53.419> rube<00:05:53.930> Channel

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:54.349 
interpolation you can set rube Channel

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:56.350 
interpolation you can set rube Channel
root<00:05:54.740> Channel<00:05:55.159> groups<00:05:55.400> which<00:05:56.150> we'll<00:05:56.330> be

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:56.360 
root Channel groups which we'll be

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.779 
root Channel groups which we'll be
looking<00:05:56.569> at<00:05:56.900> in<00:05:57.319> a<00:05:57.589> little<00:05:57.830> bit<00:05:57.979> and<00:05:58.189> this

00:05:58.779 --> 00:05:58.789 
looking at in a little bit and this

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:00.610 
looking at in a little bit and this
channel<00:05:59.240> manager<00:05:59.689> allows<00:05:59.960> you<00:06:00.110> to<00:06:00.229> break<00:06:00.409> them

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
channel manager allows you to break them

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.939 
channel manager allows you to break them
up<00:06:00.770> into<00:06:01.539> into<00:06:02.539> channels<00:06:02.960> as<00:06:03.169> well

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:03.949 
up into into channels as well

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:06.279 
up into into channels as well
kind<00:06:04.460> of<00:06:04.520> like<00:06:04.669> smoothing<00:06:05.120> groups<00:06:05.330> where<00:06:06.110> you

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:06.289 
kind of like smoothing groups where you

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:07.659 
kind of like smoothing groups where you
can<00:06:06.439> apply<00:06:06.529> different<00:06:06.770> things<00:06:07.370> to<00:06:07.639> a

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
can apply different things to a

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:11.679 
can apply different things to a
different<00:06:08.150> Channel<00:06:09.189> the<00:06:10.189> other<00:06:11.089> thing<00:06:11.569> that's

00:06:11.679 --> 00:06:11.689 
different Channel the other thing that's

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:13.839 
different Channel the other thing that's
in<00:06:11.900> here<00:06:11.930> or<00:06:12.500> but<00:06:13.069> kind<00:06:13.250> of<00:06:13.310> the<00:06:13.370> major<00:06:13.550> thing

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:13.849 
in here or but kind of the major thing

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:16.240 
in here or but kind of the major thing
that<00:06:13.879> I<00:06:14.060> wanted<00:06:14.419> to<00:06:14.539> look<00:06:14.689> at<00:06:14.900> was<00:06:15.620> the<00:06:15.650> plant

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.250 
that I wanted to look at was the plant

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.980 
that I wanted to look at was the plant
and<00:06:16.490> they<00:06:16.610> remove<00:06:16.969> so<00:06:17.270> of<00:06:17.360> course<00:06:17.509> I<00:06:17.689> can<00:06:17.839> go

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:17.990 
and they remove so of course I can go

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.709 
and they remove so of course I can go
into<00:06:18.169> any<00:06:18.560> one<00:06:18.710> of<00:06:18.889> these<00:06:19.099> roots<00:06:19.580> or<00:06:20.000> a<00:06:20.060> bunch

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:20.719 
into any one of these roots or a bunch

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:21.969 
into any one of these roots or a bunch
of<00:06:20.839> these<00:06:20.960> and<00:06:21.199> just<00:06:21.289> say<00:06:21.500> you<00:06:21.560> know<00:06:21.800> these

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:21.979 
of these and just say you know these

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:24.610 
of these and just say you know these
were<00:06:22.159> generated<00:06:22.759> but<00:06:23.389> for<00:06:23.599> whatever<00:06:23.750> reason<00:06:23.930> I

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:24.620 
were generated but for whatever reason I

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.929 
were generated but for whatever reason I
don't<00:06:24.680> want<00:06:24.979> them<00:06:25.189> so<00:06:25.370> I'm<00:06:25.520> going<00:06:25.699> to<00:06:25.759> just

00:06:25.929 --> 00:06:25.939 
don't want them so I'm going to just

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:29.399 
don't want them so I'm going to just
remove<00:06:26.270> these<00:06:26.539> roots<00:06:26.870> so<00:06:27.529> a<00:06:27.560> little<00:06:28.069> bit<00:06:28.189> of

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:29.409 
remove these roots so a little bit of

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:32.469 
remove these roots so a little bit of
ability<00:06:30.409> to<00:06:30.439> kind<00:06:30.830> of<00:06:30.889> adjust<00:06:31.009> that<00:06:31.430> and<00:06:31.699> then

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 
ability to kind of adjust that and then

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:34.689 
ability to kind of adjust that and then
after<00:06:33.379> if<00:06:33.500> I<00:06:33.620> you<00:06:34.039> know<00:06:34.129> had<00:06:34.339> a<00:06:34.370> particular

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:34.699 
after if I you know had a particular

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:38.079 
after if I you know had a particular
area<00:06:35.240> which<00:06:35.419> happens<00:06:35.830> you<00:06:36.830> know<00:06:36.979> fairly<00:06:37.789> often

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:38.089 
area which happens you know fairly often

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:40.089 
area which happens you know fairly often
that<00:06:38.509> I<00:06:38.539> needed<00:06:38.990> more<00:06:39.169> guides<00:06:39.500> in<00:06:39.770> because<00:06:40.069> I

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:40.099 
that I needed more guides in because I

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:40.760 
that I needed more guides in because I
wanted

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770 
wanted

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:43.550 
wanted
detail<00:06:41.160> I<00:06:41.699> can<00:06:42.300> go<00:06:42.449> in<00:06:42.599> and<00:06:42.750> just<00:06:42.870> plant<00:06:43.229> roots

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 
detail I can go in and just plant roots

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.240 
detail I can go in and just plant roots
which<00:06:44.099> I<00:06:44.250> find<00:06:44.490> really<00:06:44.789> really<00:06:45.830> beneficial<00:06:46.830> if

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.250 
which I find really really beneficial if

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.040 
which I find really really beneficial if
I<00:06:47.550> just<00:06:47.729> kind<00:06:47.910> of<00:06:47.970> click<00:06:48.180> here<00:06:48.479> you<00:06:48.750> can<00:06:48.780> see<00:06:49.020> I

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
I just kind of click here you can see I

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.689 
I just kind of click here you can see I
can<00:06:49.259> click<00:06:49.500> and<00:06:49.620> add<00:06:49.740> roots<00:06:49.979> and<00:06:50.190> as<00:06:50.370> I<00:06:50.520> add

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:50.699 
can click and add roots and as I add

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:52.790 
can click and add roots and as I add
them<00:06:51.000> you'll<00:06:51.210> see<00:06:51.449> that<00:06:51.629> basically<00:06:52.229> they<00:06:52.560> look

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 
them you'll see that basically they look

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.790 
them you'll see that basically they look
at<00:06:53.460> their<00:06:53.729> surroundings<00:06:54.360> and<00:06:54.599> they<00:06:54.750> adopt<00:06:55.590> the

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 
at their surroundings and they adopt the

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.710 
at their surroundings and they adopt the
shape<00:06:56.069> of<00:06:57.229> the<00:06:58.849> roots<00:06:59.849> and<00:07:00.090> strands<00:07:00.539> that<00:07:00.659> are

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 
shape of the roots and strands that are

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.540 
shape of the roots and strands that are
around<00:07:01.139> them<00:07:01.379> so<00:07:01.650> you<00:07:01.710> can<00:07:01.979> I<00:07:02.099> I<00:07:02.129> can<00:07:02.400> see<00:07:02.520> a

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:02.550 
around them so you can I I can see a

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.180 
around them so you can I I can see a
little<00:07:02.759> bare<00:07:03.150> spot<00:07:03.479> here<00:07:03.900> and<00:07:04.080> I<00:07:04.590> can<00:07:04.800> add<00:07:04.979> in

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:05.190 
little bare spot here and I can add in

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:06.619 
little bare spot here and I can add in
some<00:07:05.220> roots<00:07:05.610> there<00:07:05.849> and<00:07:06.060> you<00:07:06.120> can<00:07:06.240> see<00:07:06.360> that<00:07:06.539> we

00:07:06.619 --> 00:07:06.629 
some roots there and you can see that we

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:09.589 
some roots there and you can see that we
get<00:07:06.840> a<00:07:07.050> bunch<00:07:07.979> of<00:07:08.129> different<00:07:08.490> guides<00:07:09.180> there

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599 
get a bunch of different guides there

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:12.080 
get a bunch of different guides there
that<00:07:10.050> are<00:07:10.229> you<00:07:10.830> know<00:07:10.919> just<00:07:11.190> quickly<00:07:11.729> in<00:07:11.970> the

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:12.090 
that are you know just quickly in the

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:13.999 
that are you know just quickly in the
general<00:07:12.479> shape<00:07:12.750> of<00:07:13.050> the<00:07:13.440> roots<00:07:13.770> that<00:07:13.889> are

00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:14.009 
general shape of the roots that are

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:16.040 
general shape of the roots that are
around<00:07:14.340> them<00:07:14.639> which<00:07:14.819> is<00:07:15.000> pretty<00:07:15.240> helpful<00:07:15.479> so

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.050 
around them which is pretty helpful so

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.170 
around them which is pretty helpful so
that's<00:07:16.380> a<00:07:16.470> general<00:07:16.500> overview<00:07:17.039> of<00:07:17.220> these<00:07:17.789> kind

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.180 
that's a general overview of these kind

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.200 
that's a general overview of these kind
of<00:07:18.300> brush<00:07:19.289> tools<00:07:19.590> certainly<00:07:20.099> there<00:07:20.340> are<00:07:20.699> a<00:07:20.729> few

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:21.210 
of brush tools certainly there are a few

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:23.899 
of brush tools certainly there are a few
more<00:07:21.710> you<00:07:22.710> know<00:07:22.830> parameters<00:07:23.460> and<00:07:23.699> more

00:07:23.899 --> 00:07:23.909 
more you know parameters and more

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:25.610 
more you know parameters and more
in-depth<00:07:24.300> things<00:07:24.569> like<00:07:24.840> the<00:07:25.020> channels<00:07:25.440> that

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:25.620 
in-depth things like the channels that

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.350 
in-depth things like the channels that
we'll<00:07:25.800> look<00:07:25.949> at<00:07:26.099> a<00:07:26.159> little<00:07:26.430> bit<00:07:26.550> later<00:07:26.759> but<00:07:27.090> I

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 
we'll look at a little bit later but I

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.420 
we'll look at a little bit later but I
just<00:07:27.690> wanted<00:07:27.900> to<00:07:27.990> kind<00:07:28.139> of<00:07:28.289> give<00:07:28.440> us<00:07:28.560> a<00:07:28.740> quick

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:29.430 
just wanted to kind of give us a quick

00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:32.099 
start on these things that we find in

00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:36.469 
start on these things that we find in
edit<00:07:32.490> guides<00:07:32.729> in<00:07:33.000> order<00:07:33.210> to<00:07:33.360> style<00:07:33.840> our<00:07:34.169> hair
