 long time pirate ets and had a 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.630
 facebook campaign on the galera to 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.360
 People leave the pirate 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.060
 I got it, I got my name. 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.950
 this original 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.800
 I downloaded a trip thereafter like this 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.390
 I was crazy, lady, but I had a 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.170
 here near my city that 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.820
 it would be butiá and the mine exists the mira 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.510
 inhale when I got into the crosshairs 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:36.010
 I was very crazy, it was sinister if 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:37.900
 the guy is and whatever and I am very guto 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.600

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.990
 Bush 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.030
 What you like best about today is not the 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.180
 face 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.759
 man I think I love, it's kind of 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.270
 like reality is expensive i am 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:04.110
 was all the guy just what kind it is because 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:06.970
 the business being here was understood that 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.220
 dream face you had talk pull 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:14.290
 today I do not see it's not the one but I wanted 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:18.069
 much that wanted to go to the expansion but 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:21.130
 I'm going back to the amazon will get there kind 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.560
 which is a very hot stretch to see that the 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:28.120
 road is very complicated I think 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.500
 wanted to see more of the Amazonian side there and 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.840
 today so expensive any 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:36.730
 3 you most like to walk inside the 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.470
 map liked the south fell i like 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.220
 to walk between santa catarina and rio grande 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.549
 southern 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.560
 I like it very dear, which reached 3 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:47.110
 Favorite on any trip you spoke to 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.239
 so it's today I made a trip that 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:54.060
 It was worth it, yes, what was the trip? 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.060
 What else has worsened to this day? 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.859
 Dude I think I 'll never have senna power. 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:04.019
 follows the mountain range that runs from slabs is 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:08.079
 another city that she will touch is very 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.340
 I seriously remember how the trip was expensive 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.950
 face 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.780
 I like to walk somewhere local if he does not 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.620
 There was a way and he had to walk 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.500
 wheel was very mean that you are with 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.580
 the truck 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:28.830
 today I 'm with scania, which is the 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:33.840
 50's model 17 already our face you like 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:35.640
 of the foot heavy guy but the guy is good 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.290
 always have a way because I like one 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.190
 quieter business I think 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.860
 This is one of the characteristics of dodo 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.050
 It's the face of that kind so you have it. 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.170
 space for everyone in the galera that 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.150
 do you like to step on more? 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:54.450
 pizarro and who likes to walk more 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:58.560
 Right, I like guys too, it 's the galley. 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:02.450
 of those who overpower John very much until 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:05.220
 not so much car that I do in the courage 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.370
 Do you arrive at the bars from time to time? 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.100
 How long I like the ford truck? 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:15.420
 charge of the saw the kind load I use the 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:18.690
 uea partnership mold right that is the motto 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:21.840
 of the handles are heavy loads 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.250
 Yes, they are well and very intense that he can 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.270
 man's face 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:29.820
 and hence guto will climb celso roth to stay 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.790
 turning wheel is complicated there is 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.810
 actually even more expensive and may be 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:40.050
 something that does not manual or automatic steering wheel 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:41.390
 chicago joão godoy is played in the manual 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.860

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:45.419
 dude, I have the option of 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.560
 marches understood when I see that my 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:53.710
 picking up too much and giving help start 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:56.260
 It's cool to know how multi-player face is 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:01.430
 man I can not play multiplayer 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:04.360
 seriously was even released from the tnl team 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.440
 Here I can not play multiplayer. 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:11.030
 Do you want to send a salve to someone? 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:15.830
 face-to-face with autuori for all 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:18.860
 punk is everyone even from tnl people 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.750
 the rest is for you luiz that was worth it 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:24.680
 the victor who was with us now too 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:28.930
 just in the ts for everyone that was 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.930
 very fan of very flamenco reaction 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:35.960
 Did you ever dream of being a driver? 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:38.780
 truck man face man I'm a driver 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.070
 do not you think there 's a pickup truck? 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.100
 Particular only that I have a problem 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:45.110
 staff that I can not drive type 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.420
 truck support private car 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.470
 key 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.680
 so in a way this is the 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:56.090
 A dream come true. 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:58.070
 that is very top is good the power power guy 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.480
 to have this opportunity, I do not 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.690
 I particularly dreamed a lot 

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:05.030
 face on your truck driver in 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:08.180
 Come in, man, you think that's the case, I guess. 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.980
 very tops business deal but unfortunately 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.960
 today's work is like this 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.970
 I'm a bank man, this is here for me. 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.470
 it's kind of like the realization of a dream 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:18.020
 that I can not have today 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.240

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:23.750

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.550
 It's always nice to talk to you.

 as soon as they are entered that they are 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:31.490
 Because of this I do not think so 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:35.380

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:38.450
