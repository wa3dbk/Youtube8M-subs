00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello everybody, from here the plenary this is the 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.830
 enade tablet promotes and runs in 28.1 more 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.389
 despite being called a tablet, do not 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.429
 this equipment is a 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.870
 authentic computer for being one more 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.210
 backyard computer 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.279
 I find interesting moral damage so 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.260
 notifications before entering snow saw 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.410
 in itself then this equipment counts on 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.080
 intel atom quorum processor 1.83 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:28.320
 giant also has two goals from 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.040
 16 gigas in the internal mori a screen and 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.469
 ps full hd 8.9-inch camera 5 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.710
 megapixels behind 2 megapixels to 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:42.510
 front has SD card support has 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.940
 3g connection comes with the 365 dof and still has 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.070
 an hdmi port to connect to a 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.960
 monitor but will now know and 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.010
 justifications we will enter the analysis 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.199
 wins 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.969
 let's get first saved is e 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.430
 We 'll see soon how 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.500
 works and what your performance is like 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.809
 being of outer surface with the body in 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.270
 that bring eb1 corn has a design 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.030
 attractive in my opinion is to run the 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.430
 construction and street has a good movie in hand 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.979
 is not exactly the lightest tablet in the 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.320
 world but it was before being that it has 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.270
 a perceived weight will lose two already 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.670
 had lemon with respect to 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.960
 size with 9 inches I can say that 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.790
 laid on the hand 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.790
 garbage is one of the strengths of this 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.979
 equipment such as a full hd screen and psd 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.960
 have very good viewing angles and runs 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.280
 very interesting makes that no 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.479
 film is a pretty experience. 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.490
 nice 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.890
 relative to the exterior clark being a 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.439
 and can connect feathers or even a corner 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.450
 by USB with one of the included accessories 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.939
 want to see all the included accessories 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.490
 do not forget summer unboxing whose link 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.200
 is in the description put it you now 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.360
 we're probably saying it's bad 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.610
 The truth was that the equipment already 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.460
 design cough but after all how 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.960
 how does your performance work 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.299
 with respect to how it 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.340
 simple enough imagine the computer 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:03.119
 windows that you probably have in 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.729
 home running windows 8.1 is the same 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.899
 basically the same only with function 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.640
 touch screen 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.440
 speaking of performance now 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.910
 I was hoping to play here and put everything in and it's not 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.740
 That's why this tablet bar 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.110
 computer 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.120
 It was built, this did not think of me. 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.130
 but for tasks so that they can 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.380
 want to buy the device as see 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.840
 movies and surfing grandson to work on sap 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.820
 from the office and can handle all this without 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.680
 no problem since we are talking 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.540
 of the office let you take an odd moment 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.710
 said one of the most brutal things 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.170
 of these equipment 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:37.610
 basically I will with a subscription 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.680
 office 365 free this basically 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.350
 means they will have access to the Ã£ 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.660
 excel powerpoint is one terabyte of 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.510
 android storage minutes 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.640
 skype for free subscription only 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.850
 of this plan for a long time costs 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.620
 and it is therefore the case that 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.270
 tablet a great bonus 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.070
 and since we're talking about word 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.320
 excel or powerpoint let me say that 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.210
 the applications work here quite a bit 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.580
 goes in correns in almost no one wants 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.170
 always take a morning so I can 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.110
 recommend the use of both applications 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.090
 office on this sound equipment 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.810
 wills any such rotating in 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.880
 tablet 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.400
 however I think this is lack of 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.800
 windows optimization to make a 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.450
 since it has windows 8 point because you 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.270
 they will do it, they will be able to upgrade 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.160
 free for windows 10 when I left and 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.930
 so it may be that this problem is 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.030
 let me just say that before 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.130
 advance more in the region who wants to use 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.170
 this but as a tablet as a pc 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.930
 to work in the apple store and 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.490
 microsoft is disappointing for you not 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.590
 was here or is it just the android will be 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.510
 better because it is the number of applications 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.220
 available is quite another vote 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.840
 against and says he saw the battery is 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.820
 normal for an equipment to run the 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.010
 windows for about four hours in 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.660
 May at 5 hours of continuous use in 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.040
 However, they may have stopped 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.620
 to see good things with the equipment 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.510
 the equipment but not is not all easy 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.340
 have some complaints pointed out in 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.100
 First of all I consumed a lot of battery power. 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.740
 booth will be left for example three 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.020
 or four days arrives with battery 50% 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.180
 When you pay I just do not 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.130
 It must have no battery so it goes by 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.330
 I'm off every day at night 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.550
 before bed 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.950
 however it is not so much of a problem 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.720
 since the league is quite fast 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.489
 then also say that when they want to 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.859
 use windows on the desktop and 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.800
 to advertise an element using apps to use 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.500
 casing of a quick keyboard makes a 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.960
 Chinese 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.150
 because that 's it 's too small to use 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.250
 this does not happen in the 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.780
 planted in areas and only for size 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.880
 chinese for windows 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.950
 obviously happens in the last 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.840
 criticism is for little memory after 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.240
 operating system installed under a yes 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.040
 tinga will play quite unclear with 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.960
 the micro sd card and solves the problem 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.290
 but I let the equipment go 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.210
 more expensive and had at least 64 gigs 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.920
 internal memory but continuing with the 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.830
 video and before reaching the conclusion 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.990
 just missing the keyboard talk 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.669
 which will not include in this a purchase 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:02.760
 optional in france 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:05.070
 No, it's not optional, it's mandatory if you go 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.020
 buy was have to buy eco 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.080
 keyboard because why it is practically 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.720
 one does all right right protective cover 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.580
 they stretch scarf and they will fight there have 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.560
 a good training loses the letters despite 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.210
 small ways to write 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.430
 The only problem I found that is the 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.380
 keyboard have a bull in Spanish 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.600
 however it is not a big problem because 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.370
 goes to Spanish and ninety-nine for 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.710
 percent equal to the Portuguese only 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.780
 some points where it slightly incites 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.180
 different to say that being 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.280
 existing products in you was in 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.620
 three years guarantees is what is fantastic 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.030
 important is the time of completion by 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.130
 240 euros 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.410
 it was up to brilliant for any 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:46.169
 person who wants to see and mails surf the 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:48.570
 net to work in office apps in a 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:51.060
 windows environment such as a 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:53.729
 student tried to leave already I went to me and it's 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.650
 quite handy and I can say that I stay - 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:58.290
 undoubtedly especially 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.479
 very attractive price after this review 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:02.490
 if they want to buy the 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:04.590
 registration just as boxing did 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.050
 since the reviews which found that 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.729
 were here, they wanted to have the 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.220
 movies because a tablet with a 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:13.200
 windows do not screen much design 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:15.270
 wake up the state if they do not 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:18.210
 and also to come here from the 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:21.650
 motown 360 is coming and project 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.650
 there is the next person
