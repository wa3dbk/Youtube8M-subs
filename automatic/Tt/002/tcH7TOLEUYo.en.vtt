00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.580

 in solidarity with the organization that 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:23.369

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:25.650
 to fulfill all the loves of the 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.630
 Our campaign of colors under the ball is 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.310
 It was very important that I was socially

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.239

 super gorgeous design for a cause 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:57.940
 fair and I believe that fashion needs 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.859
 to be in this moment together with this 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.250
 thinking and with this desire to help 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:02.250
 the others 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.210
 she got rid of the princesses' palace 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.620
 which was a pension for transvestites in 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.740
 80's 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.860
 and when AIDS came out scary 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.320
 overwhelmingly she opened the doors of this 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:24.010
 home to accommodate these these patients 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:27.360
 her work was and always will be 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:31.080
 wonderful because she gave it all 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.080
 including your life 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:37.100
 so with the help of the support house 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.010
 brenda lee 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.920
 Today I know what it's like to live today. 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.530
 nothing is a normal person like you 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.580
 brenda has become a reference in 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:54.710
 to those with the AIDS virus 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.770
 but neither is his good will enough 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.960
 need more dedication perseverance 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.710
 money for work as serious as 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.070
 This one 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:08.000
 always been very selfless and did not 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:11.030
 It hurts me, I remember she's gone more. 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.520
 She left us the will to go too. 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.440

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:24.530
