there<00:00:35.920> this<00:00:36.760> water<00:00:37.120> pump<00:00:37.390> is<00:00:38.200> driven<00:00:38.560> by<00:00:38.890> the

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.660 

Israel<00:00:42.130> by<00:00:42.310> the<00:00:42.370> timing<00:00:42.850> chain<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.890> something

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
Israel by the timing chain and something

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.930 
Israel by the timing chain and something
that<00:00:45.820> I<00:00:45.880> notice<00:00:46.500> this<00:00:47.500> car<00:00:47.740> start<00:00:48.040> overheating

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
that I notice this car start overheating

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.070 
that I notice this car start overheating
and<00:00:49.800> on<00:00:50.800> the<00:00:50.980> cold<00:00:51.190> weather<00:00:51.690> didn't<00:00:52.690> get<00:00:52.870> any

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.080 
and on the cold weather didn't get any

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.620 
and on the cold weather didn't get any
heat<00:00:53.500> in<00:00:53.950> the<00:00:54.930> heater<00:00:55.930> core<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.850> after

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 
heat in the heater core so after

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.220 
heat in the heater core so after
changing<00:01:00.090> replacing<00:01:01.090> twice<00:01:01.360> the<00:01:01.720> thermostat

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
changing replacing twice the thermostat

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.880 
changing replacing twice the thermostat
I<00:01:02.560> will<00:01:02.740> decide<00:01:03.040> to<00:01:03.370> look<00:01:03.910> forward<00:01:04.620> look<00:01:05.620> for

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
I will decide to look forward look for

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.800 
I will decide to look forward look for
something<00:01:06.250> different<00:01:06.400> so<00:01:06.940> we<00:01:06.970> decided<00:01:07.720> to

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
something different so we decided to

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.310 
something different so we decided to
look<00:01:07.990> on<00:01:08.170> in<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:09.390> into<00:01:10.390> the<00:01:10.480> water<00:01:10.690> pump<00:01:11.050> and

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
look on in the into the water pump and

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.670 
look on in the into the water pump and
we<00:01:11.470> found<00:01:12.010> that<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:13.450> this<00:01:14.050> wheel<00:01:14.350> is<00:01:14.680> loose

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
we found that this this wheel is loose

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.590 
we found that this this wheel is loose
it's<00:01:17.680> loose<00:01:17.830> from<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:18.400> main<00:01:18.580> shaft<00:01:18.820> on<00:01:19.120> the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
it's loose from the main shaft on the

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.880 
it's loose from the main shaft on the
water<00:01:19.840> pump<00:01:20.520> see<00:01:22.920> there's<00:01:23.920> supposed<00:01:24.250> to<00:01:24.400> be

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
water pump see there's supposed to be

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.600 
water pump see there's supposed to be
moving<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:27.010> same<00:01:27.220> time<00:01:28.049> but<00:01:29.049> this<00:01:29.770> is<00:01:29.979> not<00:01:30.250> so

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
moving the same time but this is not so

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.700 
moving the same time but this is not so
if<00:01:30.880> you<00:01:31.090> put<00:01:31.299> any<00:01:31.450> pressure<00:01:31.720> to<00:01:31.960> the<00:01:32.380> heater

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
if you put any pressure to the heater

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.110 
if you put any pressure to the heater
core<00:01:33.040> and<00:01:33.729> also<00:01:34.720> let<00:01:35.290> the<00:01:35.440> car<00:01:35.620> overheat<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:37.090> I

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
core and also let the car overheat so I

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.260 
core and also let the car overheat so I
did<00:01:38.010> the<00:01:39.010> reason<00:01:39.340> why<00:01:39.490> we<00:01:39.670> notice<00:01:39.970> that<00:01:40.090> is

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
did the reason why we notice that is

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.260 
did the reason why we notice that is
because<00:01:40.630> every<00:01:41.409> time<00:01:41.590> we<00:01:41.710> start<00:01:42.640> driving<00:01:43.119> this

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
because every time we start driving this

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.530 
because every time we start driving this
vehicle<00:01:43.600> around<00:01:44.200> we<00:01:44.979> notice<00:01:45.310> that<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.790> steam

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
vehicle around we notice that the steam

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:53.149 
vehicle around we notice that the steam
and<00:01:46.900> cooling<00:01:47.830> about<00:01:48.760> the<00:01:49.030> main<00:01:50.310> radiator<00:01:51.310> cap

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
and cooling about the main radiator cap

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.120 
and cooling about the main radiator cap
so<00:01:54.159> we<00:01:54.580> decide<00:01:55.450> to<00:01:55.479> go<00:01:55.869> ahead<00:01:56.110> and<00:01:56.290> get<00:01:56.650> deeper

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
so we decide to go ahead and get deeper

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.179 
so we decide to go ahead and get deeper
into<00:01:57.729> this<00:01:57.909> problem<00:01:58.740> and<00:02:00.150> also<00:02:01.260> all<00:02:02.260> it<00:02:02.650> took<00:02:03.070> a

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
into this problem and also all it took a

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.620 
into this problem and also all it took a
little<00:02:03.340> while<00:02:03.520> to<00:02:03.580> get<00:02:03.850> to<00:02:03.909> it<00:02:04.119> to<00:02:04.360> the<00:02:04.450> word
