00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.850
 how is it actually not going 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.709
 take 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:13.709
 the number of men 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:24.809
 the weather before breaking free with the finish line by just two more 

00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:25.699
 times 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.979
 however, there was rarely the idea that I find 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:29.970
 via twitter 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.970
 the closing manche would be able to walk the streets 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.210
 as 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.819
 to initiate the investigation 

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:46.840
 that is not a much larger 10 percent loss 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.840
 not the desired effect anyway 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.820
 traffic jams can now be found again 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.140
 users will decrease 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.140
 after 79 minutes 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.210
 because of this 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.960
 we can keep it 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.960
 we want the Netherlands to do better now than it was 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.310
 commercial channels 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.810
 the bodies were salvaged 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.870
 the release we will probably have more 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.870
 the perpetrators are gone 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.450
 do you want that 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.080
 it's a shame we see 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.850
 the works will respond 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.729
 world 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.729
 it was an interim government
