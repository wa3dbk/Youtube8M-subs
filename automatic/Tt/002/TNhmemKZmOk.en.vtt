00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
where the course that it's going to hit

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.980 
where the course that it's going to hit
no<00:01:47.130> further<00:01:47.490> than<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.270> little<00:01:48.659> under<00:01:48.840> your

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
belly button area so that's what we're

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.450 
belly button area so that's what we're

going to utilize as the natural hip area

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.999 
going to utilize as the natural hip area
so<00:01:54.119> it's<00:01:54.420> not<00:01:54.630> going<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.049> hit<00:01:55.259> too<00:01:55.829> much

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
so it's not going to hit too much

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:56.450 
so it's not going to hit too much
farther

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
farther
