 brought you dear friends with you 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.549
 still rimas we continue to feed 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.770
 fly out and I want to show you 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.870
 something which developers here here 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.900
 recently added in the latest patch 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:17.550
 This is about music to see if we 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.859
 quickly stop ship hear 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.250
 music doubled tripled in general 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.590
 somehow 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.010
 we echo him quickly we type 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.010
 speed 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.760
 i hope you can hear i'm just sitting in 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.830
 headphones and I advise you too if you don’t 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.070
 hear can can wear headphones 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.750
 shure 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:44.480
 I will not just talk and heal 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:47.270
 sharply planet and abruptly become a ship 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.129
 with abrupt maneuvers music changes it 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.190
 it becomes as if tripling and not for 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.650
 there them it is served ace it adds 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.900
 atmospheric space simulator in 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.449
 that which we are now 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:05.019
 we just play I don't know without words without 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:05.019
 words on the clan to give again 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.140
 1 music will play again normally 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.020
 so here we are this planet will scan 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.289
 look and fly to the next planet and 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.329
 as long as we are not going away we 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:31.950
 be full date with full speed 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.259
 we need a little bit off her 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:41.000
 because she is trying to count us 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:41.000
 and so on so fly 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.540
