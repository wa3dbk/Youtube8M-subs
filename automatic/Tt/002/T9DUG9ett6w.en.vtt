brand<00:00:33.450> new<00:00:33.600> 200<00:00:33.809> series<00:00:37.129> where<00:00:38.129> you're<00:00:38.309> just

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
brand new 200 series where you're just

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.389 
brand new 200 series where you're just
like<00:00:38.579> cutting<00:00:39.059> with<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:39.899> yeah<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.559> suppose

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
like cutting with that yeah I suppose

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.889 
like cutting with that yeah I suppose
that's<00:00:41.969> what<00:00:42.120> that's<00:00:42.329> why<00:00:42.450> they<00:00:42.570> call<00:00:42.750> the

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
that's what that's why they call the

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.069 
that's what that's why they call the
conversion<00:00:43.530> that's<00:00:43.829> right<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:45.120> remember<00:00:45.719> look

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
conversion that's right I remember look

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.869 
conversion that's right I remember look
at<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.260> kids<00:00:46.469> brains<00:00:46.829> bank<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.489> use<00:00:47.640> not<00:00:47.850> a

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
at the kids brains bank and use not a

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.600 
at the kids brains bank and use not a
mark<00:00:48.210> on<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:49.440> what<00:00:49.559> what<00:00:49.829> exactly<00:00:49.950> are<00:00:50.489> you

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
mark on it so what what exactly are you

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.540 
mark on it so what what exactly are you
going<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.850> do<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.239> convert<00:00:51.570> this<00:00:51.899> thing<00:00:52.340> into<00:00:53.340> a

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
going to do to convert this thing into a

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.750 
going to do to convert this thing into a
you<00:00:54.260> all<00:00:55.260> will<00:00:55.620> go<00:00:55.710> take<00:00:56.100> all<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.489> interior

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
you all will go take all the interior

now they've actually cut the entire

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.719 
now they've actually cut the entire
chassis<00:01:17.720> in<00:01:18.110> half<00:01:18.440> and<00:01:18.770> taken<00:01:19.130> the<00:01:19.220> rear<00:01:19.460> end

chassis in half and taken the rear end
of<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:19.940> truss<00:01:20.180> battles<00:01:21.170> that<00:01:21.440> way<00:01:21.619> and<00:01:22.150> this

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
of the truss battles that way and this

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.719 
of the truss battles that way and this
is<00:01:23.210> where<00:01:23.630> it<00:01:23.750> gets<00:01:23.869> really<00:01:24.350> scary<00:01:24.710> for<00:01:25.010> me<00:01:25.159> but

space in if you have a look here I'll
show<00:01:31.190> you<00:01:31.220> build<00:01:32.000> this<00:01:32.060> little<00:01:32.270> camera<00:01:32.570> in

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
show you build this little camera in

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:41.380 
show you build this little camera in
here<00:01:34.360> and<00:01:35.360> there<00:01:35.600> it<00:01:35.750> is<00:01:39.580> my<00:01:40.580> cars<00:01:40.850> in<00:01:41.030> two

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
here and there it is my cars in two

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.800 
here and there it is my cars in two
pieces<00:01:41.930> so<00:01:42.170> we're<00:01:42.860> actually<00:01:42.950> going<00:01:43.220> to<00:01:43.310> stick

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
pieces so we're actually going to stick

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.510 
pieces so we're actually going to stick
650<00:01:44.810> millimetres<00:01:45.140> into<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.310> chassis<00:01:46.930> 650

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
650 millimetres into the chassis 650

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.520 
650 millimetres into the chassis 650
welded<00:01:49.520> that<00:01:49.550> in<00:01:49.850> weld<00:01:50.600> it<00:01:50.780> on<00:01:50.899> that<00:01:51.080> in<00:01:51.259> and

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
welded that in weld it on that in and

00:01:51.530 --> 00:02:01.910 
welded that in weld it on that in and
the<00:01:52.100> car<00:01:52.340> well<00:01:52.670> it<00:01:52.820> becomes<00:01:53.090> longer

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.650 

starting<00:02:02.920> to<00:02:02.980> take<00:02:03.130> shape<00:02:03.490> now<00:02:04.090> pull<00:02:04.630> back

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
starting to take shape now pull back

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.750 
starting to take shape now pull back
together<00:02:05.190> until<00:02:06.190> they<00:02:06.250> put<00:02:06.460> all<00:02:06.580> their

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
together until they put all their

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.750 
together until they put all their
strengthening<00:02:07.600> gusset<00:02:08.140> plates<00:02:08.380> in<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:09.610> now

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:09.760 
strengthening gusset plates in and now

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.640 
strengthening gusset plates in and now
are<00:02:09.940> they<00:02:10.030> going<00:02:10.180> to<00:02:10.240> start<00:02:10.479> work<00:02:10.720> on<00:02:11.080> what

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
are they going to start work on what

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:12.930 
are they going to start work on what
goes<00:02:11.830> in<00:02:12.070> here<00:02:12.100> they've<00:02:12.520> got<00:02:12.640> this<00:02:12.730> big

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
goes in here they've got this big

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.480 
goes in here they've got this big
toolbox<00:02:13.210> that<00:02:13.660> goes<00:02:13.840> in<00:02:14.050> here<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:14.470> then<00:02:15.340> I<00:02:15.430> can

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
toolbox that goes in here and then I can

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.400 
toolbox that goes in here and then I can
start<00:02:15.820> looking<00:02:15.940> at<00:02:16.210> lengthening<00:02:17.110> all<00:02:17.290> the

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
start looking at lengthening all the

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.890 
start looking at lengthening all the
wires<00:02:17.650> at<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.040> back<00:02:18.310> cause<00:02:18.520> remember<00:02:18.900> 650

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
wires at the back cause remember 650

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.050 
wires at the back cause remember 650
millimetres<00:02:20.170> has<00:02:20.950> gone<00:02:21.190> into<00:02:21.490> the<00:02:21.610> chassis<00:02:21.820> of

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
millimetres has gone into the chassis of

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.150 
millimetres has gone into the chassis of
this<00:02:22.240> car<00:02:22.710> so<00:02:23.710> it's<00:02:24.220> coming<00:02:24.430> together<00:02:24.580> nicely

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
this car so it's coming together nicely

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.970 
this car so it's coming together nicely
so<00:02:27.160> what<00:02:27.370> creative<00:02:27.820> conversions<00:02:28.000> do<00:02:28.600> is<00:02:28.750> they

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
so what creative conversions do is they

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.460 
so what creative conversions do is they
prefabricate<00:02:29.980> all<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.760> parts<00:02:31.240> you<00:02:31.480> can<00:02:32.320> see

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
prefabricate all the parts you can see

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.960 
prefabricate all the parts you can see
here<00:02:32.710> I've<00:02:32.830> got<00:02:32.980> all<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.190> parts<00:02:33.370> here<00:02:33.700> this<00:02:33.880> is

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
here I've got all the parts here this is

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.880 
here I've got all the parts here this is
big<00:02:34.090> parts<00:02:34.540> for<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.810> toolbox<00:02:35.290> or<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.590> little

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
big parts for the toolbox or a little

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.210 
big parts for the toolbox or a little
bit<00:02:35.980> go<00:02:36.580> down<00:02:36.880> in<00:02:37.060> here<00:02:37.300> I<00:02:37.510> get<00:02:37.960> it<00:02:38.080> all

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
bit go down in here I get it all

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.440 
bit go down in here I get it all
prefabricated<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:39.400> then<00:02:40.120> they<00:02:40.270> just

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
prefabricated and then they just

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.360 
prefabricated and then they just
basically<00:02:40.990> put<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.560> pieces<00:02:41.770> together<00:02:42.100> like

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
basically put the pieces together like

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.360 
basically put the pieces together like
in<00:02:42.640> my<00:02:42.730> car<00:02:42.940> no<00:02:43.120> set<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:43.960> then<00:02:44.080> weld<00:02:44.350> it<00:02:44.470> up<00:02:44.620> and

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
in my car no set and then weld it up and

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.190 
in my car no set and then weld it up and
that's<00:02:45.460> a<00:02:45.670> matter<00:02:45.970> of<00:02:46.090> doing<00:02:46.330> a<00:02:46.390> bit<00:02:46.540> of<00:02:46.570> a<00:02:46.840> bit

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
that's a matter of doing a bit of a bit

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.260 
that's a matter of doing a bit of a bit
of<00:02:47.320> bodywork<00:02:47.710> and<00:02:48.580> then<00:02:48.790> of<00:02:48.880> course<00:02:49.090> they

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
of bodywork and then of course they

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.180 
of bodywork and then of course they
start<00:02:49.540> looking<00:02:49.840> at<00:02:50.290> doing<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.680> final<00:02:51.070> which

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
start looking at doing the final which

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.650 
start looking at doing the final which
is<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.550> top<00:02:52.510> coat<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:54.000> blending<00:02:55.000> that<00:02:55.120> silver

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
is the top coat and blending that silver

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.320 
is the top coat and blending that silver
in<00:02:55.810> so<00:02:56.710> as<00:02:56.860> you<00:02:57.010> can<00:02:57.160> see<00:02:57.370> behind<00:02:57.550> me<00:02:57.880> now<00:02:58.120> we're

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
in so as you can see behind me now we're

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.780 
in so as you can see behind me now we're
in<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.540> paint<00:02:58.840> shop<00:02:59.110> so<00:02:59.380> it<00:02:59.500> means<00:02:59.770> we're<00:03:00.610> in

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
in the paint shop so it means we're in

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.200 
in the paint shop so it means we're in
the<00:03:00.970> final<00:03:01.630> stages<00:03:01.990> of<00:03:02.320> the<00:03:02.620> conversion<00:03:03.250> where

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
the final stages of the conversion where

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.780 
the final stages of the conversion where
the<00:03:04.360> real<00:03:04.540> magic<00:03:04.780> happens<00:03:05.080> so<00:03:05.920> fall<00:03:06.190> behind<00:03:06.400> me

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
the real magic happens so fall behind me

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.090 
the real magic happens so fall behind me
now<00:03:06.970> now<00:03:07.660> this<00:03:08.080> guy<00:03:08.320> he's<00:03:08.530> good<00:03:08.830> at<00:03:08.950> what<00:03:08.980> he

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
now now this guy he's good at what he

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.380 
now now this guy he's good at what he
does<00:03:09.430> maybe<00:03:10.360> damn<00:03:10.870> good<00:03:11.230> so<00:03:11.890> this<00:03:12.430> car<00:03:12.820> when

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
does maybe damn good so this car when

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.210 
does maybe damn good so this car when
it's<00:03:13.540> finished<00:03:13.930> is<00:03:14.170> going<00:03:14.440> to<00:03:14.500> look<00:03:14.709> like<00:03:15.010> it

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
it's finished is going to look like it

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.660 
it's finished is going to look like it
came<00:03:15.489> out<00:03:15.730> of<00:03:15.760> a<00:03:15.940> Toyota<00:03:16.180> factory<00:03:16.750> so<00:03:17.590> his<00:03:18.130> job

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
came out of a Toyota factory so his job

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.250 
came out of a Toyota factory so his job
it's<00:03:18.850> got<00:03:19.150> another<00:03:19.360> coat<00:03:19.630> there<00:03:19.810> on<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:20.050> back

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260

his job now is to blend that silver

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.620 
his job now is to blend that silver
paint<00:03:22.900> job<00:03:23.170> through<00:03:23.920> to<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.250> front<00:03:24.520> and<00:03:25.360> I<00:03:25.480> can

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
paint job through to the front and I can

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.780 
paint job through to the front and I can
guarantee<00:03:25.959> you<00:03:26.350> you<00:03:26.680> would<00:03:26.830> not<00:03:27.160> be<00:03:27.459> able<00:03:27.610> to

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
guarantee you you would not be able to

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.210 
guarantee you you would not be able to
pick<00:03:28.120> the<00:03:28.270> difference

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.280
