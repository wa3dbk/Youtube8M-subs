supply today I got a ton Z 3152 awesome
later<00:00:20.890> Nano<00:00:21.779> that's<00:00:22.779> gonna<00:00:22.900> be<00:00:23.080> for<00:00:23.290> my<00:00:23.439> JBJ<00:00:24.160> 28

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:25.290 
later Nano that's gonna be for my JBJ 28

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.639 
later Nano that's gonna be for my JBJ 28
I<00:00:26.290> think<00:00:27.189> it'll<00:00:27.310> be<00:00:27.430> a<00:00:27.460> lot<00:00:27.550> better<00:00:27.820> than<00:00:28.649> the

00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:29.649 
I think it'll be a lot better than the

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:36.540 
I think it'll be a lot better than the
JBJ<00:00:30.960> auto<00:00:31.960> top<00:00:32.259> off<00:00:32.410> that<00:00:32.619> I<00:00:32.710> have<00:00:32.890> now<00:00:35.550> at

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
JBJ auto top off that I have now at

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.650 
JBJ auto top off that I have now at
least<00:00:36.700> that's<00:00:36.940> what<00:00:37.000> I'm<00:00:37.180> hoping

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
least that's what I'm hoping

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.090 
least that's what I'm hoping
also<00:00:39.420> there<00:00:40.420> was<00:00:40.510> that<00:00:40.660> time<00:00:40.930> to<00:00:41.230> go<00:00:41.800> ahead<00:00:41.890> and

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
also there was that time to go ahead and

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.010 
also there was that time to go ahead and
change<00:00:42.370> my<00:00:44.250> ro/di<00:00:45.250> unit<00:00:45.700> filters<00:00:46.030> and<00:00:46.210> resin

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
change my ro/di unit filters and resin

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.860 
change my ro/di unit filters and resin
in<00:00:47.200> my<00:00:48.130> fourth<00:00:48.400> stage<00:00:48.700> and<00:00:49.000> I<00:00:49.030> also<00:00:49.330> got<00:00:49.660> from

the nanos you see here we got of course

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:38.249 
the nanos you see here we got of course
we<00:01:32.200> have<00:01:32.319> our<00:01:32.439> instructions<00:01:36.869> I'm<00:01:37.869> sure<00:01:38.109> in

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
we have our instructions I'm sure in

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
like the little little brain that it

00:01:53.679 --> 00:02:01.550 
like the little little brain that it
comes<00:01:53.799> with<00:01:56.310> we've<00:01:57.310> got<00:01:57.459> our<00:01:58.200> tubing<00:01:59.909> with<00:02:00.909> the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
comes with we've got our tubing with the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.019 
comes with we've got our tubing with the
bracket<00:02:02.560> that<00:02:02.770> comes<00:02:02.829> along<00:02:03.219> with<00:02:03.399> it<00:02:03.459> to<00:02:03.849> hold

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
the tubing on the back your tank secure

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:16.770 
the tubing on the back your tank secure
okay<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:13.660> we<00:02:13.810> have<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.110> pump<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:16.030> this<00:02:16.599> is

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
okay and we have the pump and this is

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.000 
okay and we have the pump and this is
probably<00:02:16.959> the<00:02:17.200> real<00:02:17.349> reason<00:02:17.680> why<00:02:17.770> I<00:02:17.830> bought

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
probably the real reason why I bought

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.410 
probably the real reason why I bought
this<00:02:18.220> is<00:02:18.520> for<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.090> pump<00:02:19.680> I<00:02:21.060> have<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.150> aqua

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
this is for the pump I have the aqua

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.030 
this is for the pump I have the aqua
lifter<00:02:22.720> on<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.500> JBJ<00:02:24.250> auto<00:02:24.849> top<00:02:25.090> off<00:02:25.269> and<00:02:26.040> I

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
lifter on the JBJ auto top off and I

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.380 
lifter on the JBJ auto top off and I
haven't<00:02:27.310> set<00:02:27.459> up<00:02:27.489> about<00:02:27.670> midway<00:02:28.120> on<00:02:28.150> my

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
haven't set up about midway on my

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.110 
haven't set up about midway on my
cabinet<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.980> it<00:02:30.459> just<00:02:30.849> it<00:02:31.180> has<00:02:31.329> a<00:02:31.360> tough<00:02:31.659> time

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
cabinet and it just it has a tough time

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.360 
cabinet and it just it has a tough time
pulling<00:02:34.120> water<00:02:34.329> and<00:02:34.769> then<00:02:35.769> pushing<00:02:36.159> the<00:02:36.220> water

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
pulling water and then pushing the water

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.979 
pulling water and then pushing the water
up<00:02:36.670> to<00:02:36.730> and<00:02:37.299> over<00:02:38.110> my<00:02:38.290> back<00:02:38.829> of<00:02:39.010> my<00:02:39.129> tank<00:02:39.510> so<00:02:40.510> I

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
up to and over my back of my tank so I

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.050 
up to and over my back of my tank so I
think<00:02:41.409> this<00:02:41.829> pump<00:02:42.220> is<00:02:42.400> gonna<00:02:42.700> be<00:02:42.879> a<00:02:42.909> lot

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
think this pump is gonna be a lot

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.509 
think this pump is gonna be a lot
stronger<00:02:44.010> even<00:02:45.010> though<00:02:45.159> it's<00:02:45.250> going<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.430> be

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
stronger even though it's going to be

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.170 
stronger even though it's going to be
sitting<00:02:45.760> lower<00:02:46.709> I<00:02:47.709> think<00:02:47.980> it'll<00:02:48.519> be<00:02:48.640> fine<00:02:48.849> and

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
sitting lower I think it'll be fine and

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.440 
sitting lower I think it'll be fine and

here<00:03:57.340> so<00:03:57.519> when<00:03:57.609> we<00:03:57.640> get

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
here so when we get

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.319 
here so when we get
this<00:03:59.569> is<00:03:59.719> the<00:03:59.870> control<00:04:00.469> module<00:04:00.650> of<00:04:00.980> it<00:04:01.269> so<00:04:02.269> it

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
this is the control module of it so it

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:03.729 
this is the control module of it so it
kind<00:04:02.510> of<00:04:02.540> leaves<00:04:02.689> a<00:04:02.780> small<00:04:02.930> imprint<00:04:03.500> it's<00:04:03.620> not

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:03.739 
kind of leaves a small imprint it's not

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.559 
kind of leaves a small imprint it's not
very<00:04:03.950> big<00:04:04.420> not<00:04:05.420> as<00:04:05.510> big<00:04:05.659> as<00:04:05.780> the<00:04:05.930> JBJ<00:04:07.359> so<00:04:08.359> don't

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
very big not as big as the JBJ so don't

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.369 
very big not as big as the JBJ so don't
take<00:04:08.659> as<00:04:08.780> much<00:04:08.900> room<00:04:09.370> and<00:04:10.370> then<00:04:10.730> I<00:04:10.760> have<00:04:11.060> my

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 
take as much room and then I have my

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:19.240 
take as much room and then I have my
five<00:04:12.379> gallon<00:04:13.150> RL<00:04:14.150> water<00:04:14.359> down<00:04:14.599> here<00:04:17.380> so<00:04:18.380> it's

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
five gallon RL water down here so it's

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.689 
five gallon RL water down here so it's
pretty<00:04:19.370> small<00:04:19.609> and<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:21.680> pump<00:04:21.919> is<00:04:22.009> very<00:04:22.190> strong

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:22.699 
pretty small and the pump is very strong

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:25.150 
pretty small and the pump is very strong
like<00:04:23.150> I<00:04:23.180> figured<00:04:23.479> so<00:04:23.870> it<00:04:24.020> don't<00:04:24.169> have<00:04:24.289> an<00:04:24.500> issue

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
like I figured so it don't have an issue

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.390 
like I figured so it don't have an issue

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.630 

by<00:04:39.670> the<00:04:39.730> float<00:04:40.030> switch<00:04:40.300> there<00:04:41.340> which<00:04:42.340> is<00:04:42.490> right

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
by the float switch there which is right

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.860 
by the float switch there which is right
there<00:04:42.670> with<00:04:42.910> a<00:04:42.970> white<00:04:43.120> wire<00:04:43.330> going<00:04:43.630> through<00:04:43.780> it

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
and then the return line right there a

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.210 
and then the return line right there a
very<00:04:50.020> good<00:04:50.290> flow<00:04:51.540> so<00:04:52.540> I<00:04:52.870> would<00:04:53.560> suggest<00:04:53.740> if

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220
