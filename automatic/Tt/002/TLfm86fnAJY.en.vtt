00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:09.099 
this is a video for an origami Jumping

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.350 
this is a video for an origami Jumping
Frog<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.870> first<00:00:11.080> step<00:00:11.260> for<00:00:11.379> the<00:00:11.469> origami<00:00:11.590> frog

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
Frog the first step for the origami frog

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.509 
Frog the first step for the origami frog
is<00:00:13.360> to<00:00:13.540> pick<00:00:13.690> out<00:00:13.809> a<00:00:13.839> sheet<00:00:13.990> of<00:00:14.080> paper<00:00:14.259> and<00:00:14.530> now

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:15.519 
is to pick out a sheet of paper and now

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:16.589 
is to pick out a sheet of paper and now
we're<00:00:15.730> going<00:00:15.820> to<00:00:15.879> start<00:00:16.119> with<00:00:16.209> the<00:00:16.330> white<00:00:16.540> side

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:16.599 
we're going to start with the white side

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.380 
we're going to start with the white side
up<00:00:16.919> and<00:00:17.919> we're<00:00:18.040> going<00:00:18.130> to<00:00:18.220> fold<00:00:18.490> a<00:00:18.730> book<00:00:19.150> fold

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
up and we're going to fold a book fold

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.880 
up and we're going to fold a book fold
so<00:00:19.570> take<00:00:19.720> the<00:00:19.840> bottom<00:00:20.140> edge<00:00:20.290> and<00:00:20.529> bring<00:00:20.710> it<00:00:20.800> up

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
so take the bottom edge and bring it up

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.170 
so take the bottom edge and bring it up
to<00:00:20.980> the<00:00:21.070> top<00:00:21.279> just<00:00:22.050> like<00:00:23.050> this<00:00:23.880> you<00:00:24.880> can<00:00:25.029> see

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
to the top just like this you can see

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.609 
to the top just like this you can see
how<00:00:25.300> you<00:00:25.359> get<00:00:25.510> it<00:00:25.599> nice<00:00:25.750> and<00:00:26.019> lined<00:00:26.140> up<00:00:26.320> so<00:00:26.529> you

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619 
how you get it nice and lined up so you

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.230 
how you get it nice and lined up so you
don't<00:00:26.710> want<00:00:26.949> it<00:00:27.070> it's<00:00:27.189> a<00:00:27.250> little<00:00:27.460> askew<00:00:27.880> it's<00:00:28.179> a

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
don't want it it's a little askew it's a

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:29.609 
don't want it it's a little askew it's a
little<00:00:28.420> off<00:00:28.539> you<00:00:28.660> want<00:00:28.810> to<00:00:28.840> get<00:00:28.960> it<00:00:29.019> as<00:00:29.140> precise

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
little off you want to get it as precise

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.770 
little off you want to get it as precise
as<00:00:29.920> you<00:00:29.980> can<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:31.779> it<00:00:31.900> lines<00:00:32.140> right<00:00:32.619> up<00:00:32.650> there

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
as you can so it lines right up there

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.069 
as you can so it lines right up there
slide<00:00:34.780> it<00:00:34.809> across<00:00:36.930> now<00:00:39.360> we're<00:00:40.360> going<00:00:40.570> to<00:00:40.719> do<00:00:41.050> a

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
slide it across now we're going to do a

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.590 
slide it across now we're going to do a
diagonal<00:00:41.680> fold<00:00:42.040> so<00:00:42.760> the<00:00:42.820> diagonal<00:00:43.090> fold<00:00:43.450> is

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
diagonal fold so the diagonal fold is

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.600 
diagonal fold so the diagonal fold is
going<00:00:43.660> to<00:00:43.809> come<00:00:44.020> from<00:00:44.260> this<00:00:45.039> top<00:00:45.340> edge<00:00:45.579> is

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
going to come from this top edge is

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.940 
going to come from this top edge is
going<00:00:46.000> to<00:00:46.059> go<00:00:46.180> up<00:00:46.300> against<00:00:46.629> this<00:00:46.750> side<00:00:47.590> edge

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
going to go up against this side edge

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.139 
going to go up against this side edge
we're<00:00:48.789> going<00:00:48.820> to<00:00:48.940> fold<00:00:49.210> it<00:00:49.329> over<00:00:51.090> like<00:00:52.090> this

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
we're going to fold it over like this

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:53.520 
we're going to fold it over like this
and<00:00:52.449> then<00:00:52.690> important<00:00:53.170> thing<00:00:53.260> you<00:00:53.350> want<00:00:53.500> to

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
and then important thing you want to

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.170 
and then important thing you want to
have<00:00:53.649> a<00:00:53.710> nice<00:00:53.890> sharp<00:00:53.920> point<00:00:54.520> here<00:00:54.820> at<00:00:54.879> the<00:00:54.969> top

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
have a nice sharp point here at the top

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.349 
have a nice sharp point here at the top
too<00:00:55.480> so<00:00:56.140> when<00:00:56.260> I'm<00:00:56.379> folding<00:00:56.829> this<00:00:56.980> over<00:00:57.370> I'm

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:58.359 
too so when I'm folding this over I'm

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:00.689 
too so when I'm folding this over I'm
getting<00:00:58.690> both<00:00:59.289> of<00:00:59.320> these<00:00:59.649> two<00:00:59.920> edges<00:01:00.100> to<00:01:00.489> line

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
getting both of these two edges to line

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.560 
getting both of these two edges to line
up<00:01:00.960> do<00:01:01.960> one<00:01:02.170> side<00:01:02.410> open<00:01:03.340> it<00:01:03.430> up<00:01:03.550> and<00:01:03.760> then<00:01:04.449> we're

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
up do one side open it up and then we're

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:05.880 
up do one side open it up and then we're
also<00:01:04.720> going<00:01:04.899> to<00:01:04.960> do<00:01:05.110> the<00:01:05.140> opposite<00:01:05.680> side<00:01:05.860> now

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
also going to do the opposite side now

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.320 
also going to do the opposite side now
there's<00:01:06.160> two<00:01:06.310> sheets<00:01:06.490> of<00:01:06.640> paper<00:01:06.789> here<00:01:07.119> and<00:01:07.149> it

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
there's two sheets of paper here and it

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.330 
there's two sheets of paper here and it
might<00:01:07.450> be<00:01:07.509> on<00:01:07.750> either<00:01:07.899> side<00:01:08.229> but<00:01:08.860> go<00:01:09.070> ahead<00:01:09.220> and

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
might be on either side but go ahead and

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.469 
might be on either side but go ahead and
fold<00:01:09.490> both<00:01:09.789> of<00:01:10.060> them<00:01:10.240> at<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:11.050> same<00:01:11.380> time<00:01:12.479> we're

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
fold both of them at the same time we're

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:14.760 
fold both of them at the same time we're
going<00:01:13.599> to<00:01:13.690> fold<00:01:13.869> this<00:01:14.020> one<00:01:14.200> over<00:01:14.380> and<00:01:14.410> again<00:01:14.740> a

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
going to fold this one over and again a

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.260 
going to fold this one over and again a
nice<00:01:14.950> sharp<00:01:15.310> point<00:01:15.520> right<00:01:15.759> there<00:01:15.940> at<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:16.090> top

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
nice sharp point right there at the top

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.260 
nice sharp point right there at the top
so<00:01:16.810> it'll<00:01:16.990> make<00:01:17.110> a<00:01:17.289> nice<00:01:17.500> X<00:01:17.830> here<00:01:18.819> at<00:01:18.910> the<00:01:19.000> top

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
so it'll make a nice X here at the top

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.199 
so it'll make a nice X here at the top
of<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:19.569> paper<00:01:20.640> next<00:01:21.640> we're<00:01:21.910> going<00:01:22.030> to<00:01:22.090> flip

00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:22.209 
of the paper next we're going to flip

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:24.930 
of the paper next we're going to flip
the<00:01:22.330> whole<00:01:22.450> paper<00:01:22.660> over<00:01:22.990> and<00:01:23.459> take<00:01:24.459> the<00:01:24.640> top

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
the whole paper over and take the top

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.930 
the whole paper over and take the top
edge<00:01:25.270> of<00:01:25.599> this<00:01:26.530> X<00:01:26.830> and<00:01:27.520> we're<00:01:27.610> going<00:01:27.729> to<00:01:27.759> fold

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
edge of this X and we're going to fold

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.330 
edge of this X and we're going to fold
it<00:01:28.060> down<00:01:28.119> to<00:01:28.330> the<00:01:28.479> bottom<00:01:28.840> edge<00:01:28.990> of<00:01:29.289> this<00:01:29.890> X<00:01:30.160> if

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
it down to the bottom edge of this X if

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.859 
it down to the bottom edge of this X if
you<00:01:30.429> see<00:01:30.610> where<00:01:30.789> these<00:01:30.910> two<00:01:31.179> points<00:01:31.539> are<00:01:31.690> right

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
you see where these two points are right

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.169 
you see where these two points are right
here<00:01:32.110> we're<00:01:32.709> going<00:01:32.830> to<00:01:32.890> fold<00:01:33.099> them<00:01:33.310> down<00:01:33.550> to

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
here we're going to fold them down to

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:36.300 
here we're going to fold them down to
these<00:01:34.450> two<00:01:34.780> points<00:01:35.259> which<00:01:35.679> are<00:01:35.830> the<00:01:35.890> bottom<00:01:36.220> of

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
these two points which are the bottom of

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.570 
these two points which are the bottom of
the<00:01:36.459> X<00:01:36.610> so<00:01:37.599> we<00:01:37.660> fold<00:01:37.989> it<00:01:38.140> down<00:01:38.729> right<00:01:39.729> like<00:01:39.910> this

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
the X so we fold it down right like this

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.999 
the X so we fold it down right like this
all<00:01:42.580> the<00:01:43.149> way<00:01:43.179> across<00:01:43.599> so<00:01:43.989> if<00:01:44.590> you<00:01:44.679> open<00:01:44.920> it

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
all the way across so if you open it

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:46.410 
all the way across so if you open it
back<00:01:45.099> up<00:01:45.280> again<00:01:45.369> you<00:01:45.580> can<00:01:45.700> see<00:01:45.880> how<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.060> line

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
back up again you can see how the line

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.910 
back up again you can see how the line
that<00:01:46.690> we<00:01:46.780> made<00:01:47.020> went<00:01:47.289> straight<00:01:47.590> through<00:01:47.619> the

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
that we made went straight through the

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.800 
that we made went straight through the
middle<00:01:48.250> of<00:01:48.399> that<00:01:49.360> X<00:01:49.599> we<00:01:50.380> folded<00:01:50.709> this<00:01:51.599> now<00:01:52.599> flip

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
middle of that X we folded this now flip

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.359 
middle of that X we folded this now flip
it<00:01:52.899> over<00:01:53.050> we'll<00:01:53.590> have<00:01:53.619> a<00:01:53.739> little<00:01:53.890> bit<00:01:54.009> sort<00:01:54.340> of

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
it over we'll have a little bit sort of

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.449 
it over we'll have a little bit sort of
like<00:01:54.429> a<00:01:54.550> ski<00:01:54.910> jump<00:01:55.739> going<00:01:56.739> on<00:01:56.860> right<00:01:57.069> there<00:01:57.099> so

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:57.459 
like a ski jump going on right there so

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
like a ski jump going on right there so
fold<00:01:58.149> it<00:01:58.270> over<00:01:58.420> so<00:01:59.700> it<00:02:00.700> looks<00:02:00.910> just<00:02:01.090> like<00:02:01.179> this

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
fold it over so it looks just like this

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:02.999 
fold it over so it looks just like this
now<00:02:02.229> we're<00:02:02.440> going<00:02:02.530> to<00:02:02.590> do<00:02:02.679> is<00:02:02.800> going<00:02:02.890> to<00:02:02.950> take

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
now we're going to do is going to take

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:04.290 
now we're going to do is going to take
our<00:02:03.160> finger<00:02:03.399> and<00:02:03.520> put<00:02:03.610> it<00:02:03.700> right<00:02:03.729> on<00:02:04.149> the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
our finger and put it right on the

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.960 
our finger and put it right on the
center<00:02:04.810> of<00:02:04.989> the<00:02:05.950> paper<00:02:06.129> so<00:02:06.459> put<00:02:06.610> it<00:02:06.700> right<00:02:06.879> in

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
center of the paper so put it right in

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.270 
center of the paper so put it right in
the<00:02:07.030> middle<00:02:07.300> of<00:02:07.420> that<00:02:07.539> X<00:02:07.810> and<00:02:08.080> push<00:02:08.709> down<00:02:08.979> and

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
the middle of that X and push down and

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.830 
the middle of that X and push down and
there's<00:02:09.399> a<00:02:09.459> moment<00:02:09.940> where<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.420> paper<00:02:10.629> is

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
there's a moment where the paper is

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.070 
there's a moment where the paper is
going<00:02:11.020> to<00:02:11.110> pop<00:02:11.319> right<00:02:12.069> there<00:02:12.750> see<00:02:13.750> how<00:02:13.870> it<00:02:13.960> went

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
going to pop right there see how it went

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.350 
going to pop right there see how it went
from<00:02:14.320> it<00:02:15.280> started<00:02:15.640> over<00:02:15.760> here<00:02:15.880> like<00:02:16.120> this<00:02:16.300> and

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
from it started over here like this and

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.960 
from it started over here like this and
then<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.750> paper<00:02:16.930> is<00:02:17.170> going<00:02:17.320> to

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
then the paper is going to

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.070 
then the paper is going to
where<00:02:18.970> these<00:02:19.150> two<00:02:19.330> edges<00:02:19.480> are<00:02:19.750> going<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:19.930> pop

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
where these two edges are going to pop

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.920 
where these two edges are going to pop
up<00:02:20.310> so<00:02:21.310> now<00:02:21.460> we're<00:02:22.120> going<00:02:22.240> to<00:02:22.300> fold<00:02:22.630> these<00:02:22.870> two

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
up so now we're going to fold these two

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.290 
up so now we're going to fold these two
edges<00:02:23.500> in<00:02:23.680> and<00:02:23.860> as<00:02:24.010> these<00:02:24.310> two<00:02:24.550> edges<00:02:24.700> come<00:02:25.120> in

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
edges in and as these two edges come in

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.540 
edges in and as these two edges come in
the<00:02:25.930> top<00:02:26.140> part<00:02:26.380> sort<00:02:26.650> of<00:02:26.710> comes<00:02:26.920> down<00:02:27.010> as<00:02:27.340> well

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
the top part sort of comes down as well

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.310 
the top part sort of comes down as well
and<00:02:27.730> go<00:02:27.880> ahead<00:02:28.000> and<00:02:28.150> flatten<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.810> whole<00:02:28.990> thing

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
and go ahead and flatten the whole thing

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.410 
and go ahead and flatten the whole thing
down<00:02:29.560> it<00:02:30.370> makes<00:02:30.670> what<00:02:30.970> its<00:02:31.120> kind<00:02:31.240> of<00:02:31.360> a

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
down it makes what its kind of a

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.570 
down it makes what its kind of a
waterbomb<00:02:31.810> base<00:02:31.870> right<00:02:32.320> there<00:02:32.530> at<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.680> top<00:02:32.860> so

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
waterbomb base right there at the top so

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.360 
waterbomb base right there at the top so
it<00:02:33.670> starts<00:02:33.940> up<00:02:34.030> like<00:02:34.180> this<00:02:34.740> we<00:02:35.740> fold<00:02:36.040> it<00:02:36.160> down

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
it starts up like this we fold it down

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.610 
it starts up like this we fold it down
bring<00:02:36.880> this<00:02:37.030> top<00:02:37.300> edge<00:02:37.540> down<00:02:37.570> while<00:02:38.170> these<00:02:38.380> two

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
bring this top edge down while these two

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.760 
bring this top edge down while these two
triangles<00:02:39.160> come<00:02:39.400> in<00:02:39.580> a<00:02:40.440> sort<00:02:41.440> of<00:02:41.470> looks<00:02:41.620> like<00:02:41.680> a

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
triangles come in a sort of looks like a

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.400 
triangles come in a sort of looks like a
house<00:02:42.010> shape<00:02:42.540> love<00:02:43.540> that<00:02:43.810> shape<00:02:44.050> of<00:02:44.200> a<00:02:44.260> house

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
house shape love that shape of a house

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.220 
house shape love that shape of a house
right<00:02:44.680> there<00:02:45.300> next<00:02:46.300> step<00:02:46.540> take<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.870> bottom

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
right there next step take the bottom

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.780 
right there next step take the bottom
edge<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.850> fold<00:02:49.240> it<00:02:49.330> up<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:50.650> right<00:02:50.860> here<00:02:50.920> the

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
edge and fold it up to right here the

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.490 
edge and fold it up to right here the
bottom<00:02:52.120> edge<00:02:52.240> of<00:02:52.390> that<00:02:52.510> triangle<00:02:53.020> pull<00:02:53.380> it

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
bottom edge of that triangle pull it

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.930 
bottom edge of that triangle pull it
right<00:02:53.650> up<00:02:53.860> there<00:02:54.070> just<00:02:54.970> like<00:02:55.120> that<00:02:56.520> after<00:02:57.520> that

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
right up there just like that after that

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.580 
right up there just like that after that
we're<00:02:58.210> going<00:02:58.300> to<00:02:58.360> take<00:02:58.600> these<00:02:58.870> two<00:02:58.930> corners

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
we're going to take these two corners

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.290 
we're going to take these two corners
there's<00:02:59.800> these<00:02:59.920> two<00:02:59.980> open<00:03:00.670> flaps<00:03:01.000> that<00:03:01.240> are

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
there's these two open flaps that are

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.660 
there's these two open flaps that are
sort<00:03:01.600> of<00:03:01.720> available<00:03:02.650> and<00:03:03.100> free<00:03:03.310> right<00:03:03.520> here

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
sort of available and free right here

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.830 
sort of available and free right here
we're<00:03:03.790> just<00:03:03.820> going<00:03:04.000> to<00:03:04.060> take<00:03:04.180> those<00:03:04.390> two<00:03:04.570> flaps

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
we're just going to take those two flaps

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.200 
we're just going to take those two flaps
and<00:03:05.020> put<00:03:05.170> them<00:03:05.290> right<00:03:05.440> to<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.680> top<00:03:05.920> of<00:03:06.210> that

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
and put them right to the top of that

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.820 
and put them right to the top of that
triangle<00:03:07.690> on<00:03:08.110> the<00:03:08.670> left<00:03:09.670> side<00:03:09.940> and<00:03:10.350> also<00:03:11.350> on

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
triangle on the left side and also on

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.710 
triangle on the left side and also on
the<00:03:12.190> right<00:03:12.220> side<00:03:13.020> like<00:03:14.020> that<00:03:14.080> and<00:03:15.330> then<00:03:16.330> after

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
the right side like that and then after

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.150 
the right side like that and then after
that<00:03:16.840> step<00:03:17.140> we're<00:03:17.350> going<00:03:17.440> to<00:03:17.500> take<00:03:17.680> both<00:03:17.950> of

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
that step we're going to take both of

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.500 
that step we're going to take both of
these<00:03:18.250> two<00:03:18.460> edges<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:18.820> fold<00:03:19.090> them<00:03:19.270> into<00:03:19.420> the

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
these two edges and fold them into the

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.470 
these two edges and fold them into the
middle<00:03:20.340> so<00:03:21.340> we're<00:03:21.430> close<00:03:21.610> to<00:03:21.760> a<00:03:21.820> cupboard<00:03:22.120> fold

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
middle so we're close to a cupboard fold

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.070 
middle so we're close to a cupboard fold
where<00:03:23.350> you<00:03:23.500> see<00:03:23.770> how<00:03:23.980> I<00:03:24.420> fold<00:03:25.420> both<00:03:25.750> of<00:03:25.959> these

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
where you see how I fold both of these

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.300 
where you see how I fold both of these
edges<00:03:26.500> over<00:03:28.170> it's<00:03:29.170> sort<00:03:29.470> of<00:03:29.530> like<00:03:29.740> a<00:03:29.770> cabinet

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
edges over it's sort of like a cabinet

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.980 
edges over it's sort of like a cabinet
or<00:03:30.430> cupboard<00:03:30.790> doors<00:03:31.060> you<00:03:31.270> see<00:03:31.450> how<00:03:31.540> they<00:03:31.660> open

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
or cupboard doors you see how they open

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.150 
or cupboard doors you see how they open
up<00:03:32.080> and<00:03:32.320> close<00:03:32.950> just<00:03:33.430> like<00:03:33.610> that<00:03:34.950> so<00:03:35.950> once

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
up and close just like that so once

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.850 
up and close just like that so once
those<00:03:36.310> have<00:03:36.430> been<00:03:36.520> folded<00:03:36.910> over<00:03:37.590> go<00:03:38.590> ahead<00:03:38.770> and

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
those have been folded over go ahead and

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.740 
those have been folded over go ahead and
squish<00:03:39.130> them<00:03:39.160> good<00:03:39.550> there's<00:03:40.120> a<00:03:40.209> lot<00:03:40.450> of<00:03:40.570> paper

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
squish them good there's a lot of paper

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.850 
squish them good there's a lot of paper
here<00:03:40.990> so<00:03:41.020> we're<00:03:41.170> going<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.320> have<00:03:41.470> to<00:03:41.560> use<00:03:41.680> some

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
here so we're going to have to use some

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.530 
here so we're going to have to use some
pretty<00:03:41.890> hard<00:03:42.220> squishes<00:03:42.610> right<00:03:42.790> here<00:03:42.970> some

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
pretty hard squishes right here some

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.810 
pretty hard squishes right here some
hard<00:03:43.750> folds<00:03:44.170> and<00:03:44.650> I<00:03:44.920> take<00:03:45.100> the<00:03:45.220> bottom<00:03:45.370> of<00:03:45.640> this

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
hard folds and I take the bottom of this

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:54.680 
hard folds and I take the bottom of this
and<00:03:47.550> fold<00:03:48.550> it<00:03:48.820> up<00:03:49.000> to<00:03:50.970> right<00:03:51.970> about<00:03:52.920> here<00:03:53.920> right

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
and fold it up to right about here right

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.770 
and fold it up to right about here right
where<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.200> triangles<00:03:57.540> have<00:03:58.540> their

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
where the the triangles have their

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.030 
where the the triangles have their
biggest<00:03:59.080> point<00:03:59.410> right<00:03:59.590> there<00:03:59.740> at<00:03:59.800> the<00:03:59.860> top

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
biggest point right there at the top

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.220 
biggest point right there at the top
fold<00:04:00.459> it<00:04:00.520> right<00:04:00.670> up<00:04:00.820> to<00:04:00.940> there<00:04:01.180> that's<00:04:01.360> the

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
fold it right up to there that's the

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.449 
fold it right up to there that's the
first<00:04:02.260> fold<00:04:02.740> and<00:04:02.950> then<00:04:03.280> fold<00:04:03.550> it<00:04:03.670> back<00:04:03.910> down<00:04:03.940> to

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
first fold and then fold it back down to

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.710 
first fold and then fold it back down to
the<00:04:06.459> bottom<00:04:06.820> edge<00:04:06.970> make<00:04:07.180> sure<00:04:07.330> it<00:04:07.420> doesn't<00:04:07.660> go

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
the bottom edge make sure it doesn't go

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.930 
the bottom edge make sure it doesn't go
past<00:04:07.990> the<00:04:08.320> bottom<00:04:08.470> edge<00:04:08.740> it's<00:04:09.400> okay<00:04:09.700> if<00:04:09.820> it's

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
past the bottom edge it's okay if it's

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.190 
past the bottom edge it's okay if it's
even<00:04:10.180> a<00:04:10.240> little<00:04:10.270> bit<00:04:10.540> less<00:04:10.810> than<00:04:10.990> the<00:04:11.050> bottom

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
even a little bit less than the bottom

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.500 
even a little bit less than the bottom
edge<00:04:11.500> because<00:04:12.310> you<00:04:12.430> want<00:04:12.640> to<00:04:12.670> have<00:04:12.820> that<00:04:13.060> under

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
edge because you want to have that under

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.940 
edge because you want to have that under
enough<00:04:13.950> for<00:04:14.950> the<00:04:15.040> spring<00:04:15.550> on<00:04:15.790> the<00:04:16.299> Frog<00:04:16.770> so<00:04:17.770> now

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
enough for the spring on the Frog so now

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.830 
enough for the spring on the Frog so now
I'll<00:04:18.730> show<00:04:18.790> you<00:04:18.940> when<00:04:19.120> you<00:04:19.180> open<00:04:19.419> up<00:04:19.480> these<00:04:19.630> two

I'll show you when you open up these two

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.920 
I'll show you when you open up these two
legs<00:04:20.109> you<00:04:20.260> flip<00:04:20.470> them<00:04:20.560> over<00:04:21.690> that's<00:04:22.690> the

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
legs you flip them over that's the

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.900 
legs you flip them over that's the
finished<00:04:23.320> frog<00:04:23.680> but<00:04:24.130> it's<00:04:24.310> really<00:04:24.550> important

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
finished frog but it's really important

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.880 
finished frog but it's really important
you<00:04:25.090> have<00:04:25.210> a<00:04:25.240> nice<00:04:25.419> little<00:04:25.750> S<00:04:25.900> curve<00:04:25.960> right

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
you have a nice little S curve right

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.010 
you have a nice little S curve right
here<00:04:26.919> it's<00:04:27.729> a<00:04:27.790> really<00:04:28.060> nice<00:04:28.240> S<00:04:28.479> curve<00:04:28.900> that

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
here it's a really nice S curve that

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.420 
here it's a really nice S curve that
that's<00:04:29.229> it<00:04:29.530> that's<00:04:29.650> the<00:04:29.800> spring<00:04:30.190> that<00:04:30.340> you're

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
that's it that's the spring that you're

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.380 
that's it that's the spring that you're
going<00:04:30.550> to<00:04:30.610> use

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
going to use

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.780 
going to use
to<00:04:31.840> help<00:04:32.020> make<00:04:32.260> him<00:04:32.470> jump<00:04:32.770> this<00:04:32.980> is<00:04:33.040> a<00:04:33.190> jumping

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
to help make him jump this is a jumping

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.420 
to help make him jump this is a jumping
frog<00:04:34.060> and<00:04:34.330> the<00:04:34.990> way<00:04:35.110> it<00:04:35.260> works<00:04:35.470> is<00:04:36.100> put<00:04:36.310> your

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
frog and the way it works is put your

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.670 
frog and the way it works is put your
finger<00:04:36.700> right<00:04:36.730> on<00:04:37.000> top<00:04:37.240> of<00:04:37.270> the<00:04:37.450> Frog<00:04:37.690> and<00:04:37.930> pull

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
finger right on top of the Frog and pull

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.010 
finger right on top of the Frog and pull
back<00:04:38.920> and<00:04:39.280> then<00:04:40.150> let<00:04:40.300> it<00:04:40.330> slide<00:04:40.660> off<00:04:40.720> your

finger and once it slides off your
finger<00:04:44.440> he<00:04:44.620> should<00:04:44.800> jump<00:04:45.040> pretty<00:04:45.220> well<00:04:45.780> it

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
finger he should jump pretty well it

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
depends on how much of that spring you

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.000 
depends on how much of that spring you
have<00:04:48.730> but<00:04:49.720> try<00:04:49.930> not<00:04:49.960> to<00:04:50.110> just<00:04:50.320> push<00:04:50.560> and<00:04:50.740> squish

have but try not to just push and squish
him<00:04:51.130> and<00:04:51.280> squish<00:04:51.520> him<00:04:51.640> flat<00:04:51.910> you<00:04:52.360> sort<00:04:52.600> of<00:04:52.630> have
