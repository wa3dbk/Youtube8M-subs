00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
episode so I kind of liked that it was

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.179 
episode so I kind of liked that it was
like<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.079> got<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.229> small<00:01:49.530> revelation<00:01:50.009> here<00:01:50.159> a

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
like you got a small revelation here a

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.620 
like you got a small revelation here a
small<00:01:50.460> revelation<00:01:50.939> there<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.299> you're<00:01:51.420> kind

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
small revelation there and you're kind

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.719 
small revelation there and you're kind
of<00:01:51.720> trying<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.990> find<00:01:52.200> out<00:01:52.470> who<00:01:53.130> was<00:01:53.310> actually

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
of trying to find out who was actually

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.520 
of trying to find out who was actually
the<00:01:53.850> good<00:01:54.000> person<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.570> whatnot<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.200> think

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
the good person and whatnot and I think

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.850 
the good person and whatnot and I think
the<00:01:55.680> game<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.299> while<00:01:57.299> it's<00:01:57.600> yeah<00:01:57.930> kind<00:01:58.409> of<00:01:58.530> okay

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
the game is while it's yeah kind of okay

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.469 
the game is while it's yeah kind of okay
he's<00:01:59.009> supposed<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.280> win<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.670> ultimately<00:02:00.360> I

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
he's supposed to win that ultimately I

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.910 
he's supposed to win that ultimately I
don't<00:02:00.600> necessarily<00:02:00.930> think<00:02:01.500> that's<00:02:01.560> the

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
don't necessarily think that's the

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.920 
don't necessarily think that's the
determining<00:02:02.790> factor<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.240> think<00:02:03.299> it's<00:02:03.630> mainly

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
determining factor I think it's mainly

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.649 
determining factor I think it's mainly
this<00:02:04.350> guy<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.649> butler<00:02:05.159> is<00:02:05.340> looking<00:02:06.240> at<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.540> to

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
this guy the butler is looking at you to

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.419 
this guy the butler is looking at you to

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
gonna slip up and I think the game is

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.530 
gonna slip up and I think the game is
just<00:02:10.489> maneuvered<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.520> make<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.150> kind<00:02:12.390> of

just maneuvered to make you kind of
reveal<00:02:12.930> who<00:02:13.110> you<00:02:13.260> truly

and kind of get people like it's almost
like<00:02:15.550> a<00:02:15.640> mind<00:02:15.940> game<00:02:16.150> so<00:02:16.420> to<00:02:16.480> speak

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
guy and his actual function it'll be a

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.430 
guy and his actual function it'll be a
little<00:03:12.820> bit<00:03:12.940> more<00:03:13.120> clear<00:03:13.420> because<00:03:13.720> I<00:03:13.930> was<00:03:14.230> kind

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
little bit of an aspect of no game or

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.440 
little bit of an aspect of no game or
