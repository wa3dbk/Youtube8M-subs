definitely that guy with that goal that

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.770 
definitely that guy with that goal that
was<00:01:45.270> incredible<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:47.450> even<00:01:48.450> though<00:01:48.509> he<00:01:48.600> didn't

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
was incredible and even though he didn't

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.080 
was incredible and even though he didn't
show<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.140> first<00:01:49.290> half<00:01:49.759> tagawa<00:01:50.759> was

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
show in the first half tagawa was

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.149 
show in the first half tagawa was
probably<00:01:51.600> one<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.560> best<00:01:52.740> players<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.100> the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
probably one of the best players in the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.700 
probably one of the best players in the
game<00:01:53.220> two<00:01:53.670> in<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.869> second<00:01:55.200> half<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.409> think<00:01:55.590> he

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
game two in the second half I think he

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.469 
game two in the second half I think he
made<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:55.950> difference<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.700> there<00:01:57.149> was<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.270> lot

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
made the difference that there was a lot

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.320 
made the difference that there was a lot
of<00:01:57.890> silent<00:01:58.890> play

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
of silent play

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.110 
of silent play
happening<00:02:00.900> with<00:02:01.020> him<00:02:01.200> use<00:02:01.350> he<00:02:01.590> was<00:02:01.710> definitely

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
happening with him use he was definitely

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.640 
happening with him use he was definitely
creating<00:02:03.120> the<00:02:03.180> attacks<00:02:03.480> really<00:02:04.140> quietly<00:02:04.470> in

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
creating the attacks really quietly in

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.670 
creating the attacks really quietly in
the<00:02:04.710> middle<00:02:05.000> to<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.030> winds<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.390> stuff<00:02:06.660> and<00:02:07.560> he

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
the middle to the winds and stuff and he

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.810 
the middle to the winds and stuff and he
had<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.830> lot<00:02:07.980> of<00:02:08.009> chances<00:02:08.340> himself<00:02:08.670> actually

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
had a lot of chances himself actually

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.490 
had a lot of chances himself actually
there<00:02:09.119> was<00:02:09.210> that<00:02:09.330> one<00:02:09.390> chance<00:02:09.930> he<00:02:10.080> had<00:02:10.229> where

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
there was that one chance he had where

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.330 
there was that one chance he had where
it<00:02:10.920> was<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.280> think<00:02:11.580> him<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.740> Hernandez<00:02:13.740> maybe

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
it was I think him and Hernandez maybe

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.450 
it was I think him and Hernandez maybe
then<00:02:14.700> if<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:14.880> was<00:02:15.210> on<00:02:15.270> that<00:02:15.450> point<00:02:15.720> and

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
then if it was on that point and

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
then if it was on that point and
Hernandez<00:02:17.460> passing<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:17.910> ball<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.210> he<00:02:18.300> just

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
Hernandez passing the ball and he just

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.420 
Hernandez passing the ball and he just
passed<00:02:18.690> it<00:02:18.930> into<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.620> goal<00:02:19.800> and<00:02:20.070> it<00:02:20.310> was

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
passed it into the goal and it was

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.000 
passed it into the goal and it was
cleared<00:02:20.790> unfortunately<00:02:21.630> but<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:22.710> can<00:02:22.860> see

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
cleared unfortunately but you can see

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.320 
cleared unfortunately but you can see
the<00:02:23.130> difference<00:02:23.430> in<00:02:23.550> confidence<00:02:24.000> after<00:02:24.120> the

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
the difference in confidence after the

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.650 
the difference in confidence after the
first<00:02:24.540> goal<00:02:25.100> which<00:02:26.100> was<00:02:26.130> a<00:02:26.700> great<00:02:27.300> girl<00:02:27.540> as

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
first goal which was a great girl as

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.750 
first goal which was a great girl as
well<00:02:27.810> after<00:02:28.680> that<00:02:28.800> it<00:02:28.950> just<00:02:28.980> lifted<00:02:29.400> them<00:02:29.580> and

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
well after that it just lifted them and

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.980 
well after that it just lifted them and
they<00:02:29.850> were<00:02:29.940> pressing<00:02:30.420> from<00:02:30.570> that<00:02:30.720> point

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
they were pressing from that point

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.630 
they were pressing from that point
onwards<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:31.620> can<00:02:31.740> see<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.010> morale<00:02:32.340> boost

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
onwards and you can see the morale boost

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.130 
onwards and you can see the morale boost
and<00:02:32.880> that's<00:02:33.000> what<00:02:33.150> we<00:02:33.240> need<00:02:33.420> every<00:02:33.840> single
