fans<00:01:30.350> here<00:01:30.650> and<00:01:30.830> you<00:01:31.190> can<00:01:31.369> see<00:01:31.610> a<00:01:31.820> large

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
fans here and you can see a large

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.340 
fans here and you can see a large
heatsink<00:01:32.960> in<00:01:33.140> place<00:01:33.860> if<00:01:34.610> we<00:01:35.420> take<00:01:35.630> a<00:01:35.810> look<00:01:36.140> at

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
heatsink in place if we take a look at

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.460 
heatsink in place if we take a look at
this<00:01:37.040> side<00:01:37.400> you've<00:01:37.910> got<00:01:37.940> a<00:01:38.390> heat<00:01:38.750> pipe<00:01:38.990> going

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
this side you've got a heat pipe going

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.260 
this side you've got a heat pipe going
into<00:01:39.800> the<00:01:39.890> heatsink<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:40.550> you'll<00:01:41.030> actually

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
into the heatsink and you'll actually

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.100 
into the heatsink and you'll actually
see<00:01:41.780> that<00:01:42.190> the<00:01:43.190> heatsink<00:01:43.670> itself<00:01:44.060> is<00:01:44.240> offset<00:01:45.080> a

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
see that the heatsink itself is offset a

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.590 
see that the heatsink itself is offset a
little<00:01:45.380> bit<00:01:45.619> so<00:01:46.040> you've<00:01:46.220> got<00:01:46.400> two<00:01:46.640> fans<00:01:47.000> that

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
little bit so you've got two fans that

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.430 
little bit so you've got two fans that
are<00:01:47.930> offset<00:01:48.830> a<00:01:49.460> little<00:01:49.610> bit<00:01:49.880> to<00:01:50.300> push<00:01:51.020> plenty

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
are offset a little bit to push plenty

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.010 
are offset a little bit to push plenty
of<00:01:51.530> air<00:01:51.740> through<00:01:52.040> the<00:01:52.130> heatsink<00:01:52.790> and<00:01:52.880> keep<00:01:53.720> the

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
of air through the heatsink and keep the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.760 
of air through the heatsink and keep the
noise<00:01:54.229> level<00:01:54.440> down<00:01:54.770> at<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.460> same<00:01:55.640> time<00:01:56.770> since

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
noise level down at the same time since

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.080 
noise level down at the same time since
we're<00:01:57.980> looking<00:01:58.100> at<00:01:58.370> the<00:01:58.460> top<00:01:58.670> of<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.850> card

get a little bit longer life out of the
card<00:02:31.220> itself<00:02:32.030> and<00:02:32.269> it<00:02:32.330> will<00:02:32.450> run<00:02:32.660> a<00:02:32.690> little<00:02:32.870> bit

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
card itself and it will run a little bit

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.949 
card itself and it will run a little bit
cooler<00:02:33.290> you<00:02:33.590> you<00:02:33.950> look<00:02:34.130> using<00:02:34.430> those<00:02:34.959> pieces

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
cooler you you look using those pieces

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.270 
cooler you you look using those pieces

up<00:03:16.240> two<00:03:16.390> slots<00:03:16.750> in<00:03:16.990> your<00:03:17.170> system

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
up two slots in your system

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:23.010 
up two slots in your system
you've<00:03:18.700> got<00:03:19.020> dvi-i<00:03:20.550> DVID<00:03:21.550> dual<00:03:22.120> link<00:03:22.420> DVI<00:03:22.750> and

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
you've got dvi-i DVID dual link DVI and

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.130 
you've got dvi-i DVID dual link DVI and
you<00:03:23.620> have<00:03:23.830> two<00:03:24.130> hdmi<00:03:24.880> ports<00:03:25.270> here<00:03:25.480> so<00:03:25.990> the

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
you have two hdmi ports here so the

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.200 
you have two hdmi ports here so the
reason<00:03:26.410> why<00:03:26.530> they<00:03:26.680> put<00:03:26.950> two<00:03:27.130> hdmi<00:03:27.670> ports<00:03:28.030> here

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.210 
reason why they put two hdmi ports here

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.510 
reason why they put two hdmi ports here
is<00:03:28.420> so<00:03:28.600> you<00:03:28.660> can<00:03:28.960> this<00:03:29.410> can<00:03:29.680> support<00:03:29.920> 4k

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
is so you can this can support 4k

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.100 
is so you can this can support 4k
resolutions<00:03:31.510> using<00:03:32.470> both<00:03:33.000> hdmi<00:03:34.000> ports<00:03:34.450> into<00:03:34.930> a

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
resolutions using both hdmi ports into a

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.240 
resolutions using both hdmi ports into a
4k<00:03:35.650> monitor<00:03:36.160> you<00:03:36.880> get<00:03:37.060> 4k<00:03:37.420> at<00:03:37.930> 60<00:03:38.560> Hertz<00:03:38.590> that

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
4k monitor you get 4k at 60 Hertz that

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.240 
4k monitor you get 4k at 60 Hertz that
way<00:03:39.460> rather<00:03:40.150> than<00:03:40.300> the<00:03:40.840> 30<00:03:41.290> Hertz<00:03:43.920> you<00:03:44.920> can

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
way rather than the 30 Hertz you can

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.110 
way rather than the 30 Hertz you can
power<00:03:45.760> up<00:03:46.060> to<00:03:46.450> 4<00:03:46.690> displays<00:03:47.080> the<00:03:47.860> fans<00:03:48.220> are<00:03:48.550> PDM

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
power up to 4 displays the fans are PDM

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.800 
power up to 4 displays the fans are PDM
at<00:03:49.330> PWM<00:03:50.260> so<00:03:50.860> they<00:03:51.310> will<00:03:51.580> adjust<00:03:51.820> based<00:03:52.420> on<00:03:52.690> the

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
at PWM so they will adjust based on the

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.610 
at PWM so they will adjust based on the
temperature<00:03:53.140> of<00:03:53.470> the<00:03:54.310> card<00:03:54.990> you've<00:03:55.990> also<00:03:56.200> got

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
temperature of the card you've also got

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.050 
temperature of the card you've also got
G<00:03:57.250> sync<00:03:57.550> this<00:03:58.300> is<00:03:58.510> G<00:03:58.780> sync<00:03:59.080> ready<00:03:59.380> so<00:04:00.010> if<00:04:00.430> you

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
G sync this is G sync ready so if you

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.540 
G sync this is G sync ready so if you
end<00:04:01.360> up<00:04:01.480> getting<00:04:01.660> AG<00:04:02.170> sync<00:04:02.500> monitor<00:04:03.070> at<00:04:03.280> some

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
end up getting AG sync monitor at some

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.280 
end up getting AG sync monitor at some
point<00:04:03.790> you'll<00:04:04.240> be<00:04:04.390> able<00:04:04.480> to<00:04:04.660> utilize<00:04:04.810> that

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
point you'll be able to utilize that

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.820 
point you'll be able to utilize that

will<00:06:07.700> run<00:06:07.940> on<00:06:08.180> a<00:06:08.240> 300<00:06:09.020> watt<00:06:09.200> power<00:06:09.410> supply<00:06:09.530> but

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
will run on a 300 watt power supply but

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.219 
will run on a 300 watt power supply but
because<00:06:10.580> we<00:06:10.729> have<00:06:10.970> an<00:06:11.300> additional<00:06:11.750> six<00:06:12.020> pin

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:12.229 
because we have an additional six pin

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:14.230 
because we have an additional six pin
connector<00:06:12.650> on<00:06:12.770> this<00:06:12.919> one<00:06:13.130> you<00:06:13.490> could<00:06:13.700> max<00:06:13.970> that

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
connector on this one you could max that

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.080 
connector on this one you could max that
out<00:06:14.450> so<00:06:15.289> your<00:06:15.530> best<00:06:15.710> bet<00:06:15.860> is<00:06:16.160> to<00:06:16.190> go<00:06:16.430> with<00:06:16.610> 400

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:17.090 
out so your best bet is to go with 400

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.850 
out so your best bet is to go with 400
watts<00:06:17.270> or<00:06:17.419> higher<00:06:19.090> secondly<00:06:20.090> for<00:06:20.630> size<00:06:20.960> just

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860
