00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.249 
quite a while now but you know it's
quite<00:01:17.939> curious<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.659> thought<00:01:18.900> I'd<00:01:19.020> try

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
quite curious I thought I'd try

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.370 
quite curious I thought I'd try
something<00:01:19.290> else<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:21.000> decided<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.960> go<00:01:22.200> for

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
something else and I decided to go for

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.760 
something else and I decided to go for
two<00:01:22.560> shukla<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.159> Selfridges<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.360> I'm<00:01:25.259> really

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
two shukla in Selfridges and I'm really

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.670 
two shukla in Selfridges and I'm really
pleased<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.520> first<00:01:27.420> thing<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.439> a

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
pleased so first thing is that it's a

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.249 
pleased so first thing is that it's a
light<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.310> medium<00:01:29.520> coverage<00:01:29.790> so<00:01:30.600> it's

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
light to medium coverage so it's

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.920 
light to medium coverage so it's
definitely<00:01:31.890> lighter<00:01:32.310> than<00:01:32.610> max<00:01:32.970> matchmaster

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
definitely lighter than max matchmaster

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.130 
definitely lighter than max matchmaster
foundation<00:01:34.680> however<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:36.060> very<00:01:36.270> buildable

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
foundation however it's very buildable

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.190 
foundation however it's very buildable
and<00:01:37.560> also<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.340> don't<00:01:38.729> get<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.060> kinkier<00:01:39.659> for

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
and also you don't get that kinkier for

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.050 
and also you don't get that kinkier for
one<00:01:40.409> my<00:01:41.220> face<00:01:41.549> right<00:01:41.880> now<00:01:41.939> has<00:01:42.750> got<00:01:43.170> 0<00:01:44.060> setting

really<00:02:08.039> good<00:02:08.550> because<00:02:08.729> it's<00:02:09.060> made<00:02:09.780> out<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.200> a

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
really good because it's made out of a

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.020 
really good because it's made out of a
gel-like<00:02:11.340> substance<00:02:11.700> as<00:02:12.690> a

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
gel-like substance as a

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.360 
gel-like substance as a
those<00:02:13.150> two<00:02:13.420> powders<00:02:13.990> opaque<00:02:14.410> pounders<00:02:14.890> but

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
those two powders opaque pounders but

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.430 
those two powders opaque pounders but
some<00:02:15.550> of<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.730> other<00:02:15.910> brands<00:02:16.390> use<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.020> it<00:02:17.260> also

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
some of the other brands use and it also

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.890 
some of the other brands use and it also
sets<00:02:18.040> itself<00:02:18.610> so<00:02:18.880> it's<00:02:19.060> like<00:02:19.240> you<00:02:19.660> don't

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
sets itself so it's like you don't

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.660 
sets itself so it's like you don't
really<00:02:20.140> need<00:02:20.470> a<00:02:20.530> setting<00:02:20.950> powder<00:02:20.980> I<00:02:21.459> thought

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.920 
and I looked online as well they had
more<00:02:41.650> than<00:02:41.709> 10<00:02:42.280> different<00:02:42.819> shades<00:02:43.360> for<00:02:43.660> loads
