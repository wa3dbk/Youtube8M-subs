00:00:01.629 --> 00:00:09.440
 is very good and how will I know if 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.980
 I count this past weekend on the 10th 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.599
 July was a great event expected by 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.519
 all the cries in this wind 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.289
 they needed three big trailers that the 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:21.380
 truth we were all super excited 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:24.109
 to see if they come down I saw superman squadron 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.939
 suicide and the pool and in this video they 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:30.400
 I will give my opinion on these three great 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.400
 trailers so we started 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.840
 Y 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.379
 batman and superman in it we believe when 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.690
 told about the story of why it 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.550
 They are facing these two major areas as 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.739
 we can see bruce wayne that is 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.930
 bartender in the city of metropolis when 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.850
 superman was putting contact in the 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.799
 first film of the man of steel and 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.890
 we all know what was happening and superman 

00:00:54.799 --> 00:01:00.199
 did a cesarean section and we see that mom 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.000
 it became more tragic for a while so 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.220
 say it since one of the scenes we see 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.770
 as it marks one of the criminals if 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.899
 as they mark the cows, the former 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.000
 producer driving are still driving 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:12.500
 the hatred towards his brother and not 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.240
 we will depend on the woman wonder of 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.289
 movement in this trailer that really 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.289
 it looks pretty good 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.689
 there is an island that we see quite strange 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.060
 where you can see an army 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.130
 of superman like that because they work like 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.079
 one is aggravated in the arm and they are 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.429
 attacking obama this really I do not know 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:35.170
 who can do if some dream of 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:36.039
 batman or something that is really going to happen 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.810
 in the movie 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.789
 followed by this we see a scene that the 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.229
 I really do not know who it is if gordon or 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:43.539
 someone who is telling batman 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.670
 that superman is not his enemy 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.140
 and other new super interesting things 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.270
 that we see in this trailer is that it 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.700
 you can see two notes that apparently 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.590
 they are the same are messages for mom one 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.509
 we can see it in the robin suit and 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.280
 another in the newspaper a stage 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.170
 important is where we can see the ex 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.539
 mourning with something that looks like kryptonite 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.579
 green shine in the form of pink devÃ©s 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.649
 architectural and already ending the 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.869
 trailer we can see more scenes are see 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.390
 good where we finally see the fight of 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.620
 dad against and we also found a 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.599
 someone the woman wonder that at 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.940
 seem to be fighting but she does not look 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.069
 very well with time and in the end we see in 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.520
 the extinguisher that is enjoying as it is 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.980
 only the pages were missing 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.930
 this ray is really I buy myself not like 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.930
 the previous teaser that did not have any feet 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.350
 or reason besides looks great fight 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.240
 well done tape lumps would burn that not 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.260
 let's continue it looks bad what happened 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.260
 appreciate the fight 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.780
 the story that the trailer poses 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.860
 who goes wrong grabs the heart 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.980
 form by what he did in the first 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.440
 movie and he lived it in the flesh 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.910
 It makes sense to me as old 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.130
 that you have superman using it 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.110
 immeasurably clear we know 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.540
 that superman was not to blame because he 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.550
 He did it on purpose but Batman did not 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.320
 he sees it like that although I kept the doubts and 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.360
 normal was there when I played a fight 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.340
 because he could not do something if he always 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.230
 normal to be prepared maybe from a 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.670
 movie bridge he had to 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.470
 prepare more to face the 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.060
 man from scratch and that's why it's a suit 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.070
 new in which he sings as if he were 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.920
 robot ours makes sense yes although 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.920
 do not have something to cover your mouth 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.050
 it makes sense another important thing does 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:27.730
 very hot where I live I melt 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:30.310
 follow his cell phone in the suicide squad 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.200
 the suicide squad train was not released 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.880
 officially on the internet but it 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.740
 introduced in the comic-con and someone what 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.750
 leaked thank you 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.460
 for this reason the trailer gives us very 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.470
 good quality but we can see this in 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.390
 where the characters in incredible action 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.340
 tells us the origin of the squadron 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.680
 suicide is a group of criminals 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.840
 captured and through blackmail or in the 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.120
 comic a bomb in the neck force us 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.190
 to upload missions and obey others and 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.960
 they work for a government section 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.450
 at the end of a trailer like seeing what 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.120
 We were both waiting for the new button 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.250
 my opinion the trailer regarding its 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.750
 story did not catch my attention and 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.250
 we can see that what if we take 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.650
 twists in the forehead on the arms in the 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.720
 chest in all the joker and personally 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.580
 I did not like them much but in front of 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.320
 stories is a movie and we hope that 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.180
 the interpretation of the character is very 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.850
 good we have to give him the benefit of 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.650
 the doubt until not seeing it does not judge me not 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.880
 I hope that it is a 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.280
 Excellent 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.660
 and something very important you hear the laughter 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.660
 of the self that I will put them here 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.680
 but it 's a very cool feature of 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.680
 this staff 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.890
 personally I liked it but let's look 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.050
 to see the expression of jared leto 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.610
 while listening which is not coming 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.230
 the trailer one of the characters so 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.200
 controversial and expected that came out in the 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.330
 trailer was the one from which many of the 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.970
 fans say it's for a fan service 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.970
 but perhaps this is not with service 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:59.689
 so I think he does not judge like me 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:01.249
 this movie because I really like the 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:03.259
 men so I'll be with big 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:06.499
 expectations are what this may be 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:08.719
 tercel film chimichangas and returns to 

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:10.330
 previous trailer this posted many 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:12.490
 thank you very much 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.710
 because it could not give comedians as 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.270
 they invited but demanding thank you 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.900
 is that it's getting very hot there 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.900
 word 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.190
 what is it and feel 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:30.639
 let's see how this started 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.440
 great personal as many know and 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:34.370
 if you do not know the school is my character 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.139
 Favourite 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.600
 having a terminal illness 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:41.030
 cancer worked as military and personal 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.710
 having this terminal illness is 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.540
 approached to invite them a project 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.940
 where not only were they going to cure cancer 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:50.780
 they were going to experiment with him and they were going to 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:52.760
 give superpowers the alarm project x 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.760
 and you know what kind of experiments 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.320
 doing or if you do not ask a little and 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.720
 leave you we can see the appearance of 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:03.090
 china stopping my favorite fighter 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.660
 fill you're watching this 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.590
 a who can see it 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.360
 finally facing the character of 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.970
 angel we can see other characters 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.930
 colossi and legation and what else I 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:17.819
 pleased is that we can see that being of 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:20.550
 301'd kill the counting 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:22.470
 jokes and especially his black humor so 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.060
 characteristic that really that what 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.220
 I was very worried because I had 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.500
 earrings that were of fire more 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.660
 for children but I was very pleased that 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.069
 they respected the character of destiny 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.509
 the truth is I'm very excited about 

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:35.550
 this movie because it looks spectacular 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:38.159
 besides that the darth costume is very 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:40.289
 very attached comics and I will be great and 

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:42.539
 that serve the action scenes began 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:44.909
 like one of the things that I could not 

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:47.190
 appreciate was the personification of sweet 

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:49.199
 and the mask the three kingdoms the truth 

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:52.770
 I was one day personified like this 

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:56.160
 weird as really in comics 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:57.990
 it was a hair and as we see it is 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.599
 very close but can not see how 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:02.460
 terrifying was seen without the magic so 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:04.650
 I was too excited about two things 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:07.770
 trailers and the order of my favorites that 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:10.229
 I want to see it 's more with the role of 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.789
 superman and suicide squad good
