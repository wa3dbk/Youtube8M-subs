information so I can develop myself and

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.040 
information so I can develop myself and
what<00:00:55.190> I<00:00:55.220> did<00:00:55.520> and<00:00:55.760> I<00:00:55.880> give<00:00:56.060> to<00:00:56.270> my<00:00:56.300> students<00:00:56.900> is

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
what I did and I give to my students is

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.890 
what I did and I give to my students is
let's<00:00:57.560> say<00:00:57.650> that<00:00:57.860> you<00:00:58.280> played<00:00:58.520> a<00:00:58.550> Chloe<00:00:58.900> with

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
let's say that you played a Chloe with

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.289 
let's say that you played a Chloe with
the<00:01:00.020> right<00:01:00.230> hand<00:01:00.530> and<00:01:00.850> then<00:01:01.850> you<00:01:02.030> do<00:01:02.180> this<00:01:04.299> so

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
the right hand and then you do this so

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:07.390 
the right hand and then you do this so
you<00:01:05.689> take<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:06.049> number<00:01:06.229> five<00:01:06.680> of<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.040> stick

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
you take the number five of the stick

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.760 
you take the number five of the stick
control<00:01:07.759> which<00:01:07.939> is<00:01:08.090> the<00:01:08.270> paradiddle<00:01:08.770> ten

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
control which is the paradiddle ten

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.380 
control which is the paradiddle ten
right<00:01:10.040> so<00:01:10.759> it's<00:01:11.560> like<00:01:12.560> this<00:01:13.060> enhance<00:01:14.060> it<00:01:14.270> will

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
right so it's like this enhance it will

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:25.989 
right so it's like this enhance it will
be<00:01:21.670> the<00:01:22.670> same<00:01:22.969> thing<00:01:23.179> you<00:01:23.390> give<00:01:23.569> one<00:01:24.789> value<00:01:25.789> to

00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:25.999 
be the same thing you give one value to

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:27.489 
be the same thing you give one value to
the<00:01:26.119> snare<00:01:26.359> and<00:01:26.569> the<00:01:26.749> other<00:01:26.899> value<00:01:27.229> to<00:01:27.380> the

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:27.499 
the snare and the other value to the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:57.030 
the snare and the other value to the
basement

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.040 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.770 

so<00:01:58.040> you<00:01:58.310> can<00:01:58.490> play<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:58.820> claw<00:01:59.060> way<00:01:59.240> and<00:01:59.479> this<00:01:59.630> is

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
so you can play the claw way and this is

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.600 
so you can play the claw way and this is
really<00:02:00.020> slow<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.770> way<00:02:00.890> I'm<00:02:01.009> doing<00:02:01.310> it<00:02:01.430> right

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
really slow the way I'm doing it right

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:33.390 
really slow the way I'm doing it right
you<00:02:02.360> know<00:02:02.960> I<00:02:03.020> get<00:02:03.200> to<00:02:03.229> the<00:02:03.500> point<00:02:03.710> you<00:02:03.830> can<00:02:03.890> do

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.460 

you<00:02:34.400> want<00:02:34.610> to<00:02:34.670> create<00:02:34.880> this<00:02:35.180> balance<00:02:35.720> of<00:02:35.900> being

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
you want to create this balance of being

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.550 
you want to create this balance of being
able<00:02:36.739> to<00:02:36.950> actually<00:02:37.220> improvise<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:39.260> know<00:02:39.380> what

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
able to actually improvise you know what

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.010 
able to actually improvise you know what
I<00:02:39.590> do<00:02:39.709> to<00:02:39.920> my<00:02:40.040> students<00:02:40.459> I<00:02:40.580> put<00:02:40.880> them<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.780> kind

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
I do to my students I put them to kind

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.550 
I do to my students I put them to kind
of<00:02:42.080> play<00:02:42.440> all<00:02:43.190> of<00:02:43.610> these<00:02:44.140> against<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.349> Clower

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
of play all of these against the Clower

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.920 
of play all of these against the Clower
so<00:02:46.040> all<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.550> all<00:02:46.790> the<00:02:47.239> stick<00:02:47.510> control

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
so all the all the stick control

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.880 
so all the all the stick control
patterns<00:02:50.170> against<00:02:51.170> the<00:02:51.260> cloud<00:02:51.500> and<00:02:51.739> then

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
patterns against the cloud and then

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.030 
patterns against the cloud and then
against<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.520> cascara<00:02:52.880> also<00:02:53.650> so<00:02:54.650> with<00:02:54.920> the

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
against the cascara also so with the

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:23.170 
against the cascara also so with the
cascara<00:02:55.340> will<00:02:55.610> be<00:03:21.040> one<00:03:22.040> more<00:03:22.160> time<00:03:22.400> for<00:03:22.670> me<00:03:22.850> to

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
cascara will be one more time for me to

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.750 
cascara will be one more time for me to
be<00:03:23.330> in<00:03:23.510> this<00:03:23.690> stage<00:03:24.170> where<00:03:24.680> you<00:03:24.830> can<00:03:25.040> you<00:03:25.549> don't

how much how much time you have to put

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.949 
how much how much time you have to put
at<00:03:48.859> it<00:03:49.010> that's<00:03:49.280> completely<00:03:49.940> up<00:03:50.209> to<00:03:50.239> you<00:03:50.540> I<00:03:50.570> did

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
at it that's completely up to you I did

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.800 
at it that's completely up to you I did
put<00:03:51.200> a<00:03:51.350> lot<00:03:51.500> of<00:03:51.650> time<00:03:51.829> to<00:03:52.070> it<00:03:52.220> in<00:03:53.090> this<00:03:53.390> this

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
put a lot of time to it in this this

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.130 
put a lot of time to it in this this
thing<00:03:54.079> didn't<00:03:54.440> come<00:03:54.680> to<00:03:54.890> me<00:03:55.040> just<00:03:55.880> by<00:03:56.079> by<00:03:57.079> the

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
thing didn't come to me just by by the

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.550 
thing didn't come to me just by by the
fact<00:03:57.620> of<00:03:57.859> nature<00:03:58.760> itself<00:03:59.329> I<00:03:59.660> have<00:04:00.170> to<00:04:00.320> create

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
fact of nature itself I have to create

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.080 
fact of nature itself I have to create
it<00:04:00.829> myself<00:04:01.100> I<00:04:01.810> have<00:04:02.810> to<00:04:02.989> practice<00:04:03.380> a<00:04:03.470> lot<00:04:04.090> to

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
it myself I have to practice a lot to

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.090 
it myself I have to practice a lot to
create<00:04:05.420> this<00:04:05.650> independence<00:04:06.650> on<00:04:06.890> this

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
create this independence on this

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.750 
create this independence on this
coordination<00:04:07.690> you<00:04:08.690> saw

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
coordination you saw

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.839 
coordination you saw
using<00:04:10.480> their<00:04:10.629> technique<00:04:11.080> basics<00:04:11.620> of<00:04:11.800> it<00:04:11.980> then

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
using their technique basics of it then

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.729 
using their technique basics of it then
after<00:04:13.180> that<00:04:13.360> you<00:04:13.810> know<00:04:13.930> you<00:04:14.230> got<00:04:14.379> to<00:04:14.590> the

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
after that you know you got to the

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.069 
after that you know you got to the
philosophical<00:04:15.610> level<00:04:15.760> of<00:04:16.030> it<00:04:16.209> which<00:04:16.720> you<00:04:16.870> want

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
philosophical level of it which you want

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.750 
philosophical level of it which you want
to<00:04:17.200> actually<00:04:17.350> create<00:04:17.859> any<00:04:17.889> style<00:04:18.160> and<00:04:18.669> you

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
to actually create any style and you

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.330 
to actually create any style and you
want<00:04:18.940> to<00:04:19.030> sound<00:04:19.239> like<00:04:19.510> yourself

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
want to sound like yourself

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.790 
want to sound like yourself
somehow<00:04:21.340> I<00:04:21.519> guess<00:04:21.820> that's<00:04:22.090> a<00:04:22.500> another<00:04:23.500> point

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
somehow I guess that's a another point

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.040 
somehow I guess that's a another point
that<00:04:24.070> everybody<00:04:24.430> wants<00:04:24.940> to<00:04:25.060> actually<00:04:25.210> be

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
that everybody wants to actually be

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.200 
that everybody wants to actually be
involved<00:04:26.740> with<00:04:28.200> okay
