00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
you might not be able to reverse so I

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.880 
you might not be able to reverse so I
would<00:03:39.600> recommend<00:03:39.630> that<00:03:40.110> just<00:03:40.410> if<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:40.740> go

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
would recommend that just if you go

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.000 
would recommend that just if you go
outside<00:03:41.040> to<00:03:41.430> get<00:03:41.550> a<00:03:41.610> ladder<00:03:41.850> or<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.210> table<00:03:43.010> from

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
outside to get a ladder or a table from

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.240 
outside to get a ladder or a table from

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
I would just say um just wait till they

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.370 
I would just say um just wait till they
make<00:03:47.430> a<00:03:47.490> mistake<00:03:47.640> and<00:03:47.880> then<00:03:48.150> you<00:03:48.360> go<00:03:48.630> in<00:03:48.810> on

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.080 
make a mistake and then you go in on
wait<00:03:49.830> for<00:03:50.010> them<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.190> come<00:03:50.400> outside<00:03:50.580> or<00:03:50.970> wait

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090
