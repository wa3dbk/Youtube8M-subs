00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello welcome to trauma and project in 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.879
 this video will teach you what is a 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.770
 finite state machine and at the same time 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.099
 we will use the application as an example 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.750
 for mobile phone whatsapp a machine 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.820
 pepper state or also called 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.830
 Finite automaton is an abstraction 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.690
 computational that writes the 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.039
 behavior of a reagent system 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.050
 by the determined number of 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.810
 states and a certain number of 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.580
 transitions between those states in 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.210
 this video we will use as an example the 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.210
 whatsapp application 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.030
 whatsapp application was created in 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:45.620
 May 2009 its second version of June 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:49.010
 of 2009 managed to have 250,000 users and 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.909
 as of January 21 , 2014 whatsapp reached 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:55.250
 the figure of 54 billion messages 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:57.170
 circulating in a single day in April 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:01.149
 2014 the number of users had 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.149
 reached 600 million 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.810
 February 2014 the application was 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.720
 bought by the company facebook by 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.140
 19,000 million dollars of which 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.690
 12 billion correspond to shares 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.510
 of facebook and the rest was paid in 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:24.490
 cash if he is mark zuckenberg 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.530
 next I will explain to you with a 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.060
 finite state machine diagram the 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.240
 operation of the application for 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.610
 mobile phone what's up first we're 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.800
 in the input menu there can 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.750
 derive two roads one of them is that 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.480
 we do not have internet or we do not have 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.060
 credit on the phone without if we do not have 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.000
 neither of those two options then 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.820
 we go back to the initial menu another one of those 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.370
 roads is that yes we have network or yes 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.530
 have credit after that we can 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.110
 enter the inbox on this 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.729
 case would be to be able to see the messages 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:03.510
 that we have received photos, videos or music 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:06.610
 or to be able to write a new message 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:09.369
 video music or send some image 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.410
 some with our contacts or 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.810
 our groups added in the 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.120
 application we can also after 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.180
 read our messages download our 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.460
 music our video or our video that 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.240
 has already been sent 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.620
 we can answer that message and that 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.840
 would give the way to create our own 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.320
 message would already depend on it 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.600
 person 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.850
 if you answer us that come the two 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.340
 blue popcorn after having done 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.090
 all the above mentioned we return 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.910
 to the input menu 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.250
 and we wait for a new one to arrive 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.800
 message 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.240
 that would be all on our part I want 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.710
 say thank you very much for watching this 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.710
 video and see you soon
