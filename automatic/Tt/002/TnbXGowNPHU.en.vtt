 sort of chopped green pepper

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.290
 our green chile 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.479
 we continue with our green chile 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.570
 let's add some oil to 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.550

 small cooking stop right now 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.600
 we also add the little ones 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:39.090
 pig so they start loosing all 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.219
 all its flavors 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.280
 continuing 4th recipe when we have seen 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:47.850
 that our flesh has changed a bit 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.039
 color has turned a color 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.080

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:12.300
 of our chopped garlic garlic let's give it 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.030
 there a little revolt to our a 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:18.970
 our elaboration and let's leave it 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.130
 sweat for about two minutes 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.160
 After two minutes we are going to 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.400
 proceed to add our path in 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.800
 a regular amount and ingredients 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.890
 to be at the foot of the video we are going to 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.140
 also earn some black pepper 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.330
 let's season with salt let's leave 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.790
 so that the salt begins to accentuate the 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.970
 flavors we add the two leaves of 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:47.100
 laurel and we also add the green 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:51.250
 chile we add it 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:54.100
 let's leave it at that point 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:58.190
 and then we will add the water 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:02.030
 so that it starts to boil 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:05.310
 and let it boil for a space of 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:08.940
 hour to one hour 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:12.530
 ten minutes with this we return to 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.530

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.200
 good as we can appreciate and talk has 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.060
 our production has been reduced 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.610
 we have removed the pig's legs 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.280
 let's reserve them for some other 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.459
 elaboration then then 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.950
 let's proceed to add our 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:35.590
 flour with a little water 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.660
 good as we have seen our position 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.989
 is quite strong we are going to add 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:44.200
 the flour with water let's start 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.720
 beat and we're going to start thickening the 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:50.819
 elaboration let's check out there 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:53.830
 can be very well remember that the 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.870
 Thick flour is slowly different 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.690
 the cornstarch then you have to have a 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.080
 little of perfect patience let's give it 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.080

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:08.020
 if we achieve everything 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:09.900
 let's leave about 5 to 7 minutes 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.170
 I finished 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.780
