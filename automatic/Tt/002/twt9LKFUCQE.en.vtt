00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
two to one car ratio mix and you need

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.210 
two to one car ratio mix and you need
cards<00:01:43.960> after<00:01:44.080> your<00:01:44.230> workout<00:01:44.530> as<00:01:44.680> well<00:01:44.710> so

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:45.220 
cards after your workout as well so

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.340 
cards after your workout as well so
pretty<00:01:45.790> decent<00:01:46.270> but<00:01:46.570> it's<00:01:46.780> good<00:01:46.990> for<00:01:47.200> what

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
pretty decent but it's good for what

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.140 
pretty decent but it's good for what
what<00:01:47.680> I<00:01:47.710> need<00:01:47.950> for<00:01:48.130> right<00:01:48.310> now<00:01:48.340> but<00:01:48.760> I<00:01:48.820> will<00:01:48.880> be

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
what I need for right now but I will be

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.540 
what I need for right now but I will be
getting<00:01:49.270> I<00:01:49.510> slit<00:01:49.840> next<00:01:50.470> time<00:01:50.650> around<00:01:50.830> so<00:01:51.490> I

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
getting I slit next time around so I

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.690 
getting I slit next time around so I
makes<00:01:51.790> one<00:01:52.060> scoop<00:01:52.390> of<00:01:52.510> this<00:01:53.160> and<00:01:54.160> once<00:01:54.370> cubed

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
makes one scoop of this and once cubed

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.970

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
is dymatize elite xt now this stuff

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.670 
is dymatize elite xt now this stuff
tastes<00:01:57.610> great<00:01:57.940> the<00:01:58.660> rich<00:01:58.930> chocolates<00:01:59.560> the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
tastes great the rich chocolates the

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.410 
tastes great the rich chocolates the
only<00:01:59.920> want<00:02:00.040> to<00:02:00.100> buy<00:02:00.280> off<00:02:00.490> of<00:02:00.520> this<00:02:00.760> but<00:02:01.240> this<00:02:01.360> is

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
only want to buy off of this but this is

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.840 
only want to buy off of this but this is
a<00:02:01.660> slower<00:02:02.170> release<00:02:02.470> protein<00:02:03.220> so<00:02:03.490> it's<00:02:03.670> kind<00:02:03.820> of

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
a slower release protein so it's kind of

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.580 
a slower release protein so it's kind of
like<00:02:03.940> you're<00:02:04.000> putting<00:02:04.240> a<00:02:04.480> you<00:02:04.930> know<00:02:05.050> the<00:02:05.320> quick

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
like you're putting a you know the quick

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.639 
like you're putting a you know the quick
stuff<00:02:05.920> in<00:02:06.220> not<00:02:06.880> as<00:02:07.090> fast<00:02:07.390> as<00:02:07.660> I<00:02:07.810> slit<00:02:08.140> but<00:02:08.319> it's

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
stuff in not as fast as I slit but it's

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.710 
stuff in not as fast as I slit but it's
faster<00:02:09.250> than<00:02:09.789> this<00:02:09.970> stuff<00:02:10.239> because<00:02:10.390> it's<00:02:10.599> kind

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
faster than this stuff because it's kind

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.340 
faster than this stuff because it's kind
of<00:02:10.869> a<00:02:11.019> slower<00:02:11.830> matrix<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:12.970> it<00:02:13.120> and

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
of a slower matrix to it and

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.930 
of a slower matrix to it and
I<00:02:14.440> like<00:02:14.950> him<00:02:15.100> in<00:02:15.250> stuff<00:02:15.490> tastes<00:02:15.700> good<00:02:15.910> I

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
I like him in stuff tastes good I

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.220 
I like him in stuff tastes good I
sometimes<00:02:16.390> I'll<00:02:16.510> take<00:02:16.720> it<00:02:16.840> before<00:02:16.930> i<00:02:17.080> go<00:02:17.200> to

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
sometimes I'll take it before i go to

sometimes I'll take it before i go to
sleep<00:02:17.380> as<00:02:17.830> a<00:02:17.890> kind<00:02:18.490> of<00:02:18.550> like<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.700> case<00:02:18.970> in<00:02:19.180> type

ties<00:02:36.400> can<00:02:36.610> do<00:02:36.760> it<00:02:36.880> up<00:02:36.970> with<00:02:37.120> some<00:02:37.270> grass<00:02:37.510> but<00:02:37.870> I

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
ties can do it up with some grass but I

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.540 
ties can do it up with some grass but I
like<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:38.410> taste<00:02:38.740> of<00:02:38.920> this<00:02:39.070> and<00:02:39.340> I<00:02:39.400> like<00:02:39.520> the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
like the taste of this and I like the

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.860 
like the taste of this and I like the
effective<00:02:40.350> effectiveness<00:02:41.350> of<00:02:41.590> it<00:02:41.770> so<00:02:42.490> I<00:02:42.870> mix

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
effective effectiveness of it so I mix

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.350 
effective effectiveness of it so I mix

this<00:02:49.330> amino<00:02:49.660> bill<00:02:49.990> I<00:02:50.260> got<00:02:50.620> used<00:02:50.830> to<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.070> taste

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
this amino bill I got used to the taste

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.950 
this amino bill I got used to the taste
guys<00:02:51.550> it's<00:02:51.880> a<00:02:51.970> lot<00:02:52.150> better<00:02:52.360> than<00:02:52.600> it<00:02:52.660> was<00:02:52.720> that

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
guys it's a lot better than it was that

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.230 
guys it's a lot better than it was that
first<00:02:53.170> day<00:02:53.470> I<00:02:53.710> mean<00:02:54.250> I<00:02:54.340> just<00:02:54.370> go<00:02:54.940> on<00:02:55.030> from<00:02:55.150> the

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
first day I mean I just go on from the

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.090 
first day I mean I just go on from the
marinade<00:02:55.600> to<00:02:55.660> this<00:02:55.960> i<00:02:56.110> just<00:02:56.140> had<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.470> give<00:02:56.980> it

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
marinade to this i just had to give it

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.710 
marinade to this i just had to give it
some<00:02:57.250> time<00:02:57.430> but<00:02:57.670> right<00:02:57.820> now<00:02:58.000> it's<00:02:58.570> going

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
some time but right now it's going

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.900 
some time but right now it's going
really<00:02:58.960> well<00:02:59.050> got<00:02:59.680> my<00:02:59.830> water<00:02:59.860> ready<00:03:00.670> to<00:03:00.790> get

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
really well got my water ready to get

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.700 
really well got my water ready to get
that<00:03:01.060> dumped<00:03:01.420> in<00:03:01.540> there<00:03:02.430> now<00:03:04.020> also<00:03:05.020> my<00:03:05.230> protein

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
that dumped in there now also my protein

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.030 
that dumped in there now also my protein
I'll<00:03:06.040> mix<00:03:06.670> in<00:03:06.850> two<00:03:07.000> scoops<00:03:07.300> of<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.540> glutamine

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
I'll mix in two scoops of the glutamine

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.380 
I'll mix in two scoops of the glutamine
some<00:03:09.040> people<00:03:09.280> say<00:03:09.400> you<00:03:09.460> don't<00:03:09.790> need<00:03:09.970> that<00:03:10.000> man

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
some people say you don't need that man

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
you don't need it it's just garbage you

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.250 
you don't need it it's just garbage you
don't<00:03:12.280> need<00:03:12.460> that<00:03:12.610> unless<00:03:12.880> I'm<00:03:13.600> gonna<00:03:13.870> use<00:03:14.080> it

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
don't need that unless I'm gonna use it

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.590 
don't need that unless I'm gonna use it
I<00:03:14.470> like<00:03:15.010> it<00:03:15.220> you<00:03:15.580> know<00:03:15.700> there's<00:03:15.940> no<00:03:16.030> taste<00:03:16.330> too

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
I like it you know there's no taste too

creatine HCI so I went ahead I picked it

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.180 
creatine HCI so I went ahead I picked it
up<00:04:23.240> it's<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:24.020> lemon-lime<00:04:24.350> flavor<00:04:24.800> and<00:04:25.100> it

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
protein shake this does not go good with

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.469 
protein shake this does not go good with
anything<00:04:30.860> if<00:04:31.520> product<00:04:31.820> is<00:04:31.970> going<00:04:32.090> to<00:04:32.150> go<00:04:32.270> good
