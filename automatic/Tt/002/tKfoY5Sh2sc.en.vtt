how<00:00:18.599> much<00:00:18.630> I've<00:00:19.020> been<00:00:19.320> waiting<00:00:19.800> for<00:00:20.009> a<00:00:20.040> fully

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
how much I've been waiting for a fully

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.220 
how much I've been waiting for a fully
suspended<00:00:20.910> fat<00:00:21.300> bike<00:00:21.540> that<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:21.899> could<00:00:22.110> just

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
suspended fat bike that I could just

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.530 
suspended fat bike that I could just
send<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:22.619> off<00:00:22.770> and<00:00:23.009> it<00:00:23.520> turns<00:00:23.759> out<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.270> this

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:24.540 
send it off and it turns out that this

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.080 
send it off and it turns out that this
bike<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:25.140> most<00:00:25.320> capable<00:00:25.619> bike<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:26.970> I've

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
bike is the most capable bike that I've

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.389 
bike is the most capable bike that I've
ever<00:00:27.300> ridden<00:00:27.660> literally<00:00:28.439> on<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.710> trails<00:00:28.980> it

00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:29.399 
ever ridden literally on the trails it

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:32.389 
ever ridden literally on the trails it
was<00:00:29.610> like<00:00:30.239> a<00:00:30.270> squirrel<00:00:30.689> down<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.410> trail<00:00:31.619> if<00:00:32.220> i

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
was like a squirrel down the trail if i

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.220 
was like a squirrel down the trail if i
overcook<00:00:32.669> stuff<00:00:33.120> or<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.329> went<00:00:33.510> into<00:00:33.660> corners<00:00:34.050> it

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
overcook stuff or I went into corners it

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.020 
overcook stuff or I went into corners it
was<00:00:34.290> incredibly<00:00:34.860> forgiving<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.489> suspension

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
was incredibly forgiving the suspension

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.390 
was incredibly forgiving the suspension
is<00:00:36.150> just<00:00:36.360> amazing<00:00:36.780> but<00:00:37.470> I<00:00:37.530> know<00:00:37.650> it's<00:00:37.980> taken<00:00:38.340> a

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.400 
is just amazing but I know it's taken a

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.570 
is just amazing but I know it's taken a
long<00:00:38.640> time<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:39.510> really<00:00:40.050> develop<00:00:40.580> the

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580 
long time to really develop the

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.430 
long time to really develop the
technology<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.600> what's<00:00:42.810> going<00:00:43.050> on<00:00:43.140> with<00:00:43.320> this

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
technology and what's going on with this

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.810 
technology and what's going on with this
fight<00:00:43.620> yeah<00:00:44.070> can<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.340> share<00:00:44.520> with<00:00:44.610> us<00:00:44.790> a

bike<00:01:11.080> and<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:12.070> first<00:01:12.369> thing<00:01:12.610> they<00:01:12.759> did<00:01:13.000> was

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
bike and the first thing they did was

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.950 
bike and the first thing they did was
looking<00:01:14.049> at<00:01:14.170> fat<00:01:14.409> bike<00:01:14.710> wheels<00:01:15.070> right<00:01:15.960> big

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
looking at fat bike wheels right big

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.710 
looking at fat bike wheels right big
tires<00:01:17.470> and<00:01:17.710> big<00:01:18.100> rims<00:01:18.490> and<00:01:19.030> wider<00:01:19.840> clubs<00:01:21.720> dyno

tires and big rims and wider clubs dyno

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.139 
tires and big rims and wider clubs dyno
test<00:01:23.170> them<00:01:23.440> to<00:01:23.590> see<00:01:23.979> what<00:01:24.670> do<00:01:24.820> the<00:01:24.939> wheels

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
test them to see what do the wheels

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:27.510 
test them to see what do the wheels
actually<00:01:25.509> do<00:01:25.990> what<00:01:26.439> are<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:26.619> wheels<00:01:26.800> do<00:01:27.100> and

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
actually do what are the wheels do and

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.370 
actually do what are the wheels do and
once<00:01:28.119> they<00:01:28.300> started<00:01:28.630> to<00:01:28.780> understand<00:01:29.200> the

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
once they started to understand the

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.040 
once they started to understand the
characteristics<00:01:29.830> of<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:31.210> wheels<00:01:31.479> and<00:01:31.810> the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
characteristics of the wheels and the

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.380 
characteristics of the wheels and the
different<00:01:32.380> sizes<00:01:32.560> of<00:01:32.890> wheels<00:01:33.250> that's<00:01:34.119> when

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
different sizes of wheels that's when

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.260 
different sizes of wheels that's when
they<00:01:34.509> actually<00:01:34.720> move<00:01:35.200> to<00:01:35.470> now<00:01:36.250> we<00:01:36.310> will<00:01:36.819> make<00:01:37.000> a

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
they actually move to now we will make a

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.289 
they actually move to now we will make a
split<00:01:37.720> pivot<00:01:38.020> suspension<00:01:38.649> work<00:01:39.429> with<00:01:40.119> the

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
split pivot suspension work with the

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.050 
split pivot suspension work with the
characteristics<00:01:40.960> of<00:01:41.080> this<00:01:41.200> wheel<00:01:41.880> it's<00:01:42.880> not

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
characteristics of this wheel it's not

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.800 
characteristics of this wheel it's not
mumbo-jumbo<00:01:43.360> it's<00:01:43.960> it's<00:01:44.229> real<00:01:44.500> stuff<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:46.090> so

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
mumbo-jumbo it's it's real stuff and so

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.930 
mumbo-jumbo it's it's real stuff and so
what<00:01:47.080> you<00:01:47.170> wind<00:01:47.409> up<00:01:47.530> having<00:01:47.770> is<00:01:48.130> you<00:01:48.399> have<00:01:48.789> to

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
what you wind up having is you have to

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.630 
what you wind up having is you have to
break<00:01:49.119> away<00:01:49.179> from<00:01:49.390> a<00:01:49.630> little<00:01:50.049> bit<00:01:50.200> of

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
break away from a little bit of

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.520 
break away from a little bit of
traditional<00:01:51.640> fat<00:01:51.850> bike<00:01:52.060> thinking<00:01:52.509> I<00:01:52.840> think

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
traditional fat bike thinking I think

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.190 
traditional fat bike thinking I think
all<00:01:54.069> of<00:01:54.100> us<00:01:54.369> with<00:01:54.670> fat<00:01:54.880> bikes<00:01:55.149> the<00:01:55.659> first<00:01:55.990> place

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
all of us with fat bikes the first place

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.749 
all of us with fat bikes the first place
you<00:01:56.380> go<00:01:56.409> is<00:01:56.909> flotation<00:01:57.909> I<00:01:58.200> mean<00:01:59.200> that's

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
you go is flotation I mean that's

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.210 
you go is flotation I mean that's
inherent<00:02:00.759> in<00:02:00.849> a<00:02:01.149> big<00:02:01.390> wide<00:02:01.660> tire<00:02:02.220> there's

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
inherent in a big wide tire there's

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.820 
inherent in a big wide tire there's
still<00:02:03.489> flotation<00:02:04.090> in<00:02:04.209> this<00:02:04.360> bike<00:02:04.649> but<00:02:05.649> that's

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
still flotation in this bike but that's

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.279 
still flotation in this bike but that's
not<00:02:06.069> the<00:02:06.250> primary<00:02:06.550> driver<00:02:07.090> anymore<00:02:07.509> right<00:02:08.110> the

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
not the primary driver anymore right the

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.610 
not the primary driver anymore right the
driver<00:02:08.649> is<00:02:09.009> traction<00:02:09.789> and<00:02:10.179> stability<00:02:10.450> and<00:02:11.140> you

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
driver is traction and stability and you

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
driver is traction and stability and you
get<00:02:11.800> a<00:02:11.830> bonus<00:02:12.040> of<00:02:12.459> some<00:02:13.269> flotation<00:02:13.900> so<00:02:14.640> when

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
get a bonus of some flotation so when

all<00:03:22.800> the<00:03:23.040> suspension<00:03:23.400> manufacturers<00:03:24.150> trying

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
all the suspension manufacturers trying

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:32.300 
all the suspension manufacturers trying
to<00:03:25.110> get<00:03:25.560> somebody<00:03:25.860> before<00:03:30.800> up<00:03:31.800> to<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.040> plate

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
to get somebody before up to the plate

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.800 
to get somebody before up to the plate
and<00:03:32.520> join<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.360> game

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
and join the game

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.950 
and join the game
and<00:03:33.990> so<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:34.950> bluto<00:03:35.280> exists<00:03:35.730> and<00:03:36.000> we<00:03:36.720> were<00:03:36.840> able

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
and so the bluto exists and we were able

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.900 
and so the bluto exists and we were able
we<00:03:37.500> knew<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.830> bluto<00:03:38.160> is<00:03:38.280> coming<00:03:38.610> we<00:03:38.700> were<00:03:38.820> able

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
we knew the bluto is coming we were able

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.630 
we knew the bluto is coming we were able
to<00:03:39.120> help<00:03:39.300> guide<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.960> blue<00:03:40.230> dough<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:41.070> so<00:03:41.550> the

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
to help guide the blue dough and so the

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.090 
to help guide the blue dough and so the
bikes<00:03:41.850> designed<00:03:42.270> around<00:03:42.840> a<00:03:43.020> blue<00:03:43.200> dough<00:03:43.380> and

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
bikes designed around a blue dough and

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.650 
bikes designed around a blue dough and
that's<00:03:44.310> really<00:03:44.580> why<00:03:44.760> we<00:03:45.120> could<00:03:45.300> have<00:03:45.390> released

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
that's really why we could have released

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.560 
that's really why we could have released
a<00:03:45.900> frame<00:03:46.200> maybe<00:03:46.740> earlier<00:03:47.220> it<00:03:48.120> doesn't<00:03:48.330> seem

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
a frame maybe earlier it doesn't seem

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.720 
a frame maybe earlier it doesn't seem

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
like the right thing to do you don't put

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.970 
like the right thing to do you don't put
a<00:03:50.760> frame<00:03:51.090> out<00:03:51.300> and<00:03:51.360> then<00:03:51.750> have<00:03:51.990> a<00:03:52.020> cobbled<00:03:52.740> fork
