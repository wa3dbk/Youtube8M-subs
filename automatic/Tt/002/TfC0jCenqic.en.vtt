00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
not going to be expecting any tugs and

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.200 
not going to be expecting any tugs and
that's<00:01:46.770> not<00:01:48.649> that's<00:01:49.649> not<00:01:49.890> happening<00:01:50.430> there's

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
that's not that's not happening there's

00:01:51.210 --> 00:02:02.929 
that's not that's not happening there's
no<00:01:51.590> resistance<00:01:52.590> at<00:01:52.950> all<00:01:55.759> see<00:01:58.340> alright<00:01:59.450> so<00:02:01.939> the

it alright so we'll go ahead and form
the<00:02:36.670> pump<00:02:38.400> so<00:02:39.400> as<00:02:39.520> you<00:02:39.640> guys<00:02:39.790> notice<00:02:40.210> my<00:02:40.390> hair

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
the pump so as you guys notice my hair

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.000 
the pump so as you guys notice my hair
has<00:02:40.780> been<00:02:40.810> getting<00:02:41.170> a<00:02:41.320> little<00:02:41.500> bit<00:02:41.590> longer

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
has been getting a little bit longer

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.850 
has been getting a little bit longer
meaning<00:02:42.670> that<00:02:42.700> forming<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.660> part<00:02:43.930> itself<00:02:44.440> has

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
meaning that forming the part itself has

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
meaning that forming the part itself has
been<00:02:45.160> a<00:02:45.190> little<00:02:45.430> bit<00:02:45.610> easier<00:02:46.800> but<00:02:47.880> one

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
been a little bit easier but one

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.210 
been a little bit easier but one
challenge<00:02:49.150> it<00:02:49.450> does<00:02:49.630> present<00:02:50.050> is<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:50.500> when<00:02:51.190> I

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
challenge it does present is that when I

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.320 
challenge it does present is that when I
do<00:02:51.340> form<00:02:51.820> the<00:02:51.970> pump<00:02:53.040> it's<00:02:54.040> a<00:02:54.430> little<00:02:54.850> trickier

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
do form the pump it's a little trickier

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.950 
do form the pump it's a little trickier
to<00:02:55.390> get<00:02:55.690> down<00:02:56.260> right<00:02:56.560> because<00:02:57.160> my<00:02:57.660> hair<00:02:58.660> tends

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
to get down right because my hair tends

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.080 
to get down right because my hair tends
to<00:02:59.080> wave<00:02:59.290> a<00:02:59.500> little<00:02:59.770> bit<00:03:00.010> more<00:03:00.220> as<00:03:00.520> it<00:03:00.910> gets

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
to wave a little bit more as it gets

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.890 
to wave a little bit more as it gets
longer<00:03:02.490> so<00:03:03.490> judging<00:03:04.060> from<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.300> product<00:03:04.660> right

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
longer so judging from the product right

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.610 
longer so judging from the product right

shine<00:03:14.500> from<00:03:15.100> the<00:03:15.190> product<00:03:16.290> one<00:03:17.290> thing<00:03:17.500> I'm

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
shine from the product one thing I'm

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.550 
shine from the product one thing I'm
skeptical<00:03:18.190> however<00:03:18.550> is<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:22.230> formation<00:03:23.230> of

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
skeptical however is the formation of

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.040 
skeptical however is the formation of
the<00:03:24.370> pump<00:03:24.670> itself<00:03:25.150> as<00:03:26.490> I<00:03:27.490> said<00:03:27.700> before<00:03:28.050> this

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
the pump itself as I said before this

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.870 
the pump itself as I said before this
product<00:03:29.470> was<00:03:29.680> very<00:03:29.950> easy<00:03:30.250> to<00:03:30.400> get<00:03:30.610> through

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
product was very easy to get through

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.990

very<00:03:31.120> easy<00:03:31.900> to<00:03:32.170> comb<00:03:32.410> through<00:03:32.440> my<00:03:33.210> hair<00:03:34.210> and

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
very easy to comb through my hair and

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.690 
very easy to comb through my hair and
what<00:03:37.000> that<00:03:37.210> usually<00:03:37.510> means<00:03:37.900> for<00:03:38.110> me<00:03:38.230> is<00:03:38.530> that

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
what that usually means for me is that

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.180 
what that usually means for me is that
I'm<00:03:39.700> not<00:03:40.210> going<00:03:40.480> to<00:03:40.570> be<00:03:40.750> able<00:03:40.990> to<00:03:41.170> form<00:03:41.470> a<00:03:41.560> pump

I'm not going to be able to form a pump

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.050 
I'm not going to be able to form a pump
that<00:03:43.410> you<00:03:44.410> know<00:03:44.530> it's<00:03:44.770> very<00:03:44.890> satisfactory<00:03:45.880> to

itself hasn't been a problem yet what

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.229 
itself hasn't been a problem yet what
I'm<00:04:13.110> feeling<00:04:14.070> however<00:04:14.700> is<00:04:14.880> that<00:04:15.180> as<00:04:16.459> I<00:04:17.459> stop

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
I'm feeling however is that as I stop

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.520 
I'm feeling however is that as I stop
combing<00:04:18.750> I<00:04:18.930> start<00:04:19.769> moving<00:04:20.100> a<00:04:20.160> little<00:04:20.340> bit<00:04:20.430> more

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
pretty much all I can get out of it at

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:48.220 
pretty much all I can get out of it at
the<00:04:35.520> moment<00:04:40.760> and<00:04:45.980> there<00:04:46.980> you<00:04:47.160> have<00:04:47.190> it
