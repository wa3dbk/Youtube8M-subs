I<00:00:08.050> would<00:00:09.050> describe<00:00:09.410> it<00:00:09.590> as<00:00:09.740> the<00:00:10.010> as<00:00:10.670> a<00:00:10.730> new

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:10.940 
I would describe it as the as a new

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:12.940 
I would describe it as the as a new
standard<00:00:11.360> in<00:00:11.510> full-size<00:00:11.990> trucks<00:00:12.320> we<00:00:12.650> know

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
standard in full-size trucks we know

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.830 
standard in full-size trucks we know
this<00:00:13.250> new<00:00:13.490> trucks<00:00:13.820> gonna<00:00:14.060> redefine<00:00:14.660> the

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:14.840 
this new trucks gonna redefine the

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.100 
this new trucks gonna redefine the
segments<00:00:15.260> taking<00:00:15.890> weight<00:00:16.160> out<00:00:16.370> and

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.110 
segments taking weight out and

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.500 
segments taking weight out and
increasing<00:00:18.110> capability<00:00:18.830> is<00:00:19.040> the<00:00:19.700> way<00:00:19.850> for<00:00:20.180> any

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
increasing capability is the way for any

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.500 
increasing capability is the way for any
tool<00:00:21.200> to<00:00:21.860> move<00:00:22.070> forward<00:00:22.550> it's<00:00:22.970> gonna<00:00:23.210> feel

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
tool to move forward it's gonna feel

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.960 
tool to move forward it's gonna feel
better<00:00:23.750> and<00:00:24.140> perform<00:00:24.680> better<00:00:24.910> than<00:00:25.910> the

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
better and perform better than the

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.210 
better and perform better than the
current<00:00:26.360> trucks<00:00:26.660> on<00:00:26.840> the<00:00:26.990> road<00:00:27.170> this<00:00:27.740> will<00:00:28.010> be

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
current trucks on the road this will be

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.189 
current trucks on the road this will be
a<00:00:28.250> new<00:00:28.490> standard<00:00:28.760> it<00:00:29.240> really<00:00:29.570> is<00:00:29.690> the<00:00:29.869> future

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
a new standard it really is the future

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.290 
a new standard it really is the future
of<00:00:30.230> tough<00:00:30.530> I<00:00:30.740> think<00:00:30.949> that's<00:00:31.130> the<00:00:31.400> best<00:00:32.119> way<00:00:32.270> to

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
of tough I think that's the best way to

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.650 
of tough I think that's the best way to
describe<00:00:32.689> it<00:00:33.550> we<00:00:34.550> wanted<00:00:34.790> to<00:00:34.880> do<00:00:34.970> something<00:00:35.210> so

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
describe it we wanted to do something so

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.360 
describe it we wanted to do something so
big<00:00:35.960> with<00:00:36.230> this<00:00:36.380> truck<00:00:36.650> that<00:00:36.680> we<00:00:36.950> said<00:00:37.160> let's

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
big with this truck that we said let's

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.250 
big with this truck that we said let's
break<00:00:37.550> it<00:00:37.700> down<00:00:37.730> to<00:00:38.030> its<00:00:38.180> core<00:00:38.480> elements<00:00:39.020> but

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
break it down to its core elements but

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.050 
break it down to its core elements but
probably<00:00:39.620> the<00:00:39.770> most<00:00:39.890> exciting<00:00:40.370> thing<00:00:40.550> was<00:00:40.730> we

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:41.060 
probably the most exciting thing was we

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.940 
probably the most exciting thing was we
were<00:00:41.090> opening<00:00:41.540> the<00:00:41.630> doors<00:00:41.870> to<00:00:42.079> materials<00:00:42.649> this

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
were opening the doors to materials this

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.979 
were opening the doors to materials this
is<00:00:43.130> the<00:00:43.220> highest<00:00:43.579> volume<00:00:44.000> vehicle<00:00:44.420> in<00:00:44.510> America

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989 
is the highest volume vehicle in America

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.840 
is the highest volume vehicle in America
and<00:00:45.260> we're<00:00:45.739> going<00:00:46.160> we're<00:00:46.430> making<00:00:46.700> this

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
and we're going we're making this

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.990 
and we're going we're making this
dramatic<00:00:47.480> change<00:00:48.050> in<00:00:48.610> materials<00:00:49.610> and<00:00:49.760> we<00:00:49.820> came

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
dramatic change in materials and we came

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.060 
dramatic change in materials and we came
up<00:00:50.180> with<00:00:50.300> just<00:00:50.510> a<00:00:50.630> dynamite<00:00:51.170> combination<00:00:51.920> of

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
up with just a dynamite combination of

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.970 
up with just a dynamite combination of
aluminum<00:00:52.520> alloy<00:00:53.149> that<00:00:53.360> we<00:00:53.510> use<00:00:53.719> on<00:00:53.989> the<00:00:54.440> cab<00:00:54.680> in

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 
aluminum alloy that we use on the cab in

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.580 
aluminum alloy that we use on the cab in
the<00:00:55.040> box<00:00:55.280> in<00:00:55.550> the<00:00:55.640> front<00:00:55.820> end<00:00:56.090> and<00:00:56.320> we<00:00:57.320> put<00:00:57.469> that

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
the box in the front end and we put that

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.610 
the box in the front end and we put that
over<00:00:57.649> a<00:00:57.860> steel<00:00:58.190> frame<00:00:58.399> which<00:00:59.210> has<00:00:59.570> boron<00:01:00.320> and

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
over a steel frame which has boron and

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.840 
over a steel frame which has boron and
higher<00:01:00.770> strength<00:01:01.190> steel<00:01:01.430> than<00:01:01.640> we've<00:01:01.760> ever

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
higher strength steel than we've ever

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.239 
higher strength steel than we've ever
put<00:01:02.180> in<00:01:02.300> a<00:01:02.390> frame<00:01:02.570> before<00:01:02.960> it<00:01:03.260> took<00:01:03.379> 700<00:01:03.920> pounds

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:04.249 
put in a frame before it took 700 pounds

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:05.709 
put in a frame before it took 700 pounds
of<00:01:04.309> weight<00:01:04.489> out<00:01:04.639> and<00:01:04.879> this<00:01:04.969> vehicle<00:01:05.149> still<00:01:05.600> is

00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:05.719 
of weight out and this vehicle still is

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:07.510 
of weight out and this vehicle still is
more<00:01:05.869> capable<00:01:06.229> than<00:01:06.319> HIV<00:01:06.590> ever<00:01:06.829> produced<00:01:07.189> and

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
more capable than HIV ever produced and

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.249 
more capable than HIV ever produced and
what<00:01:07.729> we<00:01:07.909> managed<00:01:08.329> to<00:01:08.359> do<00:01:08.659> with<00:01:08.810> that<00:01:09.020> light

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
what we managed to do with that light

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.260 
what we managed to do with that light
weight<00:01:09.499> is<00:01:09.799> actually<00:01:10.069> pour<00:01:10.520> it<00:01:10.609> back<00:01:10.670> into

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
weight is actually pour it back into

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.959 
weight is actually pour it back into
more<00:01:11.450> capability<00:01:12.289> for<00:01:12.829> the<00:01:13.009> vehicle<00:01:13.490> it's

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:13.969 
more capability for the vehicle it's

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:16.090 
more capability for the vehicle it's
actually<00:01:14.240> more<00:01:14.450> fun<00:01:14.719> to<00:01:14.899> drive<00:01:15.020> more<00:01:15.529> capable

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
actually more fun to drive more capable

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.029 
actually more fun to drive more capable
yet<00:01:16.639> looks<00:01:16.909> great<00:01:17.299> I<00:01:17.539> love<00:01:18.139> the<00:01:18.350> design<00:01:18.679> the

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
yet looks great I love the design the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:21.819 
yet looks great I love the design the
design<00:01:19.369> is<00:01:19.819> you<00:01:20.090> know<00:01:20.240> it's<00:01:20.569> stunning<00:01:20.990> it's<00:01:21.289> at

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 
design is you know it's stunning it's at

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:24.190 
design is you know it's stunning it's at
a<00:01:21.889> glance<00:01:22.329> very<00:01:23.329> different<00:01:23.719> it's<00:01:23.899> it's

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
a glance very different it's it's

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.800 
a glance very different it's it's
athletic<00:01:24.920> it's<00:01:25.639> tough<00:01:25.999> the<00:01:26.359> standard-bearer

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
athletic it's tough the standard-bearer

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.569 
athletic it's tough the standard-bearer
of<00:01:27.139> trucks<00:01:27.499> so<00:01:27.740> I'm<00:01:28.100> usually<00:01:28.249> around

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
of trucks so I'm usually around

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:32.980 
of trucks so I'm usually around
capability<00:01:29.389> payload<00:01:30.319> hauling<00:01:31.279> etc<00:01:31.939> but<00:01:32.659> even

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
capability payload hauling etc but even

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.690 
capability payload hauling etc but even
more<00:01:33.200> so<00:01:33.439> in<00:01:33.619> today's<00:01:33.859> environment<00:01:34.069> it's<00:01:34.520> also

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
more so in today's environment it's also

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.429 
more so in today's environment it's also
around<00:01:34.999> fuel<00:01:35.329> efficiency<00:01:35.869> it<00:01:36.020> can<00:01:36.170> go<00:01:36.289> with

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
around fuel efficiency it can go with

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:38.319 
around fuel efficiency it can go with
that<00:01:36.560> capability<00:01:37.009> you<00:01:37.639> can't<00:01:37.909> really<00:01:38.090> leave

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
that capability you can't really leave

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.989 
that capability you can't really leave

the truck I think it's just a beautiful
truck<00:03:04.910> I<00:03:05.209> also<00:03:05.930> love<00:03:06.230> the<00:03:06.350> way<00:03:06.500> it<00:03:06.620> drives<00:03:06.799> and

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
truck I also love the way it drives and

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.890 
truck I also love the way it drives and
it's<00:03:07.760> one<00:03:07.910> of<00:03:07.940> those<00:03:08.090> things<00:03:08.389> that<00:03:08.480> taking

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
it's one of those things that taking

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.410 
it's one of those things that taking
weight<00:03:09.109> out<00:03:09.319> is<00:03:09.530> always<00:03:09.920> a<00:03:09.950> good<00:03:10.160> thing

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
weight out is always a good thing

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.420 
weight out is always a good thing
the<00:03:11.420> rides<00:03:11.720> better<00:03:12.019> the<00:03:12.470> dynamics<00:03:13.099> are<00:03:13.250> better

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
the rides better the dynamics are better

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.879 
the rides better the dynamics are better
the<00:03:14.000> acceleration<00:03:14.690> is<00:03:14.780> better<00:03:14.959> the<00:03:15.410> braking

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:15.889 
the acceleration is better the braking

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:18.099 
the acceleration is better the braking
is<00:03:15.920> better<00:03:16.190> on<00:03:17.090> top<00:03:17.389> of<00:03:17.569> delivering<00:03:17.959> better

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:18.109 
is better on top of delivering better

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.530 
is better on top of delivering better
efficiency<00:03:18.769> so<00:03:19.040> it's<00:03:19.670> definitely<00:03:20.299> the<00:03:20.389> end

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
efficiency so it's definitely the end

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.030 
efficiency so it's definitely the end
solution<00:03:21.049> I<00:03:21.290> think<00:03:21.440> this<00:03:21.829> demonstrates

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
solution I think this demonstrates

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.220 
solution I think this demonstrates
