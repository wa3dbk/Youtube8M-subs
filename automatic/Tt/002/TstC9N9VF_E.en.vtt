based<00:01:24.060> appear<00:01:24.509> is<00:01:24.630> 1.8<00:01:25.350> million<00:01:25.799> resources

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
based appear is 1.8 million resources

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.789 
based appear is 1.8 million resources
based<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:27.119> bit<00:01:27.330> when<00:01:27.810> this<00:01:27.930> base<00:01:28.140> appear<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.650> was

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
based a bit when this base appear I was

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.560 
based a bit when this base appear I was
like<00:01:28.920> kind<00:01:29.159> of<00:01:29.189> stunned<00:01:29.549> when<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.090> amount<00:01:30.479> of

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
like kind of stunned when the amount of

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.630 
like kind of stunned when the amount of
resources<00:01:30.990> was<00:01:31.320> over<00:01:31.950> there<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.250> almost

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
resources was over there and almost

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.120 
resources was over there and almost
hitting<00:01:32.909> 1<00:01:33.360> million<00:01:33.930> elixir<00:01:34.470> available<00:01:35.009> to

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
hitting 1 million elixir available to

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.910 
hitting 1 million elixir available to
loot<00:01:35.960> but<00:01:36.960> as<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.110> can<00:01:37.259> see<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.530> elixir

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
loot but as you can see the elixir

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.859 
loot but as you can see the elixir
collectors<00:01:38.369> they<00:01:38.490> are<00:01:38.549> almost<00:01:38.880> at<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.540> core

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
collectors they are almost at the core

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.960 
collectors they are almost at the core
of<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.110> base<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.979> it's<00:01:41.159> not<00:01:41.280> too<00:01:41.400> easy<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.820> get

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
of the base so it's not too easy to get

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.660 
of the base so it's not too easy to get
elixir<00:01:42.450> because<00:01:42.570> it's<00:01:43.409> quite<00:01:44.009> well<00:01:44.250> protected

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
elixir because it's quite well protected

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.460 
elixir because it's quite well protected
and<00:01:45.149> also<00:01:45.450> at<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.720> same<00:01:45.869> time<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.170> was<00:01:46.320> having

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
and also at the same time I was having

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.440 
and also at the same time I was having
kind<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.159> weak<00:01:47.369> troop<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.000> now<00:01:48.180> as<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.360> can

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
kind of a weak troop so now as you can

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.060 
kind of a weak troop so now as you can
see<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.659> only<00:01:48.750> have<00:01:48.930> like<00:01:49.229> level<00:01:49.530> 6<00:01:49.740> per<00:01:49.890> branch

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
see I only have like level 6 per branch

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.420 
see I only have like level 6 per branch
level<00:01:50.310> 5<00:01:50.939> archer<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:51.600> if<00:01:51.720> I've<00:01:51.960> had<00:01:52.470> like<00:01:53.040> level

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
level 5 archer so if I've had like level

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.609 
level 5 archer so if I've had like level
7<00:01:53.790> per<00:01:53.939> branch<00:01:54.149> archers<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.780> maybe<00:01:55.049> level<00:01:55.409> 6

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
7 per branch archers and maybe level 6

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.280 
7 per branch archers and maybe level 6
minions<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.490> would<00:01:57.090> be<00:01:57.240> able<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.450> do<00:01:57.600> some<00:01:57.840> more

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
minions I would be able to do some more

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.350 
minions I would be able to do some more
damage<00:01:58.320> maybe<00:01:58.950> even<00:01:59.219> getting<00:01:59.460> half<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.969> the

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
damage maybe even getting half of the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.179 
damage maybe even getting half of the
whole<00:02:00.630> entire<00:02:01.079> loot<00:02:01.320> in<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.530> whole<00:02:01.710> base<00:02:02.159> of

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
whole entire loot in the whole base of

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.010 
whole entire loot in the whole base of
course<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:02.670> maybe<00:02:02.939> with<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.210> help<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.540> my<00:02:03.689> level

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
course I maybe with the help of my level

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.039 
course I maybe with the help of my level
20<00:02:04.290> heroes<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:05.280> certainly<00:02:05.820> do<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.750> lot<00:02:06.840> more

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
20 heroes you certainly do a lot more

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.410 
20 heroes you certainly do a lot more
damage<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.160> course<00:02:08.459> help<00:02:08.759> in<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.060> reading

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
damage and of course help in the reading

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.150 
damage and of course help in the reading
so<00:02:09.989> now<00:02:10.110> as<00:02:10.229> you<00:02:10.259> can<00:02:10.319> see<00:02:10.440> I'm<00:02:10.649> just<00:02:10.679> focusing

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
so now as you can see I'm just focusing

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.230 
so now as you can see I'm just focusing
on<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.459> elixir<00:02:11.940> for<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.330> particularly

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
on that elixir for this a particularly

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.060 
on that elixir for this a particularly
the<00:02:13.450> darkness<00:02:13.780> was<00:02:14.020> relatively<00:02:14.500> easy<00:02:14.620> to

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
the darkness was relatively easy to

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.130 
the darkness was relatively easy to
access<00:02:15.550> at<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.850> same<00:02:16.090> time<00:02:16.360> because<00:02:16.930> the

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
access at the same time because the

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.560 
access at the same time because the
elixir<00:02:17.890> wasn't<00:02:18.400> too<00:02:18.520> easy<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:19.000> go<00:02:19.150> for<00:02:19.420> it<00:02:19.480> they

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
elixir wasn't too easy to go for it they

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.120 
elixir wasn't too easy to go for it they
don't<00:02:19.600> want<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:19.900> risk<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.350> try<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.620> go<00:02:20.860> for<00:02:20.890> the

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
don't want to risk to try to go for the

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.790 
don't want to risk to try to go for the
elixir<00:02:21.670> but<00:02:22.180> of<00:02:22.720> course<00:02:22.960> the<00:02:23.170> goal<00:02:23.440> was<00:02:23.620> really

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
elixir but of course the goal was really

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.820 
elixir but of course the goal was really
good<00:02:24.040> enough<00:02:24.250> I'm<00:02:24.400> caught<00:02:24.610> on<00:02:24.640> my<00:02:25.830> 436,000

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
good enough I'm caught on my 436,000

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.070 
good enough I'm caught on my 436,000
girlfriend<00:02:27.250> ruled<00:02:27.430> this<00:02:27.610> attack<00:02:28.210> itself<00:02:28.480> I'm

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
girlfriend ruled this attack itself I'm

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.900 
girlfriend ruled this attack itself I'm
gonna<00:02:29.320> go<00:02:29.620> ahead<00:02:29.740> to<00:02:29.860> try<00:02:30.070> to<00:02:30.130> get<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.430> last<00:02:30.700> I

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
gonna go ahead to try to get the last I

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.280 
gonna go ahead to try to get the last I
listed<00:02:31.210> room<00:02:31.390> they're<00:02:31.600> dropping<00:02:31.840> a<00:02:31.900> ritual<00:02:32.260> to

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
listed room they're dropping a ritual to

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.900 
listed room they're dropping a ritual to
help<00:02:32.380> my<00:02:32.680> I<00:02:32.830> just<00:02:32.890> go<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.400> do<00:02:33.520> not<00:02:33.550> have<00:02:33.760> any

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
help my I just go and do not have any

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.700 
help my I just go and do not have any
barbarians<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:34.480> go<00:02:34.630> hit<00:02:34.870> trying<00:02:35.350> to<00:02:35.410> help<00:02:35.560> out

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
barbarians to go hit trying to help out

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.020 
barbarians to go hit trying to help out
so<00:02:36.280> I've<00:02:36.370> got<00:02:36.490> a<00:02:36.520> three<00:02:36.880> point<00:02:37.240> six<00:02:38.020> thousand

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
so I've got a three point six thousand

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.190 
so I've got a three point six thousand
double<00:02:40.030> excel<00:02:40.300> from<00:02:40.360> this<00:02:40.570> base<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:41.020> of

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
double excel from this base and of

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.530 
double excel from this base and of
course<00:02:41.470> we<00:02:41.590> couldn't<00:02:41.830> go<00:02:41.890> back<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.070> my<00:02:42.190> base

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
course we couldn't go back to my base

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.760 
course we couldn't go back to my base
and<00:02:43.540> we're<00:02:43.690> gonna<00:02:43.780> do<00:02:43.960> some<00:02:44.140> more<00:02:44.260> upgrade<00:02:44.650> so

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
and we're gonna do some more upgrade so

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:45.630 
and we're gonna do some more upgrade so
at<00:02:44.950> this<00:02:45.040> point<00:02:45.220> of<00:02:45.340> time<00:02:45.370> I<00:02:45.490> actually

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
at this point of time I actually

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.760 
at this point of time I actually
upgraded<00:02:46.150> some<00:02:46.390> walls<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:47.350> recording

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
upgraded some walls and the recording

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.230 
upgraded some walls and the recording
got<00:02:47.890> screwed<00:02:48.190> up<00:02:48.310> so<00:02:48.580> I<00:02:48.610> couldn't<00:02:49.120> show<00:02:49.210> you

got screwed up so I couldn't show you

so yeah I'm gonna go ahead and do some
more<00:02:54.400> rates<00:02:54.610> I'll<00:02:54.820> get<00:02:55.060> doing<00:02:55.390> this<00:02:55.540> easy<00:02:56.050> but

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
more rates I'll get doing this easy but

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
more rates I'll get doing this easy but
not<00:02:57.550> too<00:02:57.810> low<00:02:58.810> resources<00:02:59.410> base<00:02:59.740> attack<00:03:00.280> so<00:03:00.820> now

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
not too low resources base attack so now

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.330 
not too low resources base attack so now
as<00:03:01.030> you<00:03:01.060> can<00:03:01.120> see<00:03:01.470> it's<00:03:02.470> gonna<00:03:02.590> be<00:03:02.800> very<00:03:03.100> quick

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
as you can see it's gonna be very quick

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.310 
as you can see it's gonna be very quick
and<00:03:03.490> gonna<00:03:03.880> be<00:03:04.060> very<00:03:04.270> easy<00:03:04.330> just<00:03:04.900> deploy<00:03:05.140> my

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
and gonna be very easy just deploy my

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.870 
and gonna be very easy just deploy my
troop<00:03:05.500> at<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.740> very<00:03:05.920> bottom<00:03:06.070> in<00:03:06.370> a<00:03:06.460> v-shape

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
troop at the very bottom in a v-shape

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.370 
troop at the very bottom in a v-shape
men<00:03:07.060> are<00:03:07.210> not<00:03:07.390> gonna<00:03:07.540> bother<00:03:07.810> about<00:03:08.050> even

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
men are not gonna bother about even

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.260 
men are not gonna bother about even
getting<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.710> win<00:03:08.920> because<00:03:09.130> it's<00:03:09.820> gonna<00:03:10.000> be<00:03:10.240> a

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
getting the win because it's gonna be a

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.930 
getting the win because it's gonna be a
very<00:03:10.840> good<00:03:10.990> amount<00:03:11.800> resources<00:03:12.460> and<00:03:12.670> then<00:03:12.820> of

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
very good amount resources and then of

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.690 
very good amount resources and then of
course<00:03:12.970> I<00:03:13.270> didn't<00:03:13.510> use<00:03:13.990> all<00:03:14.200> my<00:03:14.710> troops<00:03:15.010> so

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
course I didn't use all my troops so

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.700 
course I didn't use all my troops so
that's<00:03:15.910> really<00:03:16.120> a<00:03:16.210> good<00:03:16.450> thing<00:03:16.720> so<00:03:16.990> I<00:03:17.410> really

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
that's really a good thing so I really

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.380 
that's really a good thing so I really
like<00:03:17.920> attacking<00:03:18.250> basis<00:03:18.730> but<00:03:18.880> I<00:03:19.000> do<00:03:19.060> not<00:03:19.240> have

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
like attacking basis but I do not have

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.930 
like attacking basis but I do not have
to<00:03:19.510> use<00:03:19.660> more<00:03:20.020> than<00:03:20.170> half<00:03:20.440> of<00:03:20.560> my<00:03:20.620> army<00:03:21.220> but<00:03:21.910> I

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
to use more than half of my army but I

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.000 
to use more than half of my army but I
get<00:03:22.240> like<00:03:22.420> a<00:03:22.630> lot<00:03:23.050> of<00:03:23.170> resources<00:03:23.710> especially

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
get like a lot of resources especially

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.430 
get like a lot of resources especially
that<00:03:24.400> particular<00:03:24.790> one<00:03:25.000> where<00:03:25.210> I<00:03:25.390> got<00:03:25.660> like<00:03:26.080> 500

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
that particular one where I got like 500

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.290 
that particular one where I got like 500
over<00:03:27.190> thousand<00:03:27.610> resources<00:03:28.090> from<00:03:28.240> that

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
over thousand resources from that

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.510 
over thousand resources from that
particular<00:03:28.630> attack<00:03:29.110> just<00:03:29.290> using<00:03:29.710> less<00:03:30.280> than

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
particular attack just using less than

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.540 
particular attack just using less than
half<00:03:30.850> of<00:03:31.030> my<00:03:31.350> army<00:03:32.350> so<00:03:32.890> you<00:03:33.010> can<00:03:33.190> see<00:03:33.370> this

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:33.550 
half of my army so you can see this

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:36.180 
half of my army so you can see this
particular<00:03:33.850> rate<00:03:34.210> ordered<00:03:34.810> the<00:03:35.470> resources<00:03:36.040> is

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
particular rate ordered the resources is

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.270 
particular rate ordered the resources is
much<00:03:36.460> higher<00:03:36.790> than<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:37.090> previous<00:03:37.390> one<00:03:37.840> but<00:03:38.560> I

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
much higher than the previous one but I

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.480 
much higher than the previous one but I
do<00:03:39.760> have<00:03:40.030> to<00:03:40.120> use<00:03:40.270> more<00:03:40.570> of<00:03:41.170> my<00:03:41.380> troops<00:03:41.650> so<00:03:42.100> once

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.490 
do have to use more of my troops so once

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.010 
do have to use more of my troops so once
a<00:03:42.580> new<00:03:42.700> small<00:03:42.940> my<00:03:43.060> troops<00:03:43.300> I<00:03:43.420> do<00:03:43.480> have<00:03:43.720> to<00:03:43.810> wait

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
a new small my troops I do have to wait

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.840 
a new small my troops I do have to wait
a<00:03:44.200> little<00:03:44.470> longer<00:03:44.680> for<00:03:45.100> my<00:03:45.370> troops<00:03:45.610> to<00:03:45.760> be

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
a little longer for my troops to be

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.030 
a little longer for my troops to be
cooked<00:03:46.210> so<00:03:46.450> that's<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.410> thing<00:03:47.560> if<00:03:47.800> you<00:03:47.920> were

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
cooked so that's the thing if you were

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.410 
cooked so that's the thing if you were
to<00:03:48.160> use<00:03:48.310> more<00:03:48.610> of<00:03:48.640> your<00:03:48.760> troops<00:03:49.030> and<00:03:49.150> then<00:03:49.330> you

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
to use more of your troops and then you

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.480 
to use more of your troops and then you
get<00:03:49.660> like<00:03:49.900> I<00:03:49.930> said<00:03:50.290> that<00:03:50.410> amount<00:03:50.830> resources<00:03:51.340> I

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
get like I said that amount resources I

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:53.060 
get like I said that amount resources I
mean<00:03:51.640> I<00:03:51.790> rather<00:03:52.000> do<00:03:52.300> lose<00:03:52.480> triumphs<00:03:52.900> like

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
mean I rather do lose triumphs like

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.310 
mean I rather do lose triumphs like
400,000<00:03:54.330> resources<00:03:55.330> reads<00:03:55.570> and<00:03:55.810> then<00:03:56.170> maybe

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
400,000 resources reads and then maybe

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.830 
400,000 resources reads and then maybe
just<00:03:56.470> use<00:03:56.860> only<00:03:57.100> 40<00:03:57.580> troops<00:03:57.910> and<00:03:58.480> then<00:03:58.570> after

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
just use only 40 troops and then after

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.600 
just use only 40 troops and then after
that<00:03:58.930> I<00:03:58.990> can<00:03:59.230> just<00:03:59.410> keep<00:03:59.530> doing<00:03:59.860> the<00:04:00.040> risk<00:04:00.250> over

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
that I can just keep doing the risk over

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.460 
that I can just keep doing the risk over
and<00:04:00.730> over<00:04:01.000> and<00:04:01.120> over<00:04:01.450> again<00:04:01.570> rather<00:04:02.200> than

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
and over and over again rather than

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.060 
and over and over again rather than
using<00:04:02.680> all<00:04:02.980> my<00:04:03.220> troops<00:04:03.460> of<00:04:04.440> 210<00:04:05.440> slots<00:04:05.890> for

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
using all my troops of 210 slots for

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.940 
using all my troops of 210 slots for
example<00:04:06.550> and<00:04:06.880> then<00:04:07.300> I<00:04:07.420> was<00:04:07.630> abused<00:04:07.990> 210<00:04:08.650> source

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
example and then I was abused 210 source

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.130 
example and then I was abused 210 source
of<00:04:09.070> my<00:04:09.190> troops<00:04:09.520> I<00:04:09.730> have<00:04:10.000> to<00:04:10.150> wait<00:04:10.390> for<00:04:10.720> a<00:04:10.750> few

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
of my troops I have to wait for a few

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.590 
of my troops I have to wait for a few
minutes<00:04:11.950> for<00:04:12.160> them<00:04:12.280> to<00:04:12.400> be<00:04:12.490> cooked<00:04:12.700> so<00:04:13.240> I

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
minutes for them to be cooked so I

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.270 
minutes for them to be cooked so I
rather<00:04:13.780> do<00:04:14.080> those<00:04:14.290> kind<00:04:14.560> of<00:04:14.590> low<00:04:14.800> resources

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
rather do those kind of low resources

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.910 
rather do those kind of low resources
but<00:04:15.700> also<00:04:15.910> those<00:04:16.450> kind<00:04:16.810> of<00:04:16.959> retreats<00:04:17.590> wherever

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
but also those kind of retreats wherever

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.680 
but also those kind of retreats wherever
I<00:04:17.950> don't<00:04:18.280> have<00:04:18.430> to<00:04:18.520> use<00:04:18.640> all<00:04:18.790> my<00:04:18.970> troops<00:04:19.209> like

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
I don't have to use all my troops like

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.030 
I don't have to use all my troops like
this<00:04:19.840> particular<00:04:20.109> one<00:04:20.440> I'm<00:04:20.590> gonna<00:04:20.739> show<00:04:20.950> you

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
this particular one I'm gonna show you

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.950 
this particular one I'm gonna show you
guys<00:04:21.250> although<00:04:21.580> the<00:04:21.700> loot<00:04:21.970> is<00:04:22.150> way<00:04:22.450> lesser

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
guys although the loot is way lesser

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.440 
guys although the loot is way lesser
than<00:04:23.080> the<00:04:23.260> previous<00:04:23.710> raid<00:04:23.950> that<00:04:24.160> just<00:04:24.430> did<00:04:24.700> but

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
than the previous raid that just did but

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.100 
than the previous raid that just did but
then<00:04:25.690> the<00:04:25.840> resources<00:04:26.260> there<00:04:26.470> so

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
then the resources there so

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.809 
then the resources there so
you<00:04:27.169> get<00:04:27.500> I<00:04:27.680> mean<00:04:27.710> they're<00:04:28.039> just<00:04:28.069> behind<00:04:28.639> this

00:04:28.809 --> 00:04:28.819 
you get I mean they're just behind this

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:31.929 
you get I mean they're just behind this
but<00:04:28.969> declare<00:04:29.330> war<00:04:29.659> and<00:04:29.930> once<00:04:30.439> my<00:04:30.860> giant<00:04:31.520> and<00:04:31.849> my

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:52.219 
using my clan castle it's really not a

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:54.550 
using my clan castle it's really not a
big<00:04:52.490> deal<00:04:52.550> because<00:04:52.879> after<00:04:53.479> every<00:04:53.840> 15<00:04:54.289> minutes

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
big deal because after every 15 minutes

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.040 
big deal because after every 15 minutes
I<00:04:54.889> would<00:04:55.490> be<00:04:55.610> able<00:04:55.699> to<00:04:55.789> request<00:04:56.150> again<00:04:56.539> and<00:04:56.960> of

00:04:58.899 --> 00:04:58.909 
course in plain castle is better because

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:01.119 
course in plain castle is better because
