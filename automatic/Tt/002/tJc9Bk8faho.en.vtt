film it's incredible in many ways I

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.819 
film it's incredible in many ways I
think<00:00:49.239> something<00:00:49.629> would<00:00:49.719> be<00:00:50.469> excitement

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
think something would be excitement

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.610 
think something would be excitement
about<00:00:51.160> being<00:00:51.309> a<00:00:51.489> slightly<00:00:51.730> older<00:00:52.000> CEO<00:00:52.600> is<00:00:52.870> that

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
about being a slightly older CEO is that

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.069 
about being a slightly older CEO is that
you're<00:00:53.739> planning<00:00:54.070> the<00:00:54.370> end<00:00:54.579> game<00:00:55.079> doesn't

00:00:56.069 --> 00:00:56.079 
you're planning the end game doesn't

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.240 
you're planning the end game doesn't
mean<00:00:56.170> I<00:00:56.260> want<00:00:56.440> to<00:00:56.500> give<00:00:56.620> up<00:00:56.739> work<00:00:56.949> immediately

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
mean I want to give up work immediately

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.459 
mean I want to give up work immediately
but<00:00:58.000> you<00:00:58.120> are<00:00:58.329> actually<00:00:58.719> planning<00:00:58.960> you're

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
but you are actually planning you're

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.049 
but you are actually planning you're
actually<00:00:59.770> sort<00:00:59.949> of<00:00:59.980> looking<00:01:00.309> at<00:01:00.489> how<00:01:01.000> you

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
actually sort of looking at how you

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.209 
actually sort of looking at how you
might<00:01:01.180> build<00:01:01.660> up<00:01:01.960> something<00:01:02.559> which<00:01:03.039> has<00:01:03.190> a

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
might build up something which has a

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.760 
might build up something which has a
greater<00:01:03.519> value<00:01:03.730> to<00:01:03.910> someone<00:01:04.300> else<00:01:04.590> the<00:01:05.590> other

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
greater value to someone else the other

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.710 
greater value to someone else the other
great<00:01:06.009> advantage<00:01:06.130> is<00:01:06.670> probably<00:01:07.300> by<00:01:07.509> the<00:01:07.570> time

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
great advantage is probably by the time

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.660 
great advantage is probably by the time
you're<00:01:08.050> over<00:01:08.229> 50<00:01:08.590> you<00:01:09.100> have<00:01:09.310> a<00:01:09.340> fabulous

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
you're over 50 you have a fabulous

you're over 50 you have a fabulous
network<00:01:10.509> of<00:01:10.690> people<00:01:11.050> you<00:01:11.410> don't<00:01:11.740> have<00:01:12.070> that

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
network of people you don't have that

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.609 
network of people you don't have that
network<00:01:12.789> until<00:01:13.149> your<00:01:13.330> order<00:01:13.750> and<00:01:13.929> you<00:01:14.440> don't
