00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.440
 the three-pointed star in the middle of 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.440
 the voluminous grill 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.980
 the long hood certainly a Mercedes 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.290
 is about the new model of the slk series 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.830
 the long bonnet follows them in a cabin 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.960
 compact and a short back part the 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.329
 interior is high quality typical of 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.400
 mercedes underscore entries from 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:36.520
 chromed ventilation and seats 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.770
 electronically adjustable 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.650
 to approve this elegant convertible 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.750
 we moved to as bar there lives the 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:47.610
 singer billy von der who for 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.610
 years he drives a mercedes slk 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:58.040
 If I have a SL here for 4 years , 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.790
 first sl here I got damaged in a 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.020
 accident but buy one immediately 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.090
 new 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.090
 I'm a fan of the slk 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.759
 let us be and skillful and also like the 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.509
 new generation of this Mercedes 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:15.509
 convertibles 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:30.210
 It looks the same as mine and has the same 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.210
 color with all the fantastic extras 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.700
 and what back 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.300
 I like let's see now how it 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.300
 behaves 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.520
 neither 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.460
 let's start with the roof 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.790
 as extra the new roof is offered 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:58.320
 magic sky control with which you can 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.320
 let in more or less light 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:07.549
 now let's open the roof in mine you have to 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.340
 squeeze something here here not here 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:15.010
 neither here 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.010
 the roof opens in less than 20 seconds 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.489
 freedom 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:30.440
 SLK love sleep now take a ride 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:34.180
 but we need good music has 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.180
 also a port for ipod 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:44.400
 maybe here or if we're going to play then 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.400
 good music itself 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:54.800
 good music good car forward 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.960
 about tastes there is nothing written but 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.270
 beyond music walk in a 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.940
 convertible with good weather is a 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:06.110
 pleasure also because the consumption of 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:09.380
 SLK norm is relatively low 5 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:13.360
 liters per 100 km very acceptable for a 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.360
 150 kilowatt power car 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:25.480
 those are the data on paper but how 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.870
 the new generation plays in the 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:32.530
 route the behavior en route is a 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:36.120
 little better than my slk but not 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:41.040
 a lot goes well out of the curves it 's comfortable 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:44.170
 magnificent and you can not tell it's a diesel 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:48.780
 when he pressed the accelerator answer 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.780
 quickly very good for a diesel 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:04:02.870
 it's nice it handles well it has great 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:04:05.360
 good stability mine too what 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.640
 I do not like much is the speedometer me 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.840
 like more a big one in the middle maybe 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.840
 be a bit old-fashioned 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:23.960
 one big advantage is the heating in the 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:28.479
 nape like this is a joy to drive without a roof 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.479
 even when they do 15 degrees outside 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.720
 which lets you print Billy the new 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:38.740
 slk generation at the end of the test 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.740
 I would rather stay with the old man 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.080
 soft 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:49.789
 It's very nice, in fact, I would have it 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:52.039
 but I still lack a sales success 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:54.559
 to be able to buy it has some 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:57.679
 details but would overlook one 

00:04:54.559 --> 00:05:02.529
 success meanwhile I continue with my old 

00:04:57.679 --> 00:05:05.350
 slk a single sales success one single 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:08.490
 it does not work is the cava 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.490
 there is nothing
