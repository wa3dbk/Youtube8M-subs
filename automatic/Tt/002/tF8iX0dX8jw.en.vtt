it's<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.680> bit<00:00:40.829> fuzzy<00:00:41.070> because<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.640> hasn't<00:00:41.820> been

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
it's a bit fuzzy because it hasn't been

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.170 
it's a bit fuzzy because it hasn't been
remastered<00:00:42.690> but<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.170> was<00:00:43.620> made<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.070> 1989<00:00:44.789> so

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
remastered but it was made in 1989 so

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.880 
remastered but it was made in 1989 so
you<00:00:45.300> have<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.660> beautiful<00:00:45.989> hand-drawn

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
you have that beautiful hand-drawn

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.119 
you have that beautiful hand-drawn
animation<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.660> DVD<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.170> blood<00:00:49.469> rain<00:00:49.680> there

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
animation on the DVD of blood rain there

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.619 
animation on the DVD of blood rain there
are<00:00:50.250> actually<00:00:50.610> two<00:00:50.789> different<00:00:50.820> movies<00:00:51.420> but

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
are actually two different movies but

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.470 
are actually two different movies but
the<00:00:51.780> combined<00:00:52.199> length<00:00:52.590> overall<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.489> still<00:00:54.059> 90

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
the combined length overall is still 90

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.970 
the combined length overall is still 90
minutes<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:54.899> it's<00:00:55.050> just<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.379> length<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.770> one

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
minutes so it's just the length of one

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.849 
minutes so it's just the length of one
movie<00:00:56.280> still<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.760> I<00:00:57.329> never<00:00:57.780> rate<00:00:58.140> anime<00:00:58.649> or

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
movie still and I never rate anime or

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.799 
movie still and I never rate anime or
anything<00:00:59.160> out<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.460> ten<00:00:59.820> just<00:01:00.180> because<00:01:00.539> it

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
anything out of ten just because it

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.080 
anything out of ten just because it
varies<00:01:01.620> depending<00:01:01.649> on<00:01:02.219> whatever<00:01:02.609> you've<00:01:02.820> seen

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
varies depending on whatever you've seen

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.350 
varies depending on whatever you've seen
so<00:01:03.390> whatever<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.650> point<00:01:05.220> may<00:01:05.460> be<00:01:05.519> for<00:01:05.880> me<00:01:06.060> would

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
so whatever a point may be for me would

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.090 
so whatever a point may be for me would
be<00:01:06.510> different<00:01:07.020> for<00:01:07.200> somebody<00:01:07.409> else<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:07.979> I

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
be different for somebody else so I

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.399 
be different for somebody else so I
never<00:01:08.220> really<00:01:08.400> do<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.939> but<00:01:09.150> for<00:01:09.330> me<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.750> would

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
never really do that but for me I would

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.670
