00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.790
 started and cutting the chicken breast a 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.790
 strips 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:55.809
 I cut before the slices because it is 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.809
 a piece of whole chicken breast 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.260
 this chicken breast cut into 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.260
 pieces now we chop the onion 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.680
 now we're going to cook the rice in a manner 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:39.170
 particular we take the pot e 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:44.060
 we pour the rice a little apology so as to 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.650
 year and cover with the water you need 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.980
 reach double the volume of 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.980
 rice 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.670
 also add a little salt 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.140
 cover and place on the fire and leave 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.980
 cook until it has absorbed 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.980
 all the water 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:15.090
 in the meantime we prepare the seasoning 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.090
 which gives you some oil in the pan 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.410

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.920

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.190
 if you don't like the crunchy texture 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.600

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.630

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.050
 chicken 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.050

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.209
 mustache curry and also reach the 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.319
