give<00:02:42.580> me<00:02:42.670> anything<00:02:43.110> some<00:02:44.110> reason<00:02:44.410> but<00:02:44.980> you

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
give me anything some reason but you

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.660 
give me anything some reason but you
have<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.489> go<00:02:45.610> south<00:02:45.970> I<00:02:46.380> think<00:02:47.380> I'm<00:02:47.590> going<00:02:47.770> south

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
have to go south I think I'm going south

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.640 
have to go south I think I'm going south
they're<00:02:49.330> heading<00:02:49.630> towards<00:02:49.959> armadillo<00:02:50.410> right

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
they're heading towards armadillo right

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.380

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
now because I went north but I think

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.600 
now because I went north but I think
that's<00:02:55.840> just<00:02:56.050> going<00:02:56.140> south<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:56.980> you<00:02:57.340> might

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
that's just going south and you might

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.300 
that's just going south and you might
run<00:02:57.730> into<00:02:57.850> the<00:02:58.330> US<00:02:58.570> Marshals<00:02:59.140> in<00:02:59.410> front<00:03:00.250> of

run into the US Marshals in front of
them<00:03:00.459> I<00:03:00.640> just<00:03:00.850> suggest<00:03:01.239> just<00:03:02.050> running<00:03:02.560> away

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680
