00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:19.820
 The bed is a little face, too. 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.599
 interesting first is that it is all 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.840
 pumpkin crude do not know there second that he 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:30.769
 is the old medicine is the joining this 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.330
 game and gamma includes the ben bang game i 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.519
 I think they are very 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.420
 inspiration to the mega man is was finding 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:40.129
 which was inspired by the sunset riders is 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.470
 so use yours because you failed to 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.540
 Only thing in common with sam childers one 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.699
 factor said in a game of cowboys have 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.670
 enemies that dies with a shot and phases 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.920
 of cowboys I think the guy you fix 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.140
 that the design of this game is pretty cool with 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.760
 the scribbles always well animated 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.159
 looking pretty much like those drawings 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.199
 and old looking posters whether alive or 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:02.780
 dead is a tech style has the unique and 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.210
 attractive but because of some holes 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.770
 In this style he stole the 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.990
 first that the whole game is going on 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.090
 in this single color that takes away some of the 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.400
 personality of the type phases after the 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.170
 desert is cool with style but the stage 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.300
 forest still looks a range of 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.100
 lonely desert with tree in the background with 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.990
 time becomes a bit tiring 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.050
 It looked like a black game boy game and 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.090
 white green black I do not know but I think 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.250
 nice with the characters you're with 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.750
 enough with the background for being blue and 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.790
 some up purple 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.040
 This has a much more 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.900
 game that I liked quite a lot more 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.760
 Unfortunately, the same is not true of 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.950
 little animals they have the same color as the 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.180
 background and worth remembering that they are villains 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:47.060
 is the duckling is evil is the little bird is 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.620
 evil and even the bunny way by them 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.570
 have the same background color as 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.549
 to happen to you ' 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.350
 camouflaged in the middle of the 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.390
 shooting something else that bothered me 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.700
 enough this design is the fact of being 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.290
 all too clear with too much time to 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.780
 game is just sight ends up getting mean 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.330
 tired or I know I'm getting old 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.390
 Too much for this to happen now I believe 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.649
 that my mother spoke max and I think 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.500
 that she was right 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.780
 anyway the game is very pulled to mega man 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.879
 you only give three shots at a time the bar 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.790
 life is vertical is on that side and the 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:21.189
 boss bar sits on the other side 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.170
 family is not until the design of the 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:25.719
 phases remind quite a few separate areas 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.579
 by fixed screens and stairs everywhere 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:29.319
 different platforms 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.390
 this scheme with the wind that neither common 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:37.870
 in some mega man games and up to those 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:40.060
 damn every way they make ram or that 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.920
 They are not so boring but that's okay. 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.769
 the songs are very calm which gives a 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.299
 very different climate until it 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.579
 difficult to explain but I think it's 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.250
 fit the game very well it has a style 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:53.620
 I only really liked them only the one that 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.359
 I find it weird, it's serious. 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.400
 It seems a bit like that song from 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:59.400
 mega man doctor castle willy 2 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:14.219
 O 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.469
 the controls are pretty basic just walk 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:19.200
 Jump and shoot the same megaman I 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:20.999
 I recommend using a control because it's there. 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.189
 I just can not play 2d games 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:25.290
 on the keyboard but if you get the last one 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:26.849
 play on the keyboard and be really happy 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.040
 most of the enemies die with a 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.469
 I shot and I think I'm good as an Elissandro. 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.780
 type whatever I think this effect is 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:35.310
 totally unnecessary here this game 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.650
 There's no need to have blood to stay. 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.780
 attractive could very well be there only one 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.120
 smoke something that you would like 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.489
 good sometimes I think blood is kind of 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.639
 had the charisma of this game but this is only 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.590
 my mini opinion the bosses are not so 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:51.930
 interesting but until it gives a good 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.359
 start fight seems to be very 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.489
 difficult but are not after a few 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:58.650
 attempts you take from letter can 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.329
 seem a little difficult at first for you 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.489
 always die and have to return from the 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:05.129
 beginning of the phase but I know that there are 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.569
 unfortunately they are very short and after 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:09.000
 a couple of tries you can 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.379
 pass from good and nothing impossible yet 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.510
 more because enemies usually 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.069
 knock down bakes that make a living 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.669
 and there are still some weapons to 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.699
 to help 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:20.159
 and this legacy attempt is very 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:22.500
 over power leaving the game up easy 

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:25.139
 but too much difficulty here is the same 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.449
 on the platforms, remembering that thorn 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.970
 they kill the same first again 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.919
 but by far the worst part this game is 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.889
 this one also in the second mello he one 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:37.020
 kind of a trampoline and unfortunately he 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:39.150
 has the same mechanics as those trampoline 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.520
 Exploding Super Mario Bros 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.770
 Sucks that kind of death makes you 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.810
 jump high you can never jump 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.759
 right you need to press the 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.530
 jump and when it's coming out of one spring 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:51.690
 I'm a little complicated, I lost my account. 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:55.400
 of the times that fell because of not being able to 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.470
 use this right drug focus method 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.780
 At the beginning of the game you can choose a 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.580
 between two characters the good guy and the 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.500
 young lady when you take care of you 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.509
 must rescue the girl who has already 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.340
 we are well accustomed but when it catches 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:09.740
 The young lady you must rescue the affection 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:14.030
 on tv, fine, see his animation. 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:16.729
 who is half effeminate iur with the difference 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.889
 it is that it jumps higher and even 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:21.350
 can float what leaves the platforms 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:23.240
 much easier this game she really will 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.009
 good style princess peach of super mario 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.600
 but two bros can not shoot 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:28.310
 running that in my opinion neither 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.169
 so much trouble and that's why 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.960
 She's cool, after all. 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:34.910
 The game is very good but it is kind of 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.550
 drawing style mixed with models 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:39.860
 3d is cool and unique but he alone 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.289
 does not come from the game the gameplay is well 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.389
 influential and needs very good by the way 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:46.550
 I think it's the best aspect of the game 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:49.130
 songs are very cool but nothing that you 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.500
 It makes it hard to pull out again, it's difficult. 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:54.590
 explain but are very good as well 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:56.690
 now the difficulty is a bit weak with a 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.240
 bit of technique you make this game in 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.550
 time bosses are pretty silly not 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.099
 has so many enemies 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.260
 I think that's my idea of ​​the game already 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:08.030
 that happens in the old west but that 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.699
 What annoyed me most is choice. 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:13.159
 of the colors of this game misunderstand how I 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:14.720
 he said it is quite a beautiful and unique but 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:17.300
 it gets pretty tiring after a 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.520
 time she kind of take condensed milk 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.710
 pure in the beginning is Mormon but then you 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.720
 can not take more than so sweet that it is without 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:26.150
 To say that he really judged my sight. 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.190
 but of course not everyone who suffers from 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.620
 this kind of thing only old people goal and 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.409
 every day is closer to 30 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.659
 that 20 is good you can get this 

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:37.639
 game at 3ds mall in the shop 

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:39.979
 your mobile mutants that rotate games and in 

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:42.139
 steam for only two real serious goes 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:44.560
 that you do not have two pillars or 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:48.970
 clean this was today's recommendation 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:48.970
 to the next and saw beware 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.740
 Thanks for watching. 

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.420
 shares with his mother with his aunt 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.980
 Your grandmother with her father with her dog. 

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.690
 bird and who else you find in your 

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.470
 front and short page understands this not 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:04.610
 come to take face book blah blah blah 

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:06.410
 I'm sure they'll ask about 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.710
 review than ever in two days good 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:12.530
 calm on the young pan the video will come no 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.540
 sooner than late never to be such a fuck 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.760
 It took 15 years to leave without 

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:19.750
 equal than for everton to seeing spoke 

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.750
 there until the next
