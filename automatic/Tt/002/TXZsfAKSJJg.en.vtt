00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
next group of tones and we're still

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.920 
next group of tones and we're still
sticking<00:00:05.730> within<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.210> realms<00:00:06.509> of<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:06.660> clean

realms we're not fully American we got a

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.990 
realms we're not fully American we got a
nice<00:01:36.000> blend<00:01:37.189> when<00:01:38.189> we<00:01:38.310> were<00:01:38.400> setting<00:01:38.610> up<00:01:38.820> the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
nice blend when we were setting up the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.660 
nice blend when we were setting up the
sounds<00:01:39.509> moved<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.350> control<00:01:40.770> around<00:01:41.130> if<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.369> if

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
sounds moved that control around if I if

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
of hollow tone when it's set all the way

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.539 
of hollow tone when it's set all the way
full<00:02:05.299> up<00:02:05.479> and<00:02:05.750> then<00:02:06.259> that<00:02:06.439> kind<00:02:06.649> of<00:02:06.740> closes<00:02:07.399> in

difference with this sounds to the Las

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.729 
difference with this sounds to the Las
and<00:04:05.790> is<00:04:05.970> that<00:04:06.209> where<00:04:06.750> we<00:04:06.930> had<00:04:07.079> the<00:04:07.199> DP<00:04:07.590> are

and is that where we had the DP are

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.189 
and is that where we had the DP are
pretty<00:04:08.519> much<00:04:08.699> flat<00:04:08.970> out<00:04:09.209> we're<00:04:09.659> going<00:04:09.840> to<00:04:09.900> dial

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:10.199 
pretty much flat out we're going to dial

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:12.969 
pretty much flat out we're going to dial
that<00:04:10.500> back<00:04:10.560> to<00:04:11.400> around<00:04:11.699> about<00:04:11.879> nine<00:04:12.329> o'clock
