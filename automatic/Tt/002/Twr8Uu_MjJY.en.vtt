00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:19.090
 now how deep and look at this is the 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.520
 mass that we made in the previous video is 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.160
 the cold porcelain mass that gives you a 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:28.000
 little beige with a red made 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:31.869
 in pink and what we are going to do today are 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.620
 molds to go a little lighter 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.840
 I model with my hands but I saw how it 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.910
 they made these molds and coughs and I'm going to pass 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.800
 very bad and was more on the slopes or 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:47.120
 do what we want and serious 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.410
 as it is now we cut it done me 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.840
 came out an earring made they were cropped 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.310
 no longer put it if you want 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:01:00.310
 you see the dragonfly what a funny thing and 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:03.420
 the mold of the dragonfly would be made 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:06.299
 that remains flexible 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.479
 because now I'm going to say how it's done 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.880
 this is a teddy so not appreciated 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.770
 ok but when we need the mass and 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:20.600
 let's take it out, it's beautiful that is this 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:23.979
 of a medium clamp also beige or a 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.630
 lacito or for example these are buttons 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:30.020
 look at what things and status and menus 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.569
 They are buttons for earrings left 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.179
 chulísimo they are beautiful pretty with that 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:39.189
 I'm going to tell you the ingredients for 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.189
 make these molds so beautiful 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:04.320
 Look, it's very simple this 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:06.820
 on a tablespoon we put the two 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.880
 of cornstarch 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.990
 in corn starch 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.500
 Y 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:17.090
 It's transparent silicone 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.540
 because the transparent is better I've 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:26.189
 made with white silicone 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:30.230
 and it's not the same today look at this I'm going to add 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:36.290
 this would be like 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:39.319
 a spoonful I also believe and this what 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.750
 we are doing on the fly look 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.209
 we're doing on the fly and we're going 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.650
 seeing what we need and according to 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:50.660
 also this cap cited what the 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.730
 mold how big they would be if a 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.650
 little bit bigger we have to call 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.549
 be a little smaller we press 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.970
 it's better to look and go around 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.570
 taking cornstarch 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.230
 making the dough more or less like that of 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:11.150
 cool 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:15.500
 but it would be harden 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:19.220
 they stay flexible as I say I want 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:21.939
 it is flexible it is flexible and it serves us 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:25.220
 any little thing to make the mold 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:28.370
 any little thing of whatever it is that 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.420
 want to move any doll 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.549
 any little thing 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:38.000
 look good I will continue because this is 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:41.709
 need a little while I will continue and now 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.709
 Let's go with the next step 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:48.670
 bale is already staying every time we go 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.950
 I already had to throw I put a little 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.140
 more than silicone because there was so much more 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:57.250
 fine I think it's like in a 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:00.490
 teaspoon and a spoonful of silicone 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.380
 for a tiny mold it serves for some 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.050
 how many little ones 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.830
 I'm going to do what I have here because 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.830
 I have not done more 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.879
 when it is already a little 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:18.340
 you see how the mass is almost 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.489
 but still you see there is still a 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:25.090
 little bit of kneading 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:28.349
 to make it softer elche are made 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.349
 with talcum powder 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.690
 go back to coltan this done 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.280
 It also looks great but I like it in 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.780
 a cornstarch tail because there are more 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:42.330
 finer soft I like more with this 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:45.810
 this butterfly 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:49.020
 and I have to do more because it is very 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:52.770
 fast and very fast when we want 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:55.879
 make a file any little thing 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.879
 with very fast 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.720
 let's see if we no longer have 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:04.400
 I think yes, we make a little ball 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.020
 chubby clear so it does not go through the 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.520
 other side 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.960
 I will continue to wash my hands 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.960
 so that it does not give air 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:18.370
 I'm going to catch a little more 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:20.590
 1 to make the pretty 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.139
 I'm going to make the nasa the east that I have 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.389
 here a little bow does not need that this one 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:27.160
 not perfect either because for what it is 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:29.390
 you will see but that is in little 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:34.490
 presentable 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:37.460
 well and now it would be this no matter what it is 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:40.230
 on the one hand man up on the bottom 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:43.710
 for Carlos around here 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.710
 but what are we 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:52.669
 good and now if we let it rest in 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.669
 two or three minutes and now I take it out 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:59.800
 well here I have done some this is 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.700
 I'm not going to take a heart because I 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.260
 comes out 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.260
 look at this from a heart 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:13.210
 this butterfly 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:15.160
 and although damiá accessible flexible 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.680
 this one that has done it already with the mass for 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.870
 that you see how it comes out that the teacher 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.380
 but so you can see what's left after 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:26.199
 cut a little bit what is left and now 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:29.590
 there is only one if you enter well and do not 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:32.150
 missing this is the ugliest and this one that 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:35.830
 we made the appointment 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:38.030
 You see we put the masita you see how it is 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:41.030
 this you do not have to do soon because 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:43.370
 is if it hardens soon molds of 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:48.410
 perfect silicone we already have our 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:50.690
 little bows to be encouraged too 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:54.920
 and look at what a pretty little thing and what 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:57.260
 we do perfect and not time also with 

00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:00.100
 that if you like finger up and up 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.100
 another visit
