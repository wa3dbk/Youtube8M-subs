00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.689
 Goals go to the lake if the champion 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.930
 move away from the disk or time will die 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.640
 disk life will start to decrease faster 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.800

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.619
 rise azer summon sand warrior 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.420
 for the next few seconds 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.700
 when the attack target is my champion 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.860
 appears in the attack radius of the soldier then he 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.930
 begins to attack and instead a lake inflicting 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.909
 damage to all targets along the line 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.740
 at the same time the champion has 2 charges 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.720
 skills that allows you to invoke two 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.210
 warriors almost immediately from the next through 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.039
 some time if azer too 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.229
 move away from the warriors they will disappear 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.910
 their lifespan is halved 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.670
 if they are within attack range 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.470
 enemy tower using one charge 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.989
 rise to the enemy tower azer 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.660
 will sacrifice his soldier and inflict 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:16.060
 increased damage to the structure of the third 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.040
 spell active sand azer 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.440
 moves to one of his warriors 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.810
 inflicting damage to enemies and throwing up 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.030
 them for a short time if 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.459
 Azer on its way meets the enemy 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.470
 the champion he stops and gets 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.380
 shield for a few seconds dependent on 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.420
 bonus health lake 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.670
 Ultimate divide and rule the champion 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.720
 encourages phalanx resistant soldiers who 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.850
 make a dash forward 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.750
 discarding enemies facing them and 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.030
 cause damage 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.940
 enemies will not be able to pass through the phalanx to 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.739
 her disappearance however allies lake 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.480
 can move freely through it 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.420
 getting for a short time 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.549
 movement speed bonus in contrast 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.530
 from warriors skills rise a phalanx not 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.730
 reacts to auto attacks and others 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.739
 spells azera 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.720
 divide and conquer does not stop 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.900
 Ultima you are such champions as nocturne 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.900
 ivy 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.060
 target jumps such as jax not 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.000
 will give a jump over the phalanx but at the same time 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.560
 allies the lake will take damage from skill on 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.810
 Currently Ultimate can 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.960
 jump over flash or go on the lantern 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:21.420
 trash worth noting that the first and third 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.520
 and the ability cannot be used while 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.400
 you are not called at least one warrior with 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.350
 help rise unequivocal emperor 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.750
 width is one of the most interesting 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.300
 champions since the release of sender or 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.459
 even zaire, alas, should not expect from him 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.320
 cosmic damage numbers first 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.600
 turn champion is strong due to his 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.850
 mobility and ultimate Azeri 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.280
 specifically created for team games 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.709
 so I would rather see him in 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.480
 action correctly located ultimate 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.370
 in a narrow space will force to separate 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.980
 enemy team with little or no 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.020
 waste opportunities a combination of the first 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.970
 three spells allows a champion as 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.459
 get away from danger and catch up 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.980
 outgoing goals to our big 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:11.549
 the lake has no separate 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:16.019
 phrases when meeting with the pump though with his 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:17.519
 brother of ringtones he is clearly already familiar with him 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.870
 managed pullover 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.870
 I introduced 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.010
 and besides, the whole trinity has a common theme 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.750
 galactic skins as usual 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.120
 developers keep all the secrets up 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.520
 The last on English-language sites already 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.740
 with might and main there are discussions about this so 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.840
 what stock up patience summoners and 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.120
 get ready to join or
