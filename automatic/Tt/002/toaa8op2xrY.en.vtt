 a few weeks ago the performances of São Paulo seemed more like a comedy movie 

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:10.490
 the three-time champion with difficulties 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.259
 I even suffered to win the tie 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.559
 some games have passed and now what you see is a horror movie 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.279
 but for opponents 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:26.730
 the 'tricolor' after four wins in a row 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.600
 It was dubbed as you're Brazilian. 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.609
 this proves that the supporter is on our side is confident in the work 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.940
 we have to give that same answer to the one who has faith in God of 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.840
 that things will work out I recognized it 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.750
 and some of them rené 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.750
 they erred ugly very scared paulo 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.210
 from the afternoon 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.190
 to participate 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.630
 paulo we are looking for if you enter the matches 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.110
 the character in the movie series Friday the 13th 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.600
 gave the impression that he was dead 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.930
 but he appeared alive then frightening everyone 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.930
 what is it 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.190
 how are you paulo 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.120
 that even with one more bad start of season returns to be alive in the fight 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.290
 by the Brazilian title 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.450
 there is still some other similarity between são paulo and the right 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.680
 each letter of the character's name 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.290
 symbolizes the months that são paulo usually grows in the brazilian championship 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.990
 August September October 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.200
 in November 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.200
 It's good to be scared of what this is. 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.250
 the technical team ricardo gomes is only in the second month of his bench in the 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.930
 al 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.999
 The Difference For The Palm Trees Leader 

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:46.100
 dropped to seven points after the victory over botafogo 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.940
 little more than three months to the end of the Brazilian 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.980
 the smile turned to apprehension other opponents 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.100
 The team is back
