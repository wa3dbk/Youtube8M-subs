just wipe it all over my clean skin and
leave<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.360> now<00:01:18.840> it<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.590> be<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.860> little<00:01:19.979> bit

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
leave it now it can be a little bit

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.030 
leave it now it can be a little bit
drying<00:01:20.490> so<00:01:21.000> maybe<00:01:21.990> for<00:01:22.229> those<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.830> who

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
drying so maybe for those of you who

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.149 
drying so maybe for those of you who
have<00:01:23.280> dry<00:01:24.060> skin<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.990> won't<00:01:25.320> be<00:01:25.500> able<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.860> bear

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
have dry skin you won't be able to bear

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.060 
have dry skin you won't be able to bear
it<00:01:26.220> as<00:01:26.580> well<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.840> can<00:01:28.140> put<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.770> moisturizer

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
it as well so you can put a moisturizer

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.030 
it as well so you can put a moisturizer
over<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.939> but<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.450> would<00:01:30.900> advise<00:01:31.350> against<00:01:31.860> that

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
over it but I would advise against that

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.280 
over it but I would advise against that
because<00:01:32.430> it's<00:01:32.939> best<00:01:33.210> if<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.600> just<00:01:33.630> leave<00:01:34.049> it

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
because it's best if you just leave it

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.830 
because it's best if you just leave it
on<00:01:34.439> its<00:01:35.310> own<00:01:35.490> without<00:01:35.729> any<00:01:36.060> moisturizer<00:01:36.420> for

it to do its job now it's contains

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.499 
it to do its job now it's contains
glycolic<00:01:39.930> acid<00:01:40.380> which<00:01:40.650> basically<00:01:41.189> works<00:01:42.119> to

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
glycolic acid which basically works to

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.630
