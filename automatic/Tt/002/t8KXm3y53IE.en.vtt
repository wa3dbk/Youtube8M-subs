give you a quick rundown on this new
mesh<00:00:04.650> head<00:00:04.950> that<00:00:05.220> I've<00:00:05.400> had<00:00:05.640> the<00:00:05.790> guys<00:00:05.970> using

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
mesh head that I've had the guys using

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.799 
mesh head that I've had the guys using
for<00:00:06.839> lessons<00:00:07.379> for<00:00:08.160> last<00:00:08.370> few<00:00:09.000> got<00:00:09.540> a<00:00:09.570> few

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
for lessons for last few got a few

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.890 
for lessons for last few got a few
months<00:00:10.050> ago<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:10.849> I'm<00:00:11.849> really<00:00:11.910> diggin<00:00:12.450> it<00:00:12.540> just

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
months ago and I'm really diggin it just

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.530 
months ago and I'm really diggin it just
a<00:00:13.230> quick<00:00:13.530> rundown<00:00:13.830> first<00:00:14.340> of<00:00:14.490> all<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:15.360> big

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
a quick rundown first of all the big

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.240 
a quick rundown first of all the big
standout<00:00:16.020> thing<00:00:16.350> is<00:00:16.470> obviously<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.010> feel<00:00:17.220> of

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
standout thing is obviously the feel of

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.800 
standout thing is obviously the feel of
it<00:00:17.520> that's<00:00:17.670> what<00:00:17.820> people<00:00:18.119> get<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.359> mesh<00:00:18.600> head

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
it that's what people get a mesh head

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.070 
it that's what people get a mesh head
for<00:00:19.020> over<00:00:19.490> your<00:00:20.490> regular<00:00:20.820> old<00:00:20.880> pads<00:00:21.270> the

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
for over your regular old pads the

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.599 
for over your regular old pads the
artifact<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:23.010> something<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.400> didn't

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
artifact that is something that I didn't

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.790 
artifact that is something that I didn't
think<00:00:23.699> about<00:00:23.789> so<00:00:24.119> much<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.140> factor<00:00:25.500> of<00:00:25.680> the

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
think about so much is the factor of the

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.019 
think about so much is the factor of the
volume<00:00:26.099> it's<00:00:26.189> actually<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.460> little<00:00:26.699> quieter

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
volume it's actually a little quieter

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.429 
volume it's actually a little quieter
obviously<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.510> get<00:00:27.660> an<00:00:27.750> electric<00:00:27.930> drum<00:00:28.410> kit

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
obviously you get an electric drum kit

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.710 
obviously you get an electric drum kit
to<00:00:29.279> start<00:00:29.550> with<00:00:29.699> because<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:30.060> volume<00:00:30.390> issues

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
to start with because of volume issues

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.930 
to start with because of volume issues
for<00:00:31.380> where<00:00:31.529> you're<00:00:31.650> at<00:00:31.830> or<00:00:32.040> whether<00:00:32.340> the

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
for where you're at or whether the

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.280 
for where you're at or whether the
practice<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.420> sort<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:33.899> thing

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
practice that sort of thing

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.560 
practice that sort of thing
now<00:00:34.649> pads<00:00:35.280> are<00:00:35.550> obviously<00:00:35.880> each<00:00:36.090> quieter<00:00:36.480> than

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
now pads are obviously each quieter than

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.869 
now pads are obviously each quieter than
a<00:00:36.630> real<00:00:36.809> drum<00:00:37.020> but<00:00:37.170> still<00:00:37.700> there's<00:00:38.700> some

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
a real drum but still there's some

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.700 
a real drum but still there's some
amount<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.210> volume<00:00:39.360> inner<00:00:39.629> wear<00:00:39.809> is<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> mesh

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
amount of volume inner wear is a mesh

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.869 
amount of volume inner wear is a mesh
head<00:00:41.750> it<00:00:42.750> tends<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.170> be<00:00:43.440> you<00:00:44.070> know<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.730> could

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
head it tends to be you know you could

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.610 
head it tends to be you know you could
say<00:00:45.090> eyes<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.690> loud<00:00:45.989> but<00:00:46.200> tends<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.500> be

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
say eyes this is loud but tends to be

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.260 
say eyes this is loud but tends to be
more<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.100> higher<00:00:47.489> frequencies<00:00:48.090> which

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
more in the the higher frequencies which

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.850 
more in the the higher frequencies which
is<00:00:48.390> going<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.600> deaden<00:00:48.989> once<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.710> go<00:00:49.829> on

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
is going to deaden once you go on

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.049 
is going to deaden once you go on
through<00:00:50.129> your<00:00:50.309> walls<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.760> sort<00:00:51.000> of

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
through your walls and that sort of

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.400 
through your walls and that sort of
thing<00:00:51.239> whereas<00:00:51.480> your<00:00:51.600> low<00:00:51.750> frequencies

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
thing whereas your low frequencies

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.229 
thing whereas your low frequencies
you're<00:00:52.530> going<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.770> hear<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.160> lot<00:00:53.370> more<00:00:53.579> you

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
you're going to hear that a lot more you

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.639 
you're going to hear that a lot more you
know<00:00:54.329> potentially<00:00:54.780> in<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.899> next<00:00:55.140> room<00:00:55.260> so

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
know potentially in the next room so

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.770 
know potentially in the next room so
you're<00:00:56.610> more<00:00:56.730> likely<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:57.239> getting<00:00:57.449> away<00:00:57.570> with

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
you're more likely of getting away with

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.240 
you're more likely of getting away with
practicing<00:00:58.289> one<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.620> these<00:00:58.739> late<00:00:59.460> at<00:00:59.579> night

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
practicing one of these late at night

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.860 
practicing one of these late at night
next<00:01:02.250> door<00:01:02.430> asleep<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:03.420> that's<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.750> big

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
next door asleep so that's the big

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.700 
next door asleep so that's the big
factor<00:01:04.260> there<00:01:05.299> obviously<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.479> feel<00:01:06.720> rebound

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
factor there obviously the feel rebound

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.090 
factor there obviously the feel rebound
was<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.310> show<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.640> bit<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.299> comparison<00:01:10.100> to

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
was I show you a bit of a comparison to

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.190 
was I show you a bit of a comparison to
start<00:01:11.430> with<00:01:11.610> if<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.880> was<00:01:12.240> thinking<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.689> you

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
start with if I was thinking that you

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.370 
start with if I was thinking that you
know<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.680> pads<00:01:14.610> rebound<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.570> little<00:01:15.600> more<00:01:16.020> but

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
know the pads rebound a little more but

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.530 
know the pads rebound a little more but
it's<00:01:16.619> it's<00:01:17.040> it's<00:01:17.729> more<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:18.000> case<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.210> just

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
it's it's it's more a case of just

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.910 
it's it's it's more a case of just
feeling<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.990> little<00:01:19.020> different<00:01:19.470> yeah<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.680> might

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
feeling a little different yeah it might

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:31.630 
feeling a little different yeah it might
be<00:01:19.950> marginal<00:01:20.520> but<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:21.000> know<00:01:25.040> as<00:01:26.040> opposed<00:01:26.400> to

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.480 

so<00:01:32.640> that's<00:01:33.119> what's<00:01:33.299> going<00:01:33.570> on<00:01:33.659> there<00:01:34.250> they<00:01:35.250> are

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
so that's what's going on there they are

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.399 
so that's what's going on there they are
adjustable<00:01:36.030> just<00:01:36.360> like<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.600> real<00:01:36.840> skin<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:37.320> you

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
adjustable just like a real skin so you

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.950 
adjustable just like a real skin so you
can<00:01:37.439> get<00:01:37.650> your<00:01:37.850> drum<00:01:38.850> key<00:01:39.150> there<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.630> tighten

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
can get your drum key there and tighten

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.560 
can get your drum key there and tighten
them<00:01:40.020> up<00:01:40.170> as<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.409> wish<00:01:40.909> basically<00:01:41.909> it's<00:01:42.329> these

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
them up as you wish basically it's these

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.780 
them up as you wish basically it's these
sensor<00:01:43.020> underneath<00:01:43.290> there<00:01:43.710> since<00:01:44.430> underneath

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
sensor underneath there since underneath

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.359 
sensor underneath there since underneath
that<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.259> can't<00:01:46.500> quite<00:01:46.590> see<00:01:46.740> there's<00:01:47.310> a

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
that and you can't quite see there's a

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.760 
that and you can't quite see there's a
little<00:01:47.630> from<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.659> crossbar<00:01:49.259> comes<00:01:49.560> up<00:01:49.680> with

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
little from that crossbar comes up with

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.050 
little from that crossbar comes up with

probably<00:02:49.090> half<00:02:49.450> of<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:49.690> fact<00:02:49.870> that<00:02:49.930> I<00:02:50.620> did<00:02:50.800> it

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
probably half of the fact that I did it

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.400 
probably half of the fact that I did it
for<00:02:51.010> was<00:02:51.250> for<00:02:51.730> some<00:02:52.720> buyers<00:02:52.930> that<00:02:53.200> have<00:02:53.380> a

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
for was for some buyers that have a

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.840 
for was for some buyers that have a
better<00:02:53.620> you<00:02:53.920> know<00:02:54.010> driving<00:02:54.310> experience<00:02:54.790> a

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
better you know driving experience a

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.820 
better you know driving experience a
little<00:02:54.940> closer<00:02:55.239> to<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.780> real<00:02:56.320> kid<00:02:56.590> because

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
little closer to a real kid because

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:57.990 
little closer to a real kid because
that's<00:02:56.980> where<00:02:57.130> those<00:02:57.250> guys<00:02:57.489> are<00:02:57.640> coming<00:02:57.730> from

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
that's where those guys are coming from

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.630 
that's where those guys are coming from
neither<00:02:58.420> of<00:02:58.630> them<00:02:58.840> have<00:02:59.110> electric<00:02:59.739> kits<00:02:59.980> so<00:03:00.400> I

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
neither of them have electric kits so I

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.860 
neither of them have electric kits so I
just<00:03:01.000> wanted<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.300> make<00:03:01.420> things<00:03:01.570> nice<00:03:01.840> and

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
just wanted to make things nice and

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.310 
just wanted to make things nice and
comfy<00:03:02.290> for<00:03:02.440> them<00:03:02.620> and<00:03:03.870> other<00:03:04.870> little<00:03:05.200> side

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
comfy for them and other little side

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.930 
comfy for them and other little side
factor<00:03:05.650> it's<00:03:05.769> actually<00:03:06.040> probably<00:03:06.220> a<00:03:06.850> little

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
factor it's actually probably a little

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.110 
factor it's actually probably a little
easy<00:03:07.360> to<00:03:07.660> spot<00:03:08.080> things<00:03:08.410> once<00:03:09.130> you<00:03:09.430> deal<00:03:10.090> with

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
easy to spot things once you deal with

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.210 
easy to spot things once you deal with
your<00:03:10.450> your<00:03:11.049> exposure<00:03:11.380> being<00:03:11.680> camera<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.100> all
