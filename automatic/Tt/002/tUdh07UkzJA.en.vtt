00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.110

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.110
 I'll tell you after the intro 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.730
 Welcome to the new film factory with 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.500
 me as I Ostalb him before the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.000
 Previous videos have already said 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.660
 I'm not alone with the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.020
 film factory but my good friend 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:24.150
 Jonas is also doing jonas and I have 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.570
 For a long time many thoughts made us so 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.179
 because of 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.830
 we do that with the film factory 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.390
 we were for a concept we want 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.970
 Make a lot of new things here yourself 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.470
 and in ideas and ideas collected and on 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.110
 found hey here are really like this 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.850
 some things here that are too small 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.060
 and too little so we have it all 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.580
 packed up name thought over movie long 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.170
 It's a long time and that's why 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.600
 we put you here so fast 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.010
 short formats so different things 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.900
 in front 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.610
 First of all, I want you movie tips 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.020
 I introduce myself for the weekend 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.840
 you three films before the thematic 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.640
 fit together and also make fun 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.140
 to be watched with friends in the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.390
 First , I want you mine 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.880
 favorite films by danish director 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.030
 to present thomas jensen differently 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.130
 all extremely black grotesque and gaps 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.770
 completely crazy we start 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.050
 with adams apples a neonazi becomes too 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.720
 Social lessons in a church condemned 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.180
 where he clear 0 with the pious driver 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.490
 comes and this movie is somewhere in 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.320
 my personal top 50 pretty much 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.900
 rather funny than recommend 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.760
 second in china, they eat dogs , it goes 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.800
 two brothers of a cold blooded and 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.930
 dangerous the other sensitive and 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.479
 boring and the two experience 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.490
 couple of brutal adventures because that's 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.710
 life of the game that changes abruptly 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.390
 when he hits a bank robber again 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.250
 sometimes it leaves a real spit 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.140
 in the movie but just so the macabre 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.850
 gives the film should this special 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.920
 I can only be very funny 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.590
 recommend and as a third we still have 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.030
 the movie danish delicatessen turns it 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.010
 and diane are the operators of one 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.810
 own meat shop where accidental 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.479
 electrician comes to life and sven 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.909
 In the morning, the corpses panic 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.250
 and then every normal person works 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.350
 would make the electrician beef 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.849
 fillets and start the meat too 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.009
 Sell what comes with the customers 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.900
 really really good and speaks 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.110
 around and we already think so 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.530
 can go the cheery mohr 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.600
 Loos definitely recommended in the mini 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.580
 format unloved opinions is about 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.290
 unpopular opinions in the film so 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.940
 opinion of which I believe that you 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.560
 not many people share my first 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.770
 infamous opinion of the crackers or 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.210
 resources mega shark is a good movie 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.520
 you say because the movie is really from 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.170
 many critics were torn and he 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.880
 it is said that the film just not 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.310
 one of the films that are so bad 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.500
 that she was ashamed of everything I did 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.230
 think it's about huge crocodile 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.450
 saurier the won against a mega 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.459
 principle it was that the us military 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.560
 try to stop the two and 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.590
 jaleel white plays with you if you do not 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.630
 but knows Steve Walker and in the format 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.700
 fake news is about news we like 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:00.800
 hear would but unfortunately not the 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.570
 Reality match with the exception 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.330
 from harrison ford, they all do it 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.530
 indiana jones 4 have worked 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.090
 reparation payments to the spectator 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.550
 the amount amounts to the price 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.590
 the movie ticket plus 500 euro 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.780
 Pain Michaela Bay joined 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.760
 a gas explosion in a transformers 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.400
 replica a damage in the frontal lobe 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.010
 in the brain it was completely healthy 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.420
 and has no pain though 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.070
 close ones say he has exactly that 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.019
 be lost in the brain of the part 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.910
 need to make films 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.739
 actress and underwear model 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.230
 Kate Upton decides to enter the porn store 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.390
 to enter the us america has 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.710
 a ten year contract with brothers 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.350
 completed 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.420
 and in pretoria of the week we introduce 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.800
 you various plot wood from famous 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.840
 filming one or the other times 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.700
 ask what the hell is a plot high 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.580
 plateau is nothing but a 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.560
 Logic error within the action of a 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.780
 movie and we start with 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.170
 Butterfly find a famous place 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.000
 in a prison sequence where real 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.550
 coach drivers to convince them 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.080
 Jesus is trying a bit 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.610
 different but that's the only important thing 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.130
 then a time traveled back and 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.500
 sticks out in his hands and as he does 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.480
 he suddenly returns like that 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.000
 lived on the palms and the 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.920
 Inmate believes him every word but how 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.630
 That may be when he is in time 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.280
 travels back and so hands 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.200
 hurt then he would have with these 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.820
 injuries already in prison 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.070
 film must be there so now 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.600
 then suddenly emerge from nowhere 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.190
 but that can not be at all or 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.060
 what do you think writes in the 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.530
 Comments 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.680
 maybe I'll even argue with you 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.080
 because I like to read with that it was now 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.510
 not only with plateau do you run me 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.510
 but also with the first episode of 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.490
 junk what do you think was that was too little 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.870
 We should continue that boring 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.460
 make yet still have so 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.110
 Try it on we really like to stop 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.330
 your opinion I have in any case 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:53.270
 two videos are linked on the left side 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:56.480
 page is again the transfer video from 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.890
 domenico and my introduction video there 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.750
 where I really really quite 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.820
 personally about me and mine 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.280
 I talked about the past and me 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.190
 Hope to see you next time because 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:11.470
 the film factory and this time promised 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.470
 no bad ketch fraser in the end
