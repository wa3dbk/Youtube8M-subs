the camera to focus on this right here
is<00:00:50.280> what<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.539> concave<00:00:52.320> or<00:00:52.559> convex<00:00:52.620> anyway

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
is what is it concave or convex anyway

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.549 
is what is it concave or convex anyway
it's<00:00:53.670> it's<00:00:53.820> bent<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.449> inside<00:00:54.930> right<00:00:55.289> it's

it's it's bent to the inside right it's

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.049 
it's it's bent to the inside right it's
like<00:00:56.210> apparently<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.260> can<00:00:59.010> zoom<00:00:59.879> in

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
like apparently so that you can zoom in

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.040 
like apparently so that you can zoom in
to<00:01:00.120> stuff<00:01:00.510> better

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
to stuff better

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.160

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
and get more detail so that's the macro

with this cap let me just open it for
you<00:01:29.820> guys<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.420> can<00:01:30.450> see<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:31.049> is

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
you guys and you can see this is

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.789 
you guys and you can see this is
slightly<00:01:31.770> bent<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.490> outside<00:01:33.060> right<00:01:33.420> there

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
slightly bent to the outside right there

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.010 
slightly bent to the outside right there
so<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:35.460> basically<00:01:35.670> widens<00:01:36.450> your<00:01:36.509> angle<00:01:36.900> of

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
so it basically widens your angle of

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.280 
so it basically widens your angle of
your<00:01:37.079> camera<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.430> um<00:01:38.790> let<00:01:39.570> me<00:01:39.600> see<00:01:39.869> if<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.110> can

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
your camera so um let me see if I can

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.710 
your camera so um let me see if I can
attach<00:01:40.710> these<00:01:41.100> two<00:01:41.490> actually<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.360> clip

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
attach these two actually to the clip

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.380 
attach these two actually to the clip
itself<00:01:43.490> and<00:01:44.490> I'm<00:01:44.610> gonna<00:01:44.759> just<00:01:44.970> use<00:01:45.210> the

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
itself and I'm gonna just use the

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.760 
itself and I'm gonna just use the
fisheye<00:01:45.720> lens<00:01:45.960> for<00:01:46.170> now<00:01:46.290> because<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.710> think

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
fisheye lens for now because I think

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.160 
fisheye lens for now because I think
that<00:01:47.700> is<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.030> one<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.329> works<00:01:48.600> much<00:01:48.869> better

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
that is the one that works much better

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.620 
that is the one that works much better
compared<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.130> macro<00:01:50.460> lens<00:01:50.700> I'm<00:01:51.479> gonna

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
compared to the macro lens I'm gonna

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.910 
compared to the macro lens I'm gonna
attach<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.079> right<00:01:52.470> here

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
attach it right here

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.980 
attach it right here
remove<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.880> macro<00:01:54.180> lens<00:01:54.329> for<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.570> second<00:01:54.869> and

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
remove the macro lens for a second and

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.459 
remove the macro lens for a second and
bring<00:01:55.229> in<00:01:55.439> my<00:01:55.799> phone<00:01:56.009> where<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.670> there<00:01:57.149> this

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
bring in my phone where is it there this

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.999 
bring in my phone where is it there this
and<00:01:58.520> you<00:01:59.520> can<00:01:59.729> see<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.689> clip<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.170> off<00:02:01.710> to

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
and you can see that you clip it off to

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.130 
and you can see that you clip it off to
the<00:02:02.130> back<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.579> phone<00:02:02.820> just<00:02:03.299> like<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.899> and

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
the back of the phone just like that and

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.080 
the back of the phone just like that and
you<00:02:04.350> make<00:02:04.619> sure<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.430> middle<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.909> your

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
you make sure that the middle of your

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.570 
you make sure that the middle of your
camera<00:02:06.630> sits<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.649> middle<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.069> this<00:02:08.250> lens

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
camera sits in the middle of this lens

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.360 
camera sits in the middle of this lens
and<00:02:08.819> then<00:02:08.910> what<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.119> tend<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.810> do<00:02:09.989> is<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.349> fold<00:02:11.190> it

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
and then what I tend to do is I fold it

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.760 
and then what I tend to do is I fold it
down<00:02:11.580> like<00:02:11.610> this<00:02:11.940> so<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.450> doesn't

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
down like this so it doesn't

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.530 
down like this so it doesn't
move<00:02:12.920> it's<00:02:13.310> kind<00:02:13.490> of<00:02:13.550> in<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:13.730> fixed<00:02:14.060> position

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
move it's kind of in a fixed position

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.410 
move it's kind of in a fixed position
and<00:02:14.690> then<00:02:15.410> you<00:02:15.530> can<00:02:15.800> open<00:02:16.400> your<00:02:16.700> phone<00:02:17.090> sorry

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
and then you can open your phone sorry

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.820 
and then you can open your phone sorry

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.150 
for all the smudges on my phone right
there<00:02:19.270> maybe<00:02:20.270> make<00:02:20.570> it<00:02:20.600> a<00:02:20.750> bit<00:02:20.900> brighter<00:02:21.160> just

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
there maybe make it a bit brighter just

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.180 
there maybe make it a bit brighter just
so<00:02:22.840> you<00:02:23.840> guys<00:02:23.990> can<00:02:24.050> see<00:02:24.380> a<00:02:24.410> bit<00:02:24.560> better<00:02:24.590> and

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
so you guys can see a bit better and

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.840 
so you guys can see a bit better and
then<00:02:25.400> you<00:02:25.550> can<00:02:25.820> actually<00:02:26.060> see<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.860> fish

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
then you can actually see the the fish

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.240 
then you can actually see the the fish
eye<00:02:29.060> lens<00:02:29.330> effect<00:02:29.720> I<00:02:30.320> think<00:02:30.890> what<00:02:31.010> I'm<00:02:31.100> gonna

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
eye lens effect I think what I'm gonna

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.190 
eye lens effect I think what I'm gonna
do<00:02:31.490> is<00:02:31.730> I'm<00:02:31.910> gonna<00:02:32.000> put<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.420> few<00:02:32.510> pictures<00:02:32.960> here

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
do is I'm gonna put a few pictures here

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.280 
do is I'm gonna put a few pictures here
that<00:02:33.980> illustrate<00:02:34.580> how<00:02:35.030> wide<00:02:35.570> it<00:02:35.780> is<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:35.930> maybe

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
that illustrate how wide it is and maybe

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.870 
that illustrate how wide it is and maybe
I<00:02:36.440> find<00:02:36.680> a<00:02:36.830> few<00:02:36.980> images<00:02:37.130> that<00:02:37.400> I<00:02:37.430> took<00:02:37.520> in<00:02:37.790> the

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
I find a few images that I took in the

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.430 
I find a few images that I took in the
past<00:02:38.090> that<00:02:38.330> show<00:02:38.540> kind<00:02:38.840> of<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:38.990> before<00:02:39.410> and

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
past that show kind of the before and

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.930 
past that show kind of the before and
after<00:02:39.950> effect<00:02:40.040> because<00:02:40.460> it<00:02:40.580> is<00:02:40.670> quite

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
after effect because it is quite

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.390 
after effect because it is quite
impressive<00:02:41.270> and<00:02:42.050> if<00:02:42.350> you<00:02:42.470> then<00:02:42.650> have<00:02:43.130> it<00:02:43.250> like

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
impressive and if you then have it like

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.860 
impressive and if you then have it like
this<00:02:43.550> you<00:02:43.730> know<00:02:43.850> you<00:02:43.910> can<00:02:44.000> relatively<00:02:44.690> easy

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
this you know you can relatively easy

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.040 
this you know you can relatively easy
hold<00:02:45.260> it<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:45.650> take<00:02:46.190> pictures<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:47.210> it's<00:02:47.930> not

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
hold it and take pictures and it's not

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.570 
hold it and take pictures and it's not
necessarily<00:02:48.470> in<00:02:48.590> your<00:02:48.710> way<00:02:48.920> you<00:02:48.980> probably

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
necessarily in your way you probably

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.200 
necessarily in your way you probably
don't<00:02:49.850> want<00:02:50.120> to<00:02:50.210> have<00:02:50.420> it<00:02:50.660> like<00:02:51.250> on<00:02:52.250> there<00:02:53.000> all

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
don't want to have it like on there all

showing it anyway I'm gonna attach the

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.170 
showing it anyway I'm gonna attach the
macro<00:03:03.110> lens<00:03:03.320> as<00:03:03.530> well<00:03:03.740> just<00:03:04.520> to<00:03:04.670> show<00:03:04.850> you<00:03:04.910> guys

how that works so putting it on the

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.970 
how that works so putting it on the
mechanic<00:03:10.160> is<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:10.460> same<00:03:10.700> so<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.620> basic<00:03:12.620> screw

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
mechanic is the same so the basic screw

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.040 
mechanic is the same so the basic screw
on<00:03:13.160> the<00:03:13.280> bottom<00:03:13.430> has<00:03:13.970> the<00:03:14.000> same<00:03:14.420> size<00:03:14.720> oops

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
on the bottom has the same size oops

to the phone and you can see as I'm

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.820 
to the phone and you can see as I'm
trying<00:03:25.520> to<00:03:25.670> zoom<00:03:26.060> in<00:03:26.300> close<00:03:26.990> as<00:03:27.350> close<00:03:27.560> as

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
trying to zoom in close as close as

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.500 
trying to zoom in close as close as
possible<00:03:27.860> into<00:03:28.550> this<00:03:28.670> lens<00:03:28.970> here<00:03:29.150> that<00:03:29.300> sits

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
possible into this lens here that sits

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.280 
possible into this lens here that sits
on<00:03:29.630> the<00:03:29.750> table<00:03:29.930> it<00:03:30.709> is<00:03:31.450> much<00:03:32.450> closer<00:03:32.900> to<00:03:33.170> the

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
on the table it is much closer to the

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.230 
on the table it is much closer to the
lens<00:03:33.470> as<00:03:33.770> it<00:03:34.040> would<00:03:34.190> normally<00:03:34.459> be<00:03:34.700> with<00:03:35.120> the

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
lens as it would normally be with the

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.930 
lens as it would normally be with the
original<00:03:35.690> iPhone<00:03:35.870> lens<00:03:36.459> however<00:03:37.459> I<00:03:37.580> found

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
original iPhone lens however I found

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.790 
original iPhone lens however I found
that<00:03:38.240> the<00:03:38.390> filter<00:03:38.750> adds<00:03:38.959> a<00:03:39.260> little<00:03:39.530> bit<00:03:39.680> of

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:39.800 
that the filter adds a little bit of

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.800 
that the filter adds a little bit of
blurriness<00:03:40.459> to<00:03:40.820> the<00:03:40.910> result<00:03:41.300> so<00:03:41.510> I'm<00:03:41.660> not

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
blurriness to the result so I'm not

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.870 
blurriness to the result so I'm not
really<00:03:42.050> sure<00:03:42.170> the<00:03:42.500> macro<00:03:42.950> lens<00:03:43.160> does<00:03:43.580> its<00:03:43.790> job

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
really sure the macro lens does its job

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.610 
really sure the macro lens does its job
here<00:03:44.330> as<00:03:44.390> a<00:03:44.420> result<00:03:44.630> of<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.050> picture<00:03:45.380> I<00:03:45.410> just

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
here as a result of the picture I just

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.949 
here as a result of the picture I just
took<00:03:45.800> you<00:03:46.280> see<00:03:46.550> the<00:03:46.730> black<00:03:47.120> edges<00:03:47.540> in<00:03:47.690> all<00:03:47.810> the

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
took you see the black edges in all the

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.720 
took you see the black edges in all the
four<00:03:48.170> corners<00:03:48.380> by<00:03:48.770> the<00:03:48.920> way<00:03:49.040> that's<00:03:49.250> always<00:03:49.520> an

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
four corners by the way that's always an

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.670 
four corners by the way that's always an
effect<00:03:50.030> you<00:03:50.120> will<00:03:50.240> always<00:03:50.390> have<00:03:50.690> with<00:03:51.110> these

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
effect you will always have with these

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.610 
effect you will always have with these
lenses<00:03:52.459> as<00:03:52.820> well<00:03:53.060> as<00:03:53.270> that<00:03:53.510> they<00:03:53.990> kind<00:03:54.260> of<00:03:54.320> blur

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
lenses as well as that they kind of blur

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.320 
lenses as well as that they kind of blur
out<00:03:54.800> a<00:03:54.920> bit<00:03:55.190> towards<00:03:55.520> the<00:03:55.580> edges<00:03:55.820> of<00:03:56.180> the<00:03:56.300> image

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
out a bit towards the edges of the image

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.600 
out a bit towards the edges of the image
is<00:03:56.780> just<00:03:57.050> not<00:03:57.230> as<00:03:57.380> crisp<00:03:57.770> anymore<00:03:58.220> you<00:03:58.370> know<00:03:58.459> as

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
is just not as crisp anymore you know as

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.190 
is just not as crisp anymore you know as
it<00:03:58.730> would<00:03:58.880> be<00:03:58.910> with<00:03:59.180> the<00:03:59.270> real<00:03:59.450> fisheye<00:03:59.959> lens

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
it would be with the real fisheye lens

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.010 
it would be with the real fisheye lens
so<00:04:00.680> here<00:04:00.860> I<00:04:00.890> just<00:04:00.920> scattered<00:04:01.430> out<00:04:01.550> three

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 
so here I just scattered out three

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.600 
so here I just scattered out three
objects<00:04:03.020> on<00:04:03.140> the<00:04:03.230> table<00:04:03.650> just<00:04:03.830> to<00:04:04.370> show<00:04:04.550> you

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
objects on the table just to show you

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.970 
objects on the table just to show you
guys<00:04:04.850> how<00:04:05.209> much<00:04:05.510> of<00:04:05.900> a<00:04:05.990> zoom<00:04:06.260> effect<00:04:06.470> you

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
guys how much of a zoom effect you

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.120 
guys how much of a zoom effect you
actually<00:04:07.550> get<00:04:07.760> when<00:04:08.390> you<00:04:08.600> apply<00:04:09.470> and<00:04:09.770> remove

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
actually get when you apply and remove

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.890 
actually get when you apply and remove
the<00:04:10.340> lens<00:04:10.520> just<00:04:10.760> right<00:04:11.300> next<00:04:11.540> to<00:04:11.630> each<00:04:11.750> other

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
the lens just right next to each other

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.020 
the lens just right next to each other
as<00:04:12.140> a<00:04:12.170> comparison<00:04:12.770> I<00:04:12.950> guess<00:04:13.130> so<00:04:13.610> you<00:04:13.670> can<00:04:13.880> see

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
as a comparison I guess so you can see

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.790 
as a comparison I guess so you can see
the<00:04:14.180> lenses<00:04:14.480> applied<00:04:14.780> you<00:04:14.959> do<00:04:15.140> get<00:04:15.320> the<00:04:15.470> common

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
the lenses applied you do get the common

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.260 
the lenses applied you do get the common
curves<00:04:16.130> that<00:04:16.430> you<00:04:16.549> know<00:04:16.700> from<00:04:16.970> fisheye

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:17.270 
curves that you know from fisheye

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.330 
curves that you know from fisheye
photography<00:04:17.840> but<00:04:18.020> now<00:04:18.260> as<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.859> lens<00:04:19.220> is

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
photography but now as the lens is

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.370 
photography but now as the lens is
removed<00:04:19.520> you<00:04:19.880> have<00:04:19.940> much<00:04:20.330> smaller<00:04:20.810> field<00:04:21.229> of

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
removed you have much smaller field of

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.860 
removed you have much smaller field of
view<00:04:21.530> it<00:04:21.770> is<00:04:21.799> really<00:04:22.460> quite<00:04:22.790> a<00:04:23.090> drastic

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870 
view it is really quite a drastic

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:24.800 
view it is really quite a drastic
difference

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
difference

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.750 
difference
of<00:04:25.200> the<00:04:25.410> field<00:04:25.650> of<00:04:25.740> you<00:04:25.890> however<00:04:26.220> like<00:04:26.460> I<00:04:26.580> said

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
of the field of you however like I said

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.730 
of the field of you however like I said
before<00:04:26.910> it<00:04:27.210> washes<00:04:27.660> out<00:04:27.810> towards<00:04:28.260> the<00:04:28.590> edges

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
before it washes out towards the edges

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.800 
before it washes out towards the edges
bringing<00:04:29.700> in<00:04:29.820> my<00:04:29.940> hand<00:04:30.150> there<00:04:30.360> on<00:04:30.480> the<00:04:30.600> side

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
bringing in my hand there on the side

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.660 
bringing in my hand there on the side
but<00:04:31.260> I<00:04:31.290> wanted<00:04:31.650> to<00:04:31.740> test<00:04:31.980> it<00:04:32.130> against<00:04:32.490> other

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
but I wanted to test it against other

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:35.000 
but I wanted to test it against other
devices<00:04:33.060> because<00:04:33.870> it's<00:04:34.050> promised<00:04:34.470> to<00:04:34.590> work<00:04:34.740> on

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
devices because it's promised to work on

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.920 
devices because it's promised to work on
most<00:04:35.580> smartphones<00:04:35.820> I<00:04:36.360> would<00:04:36.510> say<00:04:36.660> you<00:04:36.720> can

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
most smartphones I would say you can

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.230 
most smartphones I would say you can
check<00:04:37.200> Amazon<00:04:37.800> if<00:04:38.460> you<00:04:38.580> want<00:04:38.760> more<00:04:38.910> detail<00:04:39.210> on

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
check Amazon if you want more detail on

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.000 
check Amazon if you want more detail on
that<00:04:39.330> but<00:04:39.630> I<00:04:39.660> brought<00:04:39.900> in<00:04:40.050> my<00:04:40.080> PS<00:04:40.440> Vita<00:04:40.680> and<00:04:40.830> you

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
that but I brought in my PS Vita and you

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.160 
that but I brought in my PS Vita and you
can<00:04:41.190> see<00:04:41.460> there<00:04:41.730> on<00:04:41.940> the<00:04:42.060> back<00:04:42.240> there<00:04:42.840> the

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
can see there on the back there the

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.470 
can see there on the back there the
camera<00:04:43.530> doesn't<00:04:43.800> sit<00:04:44.130> on<00:04:44.310> a<00:04:44.340> flat<00:04:44.700> surface<00:04:45.030> and

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
camera doesn't sit on a flat surface and

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.600 
camera doesn't sit on a flat surface and
that<00:04:45.990> proves<00:04:46.470> to<00:04:46.560> be<00:04:46.680> a<00:04:46.800> problem<00:04:47.250> because<00:04:47.400> the

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
that proves to be a problem because the

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.510 
that proves to be a problem because the
camera<00:04:48.120> never<00:04:48.450> sorry<00:04:49.380> the<00:04:49.590> lens<00:04:49.800> never<00:04:50.160> sits

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
camera never sorry the lens never sits

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.820 
camera never sorry the lens never sits
really<00:04:50.880> straight<00:04:51.270> on<00:04:51.510> top<00:04:51.960> of<00:04:52.170> the<00:04:52.350> lens

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
really straight on top of the lens

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.940 
really straight on top of the lens
that's<00:04:53.160> inside<00:04:53.640> the<00:04:53.760> device<00:04:54.000> and<00:04:54.270> you<00:04:54.360> do<00:04:54.630> get

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:54.950 
that's inside the device and you do get

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:57.320 
that's inside the device and you do get
you<00:04:55.950> know<00:04:56.070> you<00:04:56.130> basically<00:04:56.340> have<00:04:56.730> to<00:04:56.850> hold<00:04:57.120> it

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
you know you basically have to hold it

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.240 
you know you basically have to hold it
in<00:04:57.450> position<00:04:57.630> to<00:04:58.140> get<00:04:58.320> the<00:04:58.470> effect<00:04:58.860> you<00:04:58.980> want

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
in position to get the effect you want

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.310 
in position to get the effect you want
and<00:04:59.490> again<00:05:00.090> you<00:05:00.300> can<00:05:00.480> see<00:05:00.690> here<00:05:00.840> now<00:05:00.930> I'm

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
and again you can see here now I'm

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.080 
and again you can see here now I'm
removing<00:05:01.860> the<00:05:02.070> lens<00:05:02.340> at<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:02.580> field<00:05:02.880> of<00:05:02.970> view

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
removing the lens at the field of view

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.380 
removing the lens at the field of view
is<00:05:03.270> much<00:05:03.600> smaller<00:05:04.490> obviously<00:05:05.490> the<00:05:05.910> detail<00:05:06.240> as

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
is much smaller obviously the detail as

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.030 
is much smaller obviously the detail as
well<00:05:06.570> but<00:05:07.050> if<00:05:07.200> that's<00:05:07.380> the<00:05:07.530> effect<00:05:07.890> you're

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
well but if that's the effect you're

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.560 
well but if that's the effect you're
after<00:05:08.340> then<00:05:08.490> I<00:05:08.610> guess<00:05:08.820> this<00:05:09.090> product<00:05:09.450> is

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
after then I guess this product is
