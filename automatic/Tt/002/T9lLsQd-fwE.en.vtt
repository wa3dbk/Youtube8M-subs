clean<00:01:57.680> up<00:01:57.800> i<00:01:57.890> think<00:01:58.100> like<00:01:58.250> two<00:01:58.490> or<00:01:58.610> three<00:01:58.640> of

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
clean up i think like two or three of

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.810 
clean up i think like two or three of
them<00:01:59.030> that's<00:01:59.990> why<00:02:00.170> i<00:02:00.200> like<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.530> third<00:02:00.800> guy<00:02:01.040> so

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
them that's why i like the third guy so

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.080 
them that's why i like the third guy so
what<00:02:01.970> we're<00:02:02.180> doing<00:02:02.210> pretty<00:02:02.450> good

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.440 

here<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.840> make<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.409> stupid<00:02:07.829> decision<00:02:07.859> and

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
here I make a stupid decision and

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.809 
here I make a stupid decision and
basically<00:02:09.450> jumping<00:02:09.989> down<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.349> bottom<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.830> it's

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
basically jumping down to bottom it it's

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.150 
basically jumping down to bottom it it's
not<00:02:12.030> a<00:02:12.090> smart<00:02:12.390> move<00:02:12.510> because<00:02:13.200> then<00:02:13.800> everyone

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
not a smart move because then everyone

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.800 
not a smart move because then everyone
has<00:02:14.400> a<00:02:14.430> height<00:02:14.790> advantage<00:02:14.819> over<00:02:15.510> you

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
has a height advantage over you

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.839 
has a height advantage over you
basically<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:16.800> it's<00:02:16.830> not<00:02:17.280> I<00:02:17.550> wouldn't

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
basically and it's not I wouldn't

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.070 
basically and it's not I wouldn't
suggest<00:02:18.000> doing<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.629> don't<00:02:18.840> know<00:02:18.930> why<00:02:19.050> I

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
suggest doing that I don't know why I

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.830 
suggest doing that I don't know why I
was<00:02:19.200> doing<00:02:19.319> that<00:02:19.590> but<00:02:23.390> here<00:02:24.390> I'm<00:02:24.450> using<00:02:24.569> the

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
was doing that but here I'm using the

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.410 
was doing that but here I'm using the
embassy<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:25.440> hit<00:02:26.040> that<00:02:26.069> one<00:02:26.340> by<00:02:26.519> accident<00:02:26.700> but

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
embassy I hit that one by accident but

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.360 
embassy I hit that one by accident but
I've<00:02:27.870> just<00:02:28.290> figured<00:02:28.500> I<00:02:28.709> might<00:02:28.890> as<00:02:28.950> well<00:02:29.040> try<00:02:29.250> it

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
I've just figured I might as well try it

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.550 
I've just figured I might as well try it
out<00:02:29.519> you<00:02:30.360> know<00:02:30.480> one<00:02:30.959> thing<00:02:30.989> I<00:02:31.200> don't<00:02:31.379> really

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
out you know one thing I don't really

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.589 
out you know one thing I don't really
like<00:02:31.769> about<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.069> is<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:33.180> makes<00:02:33.450> your

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
like about it is that it makes your

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.630 
like about it is that it makes your
radar<00:02:34.019> like<00:02:34.290> jam<00:02:34.650> basically<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:35.400> it<00:02:35.459> looks

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
radar like jam basically and it looks

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.430 
radar like jam basically and it looks
like<00:02:35.700> there's<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.209> ton<00:02:36.690> of<00:02:36.720> guys<00:02:36.840> around<00:02:37.080> you

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
like there's a ton of guys around you

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.339 
like there's a ton of guys around you
and<00:02:37.709> it<00:02:38.130> does<00:02:38.340> that<00:02:38.370> for<00:02:38.549> your<00:02:38.819> opponent<00:02:39.299> so<00:02:40.230> it

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
and it does that for your opponent so it

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.220 
and it does that for your opponent so it
can<00:02:40.470> kind<00:02:40.590> of<00:02:40.709> be<00:02:40.799> annoying<00:02:41.040> but<00:02:42.170> here<00:02:43.170> I'm

and bads to it you know I think it looks
pretty<00:04:30.990> cool<00:04:31.380> but<00:04:31.620> it's<00:04:31.770> kind<00:04:31.979> of<00:04:32.040> annoying

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:32.389

pretty cool but it's kind of annoying
you<00:04:33.389> know<00:04:33.419> because<00:04:34.280> it<00:04:35.280> almost<00:04:35.460> embarrasses

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
you know because it almost embarrasses

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:37.640 
you know because it almost embarrasses
you<00:04:36.630> because<00:04:36.870> you're<00:04:37.020> standing<00:04:37.410> there<00:04:37.470> and

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
you because you're standing there and

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.110 
you because you're standing there and
then<00:04:37.740> you<00:04:37.830> got<00:04:37.949> to<00:04:38.070> wait<00:04:38.220> like<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.610> two

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
then you got to wait like the two

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.180 
then you got to wait like the two
seconds<00:04:39.660> or<00:04:39.750> whatever<00:04:39.870> until<00:04:40.410> you<00:04:40.949> finally

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
seconds or whatever until you finally

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:50.129 
seconds or whatever until you finally
are<00:04:41.340> dead

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.050 

here<00:04:50.740> I<00:04:50.800> can<00:04:50.979> tell<00:04:51.129> that<00:04:51.159> there's<00:04:51.400> an<00:04:51.520> invisi

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
here I can tell that there's an invisi

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.600 
here I can tell that there's an invisi
below<00:04:52.479> me<00:04:52.719> because<00:04:53.169> the<00:04:53.379> dots<00:04:53.620> are<00:04:54.009> a<00:04:56.610> darker

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
below me because the dots are a darker

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.029 
below me because the dots are a darker
red<00:04:57.639> and<00:04:58.319> that's<00:04:59.319> the<00:04:59.499> good<00:04:59.620> thing<00:04:59.680> about<00:04:59.830> the

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.039 
red and that's the good thing about the

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:01.469 
red and that's the good thing about the
radar<00:05:00.340> if<00:05:00.490> they're<00:05:00.669> a<00:05:00.699> lighter<00:05:00.999> red<00:05:01.210> then<00:05:01.389> it

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
radar if they're a lighter red then it

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:02.550 
radar if they're a lighter red then it
means<00:05:01.569> that<00:05:01.689> they're<00:05:01.900> either<00:05:02.020> above<00:05:02.349> you're

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
means that they're either above you're

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.739 
means that they're either above you're
around<00:05:03.370> you<00:05:03.610> and<00:05:03.879> if<00:05:04.060> they're<00:05:04.210> darker<00:05:04.599> red

00:05:04.739 --> 00:05:04.749 
around you and if they're darker red

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:06.390 
around you and if they're darker red
then<00:05:04.900> it<00:05:04.990> means<00:05:05.110> that<00:05:05.229> they're<00:05:05.439> blow<00:05:05.680> you<00:05:05.740> so

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
then it means that they're blow you so

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.350 
then it means that they're blow you so
it's<00:05:06.550> pretty<00:05:06.729> useful<00:05:07.830> you<00:05:08.830> know<00:05:08.999> it<00:05:09.999> kind<00:05:10.240> of

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
it's pretty useful you know it kind of

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.209 
it's pretty useful you know it kind of
defeats<00:05:10.749> the<00:05:10.810> whole<00:05:10.990> thing<00:05:11.349> of<00:05:11.590> not<00:05:12.009> knowing

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:12.219 
defeats the whole thing of not knowing

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:14.159 
defeats the whole thing of not knowing
where<00:05:12.490> someone<00:05:12.789> is<00:05:12.909> you<00:05:13.479> know<00:05:13.599> they're<00:05:13.779> rajab

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
where someone is you know they're rajab

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:15.119 
where someone is you know they're rajab
you<00:05:14.319> don't<00:05:14.469> know<00:05:14.529> if<00:05:14.590> they're<00:05:14.740> above<00:05:14.919> your

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:15.129 
you don't know if they're above your

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:17.159 
you don't know if they're above your
below<00:05:15.460> you<00:05:15.520> but<00:05:15.849> now<00:05:15.969> you<00:05:16.029> can<00:05:16.300> know<00:05:16.449> basically

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
below you but now you can know basically
