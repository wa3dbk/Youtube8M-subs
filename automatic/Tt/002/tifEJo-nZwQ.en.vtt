the<00:00:13.349> very<00:00:13.530> action<00:00:13.799> transport<00:00:14.730> mechanism

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
the very action transport mechanism

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.210 
the very action transport mechanism
that's<00:00:15.599> pumping<00:00:16.049> around<00:00:16.170> your<00:00:16.440> blood<00:00:16.650> as<00:00:16.980> you

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
that's pumping around your blood as you

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.480 
that's pumping around your blood as you

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
molecule that is currently on your

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.690 
molecule that is currently on your
screen<00:01:19.049> we<00:01:19.500> worked<00:01:19.740> out<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.009> very<00:01:20.189> mechanism

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
screen we worked out the very mechanism

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.469 
screen we worked out the very mechanism
of<00:01:20.970> how<00:01:21.420> this<00:01:21.570> protein<00:01:21.930> transports<00:01:22.770> oxygen<00:01:23.479> so

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
of how this protein transports oxygen so

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.080 
of how this protein transports oxygen so
cool<00:01:24.990> let's<00:01:25.619> show<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.189> some<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.640> magic

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
cool let's show you some of that magic

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.090 
cool let's show you some of that magic
that<00:01:27.119> enables<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.840> live<00:01:28.110> let's<00:01:28.680> find<00:01:28.979> the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
that enables you to live let's find the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.819 
that enables you to live let's find the
the<00:01:29.579> heme<00:01:29.820> group<00:01:30.119> yeah<00:01:30.600> it's<00:01:30.810> hemas<00:01:31.650> in

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
the heme group yeah it's hemas in

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.660 
the heme group yeah it's hemas in
hemoglobin<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.600> good<00:01:33.780> graphics

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
hemoglobin so good graphics

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.539 
hemoglobin so good graphics
representations<00:01:35.840> delete<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.049> all<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:38.280> type

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
representations delete the all and type

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.390 
representations delete the all and type
in<00:01:38.729> protein<00:01:39.329> then<00:01:39.720> hit<00:01:39.930> return<00:01:40.159> there<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.250> go

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
in protein then hit return there you go

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.190 
in protein then hit return there you go
that's<00:01:41.729> just<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.210> amino<00:01:42.479> acid<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
that's just the amino acid of the

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.499 
that's just the amino acid of the
hemoglobin<00:01:43.890> protein<00:01:44.310> now<00:01:45.030> let's<00:01:45.240> find<00:01:45.450> that

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
hemoglobin protein now let's find that

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.630 
hemoglobin protein now let's find that
magical<00:01:46.200> heme<00:01:46.500> group<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:47.220> gives<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.610> the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
magical heme group that gives it the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.330 
magical heme group that gives it the
excellent<00:01:48.299> ability<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.840> carry<00:01:49.079> oxygen<00:01:49.340> so

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
excellent ability to carry oxygen so

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.810 
excellent ability to carry oxygen so

that's the iron that's where the oxygen

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.330 
that's the iron that's where the oxygen
binds<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.080> that's<00:02:10.470> what<00:02:10.739> gives<00:02:10.860> your<00:02:11.039> blood

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
binds and that's what gives your blood

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.940 
binds and that's what gives your blood
it's<00:02:11.610> red<00:02:11.879> color

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
it's red color

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.080 
it's red color
fantastic<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.190> now<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.400> can<00:02:14.610> see<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.880> heme

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
fantastic so now you can see the heme

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.090 
fantastic so now you can see the heme
easily<00:02:15.600> let's<00:02:16.080> change<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.709> protein

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
easily let's change the protein

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.890 
easily let's change the protein
representation<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.120> change<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.540> color

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
representation and change the color

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.080 
representation and change the color
method<00:02:19.230> from<00:02:19.350> name<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:20.190> chain<00:02:20.490> and<00:02:20.730> change

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
method from name to chain and change

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.730 
method from name to chain and change
their<00:02:21.270> protein<00:02:21.690> representational<00:02:22.500> from<00:02:22.650> the

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
their protein representational from the

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.940 
their protein representational from the
lines<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.700> new<00:02:24.450> ribbon<00:02:24.840> now<00:02:25.410> we<00:02:25.470> can<00:02:25.680> see<00:02:25.830> the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
lines to new ribbon now we can see the

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.980 
lines to new ribbon now we can see the
protein<00:02:26.370> structure<00:02:26.760> is<00:02:27.180> actually<00:02:27.750> two

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
protein structure is actually two

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.620 
protein structure is actually two
molecules<00:02:28.530> each<00:02:29.130> one<00:02:29.430> with<00:02:29.910> a<00:02:29.940> heme<00:02:30.300> group

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
molecules each one with a heme group

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.740 
molecules each one with a heme group
great<00:02:31.470> so<00:02:32.040> now<00:02:32.220> let's<00:02:32.520> find<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.880> oxygen<00:02:33.600> and

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
great so now let's find the oxygen and

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.170 
great so now let's find the oxygen and
all<00:02:33.870> of<00:02:33.989> this<00:02:34.140> so<00:02:34.770> click<00:02:35.069> on<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.430> HTM

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
all of this so click on the HTM

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.590 
all of this so click on the HTM
representation<00:02:37.110> and<00:02:37.260> add<00:02:37.709> oxy<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.300> then

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
representation and add oxy to it then

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.720 
representation and add oxy to it then
hit<00:02:39.870> return<00:02:40.020> there<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:41.040> go<00:02:41.220> that's<00:02:41.520> the

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
hit return there you go that's the

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.780 
hit return there you go that's the
oxygen<00:02:42.230> without<00:02:43.230> this<00:02:43.440> protein<00:02:43.920> your<00:02:44.489> blood

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
oxygen without this protein your blood

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.400 
oxygen without this protein your blood
would<00:02:45.030> only<00:02:45.300> be<00:02:45.510> able<00:02:45.570> to<00:02:45.720> carry<00:02:45.810> about<00:02:46.200> one

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
would only be able to carry about one

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.550 
would only be able to carry about one
hundredth<00:02:47.070> of<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.310> oxygen<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.330> does<00:02:48.560> as

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
hundredth of the oxygen that it does as

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.199 
hundredth of the oxygen that it does as
you<00:02:49.620> watch<00:02:49.980> this<00:02:50.160> video<00:02:50.340> there<00:02:50.940> are<00:02:51.030> about<00:02:51.150> a
