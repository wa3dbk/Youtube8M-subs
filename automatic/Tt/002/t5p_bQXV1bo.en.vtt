two years and to be honest with you it's
like<00:02:22.770> I'm<00:02:23.770> paying<00:02:24.520> attention<00:02:25.090> to<00:02:26.370> nothing

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
like I'm paying attention to nothing

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.520 
like I'm paying attention to nothing
literally<00:02:28.030> that<00:02:28.360> my<00:02:28.480> hair<00:02:28.750> is<00:02:28.780> talking<00:02:29.350> to<00:02:29.380> me

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
doing so what I'm basically saying is

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.750 
doing so what I'm basically saying is
I'm<00:02:37.210> just<00:02:37.780> gonna<00:02:39.090> let<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.150> just<00:02:41.490> really<00:02:42.490> really

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760

really free form I used to shampoo my
locks<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:50.140> then<00:02:50.770> I<00:02:50.800> would<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:52.540> know

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
locks and then I would you know

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.110 
locks and then I would you know
sometimes<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.560> hairs<00:02:53.800> would<00:02:54.040> be<00:02:54.220> you<00:02:55.000> know

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
sometimes the hairs would be you know

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.430 
sometimes the hairs would be you know
trying<00:02:55.360> to<00:02:55.420> get<00:02:55.570> with<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:55.720> other<00:02:55.930> hand<00:02:56.230> I

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
trying to get with the other hand I

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.590 
trying to get with the other hand I
would<00:02:56.590> kind<00:02:56.710> of<00:02:56.860> like<00:02:57.010> pull<00:02:57.790> those<00:02:57.970> apart<00:02:58.000> or

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600

of<00:03:15.850> it<00:03:15.940> up<00:03:16.120> a<00:03:16.450> lot<00:03:17.050> of<00:03:17.110> them<00:03:17.350> are<00:03:17.530> starting<00:03:17.980> to

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
of it up a lot of them are starting to

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.090 
of it up a lot of them are starting to
Matt<00:03:18.370> together<00:03:18.610> in<00:03:19.320> you<00:03:20.320> know<00:03:20.470> at<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:20.830> root

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
Matt together in you know at the root

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.520 
Matt together in you know at the root
and<00:03:21.340> I<00:03:21.790> really<00:03:22.420> was<00:03:22.600> just<00:03:22.840> like<00:03:23.050> not<00:03:23.410> even

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
and I really was just like not even

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.000 
and I really was just like not even
wanting<00:03:23.890> to<00:03:23.950> disturb<00:03:24.430> that<00:03:24.730> so<00:03:25.800> that's<00:03:26.800> pretty

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
wanting to disturb that so that's pretty

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.710 
wanting to disturb that so that's pretty
much<00:03:27.130> it<00:03:27.489> a<00:03:27.610> lot<00:03:28.060> of<00:03:28.209> them<00:03:28.330> were<00:03:28.450> probably

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
much it a lot of them were probably

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.560 
much it a lot of them were probably
going<00:03:28.959> to<00:03:29.080> start<00:03:29.350> to<00:03:29.500> do<00:03:29.650> that<00:03:29.860> because<00:03:30.570> with

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
going to start to do that because with

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:38.130 
going to start to do that because with
these<00:03:31.810> ends<00:03:32.380> unraveling<00:03:33.220> like<00:03:33.400> that<00:03:37.140> I've

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
these ends unraveling like that I've

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.090 
these ends unraveling like that I've
noticed<00:03:38.800> some<00:03:39.190> of<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:39.430> ends<00:03:40.000> are<00:03:40.090> kind<00:03:40.810> of

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
noticed some of the ends are kind of

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.300 
noticed some of the ends are kind of
starting<00:03:42.100> to<00:03:42.310> grow<00:03:42.610> together<00:03:43.050> but<00:03:44.050> um<00:03:44.350> that's

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
starting to grow together but um that's

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.100 
starting to grow together but um that's

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
last night I didn't grab it at the roots

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.500 
last night I didn't grab it at the roots
and<00:04:01.930> start<00:04:02.380> planning<00:04:02.739> it<00:04:03.010> I<00:04:03.250> just<00:04:04.030> grabbed<00:04:04.390> it

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
and start planning it I just grabbed it

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.920 
and start planning it I just grabbed it
at<00:04:04.690> the<00:04:04.900> ends<00:04:05.650> and<00:04:05.860> just<00:04:06.580> did<00:04:06.850> it<00:04:07.030> like<00:04:07.060> that<00:04:07.540> I

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
at the ends and just did it like that I

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.400 
at the ends and just did it like that I
didn't<00:04:08.500> even<00:04:08.590> disturb<00:04:09.100> the<00:04:09.340> roots<00:04:09.580> so<00:04:10.410> that's

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410 
didn't even disturb the roots so that's

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.140
