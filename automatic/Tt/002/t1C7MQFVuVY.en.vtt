00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.769
 hello dear video game friends each 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.420
 back to retro video game 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.130
 reviews and I welcome you to one 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.740
 new cultivation xing video 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.109
 I was on rebuy and had 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.410
 I bought a few small games around 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.840
 replenish our collection ourselves 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.910
 Now the package is there and what is there 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.830
 's inside I want you now 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.559
 Showing with really good ones 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:38.210
 I play a very acceptable one 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:42.469
 Price we always got up 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:46.079
 Carefully, but then it starts with 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:49.440
 husband ex comment mission for the 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.420
 Unfortunately, gamecube have or is that 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.879
 at all the title in no is not 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.250
 that's the stupid thing about rebuy you never know 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.890
 really from the manne where its off 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.739
 almost the game is complete 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.520
 but in a dvd case I did not like that 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.379
 good 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.970
 but I think I still have it here 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.439
 somewhere around the glasses 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.460
 That's why I'll be lying around 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.260
 swap format 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.479
 Nonetheless, the game is a lot 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.420
 good it is a role play from the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.400
 Megaman Universe and I have it back then 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.369
 had time in the past but had 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.470
 never finish because yes the end bosses 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.900
 In the end you had to quasi in the 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.360
 last sequence all against the game 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.770
 make one sheet at a time and have that 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.750
 I just did not get done because 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.369
 was nothing enough as you said 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.659
 beautiful says otherwise that's what I wanted then 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.970
 try again and again that bitches me 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.780
 until today and now I have finally 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.520
 my comment mission back there and me 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.740
 I'll definitely start it again very much 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.200
 like to play a lot of fun 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.729
 But every British should be two 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.979
 Owners look because there is the thing 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:55.040
 also on it different yes everything completely 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:58.170
 here once my ex we still have 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.850
 then it was for the psp and that was star ocean 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.159
 First pair yahoo 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.009
 finally station I have the second one 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.140
 part of a while even more 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.789
 get welded on ebay and yes that 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.349
 a trick is the first of me yet 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.780
 I completely miss the second one 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.580
 meanwhile on playstation 1 and on 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.590
 psp 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.750
 and that's the first part in the end 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.600
 I am currently playing with a buddy of 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.130
 me the fourth through on xbox 360 and 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.750
 thought myself man you 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.810
 could masters already start 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:30.230
 but then I still have 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.570
 maybe translate the translated to 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.130
 gamble on emulator via super nintendo 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.660
 but I do not have that yet 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.090
 made me and then rather for it 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.340
 decided because here also the whole 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.100
 implemented differently with more 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.120
 speech output and the graphic therefore 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.840
 I chose the psp version 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.080
 decided 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.850
 and that is completely like here too 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:54.770
 really good and I'm really happy 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:56.060
 on it station first couple then if you 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.520
 We do not need a few flyers 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:02.870
 but no one we have something for 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:05.690
 the gamecube namely within 25 impact 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.459
 I love the burnout paradise paradise 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.740
 not so cool now 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.840
 because the open city star also little 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.440
 The burn-out principle has been adapted as well 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.170
 I think 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.930
 but nonetheless I have burnouts 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.120
 1 to revenge will be super loved 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.860
 and part 1 2 I earned at that time 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.959
 and you have hours and weeks 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.730
 gambled for months and then I have 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.920
 told me then come get you part 1 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.650
 and 2 again for the gamecube and l3 and 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.910
 revenge then in effect for the xbox 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.620
 or xbox 360 and that my dear 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.230
 friends is then in the end the second 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.180
 Part of it is completely great 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.650
 You never know rebuy if he does 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.019
 maybe the derivative or so much 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.450
 I have had it all before 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.800
 is wonderful the cds episode needs but 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.420
 as I can see that she can do that 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.440
 endangered spots how can you be beautiful 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.980
 then clean it is the thing 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.260
 no topic really so awakens with it 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.060
 no game has to be played every time 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.310
 I think it's not great 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.340
 as good as 3 and 4 but at least one 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.010
 the hottest racing games on the nintendo 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.680
 gamecube jawoll 102 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.739
 but only collect in it and that is 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.000
 the parliament generation too 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.620
 formerly had then sold again 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.120
 then the price has risen extremely 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.070
 for the game then I have that everywhere 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.120
 I was looking for too expensive and 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.760
 now I have the right to a good 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.150
 reasonable price often very cool game 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.669
 although many do not like it 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.710
 I think the game is great, I think that 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.910
 graphic superstar damage tinker i 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.820
 at that time even the story was complete 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.190
 played through was really good 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.380
 for me on a level with the n64 on 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.960
 the n64 what the terms and 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:43.080
 multiplayer here again on the 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.470
 screenshots of the multiplayer is absolute 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.240
 timeless as with just about everyone 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.500
 bombing but this is really 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.970
 also so good that you can do it in the quiet 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.789
 can play adventure mode and that 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:00.240
 Also here really complete super good 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:01.949
 once generation for the nintendo 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.750
 gamecube years 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:05.370
 so that was her, that was the four of them 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.020
 I bought the games but the ones I bought 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.979
 make the bag is empty 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:15.780
 I'll show you three times gamecube again 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:17.970
 and once I paid for playstation 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.949
 about when I have the shipment with you 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.830
 einrechne just under 40 euros 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:27.539
 but this is mainly due to station 13 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:29.729
 megaman 10 moment 13 and I think so 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:31.080
 a 70 euro cost so come about 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:34.680
 We then paid for the price 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:37.410
 I find reasonable because I that 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:40.169
 here only for 20 30 euro seen 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.729
 have mediatex have eternal 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:43.139
 no longer found on the gamecube 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:45.210
 otherwise on playstation 2 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.039
 Bomberman as I said that the price 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.409
 the land continues to rise 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:50.699
 25 to 30 euros now I was glad that 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:52.050
 it back under the fifteen food 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:55.169
 border I fell immediately 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:56.580
 accessed and burnout 247 euro monument 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.580
 you can not go wrong for that 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.380
 gamecube version yes a new game from 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.090

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.770

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.320
 totally cool or where they say the says 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.940

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.330
