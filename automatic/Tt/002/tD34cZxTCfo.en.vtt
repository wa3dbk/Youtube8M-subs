00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:05.320
 Welcome back last Plame Euro while the hunt is anything 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:07.230
 will continue 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.099
 who will first talk to you about some of the suggestions made to Mirko 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:17.490
 To make the excuse would be useful, such as me something mean to 

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:18.710
 provide 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.429
 at the moment what am I selling what can i do why are you actually lying there dreaming 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:27.169
 what can i sell and sometimes i need to sell urgently 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.220
 what do I have everything? 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.400
 there's the bad Marko 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.400
 his inventory had not been cleared 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.830
 No, that will be Norbert again, that will be a record in a row 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.750
 yes, I guess probably 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:44.680
 Na Na Na Na 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.930
 b more not so bad 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.980
 where we wait again 24 hours 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.230
 because we need a lot of money for painter potions and then 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.050
 I will not forget that, too 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.210
 then we will lose our bounty 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.700
 we will bounty a lot 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.239
 but only one head 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.490
 and that does not fit together 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.410
 and that's why we want to get rid of that after about 50 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.770
 OMV percent of Maze was not 50 years train already many 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.070
 so had the news that ore 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.160
 parking spot 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.370
 the demand of me here is really thinking 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.100
 see if I can come up with it 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.670
 Let's hope so 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.480
 Juggling a bit with numbers and selling things is not so bad 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.230
 then that da-nos will be yes 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.720
 so i think i'm out of the few things not selling 30th 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.220
 tractor driver 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.220
 yes, logically 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.070
 H 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.300
 the nearer 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.850
 there was still his colleague was 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.420
 and 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.420
 yes, yes, I needed western ones 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.460
 that's already day 76 "You have to imagine that 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.689
 Neptune Meppen 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:14.539
 ordered should be without a trace 

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:18.269
 if that is going on now and we are ready to cook 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.410
 I completely forgot to clear a mental but I'm sorry 

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:26.119
 I forgot it and Switch can not go that way so I do that 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:28.769
 now just as fast as possible 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.249
 you come away 

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:32.449
 you're unlucky, too 

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:33.709
 Warnatzsch 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.679
 when that special did not go there constantly 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:39.979
 the first prince pair enchantment this ax has 

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:42.309
 that is always when you hit 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:45.709
 The next blow hits even stronger 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.709
 that is i know i like the concept 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:53.899
 that can be sold in the quiet 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:56.519
 become 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.479
 and what else am I left in the pits here? 

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:02.479
 ARZ that can 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.239
 i would say i am already considered a nanny mental few things so far 

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:11.389
 Schürmann who really did not need 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:13.289
 currently again 

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:15.159
 and 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:16.379
 the more 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.379
 first a winner intervention 

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:26.579
 or No Poland more urgently roused the oh so to the camp 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.129
 No, that would not be so great Hansi liter into the game, of course 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.439
 Zion would have to take me to Mulack Tormo 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:36.439
 Marga once not guilty 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.129
 after months was 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.950
 Naturally 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.089
 The man was right, the man was right 

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:45.659
 and we want 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.139

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:48.669
 Ockert Kokott 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:51.669
 Dr fact I survived it 

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:54.629
 and we will go first 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.739
 where to rip the network 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.739
 That's a good question 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.039
 so we stood out as the very first Knox subway No, that may not be the result 

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:08.259
 Sense Jule exercise 

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:11.679

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.389
 Can you tell yourself if I had in my head right now? 

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:34.029
 First of all we go to the cavern southwall because there it will be 

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:35.909

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:41.599
 and here I can 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:46.330
 I got the hint that it works if you do not see the guild 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.330
 has joined times to see if it is true 

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:54.819
 yes you do not have the dialogue yet 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:57.819
 the assured 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.889
 it is strange 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.490
 okay we'll join Adidas at or 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:16.289

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.650
 Now I have the dialogues option a bounty view poor now 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.490
 I never can not 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:27.310
 OK 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.900
 I was once again "wrong information" 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.140
 So we'll do it all the way, how big is our head? Money 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:37.360
 800 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.930
 yes Lünen what will I do 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:48.900
 more Espelkamp daily there is not going on at the moment 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:59.840
 but with that I let myself become like for the same reasons 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.449
 and their failing that I once again something was planned was not done 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:06.210
 have 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.230
 and blame for that we all know and there we agree that is 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:11.599
 Type 

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:13.789
 Euro increase 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:16.689
 I pay 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:19.119
 Kanzian have money 

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:22.119
 Specialist only to me to store 

00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:27.030
 that's the way 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:31.940
 It's not that bad. Actually, that's all bad 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.409
 actually not again just because they just now 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:39.400
 the sudden with a Porsche to the fortress of the moon moth legion 

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:40.469
 somewhere 

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:41.520
 becomes the DAX 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.069
 stolen 

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.759
 the stolen goods that one finds with me 

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:47.249
 sat forward 

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:51.110
 and this is the place where he will be brought back to the AHS 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.219
 then I can take off your co-star at the same time 

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:56.509
 and Sun 

00:06:56.509 --> 00:06:59.569
 do something that should already have done long ago 

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:02.469
 namely my attributes 

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:05.469
 Moment to see it 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.619
 my attributes here look at that but also from 

00:07:10.619 --> 00:07:12.159
 to heal again 

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:15.439
 yes attributes as created 

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:18.439
 that didn `t work 

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:23.479
 and that was okay 

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:28.840
 but now all our stuff is gone but somewhere there has to be life today and this 

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.370
 Brucker lays out stuff so gray within Nicholas Davis title for you 

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.050
 rank 

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:38.080
 somewhere here 

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:41.449
 somewhere here lies the stuff in a chest with evidence 

00:07:41.449 --> 00:07:42.909
 if I had to 

00:07:42.909 --> 00:07:45.499
 where exactly is this is clear 

00:07:45.499 --> 00:07:47.009
 Ockert 

00:07:47.009 --> 00:07:49.520
 starts again yes there it is 

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.270
 were isolated 

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.270
 Just place this tour on 

00:07:57.389 --> 00:08:00.110
 tweet True North users ear 

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.860
 that makes sense 

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:03.379
 OK
