00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 good morning with you i am olga platonov 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.049
 bad mood today we 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.690
 let's talk about the most beloved flower of all 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.059
 gardeners and hydrangeas and how her 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.160
 properly cut 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:17.580
 Before you come to the bush you need to understand 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.949
 what sort of hydrangea do you have in the garden 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.070
 first class hydrangea oak forest 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.710
 and large-stalks you, they form 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.930
 flower buds on shoots last year 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.269
 so you know you cut them 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.079
 can not be only if the twig broke 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.640
 But if we face izia map 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.040
 tree as in my case 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.739
 or paniculata then it is pruned early 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.129
 spring unfortunately this bush 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.980
 launched so he can also somehow 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.489
 help now trim we will do 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.559
 removing only one third of the green mass and 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.399
 Of course the old with the answer 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:01.620
 so it is necessary to cut the branch we remove the 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.489
 well-developed escape should try 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.220
 leave 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.100
 at least two thirds of the bush because already 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.409
 sap flow happened taste develops 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.409
 he cannot be seriously injured 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.340
 look at what turned my 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.189
 taste really 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.040
 From the new mail will appear not one but already 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.770
 Two escapes where there were two will be four 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.070
 so soon the hydrangea bone will be covered 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.679
 red and white inflorescences in order to 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.439
 hydrangea felt good her 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:39.270
 you need to additionally sign moisture 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.470
 especially if you grow on us 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.659
 dry place 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.360
 name hydrangea whale rank what 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.280
 means a vessel of water in order 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.130
 keep extra moisture around 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.840
 hydrangea I use this gel kernel 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.909
 i just take it and mix it with soil 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.250
 but to retain additional moisture 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.890
 it is possible to use for these purposes also 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.770
 cover mulch with it 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.899
 especially after watering let your 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.729
 hydrangea pleases you with abundant flowering 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.679
 and decorates the garden 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.679
