change<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:29.040> I<00:01:29.070> believe<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:30.180> prevent<00:01:30.630> some

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
change that I believe is to prevent some

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.440 
change that I believe is to prevent some
of<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.290> cracking<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:32.310> saw<00:01:32.549> on<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.880> lot<00:01:33.329> of

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
of the cracking that we saw on a lot of

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.539 
of the cracking that we saw on a lot of
ipad<00:01:33.840> 2<00:01:34.200> polycarbonate<00:01:35.009> shells<00:01:35.280> in<00:01:35.460> the

ipad 2 polycarbonate shells in the

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.940 
ipad 2 polycarbonate shells in the
corner<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.270> we'll<00:01:36.750> see<00:01:36.930> if<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.079> indeed<00:01:37.560> works

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
corner so we'll see if that indeed works

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.830 
corner so we'll see if that indeed works
let's<00:01:38.670> go<00:01:38.790> ahead<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.090> flip<00:01:39.240> this<00:01:39.390> around<00:01:39.570> to

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
let's go ahead and flip this around to

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.170 
let's go ahead and flip this around to
the<00:01:39.930> back<00:01:40.079> side<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.619> see<00:01:41.310> how<00:01:41.729> everything

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
the back side and see how everything

the<00:01:44.009> back<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.549> can<00:01:44.579> see<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.299> frost

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
the back you can see this is the frost

version<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.320> this<00:01:46.439> case<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:47.280> was<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.490> only

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
version of this case it was the only

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.310 
version of this case it was the only
color<00:01:47.909> available<00:01:48.090> at<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.659> time<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.140> that's

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
color available at the time so that's

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.200 
color available at the time so that's
what<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.530> ordered<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.490> can<00:01:50.670> see<00:01:50.909> that<00:01:50.939> it

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
what I ordered but you can see that it

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.270 
what I ordered but you can see that it
has<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.360> nice<00:01:51.659> frosted<00:01:52.380> look<00:01:52.590> you<00:01:52.799> can<00:01:52.950> still

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
has a nice frosted look you can still

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.550 
has a nice frosted look you can still
see<00:01:53.520> all<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:54.060> Apple<00:01:54.450> logos<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.140> everything

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
as needed now it does have a little bit

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.530 
as needed now it does have a little bit
of<00:01:58.409> branding<00:01:59.100> right<00:01:59.310> there<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.000> doesn't

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
of branding right there and that doesn't

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.510 
of branding right there and that doesn't
bother<00:02:00.570> me<00:02:00.810> too<00:02:01.110> much<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.469> actually<00:02:01.619> blends<00:02:02.189> in

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
bother me too much it actually blends in

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.359 
bother me too much it actually blends in
pretty<00:02:03.090> naturally<00:02:03.750> here<00:02:03.990> with<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.380> case<00:02:04.619> some

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
pretty naturally here with the case some

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.670 
pretty naturally here with the case some
might<00:02:05.579> not<00:02:05.939> prefer<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.659> but<00:02:06.930> for<00:02:07.439> me<00:02:07.530> it's

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
might not prefer that but for me it's

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.619 
might not prefer that but for me it's
not<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.890> big<00:02:08.069> deal<00:02:08.099> if<00:02:08.520> we<00:02:08.970> take<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.179> look<00:02:09.300> right

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
not a big deal if we take a look right

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.420 
not a big deal if we take a look right
down<00:02:09.750> here<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.200> can<00:02:10.379> see<00:02:10.649> there<00:02:11.039> is<00:02:11.250> you're

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
and what I really like about this case

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.940 
and what I really like about this case
is<00:02:14.670> your<00:02:15.120> speaker<00:02:15.630> is<00:02:15.810> fully<00:02:16.230> protected

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
sound so they've done pretty much 141

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.740 
sound so they've done pretty much 141

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
might be a potential issue for you I

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.080 
might be a potential issue for you I
haven't<00:02:57.450> experienced<00:02:58.110> it<00:02:58.200> yet<00:02:58.880> along<00:02:59.880> the

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
haven't experienced it yet along the

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.480 
haven't experienced it yet along the
back<00:03:00.270> right<00:03:01.050> along<00:03:01.410> that<00:03:01.590> hinge<00:03:01.890> area<00:03:02.100> this<00:03:02.430> is

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
back right along that hinge area this is

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.490 
back right along that hinge area this is
the<00:03:02.850> smart<00:03:03.180> cover<00:03:03.390> lock<00:03:03.660> I<00:03:03.690> was<00:03:03.990> talking<00:03:04.410> about

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
the smart cover lock I was talking about

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.480 
the smart cover lock I was talking about
so<00:03:05.220> it<00:03:05.340> will<00:03:05.490> cover<00:03:05.790> that<00:03:06.120> hinge<00:03:06.690> area<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.530> the

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
so it will cover that hinge area and the

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.550 
so it will cover that hinge area and the
area<00:03:08.520> that<00:03:08.970> is<00:03:09.030> exposed<00:03:09.540> is<00:03:09.870> where<00:03:10.110> it<00:03:10.260> kind<00:03:10.440> of

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
area that is exposed is where it kind of

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.500 
area that is exposed is where it kind of
flips<00:03:10.860> back<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.550> allow<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:11.850> to<00:03:12.030> open<00:03:12.330> up<00:03:12.450> your

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
flips back to allow you to open up your

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.410 
flips back to allow you to open up your
smart<00:03:12.930> cover<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.410> there's<00:03:13.830> a<00:03:13.920> very<00:03:14.070> small<00:03:14.760> gap

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
smart cover and there's a very small gap

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.199 
smart cover and there's a very small gap
there<00:03:15.750> so<00:03:16.020> I<00:03:16.050> really<00:03:16.530> like<00:03:16.710> that<00:03:16.950> when<00:03:17.700> we<00:03:17.820> open

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
there so I really like that when we open

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.340 
there so I really like that when we open
this<00:03:18.360> up<00:03:18.680> it<00:03:19.680> is<00:03:20.310> going<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.850> fold<00:03:21.120> flat<00:03:21.959> up

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
this up it is going to fold flat up

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.560 
this up it is going to fold flat up
against<00:03:22.800> the<00:03:22.920> back<00:03:23.100> and<00:03:23.370> no<00:03:24.180> there's<00:03:24.420> no

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
against the back and no there's no
