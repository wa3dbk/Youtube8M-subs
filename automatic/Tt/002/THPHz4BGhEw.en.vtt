00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 and in our artistic arts space 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.020
 crafts we will welcome you to 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.320
 laura paterson as it is thanks very 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:15.450
 well thank you very kind I see that you have 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:19.650
 something very romantic tender divine 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.410
 colors and style is your style is it yes 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.390
 I practice very apastelados colors that 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.840
 be very soft tones are in that the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.210
 color I like but one is already like 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.239
 the young for the extra part in 500 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.090
 good the aura that will show us monkey 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.010
 What I brought you today is a tray that 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.280
 It has a resin finish 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.200
 liquid is not a decoupage which is good 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.120
 I want to tell you first that it's a 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.710
 basic coupage well that is where the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.610
 plastics working on napkins 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.310
 of paper of which what I do is 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.950
 tear with fingers 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.440
 and do not cut with scissors because it's because 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.830
 note the cut the idea of ​​decoupage is 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.630
 that this really looks like it's 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:05.690
 painted beige and if it would not be a collage 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.630
 as we tear by the contour of the 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.000
 napkin does not have to be very verbose 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.290
 because with everything we started to pass the 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.250
 napkin 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.250
 we continue I brought some to this portal 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.270
 this is my lowered paper we have in 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.320
 Note that the napkins are very 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.390
 finite 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:33.370
 in three layers we have the design layer 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.350
 which is the one we're going to work with and 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.320
 two others that come off postpone it 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.930
 both together but they usually come out 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:44.250
 of some good as we're going to do 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:48.040
 this decoupage usually we use bases 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:52.390
 clear white clear white old tones 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.880
 very apastelados because if not the 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.070
 napkin does not have the sharpness that should 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.380
 have when others look at it clearly what 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.729
 that we are going to use is an adhesive for 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:06.640
 recover we take a sticker 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:09.429
 fundamental that it be for wood of my 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.500
 different kinds of adhesives but in 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.830
 this case for wood we tell you that 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.780
 the stickers are created airplanes 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.760
 they are all exactly free of them 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.760
 creation products creations well 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:27.060
 we start from the center towards the edges and 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.830
 well, what we do is a little 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.830
 brushstroke after another 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:36.190
 and we're going to start hitting like it's a 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:40.030
 adhesive varnish and allows us double 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.430
 that is , it's going to hit and it's going 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.540
 to give a slight protection of course 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.840
 that the final protection varnish sides 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.900
 once this is well stuck I will 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.379
 what I did was very soft because 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.329
 we work with a very thin piece of paper 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:59.969
 and the brush now also has to do 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.710
 super soft if fundamental a brush 

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:04.230
 good soft 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.310
 I'm going to show you here I brought it in a 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.360
 I work a little earlier 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:14.510
 we have the flower already fully stuck 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:18.590
 I put rests of napkin also for 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:22.010
 decorate well and fundamental varnish two 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:25.489
 varnish hands once and finishing in 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.130
 indistinct reality if they can be that is 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.160
 good taste matt glossy semimate me 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.810
 generally use everything very matte 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.959
 this triumph removed more of brightness because 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.930
 see the crystal resin above and what 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.470
 this imitates a glass and we will see that 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.880
 it looks like a glass what we are going to do is 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.500
 take the resin that has two 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.840
 components come the resin is worked 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.819
 has a component to that is that which 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.880
 will give shine and transparency and a 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:58.880
 component b which is this which is what 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.430
 will allow us to harden the piece 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.280
 well then let's keep in mind that it is 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:07.590
 a bio component does not work ones without 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.700
 they are always products that come super 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.260
 sealed 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.870
 we put one inside another 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.669
 if it comes two parts of the component and one 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.010
 part of the component that already comes 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.889
 prepared already comes there is no calm no 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:26.460
 lose nothing nothing nothing nothing we are going to 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:29.610
 mix do not stir fundamental the 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.350
 mix because if we stir it up 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.410
 little bubbles that later we can not 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.360
 get it right and the particularity that it has 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.000
 this product is that it dries at the time and 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.460
 half or two than the products that 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.060
 we know we have to wait at least 24 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:48.240
 hours in this case does not dry this to the 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.030
 hour and a half well once it is dry 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.430
 It has a resistance 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:57.750
 very good if we can support something 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:59.970
 hot at this rate if you have to have it 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.520
 very much in mind because this one if you do not 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.550
 look at the good job once 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.490
 that we already mix a little resin 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:11.380
 what are we going to do 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:15.160
 in the center we are going to leave it 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:17.200
 well fine if necessary with a 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.980
 spatula we help ourselves to a teaspoon 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:23.230
 plastic and we're going to go be running 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.260
 for the sides but that is already 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.550
 enough if I see that a bit is missing 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.510
 we started running, taking a little 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:33.710
 happen 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:36.800
 auto level exactly this is all the 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:39.920
 I work what I have to do is 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:44.090
 put something on a sheet a cap 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:46.210
 something so that it does not fall or dust 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:49.389
 nothing 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:51.910
 well we show you the little heart that 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:55.539
 we have so they were telling us 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:57.060
 before it does not overflow exactly 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.710
 we can do the same job 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:00.849
 helping us if we have a little bit of 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.009
 resin 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:05.910
 What we do is I brought a 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:07.920
 tapita to be seen 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.900
 let's throw away what little we have left 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.930
 the resin 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.330
 is minimal and 3 doubt the mind you can 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.010
 help again with the spatula 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.009
 again with the center spatula 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.830
 towards the edges 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:23.680
 it helps us more to 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:27.610
 I love the effect that remains and as the 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:29.560
 little heart is left with this shine 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:34.720
 which is the verse that perfectly lasts 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:36.700
 you can exactly achieve noise and 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.580
 we tell all the ladies that we 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:41.200
 they are looking good laura has her 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:44.620
