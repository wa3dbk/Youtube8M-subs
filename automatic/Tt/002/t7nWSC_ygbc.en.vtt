00:00:01.759 --> 00:00:06.990
 it's him everyone we find ourselves 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.440
 for a new video on the grid and 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.339
 of the pro mrt who is a great biker of 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.100
 five cubic centimeters 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:20.070
 so for them a tutorial I will you 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.780
 explain how to remove the pot for 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.090
 you can do it at home 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:29.370
 for himself to change it or so the unbridled 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:35.190
 so me mom laillÃ© already mean 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:38.010
 unbridled so to remove the pot so 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.210
 the two-part jersey we have the 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:45.989
 silent so the cartridge here here that 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:51.690
 is there that drawing like that with the most 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:54.179
 far if we see there and from there 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.769
 it is attached with a cost related to 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:01:01.890
 rest of the pot all there that then goes 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.929
 fix through springs on the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.020
 cylinder 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:12.980
 So here is to begin with we remove the 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.980
 fairing with an Allen key like this 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:22.770
 so that's what gives it once the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:25.610
 carnage remove so we have two vices 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:31.950
 as will retire at the end 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:34.370
 there is no fairing that gives it here 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.370
 fairing 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:58.549
 and to remove it you will need to 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:02:03.469
 two key allen a big one to remove 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:06.590
 this life what are found here is 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:12.369
 smaller to remove this small screw 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.369
 with this trunk of them is there 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:30.579
 so then we will remove this so 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.579
 of hose here is the anti pollution 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:42.360
 so we have two necklaces here is one there 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.360
 remove them with a screwdriver 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.560
 once pollution lenses were removed 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:03:00.100
 we will remove the two springs 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:03.910
 attach words to the cylinder through a 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:09.490
 screwdriver long enough it is possible and 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:27.940
 we're going to leverage for going out for 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:29.410
 take them out one to withdraw and you do 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.800
 same for the second month I changed 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.620
 sua screwdriver and not beefy enough 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:39.700
 so here it is and I do not take anything away 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.590
 second and after we 'll remember 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.610
 other vices that hold the pot to 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.080
 executives of the bike so after having 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.190
 removed the springs that hold the pot 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:56.650
 cylinders we will remove this little life 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:04:00.940
 which attaches to the cartridge so the 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:06.910
 black tube here and the cartridge to the rest 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:10.230
 the pot so it's like a necklace 1 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.230
 so one dessert 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:24.410
 then we will go to geoffrey vis so 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.460
 once this little son unscrewed we go 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:30.199
 move on to the other two you read here who 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:35.389
 so hold the cartridge and we're going 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:37.039
 remove all this part there must 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:05:08.560
 go quickly removed it is pivoted 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:05:08.560
 shoot to be able to remove everything and that's it 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:24.729
 does that give and so this is it 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:27.030
 that we removed and finally we removed 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:41.440
 the little life what lies at the bottom 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:43.860
 here we will be able to remove the pot so there 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:50.200
 it's the same you rotate by pulling 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:53.820
 and it comes alone here and here 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.820
 so the muffler 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:06:05.220
 it gives that and here is the pot 

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:25.100
 So here is the flange 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:26.900
 normally this is where the 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:33.170
 bohemian normally but me and already 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:35.440
 removed so here are all the tools 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:41.350
 it took to remove the pot 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:41.350
 so to remove the fairing 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.730
 it took an Allen key like this 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:50.360
 to remove the big screw a little 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:53.030
 to remove the small a screwdriver for 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:56.840
 remove the lens collar 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:07:00.380
 pollution a flat screwdriver and enough 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.940
 long and strong to leverage and 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:08.150
 remove the springs that hold the pot 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:10.010
 cylinders a key of 10 to remove the 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:13.850
 currency that held the cartridge to 

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:17.270
 frames again the key of 10 to remove 

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:18.650
 finally to open this necklace that 

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:22.430
 attached to this part of the pot to 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:26.720
 the other part and finally a key of 13 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:30.190
 to remove this life who is who 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:32.180
