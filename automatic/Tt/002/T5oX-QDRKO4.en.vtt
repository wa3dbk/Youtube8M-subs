00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:08.770
 It is rough with everyone Hello Nine-up Now I would like to change the direction of engine 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.770
 I will 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.980
 Especially 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.090
 I would like to blow the engine 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:29.880
 I think that the engine's blowing up is also in good shape 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.880
 Then I would like to check the air conditioner next 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.680
 Lower the temperature to the bottom 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.320
 The wind also opens fully 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:59.940
 Also No I get a very strong wind towards the ze Haie Oh also towards the now very cold wind came out 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:04.229
 I think I do not need to worry about anything 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:09.119
 It is smell of pet when we put on air-conditioner and smell of cigarette 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.500
 There is no place to be worried about the smell and the odor of the person who was riding before, especially afterward 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.420
 So I hope you feel relieved 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:19.210
 I will 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.869
 Yes, and I continued it is here here has Tsu become cd and md deck outside 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:26.230
 not to mention 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:31.210
 Also I think that if there is no inconvenience when listening to music, both in the we have to be played, 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:36.910
 Yes Continued here It is a new large double navigation here 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:40.840
 Yesterday I am here, so here is the navigation of fullseg available in this navigation 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:45.179
 I think it is very useful because it is 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.179
 Yes, this trip later 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.610
 Yes this why not also very easy to use because it has become a touch panel as 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.740
 I think 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:58.470

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:02.250

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:06.800
 Yes there is a sliding door and this sliding door 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:11.840
 Per sliding door that can be opened and closed automatically 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:15.140
 I will get out of the driver's seat , so it is possible to open and close with one button . 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.140
 I really want to go 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.140
 Hmm 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.420

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:36.800
 Yes like this You can open and close freely from the driver's seat with a single button 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:40.960
