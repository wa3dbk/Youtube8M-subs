00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.680 
but more importantly what helps is
having<00:02:39.730> a<00:02:39.819> message<00:02:40.150> that<00:02:40.299> is<00:02:40.420> truly

rights you lose that sponsorship and so
it<00:05:19.599> makes<00:05:19.840> it<00:05:19.990> a<00:05:20.080> lot<00:05:20.229> more<00:05:20.289> difficult<00:05:21.189> to

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
it makes it a lot more difficult to

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.490 
it makes it a lot more difficult to
compete<00:05:21.729> in<00:05:21.909> a<00:05:22.120> political<00:05:22.750> dialogue<00:05:22.990> that<00:05:23.379> is

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.360 
think that's indicative of what we're
going<00:05:43.389> to<00:05:43.479> see<00:05:43.599> in<00:05:43.719> 2012<00:05:44.440> well<00:05:44.919> we<00:05:45.039> will<00:05:45.190> just
