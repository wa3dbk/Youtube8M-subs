the<00:01:38.049> slide<00:01:38.289> skipper<00:01:38.560> this<00:01:38.740> would<00:01:38.890> be

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
the slide skipper this would be

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.390 
the slide skipper this would be
acceptable<00:01:39.399> on<00:01:39.609> a<00:01:39.640> test

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
acceptable on a test

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.880
