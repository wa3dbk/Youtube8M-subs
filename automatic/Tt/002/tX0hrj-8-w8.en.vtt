00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello welcome to the last video 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.020
 my christmas series and that is what i have 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.460
 prepared for you today a hairstyle 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.070
 a little longer ago that I have something with 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.110
 first made the hair happy 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.790
 Today he is 24 today 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.289
 Christmas Eve and I hope you celebrate 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.230
 all very nice with yours 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.789
 families and maybe yes 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.380
 not a clue what you are with yours 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.910
 make hair as I find it 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.869
 I'll give you that hairstyle for a moment 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.109
 show 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.240
 all would be the right hairstyle it sees 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.780
 than would free high but it 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.840
 is as I hope you recognize that 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.910
 processed as in one of and with 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.379
 I can combine a rock braid 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.610
 unfortunately still can not figure out how 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.960
 it says on German would perhaps 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.870
 nice if I write down with it 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.930
 if you know how that in German 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.700
 This little hair is called 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.430
 and yes that is a really simple one 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.890
 for her really fast though 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.809
 you once understood the principle braid 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.079
 and I will try in that 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.640
 to publish tutorial 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.409
 to publish also on I will 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.390
 try the professional tutorials 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.650
 a bit better because I 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.150
 namely fought for half a year 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.970
 until I found out videos 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.530
 some of what works then is now 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.330
 Although I have my starting position 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.549
 first left my pony outside 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.869
 and yes, I already have two braids 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.270
 made because I thought that carries 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.560
 you still alone here and there you see 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.780
 already on one side of this 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.890
 road rage already finished on the 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.549
 other side but will still be with 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.829
 make you 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.049
 from behind it all looks like this 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.180
 that these two heads are pretty close 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.530
 are next to each other and above all 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.579
 things could be at a height 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.810
 of course the ones vary as well 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.070
 but make a little different but the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.659
 distance that would not be so great 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.729
 especially if you do not have that many hairs 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.790
 of course you can also do it 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.409
 decide on which height to be europe 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.490
 that means either a bit 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.320
 further up or a little further 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.630
 below and of course you can too 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.710
 decide if he will be otherwise 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.930
 should or rather a little something 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.060
 should messiah who like me for 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.100
 For example, look at the world 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.560
 that means something like structure 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.060
 It looks and here I am now 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.799
 first show how that done 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.509
 and you are differentiating yours 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.250
 hair easily into two equal 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.259
 dash and spin her now 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.890
 really very important is in the same 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.850
 direction 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.140
 I have 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.670
 now the right side always we can 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.190
 of course, as well as the left 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.020
 take same direction very much 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.270
 important and then it is important now 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.100
 if you turned it on, that's it 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.630
 now across the opposite page 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.670
 turns that means over in my case 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.200
 turn left if now over right 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.420
 then it would all come back 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.830
 to wind up or both strive 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.040
 would turn into each other and then 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.150
 you would have such a twisted strand 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.470
 that is why we are particularly important 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.210
 Of course, now you can step over each other 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.060
 also turn left and then on 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.100
 then turn over to the right 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.540
 whether it is important to both strands 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.310
 the same direction turns that is 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.860
 really does not matter because it's easy on her 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.980
 just and pinned up the bush is here 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.630
 I 'm now my rob break yes together 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.180
 with this little rubber i got from 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.530
 cairns I have, I find great because 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.630
 which are just pretty unremarkable 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.820
 and now I have a hairpin and 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.840
 a few hairpins in hand and 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.970
 I will do everything with them now 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.890
 hide and that is with me so that 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.260
 I start that way I just one 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.090
 take it and then put it around that 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.830
 others got around and then they got stuck 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.020
 put in which I take a hairpin 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.750
 the little bit after and then 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.190
 go straight down again so stays 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.630
 it's all stuck right and so on 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.820
 in that they then directly on 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.590
 Scrunchy stuck in like trying 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.810
 There is still a lot of things left to do 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.780
 firmer now I use the other one 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.040
 page and submit it once 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.360
 does exactly the same you see now 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.450
 that I go to the right for a moment and she 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.650
 then the hairs inside rheins here 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.210
 and that's where it's all about 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.910
 Much solid if you just one 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.530
 hairpin reinsteckt now I take 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.490
 simply take turns and am stranded 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.320
 she once why 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.840
 depending on how long your hair will be it will be 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.860
 but take different lengths 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.230
 Here you see again that me 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.120
 all my hair a little harder fixed 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.310
 I just put in the places 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.370
 they 're going to be stapled again or 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.050
 hairpins purely so add and on 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.460
 i just wore a press 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.960
 again all hairpin purely 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.970
 Here you see again how the whole 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.590
 looks and I especially hope that 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.030
 I look at you a little bit 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.680
 could explain and I'm real times 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.090
 curious if we tried that too 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.780
 So let me in the comments 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.780
 just know 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.910
 I hope that you totally liked it 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:21.370
 and maybe make some that you 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.600
 from you after a great hairstyle for 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.729
 everyday because if you have them once 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.560
 it is really stuck then it stops 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.210
 any case , it also holds better than just 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.220
 could try a haargummi from 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.190
 It also contains better than just one 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.870
 hair elastic and yes, otherwise beautiful 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.970
 Christmas and celebrates beautiful and because 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.120
 the new year's eve and yes maybe he will come 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:43.110
 yes, what is nice and yes to the next 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.110
 video shoots
