00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.280
 it would be called a victory always puts you 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.230
 happy and I feel I am very happy 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.470
 very happy for today's performance 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:25.849
 we did the work that we had to do 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:30.090
 and I feel happy if there were there though 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:32.129
 I could have knocked him out but he is a 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.110
 fighter that being hurt more 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:37.710
 dangerous because he takes his punches 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.960
 strong and so we try to take the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.589
 fight as we had brought her 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.329
 well and the important thing is that we work 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:47.640
 things that in the corner told me and what 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.899
 then there were many things that 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.640
 we made that I feel very happy 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.769
 action with the outcome when the for 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.430
 the referee what you thought 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.470
 well then 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.210
 I can not do anything and I'm 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.980
 doing my job and I think the referee 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.520
 he did his job and I can not question 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.520

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.920

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.560

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.410
 grabbing the second air and the truth 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.290

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.930
 with being visit kabangu 2 so that 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.150
