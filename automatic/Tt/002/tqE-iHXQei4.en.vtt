blackberry<00:00:50.610> curve<00:00:50.789> 8520<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.559> fact<00:00:52.770> that

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
blackberry curve 8520 is the fact that

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.950 
blackberry curve 8520 is the fact that
it<00:00:52.949> doesn't<00:00:53.250> have<00:00:53.370> 3g<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:54.390> also<00:00:54.539> doesn't<00:00:54.719> have

down we've got these buttons either side
of<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.830> optical<00:01:17.100> trackpad<00:01:17.460> these<00:01:18.330> are

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
of the optical trackpad these are

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.960 
of the optical trackpad these are
extremely<00:01:19.049> good<00:01:19.320> very<00:01:19.799> easy<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.250> use<00:01:20.280> the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
extremely good very easy to use the

extremely good very easy to use the
optical<00:01:21.390> trackpad<00:01:21.720> not<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.909> seems<00:01:24.240> just<00:01:24.600> a

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
optical trackpad not so it seems just a

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.080 
optical trackpad not so it seems just a
little<00:01:24.750> bit<00:01:25.049> loose<00:01:25.320> under<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.220> thumb<00:01:26.460> now

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
little bit loose under the thumb now

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.910 
little bit loose under the thumb now
I've<00:01:27.390> tested<00:01:27.750> other<00:01:27.869> curves<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.500> they<00:01:28.619> seemed

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
I've tested other curves and they seemed

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.410 
I've tested other curves and they seemed
a<00:01:28.979> little<00:01:29.130> bit<00:01:29.340> better<00:01:29.520> built<00:01:29.909> around<00:01:30.210> this

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
a little bit better built around this

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.469 
a little bit better built around this
area<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.020> trackpad<00:01:31.790> but<00:01:32.790> another<00:01:33.270> big

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
area of the trackpad but another big

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.749 
area of the trackpad but another big
highlight<00:01:33.930> moving<00:01:34.500> on<00:01:34.650> is<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.100> qwerty<00:01:35.520> keypad

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
highlight moving on is the qwerty keypad

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.300 
highlight moving on is the qwerty keypad
it<00:01:36.210> isn't<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.960> best<00:01:37.200> space<00:01:37.500> keypad<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.070> not

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
it isn't the best space keypad and not

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.590 
it isn't the best space keypad and not
the<00:01:38.400> largest<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:39.000> not<00:01:39.180> as<00:01:39.299> good<00:01:39.390> as<00:01:39.509> a

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
the largest is not as good as a

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.660 
the largest is not as good as a
blackberry<00:01:39.990> bold<00:01:40.259> but<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.920> does<00:01:41.100> turn<00:01:41.310> over<00:01:41.640> a

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
blackberry bold but it does turn over a

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.149 
blackberry bold but it does turn over a
very<00:01:42.150> good<00:01:42.390> speed<00:01:42.720> when<00:01:42.960> you're<00:01:43.110> typing<00:01:43.409> now

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
very good speed when you're typing now

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.969 
very good speed when you're typing now
I'm<00:01:44.280> used<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.640> touchscreen<00:01:45.200> keypads<00:01:46.200> now<00:01:46.500> but

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
I'm used to touchscreen keypads now but

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.569 
I'm used to touchscreen keypads now but
this<00:01:47.070> physical<00:01:47.579> one<00:01:47.759> was<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.450> joy<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.869> use

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
this physical one was a joy to use

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.300 
this physical one was a joy to use
really<00:01:50.579> accurate<00:01:51.110> nicely<00:01:52.110> spaced<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.799> just

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
really accurate nicely spaced and just

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.850 
really accurate nicely spaced and just
just<00:01:53.790> feels<00:01:54.450> quality<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.229> feels<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.560> lot<00:01:55.680> better

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.370 
and for a mobile phone like this I think
there's<00:03:46.350> an<00:03:46.500> absolute<00:03:47.220> bargain<00:03:47.600> it<00:03:48.600> really<00:03:49.019> is

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
there's an absolute bargain it really is

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.590

suited<00:03:50.070> to<00:03:50.340> that<00:03:50.489> first<00:03:50.760> time<00:03:51.090> or<00:03:51.239> younger

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
suited to that first time or younger

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.330 
suited to that first time or younger
