case is a little bit of a mess and I

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.040 
case is a little bit of a mess and I
imagine<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.210> repaired<00:01:03.539> bomber<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:03.899> you

imagine that repaired bomber that you
saw<00:01:04.199> earlier<00:01:04.440> will<00:01:04.770> be<00:01:04.800> used<00:01:05.160> in<00:01:05.489> some<00:01:05.910> kind<00:01:06.119> of

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180

a<00:01:06.360> bombing<00:01:06.750> run<00:01:07.140> quest<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:08.210> think<00:01:09.210> there's

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
a bombing run quest I think there's

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.510 
a bombing run quest I think there's
really<00:01:09.479> any<00:01:09.660> question<00:01:09.899> about<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.520> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
really any question about that the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.550 
really any question about that the
around<00:01:11.729> here<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.000> around<00:01:12.180> level<00:01:12.420> 10<00:01:12.690> to<00:01:12.899> 11<00:01:13.259> so

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
around here is around level 10 to 11 so

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.980 
around here is around level 10 to 11 so
what<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.130> would<00:01:14.340> expect<00:01:14.430> is<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.360> Barry<00:01:15.750> mind<00:01:15.930> I

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
what I would expect is that Barry mind I

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.810 
what I would expect is that Barry mind I
haven't<00:01:16.229> done<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.650> yet<00:01:16.710> once<00:01:17.400> you're<00:01:17.580> done

with the stuff in coleridge you'll

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.469 
with the stuff in coleridge you'll
probably<00:01:19.229> end<00:01:19.439> up<00:01:19.590> over<00:01:19.860> here<00:01:20.189> for<00:01:20.670> parts<00:01:21.330> of
