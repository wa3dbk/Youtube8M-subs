00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 very good the same as all of these is 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.430
 because I'm great perfectly 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.919
 welcome to a 99 of my channel I am 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.200
 synapses and if you are watching modern 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.780
 warfare 2 and you are watching a gameplay 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.549
 real or not always this that has 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.170
 have long since recovered or 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.260
 I went to play reinforcement mode like that 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.720
 because I explain it to you basically if 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.760
 I'm playing lately only black ops 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.939
 2 because then I play that the most 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.830
 I like it and it just so happened that 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.099
 good in the target then quite easy 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.480
 that you get a people I do not know how 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.280
 would this is the cheese that told me that 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.290
 there was a glitch but the thing is that 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.960
 I was playing in the east mode of usa 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.969
 that is a 24 7 we were playing shock 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.219
 and me to take out the voltage clips 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.230
 then I'll leave it here on the screen 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.969
 so you can see what you have seen and 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.170
 He is playing there because it happened 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.210
 that we do not find many 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.789
 subscribers we were in groups of three 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.190
 invite more people because it would not be 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.960
 profitable because they basically took us away 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.359
 the kills and would make them profitable then 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.359
 We were Jorge Torres 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.510
 a role in their tactics and I throw the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.190
 disturbing then we stretch the three jorge 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.420
 towers or quillo el and we did not find 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.690
 a lot of Spanish then these Spaniards 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.970
 Well then they started to join 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.979
 playing with us is the same was a 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.479
 bit stressful to find you in 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.160
 Luque is a gift and they started 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.479
 to make love with the submachine guns of the same 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.580
 but good at the end of the day is what 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.950
 town and I'm not going to play that map again 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.380
 in a time so I do not care about the king 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.320
 is that a boy then I will not say 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.420
 name 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.430
 neither propaganda nor anything but there was a 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.490
 boy who did not stop joining me 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.880
 all the time and you see one so 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.290
 I always get ass no but no more 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.240
 the question is that I joined that 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.070
 he always played on another team and he 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.810
 put in the in 94 to camp me the 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.170
 tactical insertion and the whole roll and that 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.840
 is what basically fucks me not that 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.460
 you play but you play to fuck 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.479
 madrid why 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.610
 I was playing normal and he was going 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.020
 looking all the time waiting for the 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.869
 tactical insertion that I made pau 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.149
 to kill me we're going to try 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:13.050
 knowledge that I went to modern warfare 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.819
 2 and I take this example that happens that 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.209
 Many of you did tell me 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.980
 Add me give me 1 on 1 pam pim the 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.480
 I can not delegate people because I have the 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.800
 friend limit and you can say good 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.390
 but there will be people who do not play 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.950
 honestly all those that I have 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.690
 aggregates I know them practically to 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.280
 all and always when only delete to 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.959
 someone by the eyes say by the 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.830
 twitter that you always have it in the 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.930
 description and then 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.790
 does not add people because I have the 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.980
 friends limit and that's normal to the sun by 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.520
 example if he accepted all the people I 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.520
 sent request 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.920
 that other thing by the way with the chat from 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.690
 Sun 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.280
 if I connect the oven I started writing 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.010
 for comments or synapses that 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.810
 I do not know what because I often leave 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.570
 he rescinded it and I'm going to do things and not 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.750
 I read and then I say do not answer me you're a 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:05.030
 cocoon the fame I do not know that it was not the 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.590
 case because you are telling me all this 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.680
 shit that scares me the most 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.620
 the point is that I started to play 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.060
 modern warfare2 and I started to play about 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.819
 how many others against one against 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.709
 subscribers 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:23.540
 what's up that this game is good for me 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.519
 I think I 'm good at what I'm given 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.499
 ok but I think the morro fortress 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.510
 with the cox-2 that are most of the 

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:30.079
 what you guaya games you quiz 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.030
 capital 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.969
 I find it too easy for example 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.650
 when people tell me one against one 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:39.079
 white are dureta or could look no 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.239
 because I do not know skins found trap and step 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:43.250
 that I made 20 casualties and caught more 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.930
 back because that may be that if 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.569
 I started playing 20 games a day 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.250
 Well, it would end up coming out, but 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.680
 like those of catching what he could not with 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.719
 a game that they were basically for that 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.060
 because there are people who say in case I kill you 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:57.650
 here I know you're going to be here then 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.019
 I kill you because this because it seems like a 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.969
 site shot then in a game that 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.739
 so basically for that and bad for three 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:05.959
 but also not too good but 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:09.469
 however in very good football I think 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.939
 that I do not feel confident in me when 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:13.040
 games models by all and in spite of 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:15.260
 that in the gameplay a shot amount 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.660
 amazing when I play one against one in 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.430
 rust because I feel comfortable then what 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.920
 what are we going to do this video 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.100
 you going up 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:27.350
 Tomorrow is Monday 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.350
 at 4 o'clock in the afternoon he has it on the floor 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:34.650
 tomorrow Monday at 4 in the afternoon we are going to 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.330
 throw one against one against all that 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.550
 I want to send a message to my people 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.210
 it's synapses instead of with one and latina 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:45.080
 with two he is that is the nap yes but 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.080
 yes with him 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.710
 because this one is caught then the 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.230
 Monday this tempted him to twitter because 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.820
 I am saying by twitter from 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.380
 all 4 those who demand a 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.360
 message I will be in modern warfare 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:02.070
 2 teams 360 I do not have play I do not 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:04.470
 ask because you're already two teams 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.380
 360 playing one against one against all 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.920
 the one who sent me a message is worth 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.570
 then maybe I will do one thing 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.660
 so in a game of modern warfare 2 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.040

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.150
 I'll let juste and we that 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.900

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.790
 without starting much you rascal 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.140
