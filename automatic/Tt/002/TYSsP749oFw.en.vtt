different tackles and all that but the
change<00:01:51.530> I'm<00:01:51.710> saying<00:01:51.980> now<00:01:52.220> is<00:01:52.250> the<00:01:52.580> deliberate

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
change I'm saying now is the deliberate

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.350 
change I'm saying now is the deliberate
penalties<00:01:54.200> that<00:01:54.700> teams<00:01:55.700> are<00:01:55.820> giving<00:01:56.030> away

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.730 

certainly<00:01:59.360> the<00:01:59.450> top<00:01:59.630> teams<00:01:59.930> Melbourne<00:02:00.620> here

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
certainly the top teams Melbourne here

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.840 
certainly the top teams Melbourne here
today<00:02:00.979> did<00:02:01.190> it<00:02:01.310> and<00:02:01.490> certainly<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:04.520> rest<00:02:04.700> of

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
today did it and certainly the rest of

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.219 
today did it and certainly the rest of
the<00:02:04.940> day<00:02:04.970> we<00:02:05.240> played<00:02:05.479> them<00:02:05.630> did<00:02:05.780> as<00:02:05.930> well<00:02:06.130> and

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
the day we played them did as well and

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.320 
the day we played them did as well and
it's<00:02:09.229> become<00:02:09.560> quite<00:02:09.739> obvious<00:02:10.780> so

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
it's become quite obvious so

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.330 
it's become quite obvious so
the<00:02:13.870> only<00:02:14.080> way<00:02:14.200> they'll<00:02:14.380> stamp<00:02:14.650> it<00:02:14.770> out<00:02:14.890> now<00:02:15.130> is

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
the only way they'll stamp it out now is

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.940 
the only way they'll stamp it out now is
because<00:02:15.850> it<00:02:16.060> was<00:02:16.240> everybody<00:02:16.540> time<00:02:16.960> I<00:02:17.350> can<00:02:17.800> see

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
because it was everybody time I can see

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.740 
because it was everybody time I can see
the<00:02:18.070> reason<00:02:18.340> why<00:02:18.430> they<00:02:18.580> do<00:02:18.640> it<00:02:18.760> in<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.450> spirit

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
the reason why they do it in the spirit

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.740 
the reason why they do it in the spirit
of<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.840> games<00:02:20.080> far<00:02:20.350> as<00:02:20.410> I'm<00:02:20.560> concerned<00:02:21.750> they

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
of the games far as I'm concerned they

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.470 
of the games far as I'm concerned they
buy<00:02:22.960> time<00:02:23.460> we<00:02:24.460> establish<00:02:24.910> their<00:02:25.060> defensive

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
buy time we establish their defensive

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.410 
buy time we establish their defensive
lines<00:02:25.690> and<00:02:26.580> back<00:02:27.580> themselves<00:02:27.760> to<00:02:28.120> make<00:02:28.270> sure

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
lines and back themselves to make sure

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.760 
lines and back themselves to make sure
you<00:02:28.540> don't<00:02:28.690> score<00:02:28.930> and<00:02:29.050> then<00:02:29.140> set<00:02:29.320> of<00:02:29.410> six<00:02:31.770> but

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
you don't score and then set of six but

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.620 
you don't score and then set of six but
the<00:02:33.460> only<00:02:33.580> way<00:02:33.730> they'll<00:02:33.940> stop<00:02:34.210> it<00:02:34.360> is<00:02:34.450> what

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
the only way they'll stop it is what

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.420 
the only way they'll stop it is what
symbian<00:02:35.140> implies<00:02:35.470> otherwise<00:02:35.500> it's<00:02:36.160> going<00:02:36.310> to

symbian implies otherwise it's going to

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.650 
symbian implies otherwise it's going to
continue<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.030> penalty<00:02:37.330> counts<00:02:37.570> have
