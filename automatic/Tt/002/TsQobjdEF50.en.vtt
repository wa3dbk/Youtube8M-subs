I<00:00:45.900> use<00:00:46.079> cobblestone<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.860> can<00:00:46.980> use<00:00:47.070> iron

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
I use cobblestone you can use iron

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.400 
I use cobblestone you can use iron
blocks<00:00:47.610> wood<00:00:48.060> dirt<00:00:48.510> whatever<00:00:48.990> you<00:00:49.080> want<00:00:49.290> it

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
blocks wood dirt whatever you want it

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.110 
blocks wood dirt whatever you want it
basically<00:00:49.950> be<00:00:50.160> weird<00:00:50.400> if<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.550> made<00:00:50.730> out<00:00:50.880> dirt

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
basically be weird if you made out dirt

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.000 
basically be weird if you made out dirt
and<00:00:51.150> then<00:00:51.870> what<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.170> want<00:00:52.290> to<00:00:52.350> do<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.650> make<00:00:52.980> a

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
and then what you want to do is make a

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.530 
and then what you want to do is make a
front<00:00:53.370> because<00:00:53.640> when<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.940> door<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.300> actually

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
front because when the door you actually

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.480 
front because when the door you actually
gets<00:00:54.690> pushed<00:00:54.870> out<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.260> will<00:00:55.410> see<00:00:55.650> that<00:00:56.250> it

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:56.490 
gets pushed out you will see that it

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.520 
gets pushed out you will see that it
will<00:00:56.610> go<00:00:56.790> into<00:00:56.970> a<00:00:57.150> little<00:00:57.450> space<00:00:58.020> there<00:00:58.050> we<00:00:58.410> can

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
will go into a little space there we can

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.220 
will go into a little space there we can
see<00:00:58.650> dirt<00:00:58.920> block<00:00:59.460> there<00:00:59.700> and<00:00:59.880> then<00:01:00.540> basically

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
see dirt block there and then basically

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.770 
see dirt block there and then basically
just<00:01:01.380> cover<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.890> top<00:01:02.190> up<00:01:02.430> I'm<00:01:02.640> not<00:01:03.060> faster

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
just cover the top up I'm not faster

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.149 
just cover the top up I'm not faster
doing<00:01:03.990> this<00:01:04.110> like<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.530> said<00:01:04.559> people<00:01:04.860> have<00:01:05.040> done

this double door my video I think did

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.530 
this double door my video I think did
end<00:01:10.799> up<00:01:10.920> going<00:01:11.130> for<00:01:11.490> like<00:01:11.670> five<00:01:12.150> to<00:01:12.330> six

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
end up going for like five to six

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.950 
end up going for like five to six
minutes<00:01:13.159> anyway<00:01:14.330> we're<00:01:15.330> going<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.540> do<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.720> dig

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
minutes anyway we're going to do is dig

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.080 
minutes anyway we're going to do is dig
a<00:01:16.020> trench<00:01:16.229> all<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.590> way<00:01:16.770> back<00:01:17.040> along<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.939> back

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
a trench all the way back along the back

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.819 
a trench all the way back along the back
of<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.270> Pistons<00:01:18.630> here<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.200> then<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.499> see<00:01:19.679> you

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:19.829 
of the Pistons here and then you see you

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:21.649 
of the Pistons here and then you see you
want<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.039> D<00:01:20.189> down<00:01:20.429> like<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.759> did<00:01:20.909> earlier<00:01:21.299> before

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
want to D down like I did earlier before

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.020 
want to D down like I did earlier before
we're<00:01:22.170> just<00:01:22.320> doing<00:01:22.469> a<00:01:22.590> practice<00:01:22.770> run<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.340> make

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
we're just doing a practice run and make

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.760 
we're just doing a practice run and make
that's<00:01:24.329> where<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.539> put<00:01:24.719> the<00:01:24.840> redstone<00:01:25.020> why<00:01:25.499> it

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
that's where you put the redstone why it

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.069 
that's where you put the redstone why it
is<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:26.130> bit<00:01:26.280> lower<00:01:26.490> than<00:01:26.850> another<00:01:27.149> on<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.840> sides

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
is a bit lower than another on the sides

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:30.559 
is a bit lower than another on the sides
because<00:01:28.320> when<00:01:29.039> you<00:01:29.159> put<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.670> blocks<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.390> you

00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:30.569 
because when you put the blocks so you

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:31.880 
because when you put the blocks so you
can<00:01:30.689> walk<00:01:30.869> through<00:01:31.140> your<00:01:31.259> piston<00:01:31.560> door<00:01:31.740> you

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
can walk through your piston door you

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.109 
can walk through your piston door you
know<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:32.039> a<00:01:32.130> pinch<00:01:32.280> your<00:01:32.460> redstone<00:01:32.640> wiring

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
know in a pinch your redstone wiring

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.120 
know in a pinch your redstone wiring
that's<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.539> lot<00:01:33.719> of<00:01:33.780> trouble<00:01:34.020> head<00:01:34.140> before<00:01:34.289> when

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
that's a lot of trouble head before when

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.130 
that's a lot of trouble head before when
you<00:01:35.249> pinch<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.999> wiring<00:01:36.479> or<00:01:36.630> put<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> block

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
you pinch the wiring or put a block

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.569 
you pinch the wiring or put a block
right<00:01:37.499> next<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.859> some<00:01:38.009> where<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.310> wire<00:01:38.549> is

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
right next to some where the wire is

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.279 
right next to some where the wire is
that<00:01:38.909> Y<00:01:39.090> will<00:01:39.270> not<00:01:39.420> continue<00:01:39.719> through<00:01:40.109> that

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
that Y will not continue through that

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:43.099 
that Y will not continue through that
block<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:41.429> what<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.670> do<00:01:41.789> is<00:01:41.909> lie<00:01:42.810> your<00:01:42.990> red

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:43.109 
block so what you do is lie your red

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:44.899 
block so what you do is lie your red
stand<00:01:43.350> down<00:01:43.499> the<00:01:43.649> bottom<00:01:43.920> get<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.490> one<00:01:44.639> side

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
stand down the bottom get to one side

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.359 
stand down the bottom get to one side
here<00:01:45.149> put<00:01:45.960> your<00:01:45.990> redstone<00:01:46.409> torch<00:01:46.649> up<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.069> go

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
here put your redstone torch up and go

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.830 
here put your redstone torch up and go
the<00:01:47.549> other<00:01:47.670> side<00:01:47.880> put<00:01:48.210> your<00:01:48.270> redstone<00:01:48.479> torch

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
the other side put your redstone torch

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.289 
the other side put your redstone torch
there<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.319> piston<00:01:49.679> is<00:01:49.799> there<00:01:49.979> from<00:01:50.310> one<00:01:51.210> of

there that piston is there from one of

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.389 
there that piston is there from one of
the<00:01:51.389> bills<00:01:51.539> I<00:01:51.689> did<00:01:51.840> earlier<00:01:52.200> before<00:01:52.319> I<00:01:52.770> didn't

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
the bills I did earlier before I didn't

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:54.830 
the bills I did earlier before I didn't
pick<00:01:53.520> up<00:01:53.639> pick<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:53.999> up<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.329> anyway<00:01:54.630> don't<00:01:54.749> worry

to fall on do on the same side here not
going<00:02:00.389> to<00:02:00.450> four<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:01.109> is<00:02:01.229> delayed<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.859> what

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
going to four so it is delayed and what

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.770 
going to four so it is delayed and what
you<00:02:02.100> do<00:02:02.310> next<00:02:02.520> is<00:02:02.729> put<00:02:02.789> one<00:02:03.090> brick<00:02:03.359> down<00:02:03.539> beside

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
you do next is put one brick down beside

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.899 
you do next is put one brick down beside
it<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.200> then<00:02:04.409> one<00:02:04.649> above<00:02:04.889> it<00:02:05.039> and<00:02:05.159> put<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.759> bit

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
it and then one above it and put a bit

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.419 
it and then one above it and put a bit
of<00:02:05.999> redstone<00:02:06.179> on<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:07.590> one<00:02:07.740> below<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.340> will

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
of redstone on the one below and it will

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.650 
of redstone on the one below and it will
push<00:02:08.640> start<00:02:08.910> pushing<00:02:09.179> out<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.300> piston<00:02:09.539> at<00:02:09.600> the

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
push start pushing out the piston at the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.880 
push start pushing out the piston at the
top<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.959> can<00:02:10.020> see<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.470> then<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:10.740> come

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
top you can see that then you come

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.080 
top you can see that then you come
around<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.100> the<00:02:11.250> side<00:02:11.459> here<00:02:11.490> continue<00:02:12.000> the

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
around to the side here continue the

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.730 
around to the side here continue the
same<00:02:12.270> thing<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.660> block<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:12.990> decided<00:02:13.470> block

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
same thing a block of decided block

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.680 
same thing a block of decided block
above<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.280> then<00:02:14.670> redstone<00:02:15.120> on<00:02:15.360> the<00:02:15.480> first

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
above it and then redstone on the first

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:16.940 
above it and then redstone on the first
block

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
block

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.220 
block
and<00:02:17.490> then<00:02:17.819> you'll<00:02:18.209> come<00:02:18.420> along<00:02:18.630> here<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.080> you

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
and then you'll come along here and you

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.710 
and then you'll come along here and you
build<00:02:19.440> one<00:02:19.650> block<00:02:19.830> out<00:02:20.010> one<00:02:20.880> block<00:02:21.000> black<00:02:21.360> and

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
build one block out one block black and

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.199 
build one block out one block black and
you'll<00:02:22.440> see<00:02:22.680> that's<00:02:22.920> where<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.760> power<00:02:24.030> is

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
you'll see that's where the power is

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.670 
you'll see that's where the power is
going<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.420> continue<00:02:24.780> up<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:24.959> the<00:02:25.140> pistons<00:02:25.590> you

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
going to continue up to the pistons you

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.680 
going to continue up to the pistons you
just<00:02:25.830> saw<00:02:25.980> there<00:02:26.220> come<00:02:26.880> up<00:02:26.970> here<00:02:27.209> I'm<00:02:27.420> gonna

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
just saw there come up here I'm gonna

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.210 
just saw there come up here I'm gonna
actually<00:02:27.780> go<00:02:27.989> to<00:02:28.050> build<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.380> roof<00:02:28.590> now<00:02:28.830> a<00:02:29.040> bit

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
actually go to build the roof now a bit

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.320 
actually go to build the roof now a bit
of<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.340> fail<00:02:29.580> fall<00:02:29.970> off

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
of a fail fall off

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.380 
of a fail fall off
and<00:02:30.470> do<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.500> like<00:02:31.650> so<00:02:32.069> many<00:02:32.160> times<00:02:32.489> but<00:02:33.150> here<00:02:33.330> we

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
and do it like so many times but here we

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.320 
and do it like so many times but here we
go<00:02:33.420> build<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.050> roof<00:02:34.170> want<00:02:34.410> to<00:02:34.500> do<00:02:34.590> is<00:02:35.330> build

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
go build the roof want to do is build

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.970 
go build the roof want to do is build
across<00:02:36.600> there<00:02:36.989> but<00:02:37.290> you<00:02:37.380> don't<00:02:37.560> want<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:37.890> build

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
across there but you don't want to build

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.530 
across there but you don't want to build
out<00:02:38.190> too<00:02:38.370> far<00:02:38.610> just<00:02:38.670> we<00:02:39.120> can<00:02:39.239> put<00:02:39.450> your

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
out too far just we can put your

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.030 
out too far just we can put your
redstone<00:02:39.690> repeater<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.530> you<00:02:40.739> build<00:02:40.950> around

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
redstone repeater and you build around

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.490 
redstone repeater and you build around
it<00:02:41.310> later<00:02:41.489> on<00:02:41.580> so<00:02:41.940> forth<00:02:42.150> here<00:02:42.390> so<00:02:42.600> register

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
it later on so forth here so register

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.809 
it later on so forth here so register
repeater<00:02:43.950> don't<00:02:44.340> knock<00:02:44.610> it

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
repeater don't knock it

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.300 
repeater don't knock it
to<00:02:45.569> try<00:02:45.840> now<00:02:45.900> don't<00:02:46.349> do<00:02:46.440> anything<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:47.010> bit

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
to try now don't do anything to it bit

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.360 
to try now don't do anything to it bit
of<00:02:47.400> redstone<00:02:47.580> here<00:02:47.730> come<00:02:48.000> up<00:02:48.150> do<00:02:48.630> two<00:02:48.870> along

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
of redstone here come up do two along

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.370 
of redstone here come up do two along
you<00:02:50.370> do<00:02:50.550> two<00:02:50.730> along<00:02:51.000> one<00:02:51.390> up<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:51.930> then<00:02:52.110> it<00:02:52.230> one

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
you do two along one up and then it one

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.440 
you do two along one up and then it one
across<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:52.769> then<00:02:53.130> basically<00:02:53.610> that's<00:02:54.180> kind<00:02:54.390> of

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
across and then basically that's kind of

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.120 
across and then basically that's kind of
your<00:02:54.569> door<00:02:54.750> done<00:02:55.049> but<00:02:55.350> what<00:02:55.530> I<00:02:55.560> do<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.799> do

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
a little trench here time actually um a

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.420 
a little trench here time actually um a
lot<00:03:19.260> of<00:03:19.290> people<00:03:19.350> leave<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:19.709> lever<00:03:19.980> at<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.220> back

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
lot of people leave a lever at the back

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.250 
lot of people leave a lever at the back
just<00:03:20.459> show<00:03:20.940> example<00:03:21.480> but<00:03:21.630> what<00:03:21.780> I<00:03:21.810> wanted<00:03:22.170> to

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
just show example but what I wanted to

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.289 
just show example but what I wanted to
do<00:03:22.410> was<00:03:22.650> actually<00:03:22.950> drag<00:03:23.670> it<00:03:23.820> around<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:24.269> the

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
do was actually drag it around to the

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.330 
do was actually drag it around to the
side<00:03:24.390> and<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:25.049> the<00:03:25.079> front<00:03:25.170> so<00:03:25.739> you<00:03:25.829> could<00:03:26.130> use

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
side and to the front so you could use

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.890 
side and to the front so you could use
the<00:03:26.459> lever<00:03:26.670> basically<00:03:27.450> at<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.600> front<00:03:27.780> of<00:03:27.840> the

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
the lever basically at the front of the

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.479 
the lever basically at the front of the
door<00:03:28.079> because<00:03:28.320> they<00:03:28.620> use<00:03:28.799> having<00:03:28.980> a<00:03:29.070> lever<00:03:29.250> and

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
door because they use having a lever and

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.039 
door because they use having a lever and
so<00:03:30.000> you<00:03:30.090> can<00:03:30.209> see<00:03:30.329> there's<00:03:30.480> a<00:03:30.510> trench<00:03:30.750> up<00:03:30.900> door

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
so you can see there's a trench up door

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.259 
so you can see there's a trench up door
before<00:03:31.280> kind<00:03:32.280> of<00:03:32.340> mr.<00:03:32.549> Bipin<00:03:32.700> see<00:03:32.940> here<00:03:33.120> I

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
before kind of mr. Bipin see here I

before kind of mr. Bipin see here I
would<00:03:33.720> dug<00:03:33.900> itself<00:03:34.170> went<00:03:34.380> underground<00:03:34.769> a<00:03:34.890> bit

because<00:04:09.630> I'm<00:04:09.780> moving<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.410> switch<00:04:10.560> so<00:04:10.920> far

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
because I'm moving the switch so far

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.920 
because I'm moving the switch so far
away<00:04:11.400> I<00:04:11.760> need<00:04:12.030> to<00:04:12.120> make<00:04:12.269> that<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:12.720> power

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
away I need to make that the power

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.539 
away I need to make that the power

hey it's a power so you put another

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.140 
hey it's a power so you put another

then it says it's died too early so we

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.520
