00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
and then you can make yourself some

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.110 
and then you can make yourself some
crackers<00:03:56.330> with<00:03:56.569> cheese<00:03:57.580> textures<00:03:58.580> not<00:03:58.849> that

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
crackers with cheese textures not that

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:05.800 
crackers with cheese textures not that
great<00:03:59.420> but<00:03:59.830> and<00:04:01.330> also<00:04:03.069> since<00:04:04.150> Kol<00:04:05.150> has<00:04:05.180> the

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
great but and also since Kol has the

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.830 
great but and also since Kol has the
same<00:04:06.050> atomic<00:04:06.410> structure<00:04:07.010> of<00:04:07.430> diamond<00:04:08.090> you<00:04:08.690> can

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
same atomic structure of diamond you can

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.830 
same atomic structure of diamond you can
make<00:04:09.019> down<00:04:09.290> insurance<00:04:09.890> with<00:04:10.010> coal<00:04:10.840> nine

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
make down insurance with coal nine

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.199 
make down insurance with coal nine
diamond<00:04:12.170> shards<00:04:13.360> makes<00:04:14.360> a<00:04:14.510> diamond<00:04:16.030> which<00:04:17.030> is

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
diamond shards makes a diamond which is

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.180 
diamond shards makes a diamond which is
why<00:04:17.449> i<00:04:17.479> was<00:04:17.810> going<00:04:17.959> to<00:04:18.049> need<00:04:18.199> more<00:04:18.410> coal<00:04:18.739> but

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
why i was going to need more coal but

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.159 
why i was going to need more coal but
and<00:04:20.919> pretty<00:04:21.919> much<00:04:21.979> all<00:04:22.310> these<00:04:22.520> recipes<00:04:22.910> are

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
and pretty much all these recipes are

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:28.090 
and pretty much all these recipes are
irreversible<00:04:24.460> so<00:04:26.290> actually<00:04:27.290> all<00:04:27.560> of<00:04:27.620> them<00:04:27.950> are

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
irreversible so actually all of them are

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.710 
irreversible so actually all of them are
irreversible<00:04:31.000> let<00:04:32.000> me<00:04:32.090> think<00:04:32.270> is<00:04:32.479> there

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
irreversible let me think is there

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:40.110 
irreversible let me think is there
anything<00:04:32.930> else

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.219 

I<00:04:43.169> don't<00:04:44.169> think<00:04:44.290> there's<00:04:44.800> anything<00:04:45.040> else<00:04:45.310> but

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
I don't think there's anything else but

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.090 
I don't think there's anything else but
you're<00:04:47.229> just<00:04:47.380> going<00:04:47.590> to<00:04:47.680> run<00:04:47.979> around<00:04:48.100> to<00:04:48.669> show

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
you're just going to run around to show

00:04:50.100 --> 00:05:00.490 
you're just going to run around to show
how<00:04:51.100> much<00:04:51.250> everything<00:04:51.729> fills

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.310 

first<00:05:01.500> of<00:05:01.650> all<00:05:01.710> soda<00:05:02.130> crackers<00:05:03.050> they<00:05:04.050> fill

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
first of all soda crackers they fill

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.260 
first of all soda crackers they fill
half<00:05:04.620> of<00:05:04.770> one<00:05:04.950> so<00:05:05.340> it's<00:05:05.520> basically<00:05:05.760> the<00:05:05.970> side

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
half of one so it's basically the side

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.460 
half of one so it's basically the side
of<00:05:06.300> the<00:05:06.480> cookie<00:05:06.840> except<00:05:07.380> a<00:05:08.930> lot<00:05:09.930> easier<00:05:10.140> to<00:05:10.290> get

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
of the cookie except a lot easier to get

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.570 
of the cookie except a lot easier to get
cheese<00:05:10.800> and<00:05:11.010> crackers<00:05:12.350> fills<00:05:13.350> up<00:05:13.620> to<00:05:14.130> whole

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
cheese and crackers fills up to whole

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:26.750 
cheese and crackers fills up to whole
things<00:05:16.010> to<00:05:17.010> an<00:05:17.220> entire<00:05:22.310> food<00:05:25.100> so<00:05:26.100> I'm<00:05:26.580> also

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
things to an entire food so I'm also

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:32.740 
things to an entire food so I'm also
going<00:05:27.090> to<00:05:27.150> need<00:05:27.240> to<00:05:27.330> run<00:05:27.630> around<00:05:29.240> again<00:05:30.240> and

quickly<00:06:48.570> check<00:06:49.820> to<00:06:50.820> make<00:06:50.970> sure<00:06:51.030> that<00:06:51.390> I<00:06:51.420> didn't

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:51.750 
quickly check to make sure that I didn't

00:06:51.750 --> 00:07:01.340 
quickly check to make sure that I didn't
miss<00:06:53.450> anything<00:06:56.210> so

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:01.350 

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.760
