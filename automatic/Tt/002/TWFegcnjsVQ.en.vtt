but<00:02:04.660> basically<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:05.710> flex<00:02:06.010> tree<00:02:06.340> is<00:02:06.729> made<00:02:07.060> out

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
but basically the flex tree is made out

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.359 
but basically the flex tree is made out
of<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.479> material<00:02:08.110> that<00:02:08.350> allows<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:09.070> tree<00:02:09.340> to

of the material that allows the tree to

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.480 
of the material that allows the tree to
have<00:02:09.729> some<00:02:10.119> flexibility<00:02:11.130> that's<00:02:12.130> pretty

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
have some flexibility that's pretty

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
simple you're not going to see the tree

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.370

about the Flex treat the flexing is

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.660 
about the Flex treat the flexing is
actually<00:02:22.930> only<00:02:23.260> a<00:02:23.290> few<00:02:23.620> millimeters<00:02:24.280> of

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
actually only a few millimeters of

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.930 
actually only a few millimeters of
movement<00:02:25.300> under<00:02:25.900> pressure<00:02:26.459> but<00:02:27.459> this<00:02:27.640> little

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
movement under pressure but this little

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.990 
movement under pressure but this little
bit<00:02:28.180> of<00:02:28.300> flex<00:02:28.709> can<00:02:29.709> really<00:02:30.130> allow<00:02:30.490> your<00:02:30.730> horse

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
trail ride I personally really like the

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.980 
trail ride I personally really like the
color<00:03:24.100> of<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.400> saddle<00:03:24.880> it's<00:03:25.030> a<00:03:25.150> deep<00:03:25.600> brown

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
color of the saddle it's a deep brown

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.590 
color of the saddle it's a deep brown
and<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:27.250> tooling<00:03:27.610> is<00:03:27.700> really<00:03:28.030> interesting

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
and the tooling is really interesting

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.070 
and the tooling is really interesting
also<00:03:28.780> it's<00:03:29.320> got<00:03:29.560> a<00:03:29.940> combination<00:03:30.940> of<00:03:31.080> basket

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
also it's got a combination of basket

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.690 
also it's got a combination of basket
weave<00:03:32.320> and<00:03:32.710> floral<00:03:33.220> tooling<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:34.930> then<00:03:35.140> it<00:03:35.260> has

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
weave and floral tooling and then it has

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.130 
weave and floral tooling and then it has
contrasting<00:03:36.700> white<00:03:36.970> stitching<00:03:37.660> around<00:03:37.840> the

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
contrasting white stitching around the

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.750 
contrasting white stitching around the
edges<00:03:38.470> and<00:03:38.590> I<00:03:38.680> think<00:03:38.890> that<00:03:39.040> really<00:03:39.250> gives<00:03:39.550> it<00:03:39.670> a

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
edges and I think that really gives it a

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.180 
edges and I think that really gives it a
sharp<00:03:40.060> look<00:03:40.530> now<00:03:41.530> let's<00:03:41.740> say<00:03:41.920> you<00:03:41.980> would

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
sharp look now let's say you would

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.520 
sharp look now let's say you would
rather<00:03:42.430> have<00:03:42.580> this<00:03:42.910> saddle<00:03:43.420> in<00:03:44.020> a<00:03:44.200> different

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
rather have this saddle in a different

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.920 
rather have this saddle in a different
color<00:03:44.740> maybe<00:03:45.040> a<00:03:45.220> golden<00:03:46.030> brown<00:03:46.210> or<00:03:46.660> a<00:03:46.690> light

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
color maybe a golden brown or a light

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.560 
color maybe a golden brown or a light
oil<00:03:46.960> and<00:03:47.530> you<00:03:48.370> would<00:03:48.490> rather<00:03:48.700> have<00:03:48.850> a<00:03:49.060> rust

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
oil and you would rather have a rust

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.900 
oil and you would rather have a rust
