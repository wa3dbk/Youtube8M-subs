00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.009
 welcome to one more episode of 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.379
 mountain biking school 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.810
 we continue with the basic principles of 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:31.949
 training and in this episode we will talk 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:34.770
 expressiveness training when 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.200
 trains specifically for a pedal is 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.100
 important to choose how long you 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.930
 go there 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.430
 the mileage paok you will see there 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.289
 if the goal is to pedal a pedal 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.379
 lasting from 40 minutes to one hour and 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.969
 half it is necessary to train between 8 and 15 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.430
 week hours 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.770
 when you move to the longer b10 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.370
 or longer tests of an hour and a half 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.579
 at two and a half hours it is important to train 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.830
 weekly from 10 to 18 hours when it 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.479
 passes for longer tests of two 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.430
 hours and a half to three hours 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.220
 It is important to train between 15 and 20 hours 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.799
 and when you want to train for tests 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.860
 longer as the endurance 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.650
 brazil raid in pierre 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.630
 where the amount of pedaling hours 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.189
 must cycle for a week must rotate between 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.189
 18 a 24 hours 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:33.450
 the second component of specificity 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.610
 of training is the intensity is 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.600
 important to choose which intensity 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.509
 train 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.970
 according to the objective to be achieved 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:44.970
 for example when you are going to pedal 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.060
 or tests lasting up to three hours 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.299
 it is important to train between 70% and 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.220
 maximum heart rate up to 90% 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.100
 when you go for more 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.079
 intense as a cross country test 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.600
 Good morning test days last between 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.580
 an hour and a half to an hour and 45 minutes 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.770
 It's important to train 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.940
 tries to 100% of heart rate 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.920
 maximum 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.899
 this demonstrates that the choice of 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.750
 intensity of training is very important 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:16.250
 to have this basic principle of 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.250
 well- worked training 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.420
