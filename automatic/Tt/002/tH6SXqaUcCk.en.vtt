00:00:09.649 --> 00:00:12.649
 no one sitting here 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:16.609
 To do that for the honor we all have 

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:20.050
 achieved great services for ajax 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.050
 A number of cases perhaps that did not apply to Ajax 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.159
 also the other side 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:27.869
 brand new members of ajax 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.869
 they have recovered somewhat from the fright of membership 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.350
 Yes, now it does 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.280
 still so proud too yes of course 7 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.300
 proud of her 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.510
 I mean it is really an honor if you do 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.540
 are asked to become a member of ajax 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.940
 not everyone gets that either 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.850
 how that wells for you 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.850
 yes it is of course no fear they have a surprise again 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.720
 it has not been the hope for years for years 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:00.000
 yes and then the phone call of years came in the stores that didn't get in the way 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.090
 children 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.290
 yes it is of course a great honor so we would be there 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.960
 in my sanctuary 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.799
 the bags 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.300
 in the Valhalla year in the 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.210
 will get the aex in it 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.330
 because you have different collections yes 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.840
 yes i have the collection 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.970
 of course books 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.610
 you do see books and year rounds 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.340
 and glassware an order of glassware 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.540
 and what makes that glass so special for you 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.159
 In years, the battle ceased after a team on a stroke 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.030
 to the beach 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.450
 I mean that 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.920
 see six if you no longer see dynamic 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.870
 there is also not everyone a weak spot 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.910
 that's it that's the point look now you always have a chance that you have a chance 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:40.830
 good soccer players 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.710
 with a few outliers 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.420
 this was a team without weak spots 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.730
 the pie it is the year that sounds very weird that was just like that 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.470
 they were all good 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.870
 he was admittedly without an associate 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.470
 in itself was just a very good team 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.720
 who thought you were the best then 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.720
 yes you know the city or if you bike that I really like this 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.110
 but that wasn't that I even thought yes was fantastic really out of the way 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.490
 festival 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.539
 what are all singles that have ever appeared no no no i am sorry 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.150
 much much much much more 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.190
 You certainly determine he lacked for the team with all different 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.340
 all deleted how many people below will be rolled out I think so 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.339
 end is coming 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:26.120
 but yes of the seventies the ajax defender europe cup won 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.499
 everyone who went for the success 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:31.680
 and yes I think it is the second purchased 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.499
 we have sold the single of thousands 

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:37.849
 it is now unthinkable but that this was so 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.359
 Yes it is 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.359
 yes i think and and fantastic collector's item 

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:46.709
 the flag always hangs out yes 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.719
 day and night it never goes away 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:52.029
 just like being with the dutch flag at sunset again I like it there 

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:53.129
 a trailer 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:56.450
 The only thing is that the number of registrations is the way to find the 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.900
 houses bergkamp we are easy with him but he is very easy but what 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.900
 is very low on this layer 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.979
 the side of time 

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:10.449
 where are we going ad 

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:13.749

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:16.469

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:19.469

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.909
 this unique 9 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:24.719
 really great anyway 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:28.149
 I am very enthusiastic about it 

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:31.149
 to win 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:03.829

 repairing of cables that can be a big snare broadcasting everything there 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.819

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:29.840

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.090

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.990
 learn to answer 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.990
 this is essentially a signature and invitations for 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.650
 weddings and parties 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.969

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:22.950
 and then we have it again 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.950
 a whole description of how ajax works and thinks 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:29.740
 that is now also able to send home sent 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.749
 I don't know the jury 

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:36.430
 The weeks get anyway and if needed and more 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:41.599

 if you have questions and 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:14.769
 Don't ask this too often, but if they ask me it will be less effective 

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:19.809
 be sure there 

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:22.809
