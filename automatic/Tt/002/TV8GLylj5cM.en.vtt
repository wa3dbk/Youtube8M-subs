thing<00:00:17.400> it's<00:00:18.400> a<00:00:18.490> vacuum<00:00:18.670> actuated<00:00:19.890> on/off

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
thing it's a vacuum actuated on/off

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.130 
thing it's a vacuum actuated on/off
valve<00:00:21.220> basically<00:00:22.120> when<00:00:22.300> engine<00:00:22.630> is<00:00:22.720> running

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
valve basically when engine is running

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.290 
valve basically when engine is running
it<00:00:23.290> pulls<00:00:23.530> vacuum<00:00:24.100> and<00:00:24.340> it<00:00:24.520> allows<00:00:24.760> us<00:00:24.789> to<00:00:25.060> open

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
it pulls vacuum and it allows us to open

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.760 
it pulls vacuum and it allows us to open
and<00:00:25.690> flow<00:00:25.930> fuel<00:00:26.289> to<00:00:26.530> the<00:00:26.650> carbs<00:00:27.090> I<00:00:28.590> guess<00:00:29.590> this

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
and flow fuel to the carbs I guess this

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.029 
and flow fuel to the carbs I guess this
is<00:00:29.950> a<00:00:30.900> kind<00:00:31.900> of<00:00:31.930> a<00:00:32.020> safety<00:00:32.230> issue<00:00:32.379> you<00:00:32.649> know<00:00:32.860> if

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:33.039 
is a kind of a safety issue you know if

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:35.520 
is a kind of a safety issue you know if
your<00:00:33.190> wreck<00:00:33.399> or<00:00:34.149> the<00:00:34.239> bike<00:00:34.390> tips<00:00:34.690> over<00:00:35.020> or<00:00:35.320> you

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
your wreck or the bike tips over or you

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.079 
your wreck or the bike tips over or you
crash<00:00:35.829> or<00:00:36.010> whatever<00:00:38.280> when<00:00:39.280> the<00:00:39.370> bike<00:00:39.579> dies<00:00:39.819> out

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:40.089 
crash or whatever when the bike dies out

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:43.649 
crash or whatever when the bike dies out
it<00:00:40.539> cuts<00:00:40.809> off<00:00:40.960> fuel<00:00:40.989> flow<00:00:41.469> so<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:43.300> know<00:00:43.390> fuel

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:43.659 
it cuts off fuel flow so you know fuel

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:46.559 
it cuts off fuel flow so you know fuel

and<00:01:08.350> I<00:01:08.409> just<00:01:08.619> want<00:01:08.829> to<00:01:08.890> see<00:01:09.070> that<00:01:09.219> it's<00:01:09.399> steady

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
and I just want to see that it's steady

and I just want to see that it's steady
if<00:01:11.170> this<00:01:11.409> were<00:01:11.590> to<00:01:11.799> start<00:01:12.340> falling<00:01:12.610> down<00:01:12.820> you

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:13.329 
if this were to start falling down you

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:15.230 
if this were to start falling down you
know<00:01:13.450> that<00:01:13.630> there's<00:01:13.810> an<00:01:13.960> internal<00:01:14.320> leak<00:01:14.649> and

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
know that there's an internal leak and

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.380 
know that there's an internal leak and
it's<00:01:16.240> a<00:01:16.299> source<00:01:16.570> of<00:01:16.719> a<00:01:16.840> vacuum<00:01:17.229> leak<00:01:17.380> or<00:01:18.390> I've

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
it's a source of a vacuum leak or I've

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.639 
it's a source of a vacuum leak or I've
also<00:01:19.689> seen<00:01:20.079> these<00:01:20.380> where<00:01:20.680> it'll<00:01:21.399> suck<00:01:21.729> fuel

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
also seen these where it'll suck fuel

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.700 
also seen these where it'll suck fuel
through<00:01:23.649> this<00:01:23.799> tube<00:01:24.189> and<00:01:24.630> into<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:25.750> intake

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
through this tube and into the intake

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.420 
through this tube and into the intake
manifold<00:01:27.219> and<00:01:27.340> cause<00:01:27.640> a<00:01:27.670> rich<00:01:28.420> condition<00:01:28.719> and

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
manifold and cause a rich condition and

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.270 
manifold and cause a rich condition and
in<00:01:30.430> most<00:01:30.640> cases<00:01:30.880> that<00:01:31.119> happens<00:01:31.600> when<00:01:31.840> you're

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
in most cases that happens when you're

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.469 
in most cases that happens when you're
decelerating<00:01:33.280> you<00:01:33.969> know<00:01:34.090> you<00:01:34.149> got<00:01:34.329> the

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
decelerating you know you got the

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.440 
decelerating you know you got the
throttle<00:01:34.750> closed<00:01:35.530> at<00:01:36.490> a<00:01:36.609> higher<00:01:36.789> rpm<00:01:37.210> you're

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
throttle closed at a higher rpm you're

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.599 
throttle closed at a higher rpm you're
decelerating<00:01:38.229> there's<00:01:38.530> a<00:01:38.590> high<00:01:38.829> vacuum<00:01:39.130> and

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:39.609 
decelerating there's a high vacuum and

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:42.499 
decelerating there's a high vacuum and
I'll<00:01:40.179> just<00:01:40.359> suck<00:01:40.630> fuel<00:01:40.899> in<00:01:41.140> install<00:01:42.039> the<00:01:42.159> motor

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
I'll just suck fuel in install the motor

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.709 
I'll just suck fuel in install the motor
so<00:01:43.509> those<00:01:43.689> are<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:43.960> two<00:01:44.140> failures<00:01:44.439> of<00:01:44.829> this

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:45.719 
so those are the two failures of this

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:49.289 
so those are the two failures of this
fuel<00:01:46.719> valve<00:01:47.249> at<00:01:48.249> all<00:01:48.369> I<00:01:48.399> either<00:01:48.520> suck<00:01:48.880> air<00:01:49.090> and

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
fuel valve at all I either suck air and

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.330 
fuel valve at all I either suck air and
give<00:01:49.420> it<00:01:49.509> a<00:01:49.570> vacuum<00:01:49.990> leak<00:01:50.170> which<00:01:50.859> will<00:01:51.009> be<00:01:51.130> lean

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
give it a vacuum leak which will be lean

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.719 
give it a vacuum leak which will be lean
or<00:01:51.689> it'll<00:01:53.490> pull<00:01:54.490> fuel<00:01:54.729> through<00:01:55.030> it<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:57.520> this

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
or it'll pull fuel through it in this

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.520 
or it'll pull fuel through it in this
case<00:01:57.939> this<00:01:58.119> bike<00:01:58.329> is<00:01:58.509> an<00:01:58.630> 81<00:01:59.819> cb750<00:02:01.530> sometimes

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
case this bike is an 81 cb750 sometimes

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.020 
case this bike is an 81 cb750 sometimes
this<00:02:02.679> may<00:02:02.829> be<00:02:02.890> located<00:02:03.340> directly<00:02:03.670> on<00:02:03.939> the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
this may be located directly on the

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.550 
this may be located directly on the
petcock<00:02:04.450> on<00:02:04.749> the<00:02:05.499> tank<00:02:06.960> but<00:02:07.960> in<00:02:08.080> any<00:02:08.200> case<00:02:08.259> they

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
petcock on the tank but in any case they

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.699 
petcock on the tank but in any case they
function<00:02:08.920> the<00:02:08.950> same

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
function the same

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.899 
function the same
so<00:02:10.369> this<00:02:10.519> one's<00:02:10.729> good<00:02:10.939> it's<00:02:11.150> holding<00:02:11.420> a<00:02:11.510> vacuum

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:12.909 
so this one's good it's holding a vacuum

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:16.660 
so this one's good it's holding a vacuum
there's<00:02:13.909> no<00:02:13.969> leaks<00:02:14.329> and<00:02:15.430> basically<00:02:16.430> this<00:02:16.609> is

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
there's no leaks and basically this is

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.339 
there's no leaks and basically this is
how<00:02:16.879> I<00:02:16.909> have<00:02:17.120> it<00:02:17.180> set<00:02:17.299> up<00:02:17.599> so<00:02:17.629> I<00:02:17.750> can<00:02:17.930> hook<00:02:18.049> up<00:02:18.230> an

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
how I have it set up so I can hook up an

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:23.110 
how I have it set up so I can hook up an
auxilary<00:02:18.709> fuel<00:02:19.159> tank<00:02:19.459> here<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:21.819> you<00:02:22.819> know<00:02:22.939> run

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
auxilary fuel tank here and you know run

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.209 
auxilary fuel tank here and you know run
