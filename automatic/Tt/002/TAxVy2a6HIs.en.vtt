is more protective and a little bit
stiffer<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:36.570> protect<00:01:36.930> them<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.290> field

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
stiffer to protect them on the field

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.289 
stiffer to protect them on the field
they<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:38.009> manipulate<00:01:38.250> those<00:01:38.670> plates<00:01:39.060> better

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
they can manipulate those plates better

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.670 
they can manipulate those plates better
because<00:01:39.509> their<00:01:39.630> feet<00:01:39.840> are<00:01:39.990> stronger<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:40.530> it's

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
because their feet are stronger so it's

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.170 
because their feet are stronger so it's
all<00:01:40.799> about<00:01:40.829> strengthening<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.670> athlete's

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
all about strengthening that athlete's

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.300 
all about strengthening that athlete's
feet<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.659> as<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.170> move<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.530> upper<00:01:43.799> really

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
deconstructed mesh so it's breathable

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.190 
deconstructed mesh so it's breathable

to design the product and get ideas on
paper<00:02:02.670> before<00:02:03.270> we<00:02:03.689> start<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.049> cut<00:02:04.259> samples<00:02:04.829> you

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
paper before we start to cut samples you

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.340 
paper before we start to cut samples you
know<00:02:05.399> we<00:02:05.820> will<00:02:06.149> print<00:02:06.719> off<00:02:06.869> what<00:02:07.049> we<00:02:07.170> call

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
know we will print off what we call

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.619 
know we will print off what we call
these<00:02:07.530> Z<00:02:08.220> core<00:02:08.489> parts<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.000> this<00:02:09.119> is<00:02:09.239> all<00:02:09.420> like

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
these Z core parts and this is all like

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.720 
these Z core parts and this is all like
cornstarch<00:02:09.989> material<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:10.950> what<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.310> helps

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
cornstarch material and what that helps

cornstarch material and what that helps
our<00:02:11.849> team<00:02:12.090> do<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.540> get

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
our team do is get

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.050 
our team do is get
an<00:02:13.200> idea<00:02:13.560> of<00:02:13.650> how<00:02:13.980> things<00:02:14.370> are<00:02:14.550> coming<00:02:14.880> and

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
an idea of how things are coming and

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.170 
an idea of how things are coming and
we're<00:02:15.360> moving<00:02:15.720> from<00:02:15.870> 2d<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.410> 3d<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:18.000> really

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
we're moving from 2d to 3d and it really

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.760 
we're moving from 2d to 3d and it really
allows<00:02:18.480> our<00:02:18.720> team<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.170> get<00:02:19.260> an<00:02:19.380> idea

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
allows our team to get an idea

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.280 
allows our team to get an idea
conceptually<00:02:20.400> are<00:02:21.150> things<00:02:21.600> proportions

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
conceptually are things proportions

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.440 
conceptually are things proportions
right<00:02:22.350> do<00:02:22.770> we<00:02:22.890> have<00:02:23.100> things<00:02:23.370> solved<00:02:23.910> where<00:02:24.390> do

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
right do we have things solved where do

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.970 
right do we have things solved where do
we<00:02:24.540> need<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.720> move<00:02:24.959> some<00:02:25.020> things<00:02:25.260> around<00:02:25.590> or

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
we need to move some things around or

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.370 
we need to move some things around or
add<00:02:26.220> or<00:02:26.490> delete<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:27.810> just<00:02:27.990> gives<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:28.290> kind

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
add or delete so it just gives you kind

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.290 
add or delete so it just gives you kind
of<00:02:28.470> a<00:02:28.560> look<00:02:28.740> at<00:02:28.890> our<00:02:29.010> world<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.520> some<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.240> the

of a look at our world and some of the

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.600 
of a look at our world and some of the
schematics<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:30.959> drawings<00:02:31.470> that<00:02:32.310> we<00:02:32.400> use

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
schematics and drawings that we use

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.910 
schematics and drawings that we use
again<00:02:33.600> we<00:02:33.720> have<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.870> cool<00:02:34.110> combat<00:02:34.530> version

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920

our stamp of consumer insights and from

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.080 
our stamp of consumer insights and from
a<00:02:51.660> design<00:02:51.959> perspective<00:02:52.459> really<00:02:53.459> stepping<00:02:53.820> out

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
a design perspective really stepping out

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.000 
a design perspective really stepping out
there<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.440> creating<00:02:55.440> something<00:02:55.739> that<00:02:55.860> only

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
there and creating something that only

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.290 
there and creating something that only
we<00:02:56.310> can<00:02:56.340> do<00:02:56.670> so<00:02:57.660> we<00:02:57.870> went<00:02:57.989> back<00:02:58.110> again<00:02:58.470> and

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
we can do so we went back again and

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.630 
we can do so we went back again and
looked<00:03:00.300> at<00:03:00.480> at<00:03:00.690> what<00:03:01.019> her<00:03:01.170> achi<00:03:01.350> means<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:02.519> our

and most nimble trainer as you move in a

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.069 
and most nimble trainer as you move in a
zoom<00:03:16.950> huarache<00:03:17.100> mid<00:03:17.670> we've<00:03:18.600> added<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:18.959> little

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
zoom huarache mid we've added a little

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.600 
zoom huarache mid we've added a little
bit<00:03:19.260> more<00:03:19.380> outsole<00:03:19.769> cover<00:03:20.010> to<00:03:20.190> give<00:03:20.370> you<00:03:20.459> that

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
traction that you need we have a second

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.470 
traction that you need we have a second
density<00:03:23.340> of<00:03:23.370> foam<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.850> give<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.090> that<00:03:24.209> nice

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.870 
density of foam to give you that nice
smooth<00:03:24.989> transition<00:03:25.739> from<00:03:25.769> hela<00:03:26.190> forefoot<00:03:26.700> and

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
smooth transition from hela forefoot and

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.819 
smooth transition from hela forefoot and
added<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.690> pivot<00:03:28.019> point<00:03:28.260> so<00:03:28.380> you<00:03:28.440> can<00:03:28.590> start

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
added the pivot point so you can start

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.110 
added the pivot point so you can start
to<00:03:28.890> see<00:03:28.980> we've<00:03:29.310> become<00:03:29.549> a<00:03:29.610> little<00:03:29.910> bit<00:03:30.000> more

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
to see we've become a little bit more

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.170 
to see we've become a little bit more
additive<00:03:30.600> as<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:31.350> move<00:03:31.530> into<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.829> midsole<00:03:32.280> we

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
additive as you move into the midsole we

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.640 
additive as you move into the midsole we
want<00:03:33.360> to<00:03:33.450> deliver<00:03:33.690> on<00:03:33.959> that<00:03:33.989> comfort<00:03:34.530> in<00:03:34.590> that

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
want to deliver on that comfort in that

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.440 
want to deliver on that comfort in that
experience<00:03:35.190> in<00:03:35.459> that<00:03:35.489> ride<00:03:35.850> but<00:03:36.150> we're<00:03:36.269> using

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
experience in that ride but we're using

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.270 
experience in that ride but we're using
a<00:03:36.630> different<00:03:36.989> technology<00:03:37.290> so<00:03:38.010> we're<00:03:38.130> using

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
a different technology so we're using

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.370 
a different technology so we're using
zoom<00:03:38.670> air<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.269> heel<00:03:39.540> a<00:03:39.690> difference<00:03:40.200> about

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
zoom air and the heel a difference about

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.289 
zoom air and the heel a difference about
zoom<00:03:40.680> air<00:03:40.860> that<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.400> two<00:03:41.579> advantages<00:03:42.030> of<00:03:42.180> it

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
zoom air that the two advantages of it

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.000 
zoom air that the two advantages of it
it<00:03:42.480> gives<00:03:42.690> you<00:03:42.870> lower<00:03:43.049> to<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.260> ground<00:03:43.320> and

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
it gives you lower to the ground and

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.470 
it gives you lower to the ground and
it's<00:03:44.130> got<00:03:44.250> a<00:03:44.280> lot<00:03:44.430> more<00:03:44.489> snap<00:03:44.970> to<00:03:45.209> it<00:03:45.239> these

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
it's got a lot more snap to it these

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.930 
it's got a lot more snap to it these
tencel<00:03:45.959> fibers<00:03:45.989> that<00:03:46.470> are<00:03:46.530> inside<00:03:46.920> allow<00:03:47.880> you

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
tencel fibers that are inside allow you

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.190 
tencel fibers that are inside allow you
to<00:03:48.090> get<00:03:48.209> lower<00:03:48.420> to<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.600> ground<00:03:48.660> but<00:03:48.989> it<00:03:49.079> also

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
to get lower to the ground but it also

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.199 
to get lower to the ground but it also
returns<00:03:49.620> that<00:03:49.890> energy<00:03:50.280> and<00:03:50.310> it<00:03:50.459> pops<00:03:50.700> is<00:03:50.910> a<00:03:50.940> lot

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
returns that energy and it pops is a lot

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.150 
returns that energy and it pops is a lot
of<00:03:51.299> what<00:03:51.420> we<00:03:51.540> use<00:03:51.690> in<00:03:51.840> basketball<00:03:52.350> and<00:03:52.560> clean

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
of what we use in basketball and clean

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.949 
of what we use in basketball and clean
it<00:03:53.280> and<00:03:53.459> training<00:03:53.820> products<00:03:54.269> so<00:03:54.390> we've<00:03:54.810> added

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
it and training products so we've added

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.319 
it and training products so we've added
that<00:03:55.200> zoom<00:03:55.440> air<00:03:55.620> bag<00:03:55.829> and<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.100> heel<00:03:56.370> and<00:03:56.549> then

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
that zoom air bag and the heel and then

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.240 
that zoom air bag and the heel and then
as<00:03:57.480> you<00:03:57.510> move<00:03:57.600> to<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:57.959> upper<00:03:58.290> this<00:03:58.799> is<00:03:58.920> a<00:03:58.950> very

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
as you move to the upper this is a very

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.580 
as you move to the upper this is a very
overt<00:03:59.700> example<00:04:00.239> of<00:04:00.299> us<00:04:00.450> of<00:04:00.660> like<00:04:00.840> being

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
overt example of us of like being

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.190 
overt example of us of like being
reductive<00:04:02.519> and<00:04:02.910> taking<00:04:03.329> material<00:04:03.690> away<00:04:03.959> so

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
reductive and taking material away so

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.110 
reductive and taking material away so
you've<00:04:04.530> seen<00:04:04.829> these<00:04:05.010> three<00:04:05.489> windows<00:04:05.700> where

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
you've seen these three windows where

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.030 
you've seen these three windows where
we've<00:04:06.269> cut<00:04:06.510> out<00:04:06.660> material<00:04:07.170> to<00:04:07.320> reduce<00:04:07.709> weight

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
we've cut out material to reduce weight

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.160 
we've cut out material to reduce weight
but<00:04:08.820> we're<00:04:09.030> not<00:04:09.150> losing<00:04:09.390> any<00:04:09.630> structure

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
but we're not losing any structure

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.380 
but we're not losing any structure
because<00:04:10.440> we<00:04:10.620> brought<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.160> strap<00:04:11.519> and<00:04:11.790> the
