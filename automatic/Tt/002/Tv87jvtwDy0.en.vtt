to to talk about functionality and

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:34.010 
to to talk about functionality and
they're<00:00:31.439> gonna<00:00:31.560> train<00:00:31.919> function<00:00:32.899> when<00:00:33.899> they

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
they're gonna train function when they

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.240 
they're gonna train function when they
select<00:00:34.289> their<00:00:34.410> exercise<00:00:34.829> they<00:00:34.859> want<00:00:35.190> to

for<00:00:38.850> most<00:00:38.969> people<00:00:39.420> even<00:00:39.629> though<00:00:39.920> function<00:00:40.920> is

00:00:41.029 --> 00:00:41.039 
for most people even though function is

don't<00:00:43.769> focus<00:00:43.980> on<00:00:44.250> grip<00:00:44.519> strength<00:00:44.850> when

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
don't focus on grip strength when

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:47.330 
don't focus on grip strength when
they're<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:46.230> their<00:00:46.410> training<00:00:46.649> programs<00:00:47.160> which

strength is that most people when they

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
you look at their length tension curves

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.330 
you look at their length tension curves
or<00:01:24.420> their<00:01:24.659> leg<00:01:24.869> strength<00:01:24.899> curves<00:01:25.619> most<00:01:26.100> people

function very very well in the neutral

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.139 
function very very well in the neutral
ranges<00:01:28.770> but<00:01:29.219> they<00:01:29.369> function<00:01:29.729> very<00:01:29.759> very

00:01:30.139 --> 00:01:30.149 
ranges but they function very very

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.780 
ranges but they function very very
poorly<00:01:30.479> what<00:01:31.469> muscles<00:01:31.829> are<00:01:32.009> activated<00:01:32.490> long

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
poorly what muscles are activated long

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.899 
poorly what muscles are activated long
or<00:01:33.119> when<00:01:33.329> muscles<00:01:33.540> are<00:01:33.750> activated<00:01:34.110> short<00:01:34.909> so

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
or when muscles are activated short so

release so he kind of gave me this this

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.590 
release so he kind of gave me this this
thing<00:01:53.100> used<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.369> be<00:01:53.430> stuck<00:01:53.820> in<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.119> middle<00:01:54.390> so

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
thing used to be stuck in the middle so

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.020 
thing used to be stuck in the middle so
you<00:01:54.659> can<00:01:54.869> kind<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.110> do<00:01:55.289> a<00:01:55.560> finger<00:01:56.280> extension<00:01:56.850> as

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
you can kind of do a finger extension as

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.319 
you can kind of do a finger extension as
well<00:01:57.240> as<00:01:57.530> as<00:01:58.530> compressive<00:01:59.189> strength<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.700> took

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
well as as compressive strength I took

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.910 
well as as compressive strength I took
it<00:02:00.450> out<00:02:00.509> just<00:02:00.810> because<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.560> resistance

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
it out just because the resistance

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.679 
it out just because the resistance
wasn't<00:02:02.430> high<00:02:02.549> enough<00:02:02.789> so<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.030> tied<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.299> knot<00:02:03.509> in

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
wasn't high enough so I tied a knot in

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.170 
wasn't high enough so I tied a knot in
it<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:03.899> it's<00:02:04.020> a<00:02:04.049> little<00:02:04.200> bit<00:02:04.289> higher<00:02:04.469> anyway

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
it so it's a little bit higher anyway

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.340 
it so it's a little bit higher anyway
the<00:02:06.180> one<00:02:06.359> thing<00:02:06.539> that<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.750> can<00:02:06.960> do<00:02:07.109> when<00:02:07.289> you

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
the one thing that you can do when you

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.290 
the one thing that you can do when you
have<00:02:07.560> these<00:02:07.710> types<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.250> grip<00:02:08.610> strength<00:02:08.640> things

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
have these types of grip strength things

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.250 
have these types of grip strength things
when<00:02:09.539> you're<00:02:09.720> working<00:02:10.530> on<00:02:10.619> your<00:02:10.679> grips

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
when you're working on your grips

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.860 
when you're working on your grips
instead<00:02:11.920> of<00:02:12.010> only<00:02:12.220> working<00:02:12.939> at<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.450> neutral

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
instead of only working at the neutral

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.479 
instead of only working at the neutral
range<00:02:14.140> what<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.590> want<00:02:14.769> to<00:02:14.860> do<00:02:14.980> is<00:02:15.129> you<00:02:15.250> want<00:02:15.430> to

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
range what you want to do is you want to

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.190 
range what you want to do is you want to
work<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.819> muscle<00:02:16.120> long<00:02:16.299> and<00:02:16.540> you<00:02:16.959> want<00:02:17.079> to

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
work the muscle long and you want to

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.990 
work the muscle long and you want to
work<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.470> muscle<00:02:17.769> short<00:02:18.069> and<00:02:18.280> those<00:02:18.819> are

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
work the muscle short and those are

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.990 
work the muscle short and those are
going<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.349> really<00:02:20.349> expand<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.459> functionality

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
going to really expand the functionality

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.539 
going to really expand the functionality
of<00:02:22.269> how<00:02:22.420> your<00:02:22.989> your<00:02:23.319> body<00:02:23.560> is<00:02:23.769> able<00:02:24.189> to<00:02:24.280> utilize

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
of how your your body is able to utilize

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.390 
of how your your body is able to utilize
the<00:02:25.060> strength<00:02:25.420> of<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.500> grip<00:02:26.709> as<00:02:26.890> well<00:02:27.099> as<00:02:27.220> your

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
the strength of the grip as well as your

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.420 
the strength of the grip as well as your
wrist<00:02:27.610> strength<00:02:27.819> so<00:02:28.170> when<00:02:29.170> you<00:02:29.319> take<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.890> the

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
wrist strength so when you take the the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.630 
wrist strength so when you take the the
ball<00:02:30.640> what<00:02:31.510> you<00:02:31.659> can<00:02:31.840> do<00:02:32.019> is<00:02:32.260> you<00:02:32.440> can<00:02:32.620> start<00:02:32.950> if

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
ball what you can do is you can start if

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.670 
ball what you can do is you can start if
I'm<00:02:33.940> working<00:02:34.150> before<00:02:34.480> our<00:02:34.780> flexors<00:02:35.290> here<00:02:35.319> you

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
I'm working before our flexors here you

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.470 
I'm working before our flexors here you
can<00:02:35.829> start<00:02:36.069> in<00:02:36.310> a<00:02:36.489> lengthened<00:02:36.879> position<00:02:37.269> you

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
can start in a lengthened position you

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.270 
can start in a lengthened position you
can<00:02:37.659> grip<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.109> ball<00:02:38.290> as<00:02:38.500> far<00:02:38.650> as<00:02:38.709> you<00:02:38.859> can<00:02:39.010> and

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
can grip the ball as far as you can and

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.490 
can grip the ball as far as you can and
then<00:02:39.400> you<00:02:39.459> can<00:02:39.730> start<00:02:40.030> flexing<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:41.079> forearm

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
then you can start flexing the forearm

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.680 
then you can start flexing the forearm
and<00:02:41.730> extending<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:42.819> forearm<00:02:43.239> as<00:02:43.390> you

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
and extending the forearm as you

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.750 
and extending the forearm as you
maintain<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.319> grip<00:02:44.530> you'll<00:02:45.099> notice<00:02:45.430> that<00:02:45.549> as

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
maintain the grip you'll notice that as

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.970 
maintain the grip you'll notice that as
you<00:02:45.940> come<00:02:46.150> very<00:02:46.329> very<00:02:46.450> short<00:02:47.049> it's<00:02:47.620> gonna<00:02:47.769> be<00:02:47.950> a

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
you come very very short it's gonna be a

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.430 
you come very very short it's gonna be a
lot<00:02:48.220> harder<00:02:48.609> to<00:02:49.510> maintain<00:02:49.659> that<00:02:50.079> grip<00:02:50.409> and

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
lot harder to maintain that grip and

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.720 
lot harder to maintain that grip and
when<00:02:50.739> you<00:02:50.829> would<00:02:50.920> start<00:02:51.099> doing<00:02:51.519> something

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
when you would start doing something

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.069 
when you would start doing something
like<00:02:51.760> this<00:02:51.970> you<00:02:52.030> would<00:02:52.239> be<00:02:52.389> shaking<00:02:52.900> just

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:53.079 
like this you would be shaking just

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:55.199 
like this you would be shaking just
because<00:02:53.859> people<00:02:54.099> are<00:02:54.190> not<00:02:54.340> really<00:02:54.609> used<00:02:55.000> to

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
because people are not really used to

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.849 
because people are not really used to
activating<00:02:55.900> things<00:02:56.139> in<00:02:56.349> a<00:02:56.440> shortened

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
activating things in a shortened

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:59.940 
activating things in a shortened
position<00:02:57.900> similarly<00:02:58.900> if<00:02:59.200> you<00:02:59.470> take<00:02:59.500> this

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
position similarly if you take this

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:06.809 
position similarly if you take this
little<00:03:00.599> extension<00:03:01.620> mechanism<00:03:05.489> what<00:03:06.489> you<00:03:06.609> can

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
little extension mechanism what you can

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.580 
little extension mechanism what you can
do<00:03:07.000> is<00:03:07.180> you<00:03:07.329> can<00:03:07.480> start<00:03:07.720> either<00:03:07.959> at<00:03:08.079> a<00:03:08.200> shorten

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
do is you can start either at a shorten

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.520 
do is you can start either at a shorten
or<00:03:08.650> lengthen<00:03:08.739> position<00:03:09.459> go<00:03:10.000> ahead<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.530> extend

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
or lengthen position go ahead and extend

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.940 
or lengthen position go ahead and extend
it<00:03:11.680> out<00:03:11.889> and<00:03:12.129> then<00:03:12.280> work<00:03:12.549> on<00:03:13.829> shortening<00:03:14.829> the

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
it out and then work on shortening the

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.409 
it out and then work on shortening the
extensor<00:03:15.430> group<00:03:15.639> and<00:03:15.819> lengthening<00:03:16.269> the

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:16.419 
extensor group and lengthening the

00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:18.449 
extensor group and lengthening the
extension<00:03:16.870> group<00:03:17.049> as<00:03:17.199> you<00:03:17.260> are<00:03:18.040> maintaining

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
extension group as you are maintaining

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.750 
extension group as you are maintaining
the<00:03:19.030> tension<00:03:19.510> by<00:03:20.500> extending<00:03:21.099> the<00:03:21.190> fingers<00:03:21.549> out

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
the tension by extending the fingers out

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.819 
the tension by extending the fingers out
this<00:03:22.540> is<00:03:22.690> also<00:03:22.959> good<00:03:23.169> at<00:03:23.260> for<00:03:23.530> training

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
this is also good at for training

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.680 
this is also good at for training
purposes<00:03:24.040> especially<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.790> flexion<00:03:25.209> one<00:03:25.419> if

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
purposes especially the flexion one if

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.390 
purposes especially the flexion one if
you're<00:03:26.109> working<00:03:26.410> on<00:03:26.590> a<00:03:26.650> lot<00:03:26.829> of<00:03:26.919> false<00:03:27.160> crip

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
you're working on a lot of false crip

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.710 
you're working on a lot of false crip
training<00:03:27.849> if<00:03:27.940> you're<00:03:28.030> doing<00:03:28.239> a<00:03:28.299> lot<00:03:28.419> of<00:03:28.510> ring

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
training if you're doing a lot of ring

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.479 
training if you're doing a lot of ring
training<00:03:29.199> a<00:03:29.349> lot<00:03:29.680> of<00:03:29.799> people<00:03:30.010> complain<00:03:30.459> that

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
training a lot of people complain that

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.030 
training a lot of people complain that
their<00:03:30.879> wrists<00:03:31.239> hurt<00:03:31.449> or<00:03:31.750> that<00:03:31.870> their<00:03:32.109> their

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
their wrists hurt or that their their

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.619 
their wrists hurt or that their their
hands<00:03:33.280> hurt<00:03:33.549> after<00:03:33.910> doing<00:03:34.120> a<00:03:34.150> lot<00:03:34.239> of<00:03:34.299> muscle

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 
hands hurt after doing a lot of muscle

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:36.809 
hands hurt after doing a lot of muscle
ups<00:03:34.780> for<00:03:34.930> example<00:03:35.379> so<00:03:35.829> this<00:03:36.010> really<00:03:36.370> gets<00:03:36.639> the

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
ups for example so this really gets the

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.059 
ups for example so this really gets the
body<00:03:37.060> used<00:03:37.510> to<00:03:37.750> activating<00:03:38.500> those<00:03:38.650> forearm

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069 
body used to activating those forearm

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.680 
body used to activating those forearm
flexors<00:03:39.489> in<00:03:39.639> a<00:03:39.699> shortened<00:03:40.090> position<00:03:40.209> and

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
flexors in a shortened position and

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.420 
flexors in a shortened position and
thereby<00:03:41.620> by<00:03:41.889> expanding<00:03:42.639> the<00:03:42.849> availability<00:03:43.389> in

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
thereby by expanding the availability in

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.189 
thereby by expanding the availability in
function<00:03:45.430> for<00:03:46.090> that<00:03:46.269> particular

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:47.199 
function for that particular

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:48.720 
function for that particular
articulation<00:03:47.859> you're<00:03:48.010> increasing<00:03:48.370> that

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
articulation you're increasing that

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.849 
articulation you're increasing that
joints<00:03:49.090> mobility<00:03:49.629> or<00:03:50.019> in<00:03:50.379> other<00:03:50.470> words<00:03:50.709> you're

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
joints mobility or in other words you're

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.740 
joints mobility or in other words you're
increasing<00:03:51.190> that<00:03:51.699> joints<00:03:52.120> ability<00:03:52.569> to

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
increasing that joints ability to
