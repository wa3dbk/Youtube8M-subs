00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.040 
alright see once you have to take part

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.610 
alright see once you have to take part
an<00:00:07.100> old<00:00:07.220> monitor<00:00:07.520> and<00:00:07.850> get<00:00:08.780> out<00:00:08.900> like<00:00:09.080> the<00:00:09.230> fly

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:09.620 
an old monitor and get out like the fly

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.540 
an old monitor and get out like the fly
back<00:00:09.830> out<00:00:10.040> of<00:00:10.250> it<00:00:10.400> and<00:00:10.930> scrap<00:00:11.930> the<00:00:11.960> parts<00:00:12.550> you

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:13.550 
back out of it and scrap the parts you

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.050 
back out of it and scrap the parts you
can<00:00:13.790> see<00:00:13.910> this<00:00:14.590> how<00:00:15.590> the<00:00:15.650> date<00:00:15.920> monitor<00:00:16.460> it's

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
can see this how the date monitor it's

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.280 
can see this how the date monitor it's
really<00:00:17.330> old

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:18.290 
really old

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.840 
really old
there's<00:00:18.680> a<00:00:18.770> lot<00:00:18.890> of<00:00:18.980> cool<00:00:19.130> parts<00:00:19.310> we<00:00:19.610> can<00:00:19.730> get

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
there's a lot of cool parts we can get

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.140 
there's a lot of cool parts we can get
out<00:00:19.970> of<00:00:20.000> this<00:00:20.350> but<00:00:21.350> don't<00:00:22.100> do<00:00:22.310> this<00:00:22.490> unless<00:00:22.880> you

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
out of this but don't do this unless you

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.269 
out of this but don't do this unless you
know<00:00:23.330> what<00:00:23.449> you're<00:00:23.510> doing<00:00:23.869> because<00:00:24.279> the

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
know what you're doing because the

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:26.950 
know what you're doing because the
inside<00:00:25.640> here<00:00:25.910> that's<00:00:26.270> a<00:00:26.420> lot<00:00:26.539> of<00:00:26.630> parts<00:00:26.840> that

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
inside here that's a lot of parts that

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.470 
inside here that's a lot of parts that
can<00:00:27.080> kill<00:00:27.320> you<00:00:27.500> and<00:00:27.939> I<00:00:28.939> don't<00:00:29.000> want<00:00:29.240> you<00:00:29.330> guys

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
can kill you and I don't want you guys

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.810 
can kill you and I don't want you guys
get<00:00:29.720> hurt<00:00:29.900> doing<00:00:30.260> it<00:00:30.470> so<00:00:30.920> I'm<00:00:31.460> going<00:00:31.640> to<00:00:31.670> take

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
get hurt doing it so I'm going to take

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.330 
get hurt doing it so I'm going to take
off<00:00:31.910> the<00:00:32.029> cover<00:00:32.210> and<00:00:32.599> I'm<00:00:32.750> cool<00:00:33.230> video<00:00:34.160> from

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
off the cover and I'm cool video from

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.860 
off the cover and I'm cool video from
there<00:00:35.080> okay<00:00:36.080> I<00:00:36.260> took<00:00:36.470> the<00:00:36.739> cover<00:00:36.949> off<00:00:37.040> and<00:00:37.870> I'll

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
there okay I took the cover off and I'll

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.110 
there okay I took the cover off and I'll
show<00:00:39.050> you<00:00:39.129> it's<00:00:40.129> really<00:00:40.370> does<00:00:40.699> tics<00:00:40.940> it's

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
show you it's really does tics it's

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.670 
show you it's really does tics it's
really<00:00:41.360> old

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
really old

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.500 
really old
as<00:00:43.010> you<00:00:43.190> can<00:00:43.250> see<00:00:43.900> fly<00:00:44.900> backs<00:00:45.199> right<00:00:45.409> here<00:00:45.739> I

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
as you can see fly backs right here I

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:53.799 
as you can see fly backs right here I
think<00:00:47.510> see<00:00:47.720> it<00:00:48.220> it's<00:00:50.260> right<00:00:51.260> here<00:00:52.250> and<00:00:52.820> there's

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
think see it it's right here and there's

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.160 
think see it it's right here and there's
a<00:00:53.870> suction<00:00:54.199> cup<00:00:54.530> thing<00:00:54.830> that<00:00:55.100> connects<00:00:55.699> it<00:00:55.850> to

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
a suction cup thing that connects it to

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.390 
a suction cup thing that connects it to
back<00:00:57.170> TV<00:00:57.640> and<00:00:58.900> we're<00:00:59.900> gonna<00:01:00.019> take<00:01:00.680> out<00:01:00.860> this

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
back TV and we're gonna take out this

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.710 
back TV and we're gonna take out this
and<00:01:02.470> we're<00:01:03.470> gonna<00:01:03.559> keep<00:01:03.710> that<00:01:04.180> and<00:01:05.180> really<00:01:05.690> I

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
and we're gonna keep that and really I

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.090 
and we're gonna keep that and really I
don't<00:01:05.840> have<00:01:06.110> any<00:01:06.320> idea<00:01:06.590> what<00:01:06.740> threats<00:01:06.979> these

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
don't have any idea what threats these

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.219 
don't have any idea what threats these
parts<00:01:07.399> are<00:01:07.579> but<00:01:08.149> I'm<00:01:08.570> gonna<00:01:08.750> keep<00:01:08.960> some<00:01:09.200> of

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
parts are but I'm gonna keep some of

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:10.149 
parts are but I'm gonna keep some of
them<00:01:09.439> just<00:01:09.710> in<00:01:09.920> case

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
them just in case

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.039 
them just in case
I'm<00:01:10.490> in<00:01:10.700> one<00:01:10.909> day<00:01:11.119> I<00:01:11.299> might<00:01:11.479> find<00:01:11.719> out<00:01:11.899> what

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
I'm in one day I might find out what

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.709 
I'm in one day I might find out what
they<00:01:12.140> do<00:01:12.350> I<00:01:12.619> might<00:01:12.979> find<00:01:13.130> it<00:01:13.250> cool<00:01:13.430> so<00:01:14.420> I'm

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:14.719 
they do I might find it cool so I'm

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:18.969 
they do I might find it cool so I'm
gonna<00:01:15.049> try<00:01:15.920> keep<00:01:16.299> some<00:01:17.299> of<00:01:17.329> this<00:01:17.570> and<00:01:17.979> throw

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
gonna try keep some of this and throw

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.980 
gonna try keep some of this and throw
away<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:19.369> rest<00:01:19.520> because<00:01:19.939> it's<00:01:20.179> just<00:01:20.359> useless

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
away the rest because it's just useless

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.810 
away the rest because it's just useless
to<00:01:21.409> me

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
to me

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.490 
to me
but<00:01:22.820> I'm<00:01:23.600> gonna<00:01:23.719> take<00:01:23.840> off<00:01:23.990> these<00:01:24.109> screws<00:01:24.350> and

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
but I'm gonna take off these screws and

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.279 
but I'm gonna take off these screws and
I'll<00:01:24.649> show<00:01:24.859> you<00:01:24.920> from<00:01:25.280> that<00:01:25.429> after<00:01:25.729> that<00:01:26.289> okay

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
I'll show you from that after that okay

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:30.099 
I'll show you from that after that okay
I'm<00:01:27.350> gonna<00:01:27.469> show<00:01:27.619> you<00:01:27.679> I've<00:01:27.859> done<00:01:28.070> now<00:01:29.109> broke

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:30.109 
I'm gonna show you I've done now broke

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:33.160 
I'm gonna show you I've done now broke
the<00:01:30.229> circuit<00:01:30.590> board<00:01:30.799> free<00:01:31.450> but<00:01:32.450> there's<00:01:32.990> still

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
the circuit board free but there's still

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.950 
the circuit board free but there's still
some<00:01:33.320> wires<00:01:33.530> that's<00:01:33.890> hold<00:01:34.670> it<00:01:34.820> down<00:01:34.969> but<00:01:35.929> I

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
some wires that's hold it down but I

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.480 
some wires that's hold it down but I
didn't<00:01:36.499> take<00:01:36.649> off<00:01:36.740> that<00:01:36.950> screen<00:01:37.249> because

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
didn't take off that screen because

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.660 
didn't take off that screen because
that's<00:01:37.670> a<00:01:37.759> heat<00:01:37.999> sink<00:01:38.329> for<00:01:38.679> transistors<00:01:39.679> as

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
that's a heat sink for transistors as

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.139 
that's a heat sink for transistors as
you<00:01:40.850> can<00:01:40.939> see<00:01:41.090> back<00:01:41.840> here<00:01:42.079> on<00:01:42.259> it<00:01:42.439> and<00:01:43.369> TV<00:01:43.880> space

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
you can see back here on it and TV space

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.690 
you can see back here on it and TV space
down<00:01:44.420> that's<00:01:44.869> why<00:01:45.049> it<00:01:45.109> works<00:01:45.320> so<00:01:45.499> funny<00:01:45.799> but

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
down that's why it works so funny but

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.580 
down that's why it works so funny but
see<00:01:47.509> a<00:01:47.539> lot<00:01:47.689> of<00:01:47.719> good<00:01:47.899> parts<00:01:48.140> on<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.469> inside

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
see a lot of good parts on the inside

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.249 
see a lot of good parts on the inside
here<00:01:51.369> it's<00:01:52.369> really<00:01:52.819> dusty<00:01:53.030> just<00:01:53.329> the<00:01:53.780> static

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
here it's really dusty just the static

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.139 
here it's really dusty just the static
from<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:54.859> high<00:01:54.979> voltage<00:01:55.460> makes<00:01:55.819> it<00:01:55.969> stick<00:01:56.560> but

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
from the high voltage makes it stick but

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:00.580 
from the high voltage makes it stick but
one<00:01:59.149> try<00:01:59.359> to<00:01:59.420> remove<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.139> whole<00:02:00.259> circuit

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
one try to remove the whole circuit

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.520 
one try to remove the whole circuit
board<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:01.009> I<00:02:01.659> see<00:02:02.659> it<00:02:02.780> from<00:02:02.869> there<00:02:03.079> after<00:02:03.409> we

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
board and I see it from there after we

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.520 
board and I see it from there after we
get<00:02:03.649> all<00:02:03.829> this<00:02:04.119> disconnected<00:02:05.920> okay<00:02:06.969> after

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
get all this disconnected okay after

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.550 
get all this disconnected okay after
kept<00:02:09.530> Amar's<00:02:10.840> because<00:02:11.840> I<00:02:11.959> don't<00:02:12.110> know<00:02:12.230> what

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
kept Amar's because I don't know what

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.390 
kept Amar's because I don't know what
some<00:02:12.739> of<00:02:12.860> them<00:02:12.980> get<00:02:13.099> to<00:02:16.150> I<00:02:17.860> took<00:02:18.860> off<00:02:19.040> it<00:02:19.250> looks

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
some of them get to I took off it looks

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.220 
some of them get to I took off it looks
like<00:02:19.519> like<00:02:20.330> a<00:02:20.360> driver<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:22.180> CR<00:02:23.230> whatever

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
like like a driver to the CR whatever

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.009 
like like a driver to the CR whatever
they<00:02:24.379> call<00:02:24.620> them<00:02:24.739> but<00:02:25.269> please<00:02:26.269> make<00:02:26.420> sure<00:02:26.599> do

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
they call them but please make sure do

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:29.500 
they call them but please make sure do
not<00:02:27.049> do<00:02:27.530> this<00:02:27.769> if<00:02:28.099> TVs<00:02:28.640> been<00:02:28.819> around<00:02:29.060> before

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
not do this if TVs been around before

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.619 
not do this if TVs been around before
and<00:02:30.200> I<00:02:30.739> mean<00:02:31.040> you've<00:02:31.310> got<00:02:31.459> a<00:02:31.489> mistake<00:02:32.209> I<00:02:32.450> mean

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
and I mean you've got a mistake I mean

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.170 
and I mean you've got a mistake I mean
high<00:02:33.140> voltage<00:02:33.620> really<00:02:33.920> helpful<00:02:34.280> is<00:02:34.370> it<00:02:34.519> make

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
high voltage really helpful is it make

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.479 
high voltage really helpful is it make
sure<00:02:35.360> to<00:02:35.390> discharge<00:02:36.110> everything<00:02:36.650> which<00:02:37.310> this

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
sure to discharge everything which this

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.490 
sure to discharge everything which this
was<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.790> old<00:02:37.909> TV<00:02:38.120> I<00:02:38.269> knew<00:02:38.599> I<00:02:38.629> didn't<00:02:39.080> even<00:02:39.290> I

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
was the old TV I knew I didn't even I

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.490 
was the old TV I knew I didn't even I
mean<00:02:39.769> I<00:02:39.860> did<00:02:40.099> anyway<00:02:40.580> discharge<00:02:41.390> it<00:02:41.569> but<00:02:41.870> make

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
mean I did anyway discharge it but make

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.210 
mean I did anyway discharge it but make
sure<00:02:42.530> you<00:02:42.769> do

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
sure you do

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.800 
sure you do
okay<00:02:44.150> here's<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.019> circuit<00:02:45.349> board<00:02:45.530> it<00:02:46.189> has<00:02:46.810> fly

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
okay here's the circuit board it has fly

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.920 
okay here's the circuit board it has fly
back<00:02:48.049> on<00:02:48.230> it<00:02:48.409> looks<00:02:49.250> like<00:02:49.430> we<00:02:49.519> got<00:02:49.640> some<00:02:49.930> big

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
back on it looks like we got some big

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.670 
back on it looks like we got some big
caps

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.080

transformer heatsink with transistor on

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.250 
transformer heatsink with transistor on
it's<00:02:59.090> another<00:02:59.299> this<00:02:59.599> is<00:02:59.659> a<00:02:59.810> big<00:03:00.019> heat<00:03:00.230> sink

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
it's another this is a big heat sink

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.929 
it's another this is a big heat sink
that's<00:03:00.890> why<00:03:01.040> I<00:03:01.069> was<00:03:01.220> gonna<00:03:01.310> take<00:03:01.489> off<00:03:01.640> first

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:01.939 
that's why I was gonna take off first

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:04.720 
that's why I was gonna take off first
but<00:03:02.239> that's<00:03:02.540> sudden<00:03:02.840> not<00:03:02.989> to<00:03:03.200> because<00:03:03.650> he<00:03:04.519> had

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
but that's sudden not to because he had

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.699 
but that's sudden not to because he had
all<00:03:05.299> these<00:03:05.390> transistors<00:03:05.810> connected<00:03:06.170> to<00:03:06.590> it

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
all these transistors connected to it

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.449 
all these transistors connected to it
and<00:03:07.599> the<00:03:08.599> capacitor<00:03:09.170> looks<00:03:09.500> like<00:03:09.650> we've<00:03:09.920> got<00:03:10.840> a

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
and the capacitor looks like we've got a

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.619 
and the capacitor looks like we've got a
big

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
big

don't know well it gets there I mean but
pretty<00:03:35.930> neat<00:03:36.079> we'll<00:03:37.069> see<00:03:37.340> what<00:03:37.459> we<00:03:37.519> can<00:03:37.640> do

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
pretty neat we'll see what we can do

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.490 
pretty neat we'll see what we can do
with<00:03:37.879> all<00:03:37.969> these<00:03:38.090> parts<00:03:38.480> and<00:03:38.930> try<00:03:39.170> to<00:03:39.260> build

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
with all these parts and try to build

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.780 
with all these parts and try to build
something<00:03:39.709> with<00:03:39.950> up<00:03:40.099> and<00:03:41.799> let<00:03:42.799> me<00:03:42.920> clean<00:03:43.670> this

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
something with up and let me clean this

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.319 
something with up and let me clean this
up<00:03:43.969> a<00:03:44.030> little<00:03:44.120> bit<00:03:44.239> my<00:03:44.420> face<00:03:44.689> more<00:03:45.939> okay<00:03:46.939> and<00:03:47.239> I

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
up a little bit my face more okay and I

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:53.770 
up a little bit my face more okay and I
cleaned<00:03:47.629> it<00:03:47.750> off<00:03:47.900> really<00:03:48.200> good<00:03:48.230> and<00:03:51.340> now<00:03:52.780> I've

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
cleaned it off really good and now I've

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.149 
cleaned it off really good and now I've
been<00:03:53.900> able<00:03:54.079> to<00:03:54.260> observe<00:03:54.500> it<00:03:54.680> a<00:03:54.890> little<00:03:55.040> bit

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:55.159 
been able to observe it a little bit

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:57.929 
been able to observe it a little bit
more<00:03:55.400> I'll<00:03:55.609> show<00:03:55.909> you<00:03:55.969> the<00:03:56.930> parts<00:03:57.260> on<00:03:57.379> inside

00:03:57.929 --> 00:03:57.939 
more I'll show you the parts on inside

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:01.599 
more I'll show you the parts on inside
okay<00:03:59.109> so<00:04:00.109> you<00:04:00.200> can<00:04:00.290> see<00:04:00.439> there's<00:04:00.680> I<00:04:01.069> mean

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:01.609 
okay so you can see there's I mean

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.220 
okay so you can see there's I mean
bigger<00:04:01.969> parts<00:04:02.480> because<00:04:02.659> there's<00:04:02.870> such<00:04:03.079> an

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
bigger parts because there's such an

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.089 
bigger parts because there's such an
older<00:04:03.500> you<00:04:04.069> know<00:04:04.510> system<00:04:05.709> which<00:04:06.709> makes<00:04:06.920> it

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
older you know system which makes it

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:09.970 
older you know system which makes it
good<00:04:07.250> for<00:04:07.310> me<00:04:07.640> because<00:04:07.939> I<00:04:08.569> mean<00:04:08.780> parter<00:04:09.560> helped

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
good for me because I mean parter helped

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.470 
good for me because I mean parter helped
me<00:04:10.069> I<00:04:10.099> can<00:04:10.310> easily<00:04:10.849> take<00:04:11.090> them<00:04:11.239> off<00:04:11.329> the

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
me I can easily take them off the

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.149 
me I can easily take them off the
circuit<00:04:11.870> board<00:04:12.079> because<00:04:12.680> they're<00:04:12.829> not<00:04:12.950> really

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:13.159 
circuit board because they're not really

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:14.860 
circuit board because they're not really
soldered<00:04:13.609> down<00:04:13.790> I<00:04:13.849> mean<00:04:14.120> they<00:04:14.269> are<00:04:14.450> but

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
soldered down I mean they are but

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.900 
soldered down I mean they are but
they're<00:04:15.079> and<00:04:15.650> they<00:04:15.769> have<00:04:15.950> like<00:04:16.100> leads<00:04:16.400> to<00:04:16.790> them

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
they're and they have like leads to them

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.819 
they're and they have like leads to them
they're<00:04:17.480> not<00:04:17.510> like<00:04:17.870> tip

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
they're not like tip

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.700 
they're not like tip
spirits<00:04:19.580> and<00:04:19.790> chip<00:04:20.180> capacitors<00:04:21.170> and<00:04:21.380> stuff<00:04:21.560> I

spirits and chip capacitors and stuff I

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:25.140 
spirits and chip capacitors and stuff I
mean<00:04:21.920> these<00:04:22.100> and<00:04:23.030> look<00:04:23.210> at<00:04:23.330> these<00:04:23.420> things<00:04:24.010> but

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
mean these and look at these things but

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.080 
mean these and look at these things but
my<00:04:26.150> next<00:04:26.420> video<00:04:26.690> I'll<00:04:26.900> show<00:04:27.080> you<00:04:27.110> how<00:04:27.230> to

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
my next video I'll show you how to

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.980 
my next video I'll show you how to
we'll<00:04:29.090> just<00:04:29.270> mess<00:04:29.689> around<00:04:29.719> the<00:04:30.289> flyback<00:04:30.830> and

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
we'll just mess around the flyback and
