00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 welcome to tripolis tv 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.970
 Today chooses to show you how to make the glass 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.500
 at a nokia lumia 800 30 changes 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.639
 a small note this repair is 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.349
 not so easy and we should get up 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.280
 every case has solving knowledge and 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.110
 if you have spare parts and tools 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.670
 you will find everything and in mine 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.990
 video description from the left just times 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:25.500
 so do not read through expensive tools 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:27.269
 and let's get started so let's start 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.619
 The first thing we turn off is the device 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.619
 and remove the backcover and the battery 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.760
 next we take the 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.780
 screwdriver and remove the seven 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.780
 screws the back 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.270
 At this point we take a flat 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.190
 plastic chair and solve the outside around the 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.730
 back from the rest of the nokia and lay 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.730
 set it aside 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.820
 Now we separate with a flat 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.479
 plastic tool all flex 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.479
 cable connections 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.330
 Now we take a pair of tweezers and 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.950
 carefully remove the protective film of the 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.270
 then vibration motors can 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.320
 We slowly lower the mainboard 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.880
 flaps and antenna cables 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.330
 connection before we separate it aside 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.330
 lay 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.040
 after that we can use the usb and 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.040
 remove speaker unit 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.880
 next the connection of the 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.880
 Small board and solve is from glue 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:20.709
 now just put on the side 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.640
 Now we have the front camera 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.380
 then the usual hair dryer and 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.070
 Heat the edge of the display to about 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.750
 80 degrees 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.900
 better release emstek glue underneath 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.760
 lets lift with a flat tool 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.930
 Now we carefully turn on the display and 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.930
 remove it from the frame 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.940
 Next we solve the digitizer 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:00.910
 flex cable on the back of the 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:02.620
 displays attention then we have to 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.150
 another flex cable will remove this 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.070
 is, however, only by the 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.690
 remove it is therefore advisable to kill 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.670
 here at this place this repair 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.670
 only if you also have knowledge 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.540
 then we go back to the hair dryer 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.880
 and heat up the whole thing this time 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.650
 display at about 80 degrees so that the 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.240
 Under which glue can solve better now 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.660
 finally comes our playing card ins 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.490
 game 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.140
 with the map we go now between the 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.370
 digitizer and the display and drag them 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.370
 from top to bottom through 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.950
 please pay attention to the display always 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.950
 to heat again 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.459
 to make it easier for you 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.459
 you also use several cards 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.690
 now we remove the rest 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.100
 Glue residue from the digitizer goes best 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.230
 if you just glue the glue with the 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.030
 finger away rubs the whole thing can one 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.690
 Whole stay please please 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.690
 patiently 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.189
 next, take vida loca sticker 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.189
 and distribute it on the display 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.430
 Now we take the new glass off 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:11.810
 All protective films are careful 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.880
 and slowly slide down to it 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.860
 contact with the glue art pays attention 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.860
 on the fact that no bubbles arise 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:40.760
 Now gently push the glue up 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:41.930
 in the corners the excess glue 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.970
 then becomes a runner 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.470
 flow out before we see the display now 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.510
 let it harden under the uv lamp 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:49.850
 please take care that the glass is exactly 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.230
 in the right place is now 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.400
 we have to display the display for five minutes 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:56.810
 let it harden under uv lamp 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.610
 if we have that, we'll clean it 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:08.450
 remaining glue residue display with 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:09.920
 stick isopropanol at this point and 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.400
 we connect the digitizer with the 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.400
 display 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.810
 then the flex cable has to be replaced 

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:28.280
 to be soldered on 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:31.449
 make sure they do not 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.449
 short circuit purely necessary 

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:58.039
 Now we bring the repaired display 

00:06:56.749 --> 00:07:01.599
 again and build that nokia in 

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:01.599
 reverse order together 

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:10.330
 First we bring the little one 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.330
 board again 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:16.249
 then we mount the usb and 

00:07:13.339 --> 00:07:17.330
 the speaker unit next 

00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:20.949
 we bring the front camera and the 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.949
 Mainboard again and connect everything 

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:39.200
 Now we bring the back again 

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:41.380
 and screw everything back up 

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.380
 together 

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.490
 Finally, we put the battery and that 

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.590
 backcover again and check if everything 

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:51.580
 if so, should your nokia work 

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:53.600
 lumia 800 30 again look like new 

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:55.250
 so people i hope i could give you
