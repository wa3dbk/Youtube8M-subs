list was announced a lot of people

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.820 
list was announced a lot of people
thought<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.570> same<00:01:20.750> thing<00:01:20.780> that<00:01:21.110> you<00:01:21.680> know

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
thought the same thing that you know

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.590 
thought the same thing that you know
dragon<00:01:22.220> rulers<00:01:22.520> were<00:01:22.700> essentially<00:01:23.300> a<00:01:23.330> dead

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
dragon rulers were essentially a dead

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.990 
dragon rulers were essentially a dead
deck<00:01:23.840> and<00:01:24.140> you<00:01:24.740> know<00:01:24.890> the<00:01:25.070> deck<00:01:25.220> evolved<00:01:25.850> and

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
deck and you know the deck evolved and

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.469 
deck and you know the deck evolved and
changed<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:27.020> resurfaced<00:01:27.979> and<00:01:28.430> was<00:01:29.030> just<00:01:29.330> as

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
changed and resurfaced and was just as

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.330 
changed and resurfaced and was just as
strong<00:01:29.540> as<00:01:29.840> it<00:01:29.990> ever<00:01:30.020> was<00:01:30.380> but<00:01:30.979> with<00:01:31.100> all<00:01:31.220> the

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
strong as it ever was but with all the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.400 
strong as it ever was but with all the
new<00:01:31.520> hits<00:01:31.850> that<00:01:32.149> they<00:01:32.300> got<00:01:32.540> I<00:01:32.810> just<00:01:32.840> I<00:01:33.350> just

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
new hits that they got I just I just

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.109 
new hits that they got I just I just
don't<00:01:33.979> see<00:01:34.220> how<00:01:34.250> that's<00:01:34.820> going<00:01:34.940> to<00:01:35.030> be

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
don't see how that's going to be

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.389 
don't see how that's going to be
possible<00:01:35.300> in<00:01:35.690> this<00:01:35.750> upcoming<00:01:35.960> format<00:01:36.560> one<00:01:37.310> of

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
possible in this upcoming format one of

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:39.310 
possible in this upcoming format one of
the<00:01:37.490> reasons<00:01:37.850> is<00:01:38.090> that<00:01:38.149> they<00:01:38.600> actually<00:01:38.869> banned

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
the reasons is that they actually banned

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.590 
the reasons is that they actually banned
dragons<00:01:39.950> ravine<00:01:40.369> this<00:01:40.820> is<00:01:40.940> a<00:01:40.970> real<00:01:41.210> integral

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
dragons ravine this is a real integral

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.359 
dragons ravine this is a real integral
card<00:01:41.810> not<00:01:41.990> only<00:01:42.020> to<00:01:42.380> dragon<00:01:42.740> rulers<00:01:42.979> but<00:01:43.190> to

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
card not only to dragon rulers but to

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.120 
card not only to dragon rulers but to
the<00:01:43.640> actual<00:01:43.970> trib<00:01:44.300> unity<00:01:44.660> deck<00:01:44.869> as<00:01:45.080> well<00:01:45.289> so<00:01:45.649> so

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
the actual trib unity deck as well so so

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.560 
the actual trib unity deck as well so so
both<00:01:46.430> those<00:01:46.640> decks<00:01:46.880> are<00:01:47.030> already<00:01:47.300> going<00:01:47.450> to

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
both those decks are already going to

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.540 
both those decks are already going to
suffer<00:01:47.899> from<00:01:48.410> their<00:01:48.590> cards<00:01:48.920> like<00:01:49.070> return<00:01:49.369> from

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
suffer from their cards like return from

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.130 
suffer from their cards like return from
a<00:01:49.670> different<00:01:49.910> dimension<00:01:50.030> and<00:01:50.660> sixth<00:01:50.990> sense

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
a different dimension and sixth sense

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.540 
a different dimension and sixth sense
both<00:01:51.380> ended<00:01:51.740> up<00:01:51.800> on<00:01:51.950> the<00:01:52.039> balance<00:01:52.340> i<00:01:52.399> don't

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
both ended up on the balance i don't

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.830 
both ended up on the balance i don't
think<00:01:52.700> this<00:01:52.759> is<00:01:52.910> too<00:01:53.030> surprising<00:01:53.570> too<00:01:53.690> much

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
think this is too surprising too much

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.200 
think this is too surprising too much
anyone<00:01:54.259> a<00:01:54.470> lot<00:01:55.070> of<00:01:55.160> players<00:01:55.340> essentially<00:01:56.000> knew

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
anyone a lot of players essentially knew

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.400 
anyone a lot of players essentially knew
that<00:01:56.390> they<00:01:56.509> were<00:01:56.570> going<00:01:56.750> to<00:01:56.810> end<00:01:56.960> up<00:01:57.020> on<00:01:57.229> this

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
that they were going to end up on this

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:58.600 
that they were going to end up on this
list<00:01:57.680> it<00:01:57.920> kind<00:01:58.100> of<00:01:58.130> a<00:01:58.250> little<00:01:58.310> bit<00:01:58.430> of<00:01:58.520> a

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
list it kind of a little bit of a

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.370 
list it kind of a little bit of a
surprise<00:01:58.700> one<00:01:59.180> a<00:01:59.210> self-destruct<00:01:59.869> button<00:01:59.990> this

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
surprise one a self-destruct button this

surprise one a self-destruct button this
is<00:02:00.500> one<00:02:00.649> of<00:02:00.680> those<00:02:00.890> degenerate<00:02:01.729> decks<00:02:01.940> that

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
is one of those degenerate decks that

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.820 
is one of those degenerate decks that

the forbidden list many many moons ago

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.560 
the forbidden list many many moons ago
anytime<00:02:07.070> Konami<00:02:07.549> take<00:02:07.820> steps<00:02:08.179> towards

I<00:04:10.670> personally<00:04:11.090> think<00:04:11.600> that<00:04:11.720> maybe<00:04:12.110> they

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
I personally think that maybe they

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.990 
I personally think that maybe they
should<00:04:12.440> have<00:04:12.530> got<00:04:12.680> either<00:04:13.040> Blue<00:04:13.430> Boy<00:04:13.640> or

should have got either Blue Boy or

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.270 
should have got either Blue Boy or
secrets<00:04:14.720> but<00:04:15.020> faith<00:04:15.709> it's<00:04:16.010> going<00:04:16.190> to

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
definitely hinder the deck as well but I

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.270 
definitely hinder the deck as well but I
think<00:04:17.930> it<00:04:18.260> doesn't<00:04:18.560> hinder<00:04:18.709> it<00:04:18.890> so<00:04:19.040> much<00:04:19.220> that

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
think it doesn't hinder it so much that

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.759 
think it doesn't hinder it so much that
it<00:04:19.609> makes<00:04:19.760> it<00:04:19.940> completely<00:04:20.330> unplayable<00:04:20.840> a<00:04:21.260> lot

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
it makes it completely unplayable a lot

luckily I still have at least one but

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.540 
luckily I still have at least one but
now<00:05:35.169> I'm<00:05:35.290> trying<00:05:35.680> to<00:05:35.740> find<00:05:35.919> a<00:05:36.040> way<00:05:36.160> to<00:05:36.220> pick<00:05:36.430> up

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
now I'm trying to find a way to pick up

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.000 
now I'm trying to find a way to pick up
some<00:05:36.699> more<00:05:36.910> then<00:05:37.540> finally<00:05:37.990> fire<00:05:38.350> formation

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
some more then finally fire formation

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.760 
some more then finally fire formation
ten<00:05:39.280> key<00:05:39.580> is<00:05:39.820> no<00:05:40.479> longer<00:05:40.810> limited<00:05:41.139> to<00:05:41.410> two<00:05:41.620> you

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
ten key is no longer limited to two you

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:42.990 
ten key is no longer limited to two you
could<00:05:41.860> have<00:05:41.979> three<00:05:42.190> in<00:05:42.280> your<00:05:42.370> deck<00:05:42.490> once<00:05:42.729> again

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
could have three in your deck once again

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.210 
could have three in your deck once again
thus<00:05:43.300> giving<00:05:43.660> even<00:05:43.810> more<00:05:44.229> support<00:05:44.710> back<00:05:45.040> to

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
thus giving even more support back to

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.219 
thus giving even more support back to
constellar<00:05:45.550> not<00:05:46.120> only<00:05:46.240> do<00:05:46.300> they<00:05:46.389> get<00:05:46.540> m7<00:05:47.080> back

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:47.229 
constellar not only do they get m7 back

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:48.900 
constellar not only do they get m7 back
but<00:05:47.410> they<00:05:47.500> got<00:05:47.620> their<00:05:47.740> tinky<00:05:48.100> back<00:05:48.280> as<00:05:48.490> well

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
but they got their tinky back as well

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.879 
but they got their tinky back as well
this<00:05:49.570> will<00:05:49.720> also<00:05:49.780> give<00:05:49.990> rise<00:05:50.260> to<00:05:50.320> a<00:05:50.530> lot<00:05:50.740> more

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889 
this will also give rise to a lot more

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:52.920 
this will also give rise to a lot more
fire<00:05:51.190> fist<00:05:51.520> decks<00:05:51.790> all<00:05:52.479> the<00:05:52.660> different

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
fire fist decks all the different

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.420 
fire fist decks all the different
variations<00:05:53.020> of<00:05:53.470> it<00:05:53.590> will<00:05:53.740> definitely<00:05:54.130> benefit

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
variations of it will definitely benefit

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.189 
variations of it will definitely benefit
for<00:05:54.610> having<00:05:54.820> the<00:05:54.910> third<00:05:55.090> tanky<00:05:55.510> back<00:05:55.780> at<00:05:56.020> their

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199 
for having the third tanky back at their

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:58.469 
for having the third tanky back at their
disposal<00:05:56.410> so<00:05:57.340> overall<00:05:57.760> I<00:05:57.790> was<00:05:58.090> actually

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 
disposal so overall I was actually

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.030 
disposal so overall I was actually
pretty<00:05:58.690> pleased<00:05:59.050> with<00:05:59.080> the<00:05:59.440> list<00:05:59.680> they

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:00.040 
pretty pleased with the list they

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.770 
pretty pleased with the list they
addressed<00:06:00.669> dragon<00:06:01.180> rulers<00:06:01.419> quite

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
addressed dragon rulers quite

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:03.780 
addressed dragon rulers quite
extensively<00:06:02.290> the<00:06:03.070> only<00:06:03.220> deck<00:06:03.400> that<00:06:03.580> I<00:06:03.610> don't

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 
extensively the only deck that I don't

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:05.610 
extensively the only deck that I don't
think<00:06:03.970> they<00:06:04.090> really<00:06:04.300> touch<00:06:04.570> too<00:06:04.900> much<00:06:05.110> on<00:06:05.350> was

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
think they really touch too much on was

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.930 
think they really touch too much on was
Murr<00:06:05.950> males<00:06:06.160> I<00:06:06.340> think<00:06:06.490> it'll<00:06:06.610> still<00:06:06.820> be<00:06:06.910> a

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:06.940 
Murr males I think it'll still be a

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.120 
Murr males I think it'll still be a
pretty<00:06:07.180> heavily<00:06:07.900> used<00:06:08.260> deck<00:06:08.500> next<00:06:08.680> for<00:06:08.919> me<00:06:09.070> I

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
pretty heavily used deck next for me I

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.180 
pretty heavily used deck next for me I
mean<00:06:09.310> I<00:06:09.430> guess<00:06:09.660> limiting<00:06:10.660> title<00:06:11.110> 21<00:06:11.410> kind<00:06:12.010> of

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:12.190 
mean I guess limiting title 21 kind of

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.950 
mean I guess limiting title 21 kind of
took<00:06:12.639> some<00:06:12.910> of<00:06:12.940> the<00:06:13.120> luster<00:06:13.479> out<00:06:13.630> of<00:06:13.750> the<00:06:13.810> deck

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
took some of the luster out of the deck

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.960 
took some of the luster out of the deck
but<00:06:14.139> not<00:06:14.290> enough<00:06:14.680> I<00:06:14.860> think<00:06:14.889> competitive<00:06:15.790> wise

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:15.970 
but not enough I think competitive wise

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.400 
but not enough I think competitive wise
i<00:06:16.180> guess<00:06:16.330> the<00:06:16.450> two<00:06:16.600> decks<00:06:16.810> that<00:06:16.960> i'm<00:06:17.050> looking

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:17.410 
i guess the two decks that i'm looking

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.070 
i guess the two decks that i'm looking
at<00:06:17.530> next<00:06:17.889> format<00:06:18.340> are<00:06:18.550> constellar<00:06:19.150> and<00:06:19.570> spell

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
books a lot of people think the spell

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.850 
books a lot of people think the spell
books<00:06:22.419> won't<00:06:22.510> be<00:06:22.690> able<00:06:22.780> to<00:06:22.990> do<00:06:23.350> as<00:06:23.470> much<00:06:23.500> of<00:06:23.770> the

books won't be able to do as much of the
one<00:06:23.979> fate<00:06:24.220> but<00:06:24.430> i<00:06:24.520> want<00:06:24.669> to<00:06:24.729> try<00:06:24.910> it<00:06:24.940> out<00:06:25.180> so
