00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.960
 well that's it everyone here knows 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.510
 son and we end up for a factory to 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.820
 100% automatic hens which is very 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.320
 compact as you can see it's 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:19.500
 the proof the place she takes is 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.820
 that it does the fact of if we count 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.800
 really that a megan i without the walls 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.580
 bottom is the head of the hen celebrating the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.269
 4 x 4 so it's really super compact 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.759
 I train only circuit break the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.059
 roof there he has the hens you can 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.850
 feed the seeds 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:42.780
 after the hens they go the point of 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.690
 their area me I'll show you a 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.270
 foal them and their eyes arrive in 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.590
 a black coat that's the function the 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.059
 they will get through the 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.520
 suspects they will arrive in this 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.250
 funnel after the eggs he goes in his 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.320
 tonnage and veiled in this clinic 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.660
 is it this comparator is when there is 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.589
 1.9 so he sends a current that 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.990
 recover here by a hipster who sends 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.640
 this stream here and that it brings back to 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.970
 hours exemptions and it's a loop 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.610
 you have to know him 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.970
 so that's really not very hard udc 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.890
 circuit but very compact to one goes in 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.070
 make a whole 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.259
 or so to start you take from 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.790
 migdal since I live you have been shown 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:32.880
 his daughter I broke everything 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.890
 lavaud chickens they are here they are 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.020
 let's pony there babies on weekdays and 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.430
 iphone media blogs will put 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.500
 the head in the lava and suddenly it will be 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.899
 recovered in SECOPE which it is 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.460
 than the length to open the chests 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:50.540
 shelters in place that otherwise I can 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.540
 water weight 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:02:03.120
 here I am sorry but not ready 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:07.020
 so to make this plant will require 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:12.330
 a spencer a comparator august it's a 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:15.480
 late trip you will need three sets of 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:22.020
 redstone eight good products there you 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:23.750
 will take three to hooper 3 it depends 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.720
 how do you want to be 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:30.600
 you will have to bablin a sum that is 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.800
 or who it must be a tale under the 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:39.060
 only good is what if she was the 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:44.340
 who suspects after having a 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:46.770
 only lava I kept men and he me 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.050
 seems to be that or management doubt years 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.110
 miss tarn 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.680
 and yes I think it's all a 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.940
 spectrum 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.410
 so we place your too afraid of there 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.769
 Spencer rather to double the half talent 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.370
 not obvious then he puts in the place of 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.530
 this contract 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.140
 place your half to finally go and say 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:12.780
 sponsors you climb walls like that 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:15.920
 hop you place your laundry weaken 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.380
 Besides, I was waiting for that 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.140
 now there you compare this current has 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.400
 here of the writer, for example 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.299
 when it goes a notch 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.769
 an object will activate the one that gives the 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.880
 comparator that will give a current 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:37.350
 redstone now here is a 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.870
 block powder puff stone repeater on put 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.160
 a block in front of the best blogs 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:47.360
 on it we count 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:52.739
 we put the rest on top we go there 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:54.880
 but then we feed the drop hours 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:04:00.370
 so that's it's done 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:06.700
 the loan after the announced here we will place 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:09.340
 the hopper on the the hopper put the 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:13.870
 only scene and we will do the little 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:16.600
 still hen actually you put some 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.459
 blocks or mittal it does not matter I 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.600
 go hide the angles for it to be 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:26.350
 really nicer really compact this factory 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.940
 complete water over now 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.040
 you take you are for children 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.690
 take foals it's not hard to 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.570
 to carry with seeds one makes them 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:39.790
 jump in we'll do as if there 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:43.480
 had full good go let's say he 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.860
 50 pretty much and now that I'm going 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.420
 show you how to work in small 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.420
 pieces of glass but here to convey 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:05:00.450
 now when there will be 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:06.280
 eggs when there will be August eggs 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:09.670
 if spencer it goes all 10 pence and even 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.500
 17 unsuccessful olaya a baby hatched 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.120
 and which goes guardian low walks 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.770
 in the head and he will die 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:24.430
 unfortunately now we will place 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:24.850
 one or fear who is saying here we go 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.640
 to put 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:35.820
 we'll take two soft boxes 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:38.800
 place the chest we will break this block up 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:43.600
 now here we put a little bit of everything 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.680
 I do not like to bring life because 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.320
 that times the eggs and goes on to 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:48.640
 through when they are dispensed 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.290
 I'm waiting for you here left the city for 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.930
 be able to pass for to open the 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.490
 coffers 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.470
 so that's the circuit ended then that 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.360
 will do 5 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:03.210
 yes I have name of 4 if he wants the chest 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:07.660
 you put it below the 4 x 4 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:10.780
 so here is a super game circuit too little 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:13.420
 expensive magnola aston is super convenient 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:16.240
 the waiter it's super cool to have 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:19.350
 the infinite food just what 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:23.440
 to spend amazing and we have food 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:25.810
 so here's the semo here after you 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:29.770
 can make a little decoration like that 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:33.550
 fast rapier after there you can and 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:35.530
 feed your hens so you take some 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.850
 seeds or the wedding and it will do more 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:44.740
 so is this the material in addition to bp 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:46.000
 that the head bap there is steak there is no 

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.830
 of stage because they are not yet 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.100
 made what I will not do it the minute 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:53.100
 cooking we were not gone 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:07:01.270
 I will stay a little bit too 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:03.850
 this factory he goes out of his reserve 

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.590
 I stay a little f4 in this factory 

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:11.470
 and I will show you all that 

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:13.630
 will have produced so at once and 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:17.170
 well people find themselves in front of this 

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:19.300
 factory as usual which will have a lot 

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.860
 a lot produces what I stay a little 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.100
 with 14 seconds 

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:27.310
 I'm doing two three little things in my 

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:29.400
 in the world have only this factory 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.210
 I love what great shame and 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.760
 is easy to do 

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:36.400
 So here head will die a 

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:38.170
 emergency is nothing but in any case it 

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.170
 Product Foussat really produces 

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:42.580
 marsan there we get on his skin do 

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:45.130
 for now that there is a stack 

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:47.670
 in 10minutes what really plus they 

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:51.100
 100% automatic eyes a server c 

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:53.620
 it's the thing to do we do not care 

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:57.220
 miss out on food 

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:59.680
 this is funny second so 

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:01.240
 that's good I hope this tutorial 

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:03.100
 will have rained one finds oneself for a 

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:05.410
 next time this sharp early be for 

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.330
 an episode I do not know I do it at 

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:11.430
 feeling 

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:11.430
 so here I am cabbage people
