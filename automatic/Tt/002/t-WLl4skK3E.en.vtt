00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
early in the day and this just in this

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.480 
early in the day and this just in this
isn't<00:00:25.529> just<00:00:25.740> because<00:00:25.949> I'm<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.160> morning<00:00:26.369> person

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
isn't just because I'm a morning person

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.990 
isn't just because I'm a morning person
even<00:00:27.300> though<00:00:27.390> i<00:00:27.480> am<00:00:27.510> off<00:00:27.810> usually<00:00:28.019> before<00:00:28.500> 6am

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
even though i am off usually before 6am

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.220 
even though i am off usually before 6am
the<00:00:30.000> reason<00:00:30.240> i<00:00:30.330> like<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.660> light<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:31.140> the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
the reason i like the light in the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.810 
the reason i like the light in the
morning<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:31.800> when<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.070> Sun<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.610> low<00:00:32.640> on

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
morning is that when the Sun is low on

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.970 
morning is that when the Sun is low on
the<00:00:33.030> horizon<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.870> light<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.200> softer<00:00:34.710> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
the horizon the light is softer the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.160 
the horizon the light is softer the
colors<00:00:35.340> seem<00:00:35.610> more<00:00:35.790> intense<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.480> it's<00:00:36.840> easier

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
colors seem more intense and it's easier

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.900 
colors seem more intense and it's easier
to<00:00:37.290> capture<00:00:37.469> all<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.920> amazing<00:00:38.219> details<00:00:38.730> of

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
to capture all the amazing details of

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.170 
to capture all the amazing details of
nature<00:00:39.210> in<00:00:39.420> my<00:00:39.899> photographs<00:00:40.440> by<00:00:41.280> contrast<00:00:41.579> in

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
nature in my photographs by contrast in

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.970 
nature in my photographs by contrast in
the<00:00:42.239> middle<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:42.989> day<00:00:43.290> when<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.680> Sun<00:00:43.829> is

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
the middle of the day when the Sun is

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.160 
the middle of the day when the Sun is
overhead<00:00:44.120> contrasts<00:00:45.120> our<00:00:45.270> colors<00:00:45.899> seem

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
overhead contrasts our colors seem

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.959 
overhead contrasts our colors seem
flatter<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:47.100> have<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.399> contend<00:00:47.760> with<00:00:47.850> the

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
flatter you have to contend with the

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.760 
flatter you have to contend with the
harsh<00:00:48.239> shadows<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:48.989> bright<00:00:49.530> highlights

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
harsh shadows and the bright highlights

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.340 
harsh shadows and the bright highlights
so<00:00:50.579> that's<00:00:51.030> why<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.239> really<00:00:51.719> like<00:00:51.930> morning

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
so that's why I really like morning

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.410 
so that's why I really like morning
light<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.920> softer<00:00:53.309> colors<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
light is the softer colors and the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.729 
light is the softer colors and the
ability<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.809> capture<00:00:55.020> all<00:00:55.289> those<00:00:55.500> beautiful

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
ability to capture all those beautiful

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.310 
ability to capture all those beautiful
details<00:00:56.690> another<00:00:57.690> advantage<00:00:57.930> to

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
details another advantage to

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.229 
details another advantage to
photographing<00:00:59.100> early<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.579> day<00:00:59.760> is<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.180> I

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
photographing early in the day is that I

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.880 
photographing early in the day is that I
can<00:01:00.390> often<00:01:00.660> photograph<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.320> flowers<00:01:01.680> still

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
can often photograph the flowers still

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.009 
can often photograph the flowers still
covered<00:01:02.250> with<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.489> morning<00:01:02.760> dew<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.149> love<00:01:03.840> the

covered with the morning dew I love the
way<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.290> beads<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.680> water<00:01:04.710> can<00:01:05.189> look<00:01:05.400> along

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
way the beads of water can look along

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.149 
way the beads of water can look along
the<00:01:05.820> delicate<00:01:06.210> edges<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.750> flowers<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.320> know

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
that some people are able to recreate

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.210 
that some people are able to recreate
the<00:01:09.900> look<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.170> morning<00:01:10.439> dew<00:01:10.470> by<00:01:10.770> spraying<00:01:11.070> the

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
to me it doesn't look as realistic as

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.010 
to me it doesn't look as realistic as
natural<00:01:19.979> morning<00:01:20.280> dew<00:01:20.460> so<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.299> do<00:01:21.360> photograph
