Jack you're gonna pick some today I'm
going<00:00:22.939> to<00:00:23.029> show<00:00:23.180> you<00:00:23.210> how<00:00:23.450> to<00:00:23.509> fly<00:00:23.779> a

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
going to show you how to fly a

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.870 
going to show you how to fly a
helicopter<00:00:24.200> so<00:00:24.800> this<00:00:24.950> is<00:00:25.099> very<00:00:25.250> basic<00:00:25.310> for

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
helicopter so this is very basic for

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.810 
helicopter so this is very basic for
that<00:00:26.890> apparently<00:00:27.890> not<00:00:28.099> too<00:00:28.250> many<00:00:28.369> people<00:00:28.550> do

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
that apparently not too many people do

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.040 
that apparently not too many people do
know<00:00:28.910> how<00:00:29.000> to<00:00:29.060> fly<00:00:29.240> a<00:00:29.270> helicopter<00:00:29.419> as<00:00:29.900> I've

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
know how to fly a helicopter as I've

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.359 
know how to fly a helicopter as I've
come<00:00:30.200> across<00:00:30.320> a<00:00:30.470> few<00:00:30.680> people<00:00:30.919> that<00:00:31.010> just<00:00:31.220> don't

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
come across a few people that just don't

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:32.619 
come across a few people that just don't
know<00:00:31.490> how<00:00:31.550> to<00:00:31.580> fly<00:00:31.760> a<00:00:31.789> helicopter<00:00:31.939> so<00:00:32.449> whether

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:32.629 
know how to fly a helicopter so whether

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:34.390 
know how to fly a helicopter so whether
it<00:00:32.750> be<00:00:32.840> you<00:00:32.989> know<00:00:33.019> just<00:00:33.800> trying<00:00:34.040> to<00:00:34.100> get<00:00:34.250> those

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
you know hey I know how to fly this

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.619 
you know hey I know how to fly this
helicopter<00:00:42.790> so<00:00:43.790> let's<00:00:44.150> just<00:00:44.269> kill<00:00:44.480> these

so to start up wanna press Q and I'm
gonna<00:00:53.659> just<00:00:53.930> eject<00:00:54.320> here<00:00:54.530> so<00:00:54.739> we<00:00:54.890> can<00:00:55.040> eject

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
gonna just eject here so we can eject

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.250 
gonna just eject here so we can eject
and<00:00:55.790> let<00:00:56.030> it<00:00:56.150> start<00:00:56.330> up<00:00:56.510> and<00:00:56.720> I<00:00:56.780> kill<00:00:57.049> any

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.260 
and let it start up and I kill any

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.609 
and let it start up and I kill any
surroundings<00:00:58.299> while<00:00:59.299> we're<00:00:59.510> waiting<00:00:59.839> so

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:00.619 
surroundings while we're waiting so

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:01.359 
surroundings while we're waiting so
we're<00:01:01.010> good

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:01.369 
we're good

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:04.570 
we're good
starting<00:01:02.180> up<00:01:02.320> let's<00:01:03.320> get<00:01:03.409> in<00:01:03.500> the<00:01:03.559> pilot<00:01:03.860> so<00:01:04.100> as

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
starting up let's get in the pilot so as

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.039 
starting up let's get in the pilot so as
you<00:01:04.760> can<00:01:04.850> see<00:01:04.909> in<00:01:05.089> the<00:01:05.150> top<00:01:05.360> left<00:01:05.570> corner<00:01:05.630> is

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:06.049 
you can see in the top left corner is

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.230 
you can see in the top left corner is
all<00:01:06.290> of<00:01:06.470> our<00:01:06.560> different<00:01:06.950> sort<00:01:07.820> of<00:01:07.880> the<00:01:07.970> health

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
all of our different sort of the health

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.789 
all of our different sort of the health
of<00:01:08.390> all<00:01:08.510> the<00:01:08.659> main<00:01:08.840> components<00:01:09.020> so<00:01:09.560> there's

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
of all the main components so there's

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:11.740 
of all the main components so there's
the<00:01:09.920> whole<00:01:09.950> so<00:01:10.549> that's<00:01:10.700> basically<00:01:11.119> the<00:01:11.330> armor

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
the whole so that's basically the armor

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.859 
the whole so that's basically the armor
how<00:01:12.350> well<00:01:12.560> it<00:01:13.220> protects<00:01:13.729> the<00:01:14.000> co-main

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
how well it protects the co-main

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:16.660 
how well it protects the co-main
components<00:01:15.740> so<00:01:15.799> you<00:01:15.860> know<00:01:16.010> if<00:01:16.250> the<00:01:16.400> whole<00:01:16.549> is

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
components so you know if the whole is

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.090 
components so you know if the whole is
read<00:01:16.880> that<00:01:17.030> the<00:01:17.150> engine<00:01:17.540> is<00:01:17.630> down<00:01:17.900> to<00:01:18.229> it's

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
read that the engine is down to it's

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.230 
read that the engine is down to it's
gonna<00:01:19.280> that's<00:01:19.429> very<00:01:19.670> exposed

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
gonna that's very exposed

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.160 
gonna that's very exposed
so<00:01:20.960> to<00:01:21.020> rise<00:01:21.350> we<00:01:21.590> press<00:01:21.799> Q<00:01:22.130> and<00:01:22.719> we<00:01:23.719> need<00:01:23.929> to<00:01:24.049> get

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
so to rise we press Q and we need to get

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.319 
so to rise we press Q and we need to get
off<00:01:24.289> the<00:01:24.439> ground<00:01:24.679> and<00:01:25.250> for<00:01:25.429> new<00:01:25.670> players<00:01:25.880> do

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
off the ground and for new players do

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:27.700 
off the ground and for new players do
put<00:01:26.570> on<00:01:26.600> Auto<00:01:26.840> hover<00:01:27.109> when<00:01:27.259> you're<00:01:27.380> going<00:01:27.590> up

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
put on Auto hover when you're going up

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.459 
put on Auto hover when you're going up
first<00:01:28.119> so<00:01:29.119> the<00:01:29.509> engine<00:01:29.899> is<00:01:29.990> what<00:01:30.140> makes<00:01:30.350> the

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:30.469 
first so the engine is what makes the

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:32.739 
first so the engine is what makes the
whole<00:01:30.679> thing<00:01:30.710> turn<00:01:31.100> on<00:01:31.249> the<00:01:31.789> eighty<00:01:31.999> or<00:01:32.390> q<00:01:32.719> I

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:32.749 
whole thing turn on the eighty or q I

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:34.929 
whole thing turn on the eighty or q I
cannot<00:01:33.229> remember<00:01:33.530> what<00:01:33.740> that<00:01:33.920> is<00:01:34.100> but<00:01:34.759> that's

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
cannot remember what that is but that's

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:36.940 
cannot remember what that is but that's
whether<00:01:35.359> the<00:01:35.630> plane<00:01:35.929> does<00:01:36.140> this<00:01:36.320> or<00:01:36.530> this<00:01:36.649> and

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
whether the plane does this or this and

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.859 
whether the plane does this or this and
goes<00:01:37.249> into<00:01:37.429> a<00:01:37.520> full<00:01:37.850> on<00:01:37.880> made<00:01:38.210> a<00:01:38.240> stage<00:01:38.630> like

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
goes into a full on made a stage like

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.840 
goes into a full on made a stage like
that<00:01:38.899> but<00:01:39.259> we<00:01:39.350> won't<00:01:39.679> simulate<00:01:40.520> one<00:01:40.640> of<00:01:40.759> them

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
that but we won't simulate one of them

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.239 
that but we won't simulate one of them
because<00:01:41.149> we<00:01:41.270> don't<00:01:41.359> want<00:01:41.539> to<00:01:41.570> die<00:01:42.100> the<00:01:43.100> main

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:43.249 
because we don't want to die the main

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.899 
because we don't want to die the main

Emre<00:01:44.450> that's<00:01:44.899> what<00:01:45.140> that<00:01:45.289> means<00:01:45.499> and<00:01:45.710> that

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
Emre that's what that means and that

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.249 
Emre that's what that means and that

rotor<00:01:50.270> assembly<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.840> V<00:01:51.049> rotor<00:01:51.289> can<00:01:51.560> be<00:01:51.679> fixed

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:51.859 
rotor assembly the V rotor can be fixed

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:54.550 
rotor assembly the V rotor can be fixed
by<00:01:52.039> scrap<00:01:52.429> metal<00:01:52.729> and<00:01:52.909> the<00:01:53.600> I<00:01:53.630> NS<00:01:54.020> t<00:01:54.229> is<00:01:54.409> the

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
by scrap metal and the I NS t is the

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.529 
by scrap metal and the I NS t is the
instruments<00:01:55.249> so<00:01:55.579> this<00:01:55.789> is<00:01:55.909> basically<00:01:56.299> that

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
instruments so this is basically that

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:58.749 
instruments so this is basically that
little<00:01:56.840> thing<00:01:56.990> there<00:01:57.229> when<00:01:58.100> we<00:01:58.219> move<00:01:58.460> up<00:01:58.579> and

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
little thing there when we move up and

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.669 
little thing there when we move up and
down<00:01:58.909> you<00:01:59.119> know<00:01:59.240> that<00:01:59.270> tells<00:01:59.689> us<00:01:59.960> you<00:02:00.409> know<00:02:00.530> it

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
down you know that tells us you know it

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:03.249 
down you know that tells us you know it
moves<00:02:00.939> accordingly<00:02:01.939> so<00:02:02.749> it's<00:02:02.899> very<00:02:03.020> handy

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
moves accordingly so it's very handy

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:04.779 
moves accordingly so it's very handy
when<00:02:03.499> flying<00:02:03.710> a<00:02:03.829> first<00:02:04.039> person<00:02:04.249> if<00:02:04.460> we<00:02:04.549> want<00:02:04.729> to

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
when flying a first person if we want to

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:09.719 
when flying a first person if we want to
level<00:02:04.969> out<00:02:05.179> or<00:02:05.960> land<00:02:06.229> on<00:02:06.350> sea<00:02:06.590> level<00:02:07.420> so

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
level out or land on sea level so

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.110 
level out or land on sea level so
-<00:02:10.270> press<00:02:10.479> queues<00:02:10.810> to<00:02:10.840> go<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:11.849> zetas<00:02:12.849> to<00:02:13.000> go

down<00:02:13.300> very<00:02:13.540> important<00:02:14.380> things<00:02:14.590> so<00:02:15.370> to<00:02:16.209> pitch

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
down very important things so to pitch

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.550 
down very important things so to pitch
forward<00:02:16.690> we<00:02:16.840> press<00:02:17.080> W<00:02:17.530> and<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:20.380> pitch

forward we press W and to pitch

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.449 
forward we press W and to pitch
backwards<00:02:21.040> you<00:02:21.430> guess<00:02:21.610> that<00:02:21.640> it's<00:02:22.090> s<00:02:23.069> now<00:02:24.069> to

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
backwards you guess that it's s now to

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.650 
backwards you guess that it's s now to
roll<00:02:24.700> we<00:02:25.569> press<00:02:25.870> B<00:02:26.380> and<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:27.280> accordingly<00:02:27.850> so<00:02:28.600> you

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
roll we press B and a accordingly so you

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.260 
roll we press B and a accordingly so you
know<00:02:28.870> get<00:02:29.350> a<00:02:29.380> quick<00:02:29.620> feel<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.160> then<00:02:31.030> when<00:02:31.180> you

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
know get a quick feel and then when you

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.059 
know get a quick feel and then when you
feel<00:02:31.420> like<00:02:31.600> you're<00:02:31.750> ready<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:32.050> fly<00:02:32.230> turn<00:02:32.920> off

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
lean forward just a bit you will go

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.900 
lean forward just a bit you will go
forward<00:02:38.110> now<00:02:38.350> press<00:02:38.620> Q<00:02:38.950> as<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:39.430> more<00:02:39.610> you<00:02:39.760> go

forward now press Q as the more you go

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.300 
forward now press Q as the more you go
forward<00:02:40.330> the<00:02:40.450> more<00:02:40.599> you<00:02:40.750> will<00:02:40.930> descend<00:02:41.500> so

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
forward the more you will descend so

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.949 
forward the more you will descend so
counter<00:02:42.700> this<00:02:42.819> by<00:02:42.880> holding<00:02:43.150> Q<00:02:43.600> and<00:02:43.750> you<00:02:43.780> will

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
counter this by holding Q and you will

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.440 
counter this by holding Q and you will
maintain<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.530> steady<00:02:44.860> altitude<00:02:45.340> as<00:02:45.519> well<00:02:46.000> as<00:02:46.420> a

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
maintain a steady altitude as well as a

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.559 
maintain a steady altitude as well as a
rising<00:02:46.750> speed<00:02:47.140> and<00:02:47.410> to<00:02:47.709> go<00:02:47.830> backwards<00:02:48.569> we

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
rising speed and to go backwards we

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.860 
rising speed and to go backwards we
pitch<00:02:50.200> backwards<00:02:50.650> and<00:02:51.180> we<00:02:52.180> will<00:02:52.330> do<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.569> exact

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
pitch backwards and we will do the exact

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.949 
pitch backwards and we will do the exact
same<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:55.330> turn<00:02:56.140> we<00:02:57.100> can<00:02:57.280> do<00:02:57.400> this<00:02:57.780> while<00:02:58.780> we

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
same and to turn we can do this while we

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.270 
same and to turn we can do this while we
are<00:02:59.049> flying<00:02:59.290> so<00:02:59.620> let's<00:02:59.799> say<00:02:59.890> we're<00:03:00.040> flying

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
are flying so let's say we're flying

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.770 
are flying so let's say we're flying
here<00:03:00.489> let's<00:03:00.670> get<00:03:00.760> let<00:03:00.940> me<00:03:00.970> get<00:03:01.120> some<00:03:01.330> speed<00:03:01.600> for

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
here let's get let me get some speed for

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.610 
here let's get let me get some speed for
us<00:03:03.209> so<00:03:04.209> we're<00:03:04.330> doing<00:03:04.420> 100<00:03:04.989> in<00:03:05.110> a<00:03:05.200> straight<00:03:05.440> line

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
us so we're doing 100 in a straight line

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.289 
us so we're doing 100 in a straight line
if<00:03:05.860> we<00:03:06.069> Bank<00:03:06.310> of<00:03:06.489> it<00:03:06.610> and<00:03:06.790> hold<00:03:07.450> X<00:03:08.910> we<00:03:09.910> will<00:03:10.060> turn

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
if we Bank of it and hold X we will turn

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:11.400 
if we Bank of it and hold X we will turn
left

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
left

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.360

it'll<00:03:11.830> be<00:03:11.920> Bank<00:03:12.160> a<00:03:12.310> bit<00:03:12.459> and<00:03:12.730> press<00:03:13.630> C<00:03:14.190> we<00:03:15.190> will

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
it'll be Bank a bit and press C we will

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.240 
it'll be Bank a bit and press C we will
turn<00:03:15.489> a<00:03:15.549> bit<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:15.940> if<00:03:16.840> you<00:03:16.989> bank<00:03:17.470> hard<00:03:17.950> and

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
turn a bit and if you bank hard and

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.340 
turn a bit and if you bank hard and
press<00:03:18.640> S<00:03:18.940> that's<00:03:19.390> how<00:03:19.570> we<00:03:19.660> can<00:03:19.810> perform<00:03:19.959> that

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
press S that's how we can perform that

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.060 
press S that's how we can perform that
turn<00:03:20.560> but<00:03:20.769> I<00:03:21.160> say<00:03:21.400> you<00:03:21.459> try<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:22.299> do<00:03:22.390> this<00:03:22.600> in

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
turn but I say you try and do this in

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.380 
turn but I say you try and do this in
armoury<00:03:24.070> before<00:03:24.640> you<00:03:24.760> try<00:03:25.000> this<00:03:25.030> in<00:03:25.359> the

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
armoury before you try this in the

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.690 
armoury before you try this in the
actual<00:03:25.600> game<00:03:25.989> because<00:03:26.410> in<00:03:26.890> the<00:03:27.130> actual<00:03:27.489> game

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
actual game because in the actual game

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.180 
actual game because in the actual game
it's<00:03:27.940> a<00:03:28.000> lot<00:03:28.180> harder<00:03:28.420> to<00:03:28.630> find

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
it's a lot harder to find

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.460 
it's a lot harder to find
helicopters<00:03:31.090> than<00:03:31.390> in<00:03:31.630> the<00:03:31.780> armory<00:03:32.140> they're

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
helicopters than in the armory they're

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.460 
helicopters than in the armory they're
just<00:03:32.709> there<00:03:32.859> waiting<00:03:33.250> for<00:03:33.280> you<00:03:33.549> so<00:03:34.269> X<00:03:35.019> and<00:03:35.230> C

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
just there waiting for you so X and C

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.819 
just there waiting for you so X and C
that'll<00:03:36.220> turn<00:03:36.370> you<00:03:36.430> like<00:03:36.670> so<00:03:36.940> and<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:38.590> land

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
that'll turn you like so and to land

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.060 
that'll turn you like so and to land
it's<00:03:39.340> pretty<00:03:39.790> easy<00:03:40.109> all<00:03:41.109> we<00:03:41.260> gotta<00:03:41.440> do<00:03:41.650> is<00:03:41.829> just

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
it's pretty easy all we gotta do is just

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.940 
it's pretty easy all we gotta do is just
descend<00:03:42.670> down<00:03:43.480> to<00:03:43.870> where<00:03:44.320> we<00:03:44.410> want<00:03:44.590> to<00:03:44.650> land<00:03:44.799> so

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
descend down to where we want to land so

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.080 
descend down to where we want to land so
let's<00:03:45.100> say<00:03:45.220> we<00:03:45.310> want<00:03:45.489> a<00:03:45.519> lot<00:03:45.670> at<00:03:45.790> this<00:03:45.880> gas

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
let's say we want a lot at this gas

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.630 
let's say we want a lot at this gas
station<00:03:46.120> here<00:03:46.780> where<00:03:47.560> I<00:03:47.590> can<00:03:47.739> actually<00:03:48.010> refuel

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
station here where I can actually refuel

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.430 
station here where I can actually refuel
as<00:03:48.790> well<00:03:48.970> if<00:03:49.150> there's<00:03:49.359> a<00:03:49.420> pump<00:03:49.630> outside<00:03:49.810> if<00:03:50.200> not
