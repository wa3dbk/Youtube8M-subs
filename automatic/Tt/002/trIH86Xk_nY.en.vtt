00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.750
 passion real fight 

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:11.539
 what will get a large number 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:14.069
 of questions 

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:17.069
 especially if he 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.579
 basically 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.199
 when the prime minister 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:32.839
 being an exchange 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.170
 main difference 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.420
 she is a reserve system 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.300
 behaved at home 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.310
 try not to use 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.980
 ganichev cars 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.690
 and with the answer to the cottage 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.380
 man earlier 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.380
 understandably 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.940
 on the button and says 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.320
 and their families 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.320
 well, the winner 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.370
 in most pages on 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.960
 but surely lap when 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.960
 A.German 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.940
 actually 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.940
 mysticism he is unlike boxing 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.880
 vl 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.880
 it's clear too 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:12.659
 here happened on the taillight 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:14.499
 or in this way 

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:17.499
 people who are themselves 

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:21.139
 as you can see 

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:24.499
 and practically nothing 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:27.499
 Kiev Altai 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:32.339
 Oyster funds then it turns out that hard 

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:34.379
 drive and 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.519
 what tasks 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.239
 really first need to use 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.019
 very rarely 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.379
 which means that he needs it 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.829
 if suddenly an attack 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:47.939
 either inter engines 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:51.279
 let's say it is weird to work like leaks 

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:54.279
 from that part of the road don 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.159
 and the team then exactly the form 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:01.159
 simulator 1 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.689
 basically started in the press service 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:18.439
 56 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.099
 maximum speed rostat 

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:27.869
 on the first mode 

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:30.869
 beekeeping 

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:46.009
 and, accordingly, other machines would 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.829
 it's quite comfortable at the start 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.369
 Muscovite is not stalled 

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:59.839
 after that I decided not to risk 

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:02.999
 Well, and her in that it is, respectively 

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:06.809
 but nothing new came up 

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:07.839
 here above us 

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:10.839
 he survives pen mode 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.819
 before the most aggressive regime 

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:31.279
 everywhere you have to mainly for 

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:34.279
 in order to 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.050
 but 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.969
 as for action 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:11.569
 these are those scho neck 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:14.729
 actually clutch cordon 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:17.419
 spring time 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.419
 and nothing else 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:44.029
 why places 

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:46.849
 oao kamaz trophy favor that ukrainians 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:48.509
 clinics 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:51.460
 crystal as he dump 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.460
 missing mark 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.759
 that is, fatherland 

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:57.869
 dad 6 respectively 

00:05:57.869 --> 00:05:59.259
 precipitate 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:01.629
 now 6 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:02.789
 now 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:04.589
 I hope such a system 

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:07.939
 dollars and from this extra 

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:09.439
 pretend 

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:11.490
 general process 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.490
 and I already said and 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:19.419
 you again 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:22.419
 Often 

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:27.309
 all means 

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:31.999
 as became known 

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:36.909
 touching 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.619
 debt to 

00:06:42.619 --> 00:06:45.619
 with insufficient 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.990
 Boris Kolesnikov 

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:05.449
 because the viewers 

00:07:31.779 --> 00:07:33.169
 goals friends 

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:34.809
 if you don't have 

00:07:34.809 --> 00:07:36.159
 in fact 

00:07:36.159 --> 00:07:39.159
 126 rubber villages including 

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:44.999
 but the broadcast volume 

00:07:44.999 --> 00:07:46.269
 ohh next killing series
