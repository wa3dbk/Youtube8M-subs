 after a little explanation he told us 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.460
 makes a presentation with a small 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.960
 story in the game where there was a 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.630
 dog of all colors 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.130
 multicolored who was assaulted because 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.410

 at the level of graphics and realism 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.320
