00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:13.429
 stretches ktm we have the super duke r 1290 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.710
 as the name implies 1.3 liters of 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.630
 cylinder a real beast 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.080
 we go down to make you see it better indeed 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.790
 in the meantime you can see the 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.520
 speedometer with this is a mode 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.990
 demo so the effect is fake but it makes you 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.790
 see how it works 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.480
 it seems to me a real beast because i am 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:35.570
 180 ktm the horses declared on the 10 100 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.940
 he does not say it but says 10200 from 7 point 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.980
 something seconds then it comes easy 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.030
 understand that this power model does 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.340
 he has so much 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.350
 let's see the aesthetics of this one in the meantime 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.300
 motorcycle we see the orange frame a 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.700
 given this the particular a 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.280
 set up with canvas bags 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.560
 looks like some computer cases 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.320
 however they are present among the various 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.200
 accessories of this super duke r 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.910
 it does not end and it is not just a motor, however, yes 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.020
 we all look at the front with 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.880
 this lighthouse with the led effect on 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.580
 on the front for the two spheres 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.940
 sorry daylight lights we have already said i 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:17.450
 about 180 horses of whom we have 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.380
 framed now 320 mm 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.890
 bites are two discs on the front 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.579
 bites from 4-piston radial calipers 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.310
 on the back 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:27.060
 however, one caliper disc has two 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.579
 pistons 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.100
 therefore also considering the sector 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.549
 braking is seen that this bike is made 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.720
 to go fast but also to stop 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.939
 well and in time we take a look 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.520
 before closing on the back 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.039
 back we have that here the LED light 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.070
 the effect is not if you can see it 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.799
 however there are these strips that 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.179
 looks like the mask of a transformer 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.130
 Russia that these to and now we go 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:55.460
 on the other side of the stand let's see if 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.960
 we succeed in 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.110
 don't kill too many people in the 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.530
 attempt above all not to kill us 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.530
 themselves 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:09.350
 let's move on to 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.350
 in 125 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:17.160
 and here we are with the model that interested us 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:19.760
 here you find the rc 390 is a small one 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.760
 sporty 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:27.600
 415 400 of displacement karel abraham entity 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.430
 Let's see 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.310
 an exterior we see tank there 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.170
 really like the tank either for the 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.570
 but that form for the colors 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.100
 we have to keep equipment 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.770
 completely digital ones go to 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.080
 disappear any analogue indication 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.390
 I'm not sure if you can notice them from 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.030
 camcorder are really interesting 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.760
 these elements or the blocks of the 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.950
 year commands 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.989
 the backlight for all 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.180
 indicators of the various functions of the 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.720
 commands then that sees frames you see them 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.909
 also here on the part of the overwhelmed 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.099
 of the farine scenes on the front 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:05.299
 let's see the effect a little bit bad 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.140
 of this model 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:10.280
 how much we tell you 300 mm disks 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.530
 front 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.870
 excuse the front disk 230 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:19.370
 mm the risk back is a burden 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:21.680
 total of 147 kg therefore on one 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.120
 small sport horse only approx 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.180
 about forty to 0 that you find 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:31.640
 18 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.830
 only 44 400 of capacity 147 kg and 5 of 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.960
 share but then 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:41.080
 ktm for 190 with this we close the 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:44.940
 short tour of the ktm stand greeting a 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.940
