at the American DJ mega tripod profiles
now<00:00:05.850> we're<00:00:06.060> at<00:00:06.649> five<00:00:07.649> times<00:00:07.980> free<00:00:08.280> watt<00:00:08.490> LEDs

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
now we're at five times free watt LEDs

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.509 
now we're at five times free watt LEDs
in<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:10.349> flat<00:00:11.280> par<00:00:11.550> style<00:00:12.389> case<00:00:13.049> they're<00:00:13.950> perfect

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
in a flat par style case they're perfect

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.400 
in a flat par style case they're perfect
for<00:00:14.580> up<00:00:14.759> lighting<00:00:14.809> as<00:00:15.809> you<00:00:15.929> can<00:00:16.080> see<00:00:16.199> with<00:00:16.320> this

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
for up lighting as you can see with this

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.400 
for up lighting as you can see with this
one<00:00:16.470> they<00:00:16.859> have<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.330> lockable<00:00:18.330> stand<00:00:18.750> which

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
one they have a lockable stand which

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.040 
one they have a lockable stand which
means<00:00:19.680> not<00:00:20.250> how<00:00:20.520> hard<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:20.880> push<00:00:21.000> down<00:00:21.060> it's

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
means not how hard you push down it's

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.740 
means not how hard you push down it's
not<00:00:22.230> going<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.410> go<00:00:22.500> anywhere<00:00:22.710> further<00:00:23.750> and

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
not going to go anywhere further and

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.370 
not going to go anywhere further and
they<00:00:25.500> also<00:00:25.680> have<00:00:26.519> feet<00:00:27.150> on<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.420> bottom<00:00:27.660> so<00:00:28.320> you

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
they also have feet on the bottom so you

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.230 
they also have feet on the bottom so you
can<00:00:28.529> put<00:00:28.650> them<00:00:28.740> flats<00:00:29.160> or<00:00:29.340> ground<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:29.970> can<00:00:30.090> see

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
an art or fade program but we'll just

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.250 
an art or fade program but we'll just
take<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.610> look<00:00:35.730> at<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.910> back<00:00:36.090> of<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.510> one<00:00:36.750> okay

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
take a look at the back of this one okay

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.650 
take a look at the back of this one okay
so<00:00:37.290> this<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.649> back<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.100> unit<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.660> it's

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
so this is the back of a unit and it's

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.810 
so this is the back of a unit and it's
pretty<00:00:40.590> straight<00:00:40.890> forward<00:00:40.980> sorry<00:00:41.340> about<00:00:41.520> it's

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
pretty straight forward sorry about it's

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.250 
pretty straight forward sorry about it's
pretty<00:00:42.090> straight<00:00:42.329> for<00:00:42.540> them<00:00:42.660> pretty<00:00:42.870> simple

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
pretty straight for them pretty simple

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.650 
pretty straight for them pretty simple
it's<00:00:43.829> got<00:00:43.950> four<00:00:44.399> buttons<00:00:44.730> mode<00:00:45.329> setup

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
it's got four buttons mode setup

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.260 
it's got four buttons mode setup
up-and-down<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:47.039> four<00:00:47.280> digit<00:00:47.430> LED<00:00:47.940> display

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
up-and-down and a four digit LED display

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.750 
up-and-down and a four digit LED display
and<00:00:48.629> as<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:48.780> said<00:00:48.989> before<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.410> four<00:00:49.620> feet<00:00:49.860> one

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
and as I said before the four feet one

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.689 
and as I said before the four feet one
on<00:00:50.850> either<00:00:50.969> corner<00:00:51.440> and<00:00:52.440> now<00:00:53.399> what<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.610> also

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
on either corner and now what I also

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.459 
on either corner and now what I also
like<00:00:54.149> about<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.510> fixture<00:00:54.840> it's<00:00:55.140> got<00:00:55.289> power

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
like about this fixture it's got power

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.729 
like about this fixture it's got power
in<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.309> DMX<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:57.030> on<00:00:57.120> one<00:00:57.270> side<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:58.230> power<00:00:58.500> out

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
in and DMX in on one side and power out

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.439 
in and DMX in on one side and power out
and<00:00:59.070> DMX<00:00:59.370> out<00:00:59.550> on<00:00:59.730> one<00:00:59.879> side<00:00:59.910> on<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.420> other

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
and DMX out on one side on the other

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.000 
and DMX out on one side on the other
side<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.170> can<00:01:01.289> basically<00:01:01.440> just<00:01:01.680> put<00:01:01.920> them

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
side so you can basically just put them

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.160 
side so you can basically just put them
in<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.129> room<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.520> chin<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.570> cables<00:01:03.899> are<00:01:04.049> to

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
in a room a chin and the cables are to

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.399 
in a room a chin and the cables are to
be<00:01:04.229> bent<00:01:04.439> who's<00:01:04.860> got<00:01:05.040> straight<00:01:05.720> which<00:01:06.720> makes

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
be bent who's got straight which makes

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.750 
be bent who's got straight which makes
it<00:01:07.500> look<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> lot<00:01:07.860> neater<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.220> it's<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.549> lot

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
it look a lot neater and it's a lot

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.330 
it look a lot neater and it's a lot
easier<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.119> link<00:01:09.420> cables<00:01:10.110> let's<00:01:10.860> lead<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.070> mob

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
easier to link cables let's lead a mob

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.340 
easier to link cables let's lead a mob
display<00:01:11.790> at<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> minute<00:01:12.869> it's<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:13.110> an<00:01:13.200> auto
