00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:10.360
 briefly repeat that 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.890
 for this you will need 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.649
 download Kiev application 

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:17.890

 all the necessary day on the application as always 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.619
 will be if we fail 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:29.149
 cisco application we put 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:31.129
 for the simple reason that along with 

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:33.309
 it becomes all the necessary drivers for 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:34.980
 samsung smartphones 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.030
 and updated 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.350
 same drivers will again 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.290
 using the cisco application 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.580
 the application itself kesklinna during 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.300
 we will not need to pass 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.300
 will need to get out of it 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.250
 for this procedure but again 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.570
 will need an application 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.570
 you download it again from the link with it we 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.360
 let us down 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.850
 print pay archive 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.340
 protocol fell 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.340
 with four paul 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.240
 essentially let down the bottom jumped 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.130
 these 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.130
 such a file called a flicking 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.140
 networks author street we will disassemble 2 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.430
 recoverable asset 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.400
 received by the beach however serhi big 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.780
 Lying 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.880
 printout in dynamo 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.880
 run applications 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.570
 turn off our sport 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.730
 the fact that the smartphone will turn off 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:04.830
 vibrations 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.020
 so tidy up 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.349
 we need to go in mode 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.179
 to finish 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:14.349
 press the volume key held down 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:15.759
 way down 

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:18.099
 but only from the screen 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.340
 and last but not least there is such 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.819
 turn the outcome off 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.559
 court satisfied 

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:26.279
 confirms high 

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:28.859
 hand up 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:31.939
 such mode 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:33.899
 connect your smartphone 

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:36.139
 the number of Ukrainian to our 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:39.139
 edge of 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.819
 if we say that the new rules 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.019
 their 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.309
 how to fix the volume well how are we not 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:50.639
 see that at the cross 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.909
 in 37 seconds a year 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.909
 after that we are engaged in year 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:01.930
 have not yet found fifa tuesday back in may 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:05.589
 what is most important that was printed 

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:08.609
 need to open 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.409
 existing tips 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:14.649
 even for export 

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:16.919
 This procedure is very fast 

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:19.249
 therefore, shutting down no formwork 

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:21.079
 bypass 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.299
 that's just won 8 billion 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.099
 can include this program 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:28.100
 mayor 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.949
 smartphone 

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:32.949
 killed by mistake 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:35.709
 going on here at the moment 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.709
 the addition procedure for smartphones 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:44.889
 in the end reboot 

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:06.019
 that's all 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.019
 our smartphones 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.090
 application appeared 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.090
 slightly lead 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.180
 check now right away 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.729
 job market recall applications which 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:29.240
 will come rights 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.240
 for example titanium yet 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.780
 he asked from whom 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.780
 superuser

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.800
 basically everything 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.710
 as always keep in mind that if you 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.530
 make sense of it update by air 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.029
 samsung 

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:55.490
 work stops 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.860
 when skipping updated canvases you 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.969
 will see 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:02.059
 your smartphone 

00:05:02.059 --> 00:05:04.539

 this is nothing wrong if 

00:05:12.269 --> 00:05:14.479
 There will be some kind of subsequent firmware 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.689
 what you can install great 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:19.049
 using same-sex firmware through 

00:05:19.049 --> 00:05:22.270
 the application will be 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.710
 go on this topic I took off
