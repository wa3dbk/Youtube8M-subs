00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:26.580 
sight for it allows you to easily fit
the<00:03:25.030> enemy's<00:03:25.419> body<00:03:25.659> within<00:03:26.049> that<00:03:26.290> little

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
the enemy's body within that little

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.500 
the enemy's body within that little
square<00:03:27.579> or<00:03:27.760> rectangle<00:03:28.150> whichever<00:03:28.389> you<00:03:28.479> like

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
square or rectangle whichever you like

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.990 
square or rectangle whichever you like
to<00:03:28.720> call<00:03:28.870> it<00:03:28.930> I<00:03:29.079> call<00:03:29.109> it<00:03:29.260> a<00:03:29.349> square<00:03:29.590> and<00:03:30.000> it

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
to call it I call it a square and it

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.219 
to call it I call it a square and it
makes<00:03:31.180> it<00:03:31.269> easier<00:03:31.510> for<00:03:31.629> me<00:03:31.690> to<00:03:31.720> kill<00:03:31.959> them<00:03:32.109> with

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:32.229 
makes it easier for me to kill them with

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:33.509 
makes it easier for me to kill them with
the<00:03:32.319> rapid<00:03:32.500> fire<00:03:32.769> plus<00:03:33.129> you<00:03:33.310> have<00:03:33.430> the

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
the rapid fire plus you have the

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:34.920 
the rapid fire plus you have the
suppressor<00:03:33.970> so<00:03:34.120> people<00:03:34.449> don't<00:03:34.599> know<00:03:34.720> where

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
suppressor so people don't know where
