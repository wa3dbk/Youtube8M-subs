00:00:12.606 --> 00:00:15.944
 ANN SHATILLA: Welcome and welcome to the Hollywood Trend Report. I'm Anne Chatila in Los Angeles. 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.673
 This is the number one luxury lifestyle show 

00:00:19.593 --> 00:00:23.965
 In our show this week, I'll take you to the anti-aging world of Hollywood, 

00:00:24.323 --> 00:00:28.909
 The latest buzz about beauty tops headlines today, what celebrities do and buy, 

00:00:29.237 --> 00:00:30.828
 And how they get this permanent youth 

00:00:31.203 --> 00:00:36.634
 In our talk this week with senior astrologers for dermatology, Dr. Harold Lancer, 

00:00:37.161 --> 00:00:40.626
 He's the greatest man when it comes to knowing what celebrities do to keep young people, 

00:00:40.958 --> 00:00:45.451
 Known in Hollywood for his proportions, his knowledge and keen attention to patient care. 

00:00:45.832 --> 00:00:50.465
 DR. HAROLD LANCER: When people shape better, feel better. 

00:00:50.793 --> 00:00:53.932
 I always get phone calls, messages and gifts 

00:00:54.226 --> 00:00:58.546
 "As you know, it's amazing that jealousy of something is good." 

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:02.627
 ANN: We sit this week and devote a full half hour to beauty trends in Hollywood, 

00:01:03.152 --> 00:01:06.994
 All about hot celebrity products on the market today that really work, 

00:01:07.463 --> 00:01:11.812
 For the latest non-invasive embellishments. These are amazing, no pain, do not stop. 

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:13.433
 I tried it and loved it. 

00:01:13.905 --> 00:01:17.836
 It is called "Venus Fries", which is one figure in the treatment of skin tightening today 20 00: 01: 18,179 -&gt; 00: 01: 23,516 In the world, we take a look at anti-aging as a word for Athena for 2012, stem cell serum. 

00:01:23.843 --> 00:01:27.747
 What exactly are, and why can not celebrities get enough? 

00:01:28.074 --> 00:01:30.954
 That and more this week on the Hollywood Trend Report. 

00:01:31.203 --> 00:01:34.979
 In the meantime, check out our website, HollywoodTrendReport.com 

00:01:35.482 --> 00:01:39.456
 Our synchronized radio show, which is published on the website weekly in case you miss it. 

00:01:39.944 --> 00:01:42.721
 Well, let's go. Let us start. 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:44.199
 (Music) 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.448
 The latest new brand approved by the anti-aging body on the market today is the Venus Fries. 

00:01:57.589 --> 00:02:01.305
 It's now used to reduce wrinkles and tighten skin and people love it, 

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:03.856
 Because there are no stops and it is painless. 

00:02:04.292 --> 00:02:09.334
 The device is safe to get rid of wrinkles without injections or laser. 

00:02:10.151 --> 00:02:14.592
 "Venus Fries" creates the synergy of magnetism and radio frequency of the body, 

00:02:14.922 --> 00:02:19.163
 Face, stomach, under the neck, absconding, cheeks, under the eyes, arms, and legs. 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.744
 It also helps improve cellulite and reduce its circumference. 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.732
 Penetrates the treatment of multiple layers of skin. 

00:02:26.094 --> 00:02:28.680
 It warms target tissues while treating wrinkles 

00:02:29.086 --> 00:02:32.587
 And it creates enough thermal effect to induce collagen re-supply. 

00:02:32.926 --> 00:02:36.856
 I sat again with an anti-aging expert on the stars, Hollywood's top cosmetician, 

00:02:37.265 --> 00:02:42.028
 Dermatologist, Dr. Harold Lancer. I asked him, What exactly does he do? 

00:02:42.305 --> 00:02:47.263
 DR. LANCER: It's the most popular treatment anywhere in the world, Venus Fries. 

00:02:47.737 --> 00:02:52.677
 The most commonly used, magnetic locomotive "Venus Fries", is the most advanced model, 

00:02:53.147 --> 00:02:59.777
 But basically, it is without pain, in a warm and mysterious way to get the skin lifted. 

00:03:00.367 --> 00:03:05.882
 When doing so, especially on the neck, jaw area side, 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.213
 It causes the facial shape to improve. 

00:03:09.626 --> 00:03:12.085
 It causes that look to the inverted pyramid. 

00:03:12.467 --> 00:03:16.940
 It's painless. It's something, in fact there is a list waiting to be done. 

00:03:17.562 --> 00:03:21.960
 It works by using magnetic radio waves 

00:03:22.474 --> 00:03:25.582
 To consolidate the heat of the skin, all the way down to the muscles. 

00:03:26.037 --> 00:03:30.399
 We use it now in particular, not only to help the neck and face, 

00:03:30.766 --> 00:03:33.633
 But we use it to raise the body line, chest line. 

00:03:34.052 --> 00:03:36.881
 So it is a safe way to heat the skin, 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:39.658
 Make it a bit firmer and make a crisp split line. 

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:41.232
 ANN: The treatment increases blood flow 

00:03:41.637 --> 00:03:43.811
 To the treated area, and a comprehensive change of skin condition. 

00:03:44.394 --> 00:03:48.252
 Improve blood circulation and supplies more oxygen, vitamins and minerals in cells, 

00:03:48.644 --> 00:03:50.389
 During detoxification also. 

00:03:50.792 --> 00:03:52.247
 He graduated with a younger look. 

00:03:52.772 --> 00:03:56.736
 8 power waves pool in one matrix, to reduce temperature peaks. 

00:03:57.176 --> 00:03:58.624
 So I decided to try it myself. 

00:03:59.153 --> 00:04:02.792
 I had two sessions. It really is not painful at all. In fact I liked this experience. 

00:04:03.194 --> 00:04:04.804
 My goal? Smooth skin 

00:04:05.353 --> 00:04:09.606
 There is a device, the size of a computer mouse, it slips through your body. 00: 04: 09,952 -&gt; 00: 04: 11,545 easily and very comfortably. 

00:04:11.965 --> 00:04:13.993
 Most patients notice immediate results after first treatment. 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.333
 I noticed that my skin looked better. 

00:04:16.757 --> 00:04:20.994
 The procedure breaks through the body and causes the production of collagen and elastic fibers. 

00:04:21.377 --> 00:04:26.335
 Construction begins immediately, and collagen production continues for several months .. 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.539
 VANGIE EQUINA: It's like flat iron for hair. So this is iron for the skin. 

00:04:33.258 --> 00:04:36.361
 ANN: He really relaxes nerves and I can sleep. 

00:04:37.005 --> 00:04:43.477
 VANGIE: The good thing about it, it does not hurt, but it works. 

00:04:43.807 --> 00:04:49.594
 ANN: Do not hurt. Feel warm. It's soothing, I like the movement up and down. 

00:04:50.934 --> 00:04:51.858
 Are you going home with me? 

00:04:52.323 --> 00:04:52.951
 VANGIE: Oh sure. 

00:04:53.295 --> 00:04:55.506
 ANN: I would like to do it every day at home. 

00:04:55.912 --> 00:04:56.415
 VANGIE: (Laughter) Of course. 

00:04:56.835 --> 00:04:57.477
 ANN: This is beautiful. 

00:04:57.835 --> 00:05:03.009
 VANGIE: will tighten the skin, engage the skin, glare your skin, especially on the neck. 

00:05:03.804 --> 00:05:06.383
 The women here are always the problem. 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.314
 ANN: I feel the heat, and what do you do heat, "Vangui"? 

00:05:11.131 --> 00:05:17.184
 VANGIE: It increases the collagen synthesis and elastin. It's just a fabrication of your skin. 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.081
 There is another patient who has been treated. 

00:05:20.435 --> 00:05:26.228
 "It feels like a stone massage, that's how it looked," she said. 83 00: 05: 26,570 -&gt; 00: 05: 31,160 ANN: You're right, it feels like a hot massage stone. This is exactly what you feel. 

00:05:31.824 --> 00:05:35.164
 I feel that the heat is getting hotter, with time. 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.411
 So, the increase in heat becomes useful, right? 

00:05:39.758 --> 00:05:40.202
 VANGIE: Yes. 

00:05:41.002 --> 00:05:45.601
 Ann: Mary Murphy, 34, working in advertising from Los Angeles, wanted a little 

00:05:45.947 --> 00:05:48.518
 Tensile around the waist. She was happy to experience the latest treatments. She felt the same way she did. I enjoyed the quiet effect. 

00:05:52.498 --> 00:05:58.335
 MARY MURPHY: It was warm to very warm. Slightly flipped, and a little tingling. 

00:05:58.864 --> 00:06:02.981
 I felt a kind of gentleness. 

00:06:03.277 --> 00:06:07.741
 It was almost like a massage on my stomach, I really enjoyed that feeling a bit, 

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:09.396
 And feel like magic is achieved. 

00:06:09.953 --> 00:06:12.127
 ANN: People are addicted to it. Once you have done one part of the body, 

00:06:12.512 --> 00:06:14.547
 They want to do the next part. Can you see what is happening to you? 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:18.354
 MARY: I can see why people say so, I would definitely do it again. 

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:23.020
 ANN: Compared to Teramag, Venus Fries is painless, replicable and cost-effective. 

00:06:24.167 --> 00:06:28.527
