00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
diamond point for three and then there

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:20.330 
diamond point for three and then there
is<00:01:08.150> that<00:01:15.200> then<00:01:16.200> use<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:17.090> which<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:19.159> to<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.670 

and<00:01:32.560> then<00:01:33.330> the<00:01:34.330> heavy<00:01:34.570> which<00:01:34.810> is<00:01:34.930> my<00:01:35.080> favorite

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
and then the heavy which is my favorite

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:50.389 
and then the heavy which is my favorite

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.499 

then<00:01:51.399> there<00:01:51.729> is<00:01:51.759> the<00:01:51.970> engineer<00:01:52.810> /<00:01:53.340> Thailand

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
then there is the engineer / Thailand

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:03.420 
then there is the engineer / Thailand
diamond<00:01:55.509> diamond<00:02:00.780> certainly<00:02:01.780> diamond<00:02:02.430> and

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
diamond diamond certainly diamond and

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.100 
diamond diamond certainly diamond and
then<00:02:03.580> there<00:02:03.729> is<00:02:03.759> the<00:02:04.060> one<00:02:04.240> that<00:02:04.509> targets<00:02:05.050> the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
then there is the one that targets the

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.460 
then there is the one that targets the
points<00:02:05.500> means<00:02:05.679> the<00:02:05.860> medic<00:02:06.220> one<00:02:07.110> as<00:02:08.110> you<00:02:08.320> can

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
points means the medic one as you can

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.220 
points means the medic one as you can
see<00:02:08.649> that<00:02:08.800> loop<00:02:09.130> is<00:02:09.459> a<00:02:09.489> glitch<00:02:10.239> mob<00:02:10.570> for<00:02:10.959> some

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
see that loop is a glitch mob for some

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.610 
see that loop is a glitch mob for some
