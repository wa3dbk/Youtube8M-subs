00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.789 

okay<00:00:02.730> so<00:00:02.790> off-screen<00:00:03.510> i<00:00:03.750> have<00:00:03.959> just<00:00:03.990> taped<00:00:04.589> a

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
okay so off-screen i have just taped a

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.700 
okay so off-screen i have just taped a
piece<00:00:04.980> of<00:00:05.040> tracing<00:00:05.400> paper<00:00:05.700> on<00:00:06.029> top<00:00:06.330> of<00:00:06.710> that

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
piece of tracing paper on top of that

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.110 
piece of tracing paper on top of that
basic<00:00:08.189> diamond<00:00:08.580> shape<00:00:08.790> that<00:00:08.970> i've<00:00:09.090> created

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
basic diamond shape that i've created

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.299 
basic diamond shape that i've created
and<00:00:09.719> now<00:00:10.080> what<00:00:10.290> i'm<00:00:10.380> going<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.559> do<00:00:10.679> is<00:00:10.710> connect

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
and now what i'm going to do is connect

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.879 
and now what i'm going to do is connect
these<00:00:11.460> three<00:00:11.880> dots<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:13.080> third<00:00:13.410> vanishing

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
these three dots to the third vanishing

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.090 
these three dots to the third vanishing
point<00:00:14.099> at<00:00:14.250> this<00:00:14.340> weight<00:00:14.700> fall<00:00:15.389> away<00:00:15.570> from<00:00:16.170> my

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
point at this weight fall away from my

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:54.200 
point at this weight fall away from my
horizon<00:00:17.550> line

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.360 

okay<00:00:54.870> now<00:00:55.379> one<00:00:55.590> thing<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.920> can<00:00:56.100> notice

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
okay now one thing that you can notice

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.460 
okay now one thing that you can notice
is<00:00:56.700> that<00:00:56.850> unlike<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.660> two<00:00:57.840> point<00:00:58.110> perspective

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
is that unlike a two point perspective

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.400 
is that unlike a two point perspective
we<00:00:59.950> have<00:01:00.220> the<00:01:00.850> top<00:01:01.090> of<00:01:01.270> this<00:01:01.390> box<00:01:01.690> pretty<00:01:02.260> much

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
we have the top of this box pretty much

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.400 
we have the top of this box pretty much
it<00:01:02.920> was<00:01:03.070> done<00:01:03.220> in<00:01:03.370> the<00:01:03.460> same<00:01:03.640> way<00:01:04.020> how<00:01:05.020> we<00:01:05.080> would

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
it was done in the same way how we would

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.870 
it was done in the same way how we would
do<00:01:05.530> it<00:01:05.560> if<00:01:05.770> we<00:01:05.920> were<00:01:06.010> dealing<00:01:06.160> with<00:01:06.490> this<00:01:06.610> in<00:01:06.790> a

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
do it if we were dealing with this in a

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.580 
do it if we were dealing with this in a
two-point<00:01:07.240> perspective<00:01:07.360> and<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.470> only

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
two-point perspective and the only

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.020 
two-point perspective and the only
difference<00:01:08.950> between<00:01:09.190> a<00:01:09.430> two<00:01:09.760> point

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
difference between a two point

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.780 
difference between a two point
perspective<00:01:10.620> cube<00:01:11.620> and<00:01:11.860> this<00:01:11.890> one<00:01:12.340> is<00:01:12.550> that

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
perspective cube and this one is that

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.120 
perspective cube and this one is that
these<00:01:13.300> verticals<00:01:13.960> they're<00:01:14.260> no<00:01:14.410> longer<00:01:14.620> truly

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
these verticals they're no longer truly

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.430 
these verticals they're no longer truly
parallel<00:01:15.790> to<00:01:15.910> one<00:01:16.060> another<00:01:16.090> in<00:01:16.630> fact<00:01:16.870> they're

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
parallel to one another in fact they're

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.190 
parallel to one another in fact they're
actually<00:01:18.070> converging<00:01:18.820> at<00:01:19.720> that<00:01:19.930> third

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
actually converging at that third

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.710 
actually converging at that third
finishing<00:01:20.710> point<00:01:20.890> it<00:01:21.580> is<00:01:21.790> far<00:01:22.030> away<00:01:22.270> from<00:01:22.480> the

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
finishing point it is far away from the

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.820 
finishing point it is far away from the
horizon<00:01:23.170> line<00:01:23.200> and<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:25.450> reason<00:01:25.840> why<00:01:26.530> we

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
horizon line and the reason why we

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.980 
horizon line and the reason why we
needed<00:01:27.070> to<00:01:27.220> take<00:01:27.400> three<00:01:27.700> pieces<00:01:27.910> of<00:01:28.240> tracing

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
needed to take three pieces of tracing

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.890 
needed to take three pieces of tracing
pay<00:01:29.080> off<00:01:29.470> 11<00:01:30.130> x<00:01:30.220> 17<00:01:30.250> together<00:01:30.820> is<00:01:31.120> because<00:01:31.450> we

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
pay off 11 x 17 together is because we

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.660 
pay off 11 x 17 together is because we
really<00:01:32.200> cannot<00:01:32.470> place<00:01:32.800> at<00:01:33.040> third<00:01:33.250> vanishing

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
really cannot place at third vanishing

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.400 
really cannot place at third vanishing
point<00:01:33.910> too<00:01:34.060> close<00:01:34.360> to<00:01:34.570> the<00:01:34.630> horizon<00:01:34.720> line<00:01:35.050> and

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
point too close to the horizon line and

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.000 
point too close to the horizon line and
because<00:01:35.619> if<00:01:35.710> we<00:01:35.830> did<00:01:36.010> then<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:36.970> rate<00:01:37.180> of<00:01:38.010> the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
because if we did then the rate of the

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.910 
because if we did then the rate of the
tapering<00:01:39.490> of<00:01:39.729> these<00:01:40.510> lines<00:01:40.810> or<00:01:41.080> the<00:01:41.140> rates<00:01:41.830> of

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
tapering of these lines or the rates of

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.650 
tapering of these lines or the rates of
conversion<00:01:42.369> will<00:01:42.550> be<00:01:42.670> happening<00:01:43.060> a<00:01:43.180> bit<00:01:43.390> too

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
conversion will be happening a bit too

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.260 
conversion will be happening a bit too
quickly<00:01:43.990> and<00:01:44.380> then<00:01:44.680> if<00:01:45.369> it<00:01:45.640> was<00:01:45.850> that<00:01:45.880> what<00:01:46.240> you

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
quickly and then if it was that what you

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.840 
quickly and then if it was that what you
happen<00:01:46.660> then<00:01:46.900> a<00:01:47.560> great<00:01:48.040> sense<00:01:48.250> of<00:01:48.369> distortion

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
happen then a great sense of distortion

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.790 
happen then a great sense of distortion
will<00:01:49.060> take<00:01:49.479> place<00:01:49.630> in<00:01:49.900> your<00:01:50.140> image<00:01:50.440> will<00:01:50.590> just

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
will take place in your image will just

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.920 
will take place in your image will just
look<00:01:50.920> really<00:01:51.250> strange<00:01:51.520> so<00:01:52.270> right<00:01:52.540> now<00:01:52.570> these

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
look really strange so right now these

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.999 
look really strange so right now these
are<00:01:53.229> tapering<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.540> conversion<00:01:55.680> at<00:01:56.680> a<00:01:56.800> pretty

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
are tapering the conversion at a pretty

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.910 
are tapering the conversion at a pretty
good<00:01:57.070> rate<00:01:57.190> now<00:01:57.820> since<00:01:58.210> I<00:01:58.360> want<00:01:58.570> to<00:01:58.660> create

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
good rate now since I want to create

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.499 
good rate now since I want to create
sort<00:01:59.920> of<00:01:59.979> building<00:02:00.460> so<00:02:00.729> I<00:02:00.759> don't<00:02:01.060> want<00:02:01.300> it<00:02:01.390> to

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
sort of building so I don't want it to

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.720 
sort of building so I don't want it to
go<00:02:02.050> all<00:02:02.290> the<00:02:02.650> way<00:02:02.680> outside<00:02:03.220> the<00:02:03.250> patient<00:02:03.700> on

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
go all the way outside the patient on

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.580 
go all the way outside the patient on
this<00:02:03.940> system<00:02:04.090> in<00:02:04.360> it<00:02:04.600> right<00:02:04.840> here<00:02:05.140> so<00:02:05.290> this<00:02:05.440> is

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
this system in it right here so this is

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.710 
this system in it right here so this is
not<00:02:06.190> a<00:02:06.250> tall<00:02:06.520> building<00:02:06.700> it<00:02:07.180> may<00:02:07.360> be<00:02:07.420> like<00:02:07.690> a

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
not a tall building it may be like a

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.690 
not a tall building it may be like a
two-story<00:02:08.380> building<00:02:08.860> but<00:02:09.310> we're<00:02:09.489> hovering

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
two-story building but we're hovering

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.610 
two-story building but we're hovering
about<00:02:10.179> it<00:02:10.420> and<00:02:10.600> we're<00:02:10.720> looking<00:02:10.840> down<00:02:11.260> at<00:02:11.500> this

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
about it and we're looking down at this

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.259 
about it and we're looking down at this
two-story<00:02:12.070> building<00:02:12.459> so<00:02:12.880> what<00:02:13.000> we're<00:02:13.180> going

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
two-story building so what we're going

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:19.580 
two-story building so what we're going
to<00:02:13.390> do<00:02:13.510> is<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:16.230> draw<00:02:17.230> some<00:02:17.470> point<00:02:17.739> to<00:02:18.400> complete

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
to do is to draw some point to complete

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:41.740 
to do is to draw some point to complete
this<00:02:21.180> building

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.000 

now<00:02:42.320> since<00:02:42.650> in<00:02:43.430> this<00:02:44.230> drawing<00:02:45.230> we<00:02:45.680> are<00:02:45.800> trying

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
now since in this drawing we are trying

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.630 
now since in this drawing we are trying
to<00:02:46.100> create<00:02:47.230> the<00:02:48.230> exterior<00:02:48.860> of<00:02:49.070> this<00:02:49.250> building

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
to create the exterior of this building

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.270 
to create the exterior of this building
so<00:02:49.850> what<00:02:50.000> we<00:02:50.150> will<00:02:50.420> need<00:02:50.450> is<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.530> two<00:02:51.680> walls<00:02:52.010> in

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
so what we will need is the two walls in

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.820 
so what we will need is the two walls in
the<00:02:52.370> front<00:02:52.640> to<00:02:53.150> complete<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:54.320> building<00:02:54.680> in

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
the front to complete the building in

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.070 
the front to complete the building in
next<00:02:55.520> exercise<00:02:56.030> we're<00:02:56.630> going<00:02:56.660> to<00:02:56.900> actually

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
next exercise we're going to actually

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.380 
next exercise we're going to actually
take<00:02:57.470> the<00:02:57.620> thickness<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.820> two<00:02:58.970> walls<00:02:59.180> in<00:02:59.330> the

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
take the thickness the two walls in the

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.570 
take the thickness the two walls in the
front<00:02:59.630> off<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:00.500> building<00:03:00.860> it<00:03:01.010> will<00:03:01.130> also<00:03:01.220> take

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
front off the building it will also take

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.130 
front off the building it will also take
the<00:03:01.700> ceiling<00:03:02.000> off<00:03:02.120> so<00:03:02.300> we<00:03:02.450> can<00:03:02.570> actually<00:03:02.930> look

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
the ceiling off so we can actually look

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:04.840 
the ceiling off so we can actually look
through<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.130> building<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:04.610> see<00:03:04.760> the

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
through the building and see the

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.930 
through the building and see the
interior<00:03:05.120> but<00:03:05.510> that<00:03:05.660> will<00:03:05.810> be<00:03:05.900> our<00:03:06.020> next<00:03:06.170> video

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.110 

alright<00:03:10.940> so<00:03:11.240> now<00:03:11.420> i<00:03:11.830> have<00:03:12.970> intensifying<00:03:13.970> the

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
alright so now i have intensifying the

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.000 
alright so now i have intensifying the
lines<00:03:14.330> there's<00:03:14.750> basically<00:03:14.930> tracing<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:15.830> same

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
lines there's basically tracing the same

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.070 
lines there's basically tracing the same
lines<00:03:16.190> that<00:03:16.430> we<00:03:16.550> have<00:03:16.700> created<00:03:16.850> earlier<00:03:17.360> for

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
lines that we have created earlier for

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.290 
lines that we have created earlier for
the<00:03:18.110> basic<00:03:18.470> shape<00:03:18.680> now<00:03:19.220> let's<00:03:19.910> just<00:03:20.090> say<00:03:20.239> that

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
the basic shape now let's just say that

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.180 
the basic shape now let's just say that
if<00:03:20.750> I<00:03:20.870> wanted<00:03:21.170> my<00:03:21.260> building<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:21.680> be<00:03:21.770> this<00:03:21.890> tall

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
if I wanted my building to be this tall

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.050 
if I wanted my building to be this tall
so<00:03:22.910> let's<00:03:23.150> say<00:03:23.440> in<00:03:24.440> the<00:03:24.560> front<00:03:24.800> corner<00:03:25.070> this<00:03:25.850> is

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
so let's say in the front corner this is

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.850 
so let's say in the front corner this is
the<00:03:26.209> height<00:03:26.390> of<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.690> building<00:03:26.840> so<00:03:27.440> from<00:03:27.650> here

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
the height of the building so from here

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.280 
the height of the building so from here
we<00:03:28.670> should<00:03:28.730> now<00:03:29.000> have<00:03:29.030> to<00:03:29.390> connect<00:03:29.840> them<00:03:30.020> back

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
we should now have to connect them back

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.320 
we should now have to connect them back
to<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:30.650> two<00:03:30.800> finishing<00:03:31.190> point<00:03:31.370> now<00:03:31.880> just<00:03:32.150> like

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
to the two finishing point now just like

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.780 
to the two finishing point now just like
a<00:03:32.360> two<00:03:32.600> part<00:03:32.870> you<00:03:33.140> know<00:03:33.260> perspective<00:03:33.500> and<00:03:33.980> you

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
a two part you know perspective and you

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.220 
a two part you know perspective and you
know<00:03:34.910> where<00:03:35.300> all<00:03:35.450> the<00:03:35.600> lines<00:03:35.810> would<00:03:35.930> have<00:03:36.110> to

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
know where all the lines would have to

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.020 
know where all the lines would have to
answer<00:03:36.380> to<00:03:36.560> you<00:03:36.770> the<00:03:36.890> two<00:03:37.010> vanishing<00:03:37.280> point<00:03:37.640> in

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
answer to you the two vanishing point in

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.090 
answer to you the two vanishing point in
a<00:03:38.150> three<00:03:38.360> point<00:03:38.600> perspective<00:03:38.840> situation<00:03:39.560> all

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
a three point perspective situation all

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.590 
a three point perspective situation all
of<00:03:40.280> your<00:03:40.489> lines<00:03:40.730> would<00:03:40.910> have<00:03:41.120> to<00:03:41.270> answer<00:03:41.420> to

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
of your lines would have to answer to

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.170 
of your lines would have to answer to
you<00:03:41.810> not<00:03:42.200> one<00:03:42.590> not<00:03:42.830> two<00:03:42.890> but<00:03:43.130> all<00:03:43.610> three

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
you not one not two but all three

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.300 
you not one not two but all three
vanishing<00:03:44.989> point<00:03:45.230> now<00:03:45.560> since<00:03:45.769> we<00:03:45.950> have<00:03:45.980> one

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
vanishing point now since we have one

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.810 
vanishing point now since we have one
this<00:03:47.030> way<00:03:47.470> far<00:03:48.470> away<00:03:48.650> from<00:03:48.769> from<00:03:49.340> us<00:03:49.489> from<00:03:49.670> the

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
this way far away from from us from the

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.120 
this way far away from from us from the
horizon<00:03:50.209> line<00:03:50.239> and<00:03:50.570> these<00:03:51.110> are<00:03:51.320> now<00:03:51.440> in<00:03:51.980> these

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
horizon line and these are now in these

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.890 
horizon line and these are now in these
vertical<00:03:52.640> lines<00:03:52.670> are<00:03:52.970> already<00:03:53.269> going<00:03:53.480> to<00:03:53.780> the

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
vertical lines are already going to the

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.070 
vertical lines are already going to the
third<00:03:54.380> vanishing<00:03:54.799> point<00:03:55.010> so<00:03:55.430> these<00:03:55.580> are<00:03:55.700> now

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
third vanishing point so these are now

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.720 
third vanishing point so these are now
pinching<00:03:57.080> to<00:03:57.860> the<00:03:57.980> vanishing<00:03:58.190> point<00:03:58.519> to<00:03:58.610> the

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
pinching to the vanishing point to the

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:16.880 
pinching to the vanishing point to the
left<00:03:58.940> and<00:03:59.360> also<00:03:59.720> the<00:03:59.870> one<00:04:00.019> to<00:04:00.170> the<00:04:00.260> right

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.340 

so<00:04:17.890> now<00:04:18.100> we<00:04:18.160> have<00:04:18.340> a<00:04:18.970> basic<00:04:19.660> structure<00:04:20.080> of<00:04:20.110> a

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
so now we have a basic structure of a

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.740 
so now we have a basic structure of a
building<00:04:20.740> that<00:04:20.920> we're<00:04:21.550> hovering<00:04:21.820> above<00:04:22.540> it

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
building that we're hovering above it

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.630 
building that we're hovering above it
and<00:04:22.870> we're<00:04:23.170> looking<00:04:23.290> at<00:04:23.650> this<00:04:23.890> building<00:04:24.250> we

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
and we're looking at this building we

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.610 
and we're looking at this building we
can<00:04:24.790> see<00:04:24.940> the<00:04:25.060> top<00:04:25.270> and<00:04:25.690> we<00:04:25.810> can<00:04:25.990> see<00:04:26.170> the<00:04:26.290> front

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
can see the top and we can see the front

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.250 
can see the top and we can see the front
right<00:04:26.920> and<00:04:27.190> the<00:04:27.340> front<00:04:27.580> left<00:04:28.090> and<00:04:28.450> more

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
right and the front left and more

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.410 
right and the front left and more
importantly<00:04:29.680> because<00:04:30.250> we<00:04:30.610> are<00:04:30.820> now<00:04:31.060> of<00:04:31.270> a

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
importantly because we are now of a

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.530 
importantly because we are now of a
higher<00:04:31.770> elevation<00:04:32.770> looking<00:04:33.550> down<00:04:33.730> at<00:04:33.940> this<00:04:34.090> so

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
higher elevation looking down at this so

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.390 
higher elevation looking down at this so
that's<00:04:34.780> why<00:04:34.990> the<00:04:35.530> vertical<00:04:35.980> lines<00:04:36.190> they

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
that's why the vertical lines they

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.510 
that's why the vertical lines they
appear<00:04:36.910> to<00:04:36.940> be<00:04:37.180> also<00:04:37.750> moving<00:04:38.380> away<00:04:38.680> from<00:04:38.860> us<00:04:39.130> so

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
appear to be also moving away from us so

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.070 
appear to be also moving away from us so
in<00:04:39.730> an<00:04:39.850> X<00:04:40.030> exercise<00:04:40.450> I'm<00:04:40.690> going<00:04:40.750> to<00:04:40.900> tape

in an X exercise I'm going to tape

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.480 
in an X exercise I'm going to tape

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
another piece of tracing paper over this

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.390 
another piece of tracing paper over this
and<00:04:42.760> I'll<00:04:43.030> show<00:04:43.270> you<00:04:43.330> how<00:04:43.660> to<00:04:43.720> add<00:04:43.920> a<00:04:44.920> number<00:04:45.160> of

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
and I'll show you how to add a number of

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.610 
and I'll show you how to add a number of

just to embellish this building a little

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.900 
just to embellish this building a little
bit<00:04:49.690> more
