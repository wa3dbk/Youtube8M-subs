 it does not pass electric, if it does not pass the 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.900
 Verification is like going to the doctor 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.120
 you go to the doctor to give you a 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.750
 diagnosis for verification wants 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.750
 say that it is

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.810

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.300
