correct on that two images cou this is

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.029 
correct on that two images cou this is
the<00:00:28.240> era<00:00:28.420> obviously<00:00:28.930> pointing<00:00:29.320> to<00:00:29.470> it<00:00:29.619> but

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
the era obviously pointing to it but

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.100 
the era obviously pointing to it but
there<00:00:30.189> are<00:00:30.310> three<00:00:30.609> dots<00:00:30.910> on<00:00:31.150> here<00:00:31.359> one<00:00:31.630> is<00:00:31.810> red

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.110 
there are three dots on here one is red

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.619 
there are three dots on here one is red
one<00:00:32.739> is<00:00:32.890> green<00:00:33.160> one<00:00:33.850> is<00:00:34.000> blue

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:34.629 
one is green one is blue

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:36.570 
one is green one is blue
right<00:00:35.110> significant<00:00:35.769> so<00:00:35.830> this<00:00:35.980> is<00:00:36.100> this<00:00:36.280> is<00:00:36.430> the

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:36.580 
right significant so this is this is the

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.020 
right significant so this is this is the
actual<00:00:36.820> discovery<00:00:37.210> image<00:00:37.600> basically<00:00:39.030> two

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
actual discovery image basically two

actual discovery image basically two
astronomers<00:00:40.330> we're<00:00:40.780> looking<00:00:41.170> one<00:00:41.770> little

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
astronomers we're looking one little

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.799 
astronomers we're looking one little
patch<00:00:42.100> of<00:00:42.250> sky<00:00:42.430> very<00:00:42.879> very<00:00:43.149> far<00:00:43.360> away<00:00:43.390> looking

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
patch of sky very very far away looking

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.049 
patch of sky very very far away looking
for<00:00:44.020> exactly<00:00:44.290> this<00:00:44.500> kind<00:00:44.710> of<00:00:44.829> thing<00:00:45.059> stars

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
for exactly this kind of thing stars

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.000 
for exactly this kind of thing stars
don't<00:00:46.390> move<00:00:46.629> planets<00:00:47.500> or<00:00:47.620> anything<00:00:47.890> that's

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
don't move planets or anything that's

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.709 
don't move planets or anything that's
like<00:00:48.129> a<00:00:48.190> planet<00:00:48.610> does<00:00:48.879> so<00:00:49.420> this<00:00:49.600> is

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:49.719 
like a planet does so this is

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:51.029 
like a planet does so this is
color-coded<00:00:50.020> this<00:00:50.469> is<00:00:50.559> what<00:00:50.710> they<00:00:50.829> saw<00:00:51.010> on

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
color-coded this is what they saw on

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:52.950 
color-coded this is what they saw on
different<00:00:51.579> nights<00:00:51.730> they're<00:00:52.360> looking<00:00:52.660> for<00:00:52.809> one

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
different nights they're looking for one

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.959 
different nights they're looking for one
thing<00:00:53.140> moving<00:00:53.530> they<00:00:53.680> color-coded<00:00:54.250> it<00:00:54.370> to<00:00:54.550> show

00:00:54.959 --> 00:00:54.969 
thing moving they color-coded it to show

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:57.240 
thing moving they color-coded it to show
that<00:00:55.300> all<00:00:55.989> these<00:00:56.260> stars<00:00:56.530> are<00:00:56.770> staying<00:00:56.949> still

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
that all these stars are staying still

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.130 
that all these stars are staying still
this<00:00:57.789> thing<00:00:58.000> is<00:00:58.120> moving<00:00:58.270> and<00:00:58.629> the<00:00:58.809> way<00:00:58.960> it's

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
this thing is moving and the way it's

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.349 
this thing is moving and the way it's
moving<00:00:59.320> so<00:00:59.829> this<00:01:00.039> is<00:01:00.219> just<00:01:00.489> one<00:01:00.730> it's<00:01:01.180> one

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
moving so this is just one it's one

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.590 
moving so this is just one it's one
object<00:01:01.719> color-coded<00:01:02.410> is<00:01:02.710> really<00:01:03.129> delonix

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
object color-coded is really delonix

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.430 
object color-coded is really delonix
flitters<00:01:04.600> and<00:01:04.750> a<00:01:04.780> whole<00:01:04.960> different<00:01:05.259> part<00:01:05.350> of

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
flitters and a whole different part of

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.620 
flitters and a whole different part of
the<00:01:05.530> sky<00:01:05.680> so<00:01:05.950> this<00:01:06.130> is<00:01:06.310> way<00:01:06.580> out<00:01:06.940> there<00:01:06.970> this<00:01:07.479> is

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
the sky so this is way out there this is

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:08.969 
the sky so this is way out there this is
way<00:01:07.750> out<00:01:07.869> this<00:01:07.960> is<00:01:08.110> more<00:01:08.410> than<00:01:08.590> more<00:01:08.860> than

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
way out this is more than more than

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:10.889 
way out this is more than more than
twice<00:01:09.160> as<00:01:09.220> far<00:01:09.550> away<00:01:09.640> as<00:01:09.729> Pluto<00:01:10.060> unbelievable

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
twice as far away as Pluto unbelievable

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:13.889 
twice as far away as Pluto unbelievable
why<00:01:11.110> does<00:01:11.289> this<00:01:11.440> matter<00:01:11.710> Cori<00:01:12.160> well<00:01:12.910> there<00:01:13.840> are

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
why does this matter Cori well there are

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:15.449 
why does this matter Cori well there are
two<00:01:13.990> ways<00:01:14.020> you<00:01:14.170> can<00:01:14.349> look<00:01:14.410> at<00:01:14.619> it<00:01:14.740> I<00:01:14.890> think<00:01:14.950> I

00:01:15.449 --> 00:01:15.459 
two ways you can look at it I think I

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:17.010 
two ways you can look at it I think I
look<00:01:15.729> at<00:01:15.849> it<00:01:15.970> first<00:01:16.149> of<00:01:16.300> all<00:01:16.360> as<00:01:16.539> a<00:01:16.569> as<00:01:16.869> an

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
look at it first of all as a as an

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.639 
look at it first of all as a as an
exploration<00:01:17.399> question<00:01:18.399> that<00:01:19.380> there<00:01:20.380> you<00:01:20.590> know

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649 
exploration question that there you know

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:22.320 
exploration question that there you know
we<00:01:21.220> know<00:01:21.369> where<00:01:21.520> we<00:01:21.670> are<00:01:21.700> on<00:01:21.819> earth<00:01:21.940> we've

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330

came from go back to the other image you
guys<00:01:50.470> will<00:01:50.739> show<00:01:50.920> because<00:01:51.340> we're<00:01:51.789> over<00:01:52.060> here

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:52.239 
guys will show because we're over here

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:54.389 
guys will show because we're over here
on<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:52.420> left<00:01:52.630> right<00:01:52.899> it's<00:01:53.289> right<00:01:53.500> so<00:01:53.649> we're

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
on the left right it's right so we're

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.760 
on the left right it's right so we're
over<00:01:54.520> here<00:01:54.849> okay<00:01:55.300> a<00:01:55.330> little<00:01:56.140> out<00:01:56.319> here<00:01:56.560> yeah

over here okay a little out here yeah

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.350 
over here okay a little out here yeah
and<00:01:56.800> this<00:01:57.039> thing<00:01:57.250> called<00:01:57.459> Makemake<00:01:58.119> is<00:01:58.179> way

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
and this thing called Makemake is way

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.639 
and this thing called Makemake is way
out<00:01:58.509> here<00:01:58.750> that's<00:01:58.989> right<00:01:59.259> but<00:01:59.440> so<00:01:59.560> that's

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
out here that's right but so that's

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:01.740 
out here that's right but so that's
another<00:01:59.950> dwarf<00:02:00.580> planet<00:02:01.060> if<00:02:01.300> you<00:02:01.420> want<00:02:01.539> to<00:02:01.630> find

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
another dwarf planet if you want to find

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.460 
another dwarf planet if you want to find
out<00:02:01.869> where<00:02:02.160> VP<00:02:03.160> 1<00:02:03.369> 1<00:02:03.610> 3<00:02:03.849> or<00:02:03.970> Biden<00:02:04.660> is<00:02:04.810> located

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
out where VP 1 1 3 or Biden is located

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.190 
out where VP 1 1 3 or Biden is located
keep<00:02:06.399> keep<00:02:06.700> walking<00:02:07.090> about<00:02:07.300> another<00:02:07.539> 30<00:02:07.959> feet

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
keep keep walking about another 30 feet

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.699 
keep keep walking about another 30 feet
that<00:02:08.229> Wow

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
that Wow

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.529 
that Wow
you<00:02:09.160> can<00:02:09.340> see<00:02:09.580> that<00:02:09.789> far<00:02:10.060> and<00:02:10.209> this<00:02:10.270> is<00:02:10.330> the

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
you can see that far and this is the

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.089 
you can see that far and this is the
closest<00:02:10.929> that<00:02:11.020> gets<00:02:11.200> this<00:02:11.349> time<00:02:11.500> when<00:02:12.040> it

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
closest that gets this time when it

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.280 
closest that gets this time when it
really<00:02:12.370> gets<00:02:12.550> cooking<00:02:12.790> it's<00:02:13.120> 15<00:02:13.629> times<00:02:13.840> as<00:02:14.110> far

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
really gets cooking it's 15 times as far

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.100 
really gets cooking it's 15 times as far
away<00:02:14.379> as<00:02:14.500> Pluto<00:02:14.920> that's<00:02:15.099> incredible<00:02:15.730> takes

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
away as Pluto that's incredible takes

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.090 
away as Pluto that's incredible takes
4,300<00:02:17.110> years<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.380> go<00:02:17.500> around<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.740> Sun

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
4,300 years to go around the Sun

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.500 
4,300 years to go around the Sun
I<00:02:18.130> don't<00:02:18.460> know<00:02:18.520> how<00:02:18.610> you<00:02:18.700> know<00:02:18.910> that<00:02:19.120> but<00:02:19.390> I

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
trust you what is a dwarf planet

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.140 
trust you what is a dwarf planet
so<00:02:22.420> Dorf<00:02:22.780> planet<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.800> fact<00:02:24.520> you<00:02:24.670> hear<00:02:24.880> weird

so Dorf planet the fact you hear weird

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.880 
so Dorf planet the fact you hear weird
terms<00:02:25.420> like<00:02:25.570> them<00:02:25.780> is<00:02:25.960> actually<00:02:26.320> scientists

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
terms like them is actually scientists

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.440 
terms like them is actually scientists
saying<00:02:27.130> there<00:02:27.880> are<00:02:27.940> things<00:02:28.120> out<00:02:28.270> there<00:02:28.300> we

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
saying there are things out there we

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.300 
saying there are things out there we
don't<00:02:28.690> really<00:02:28.840> understand<00:02:29.350> it's<00:02:29.620> it's<00:02:30.100> a

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
don't really understand it's it's a

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.710 
don't really understand it's it's a
dwarf<00:02:30.580> planet<00:02:30.640> is<00:02:31.030> kind<00:02:31.240> of<00:02:31.270> a<00:02:31.330> catch-all<00:02:31.660> term

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
dwarf planet is kind of a catch-all term

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.420 
dwarf planet is kind of a catch-all term
for<00:02:32.110> something<00:02:32.290> it's<00:02:32.560> it's<00:02:32.890> round<00:02:33.190> like<00:02:33.310> a

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
for something it's it's round like a

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.000 
for something it's it's round like a
planet<00:02:33.880> it<00:02:34.000> sort<00:02:34.330> of<00:02:34.390> looks<00:02:34.570> like<00:02:34.690> a<00:02:34.720> planet

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
planet it sort of looks like a planet

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.220 
planet it sort of looks like a planet
but<00:02:36.010> it<00:02:36.160> doesn't<00:02:36.550> orbit<00:02:37.000> in<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.540> regular<00:02:38.200> way

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
but it doesn't orbit in a regular way

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.930 
but it doesn't orbit in a regular way
like<00:02:38.650> all<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:38.980> all<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.370> planets<00:02:39.730> that<00:02:39.790> we

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
like all the all the planets that we

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:40.530 
like all the all the planets that we
know

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
know

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.390 
know
would<00:02:40.690> this<00:02:40.810> be<00:02:41.020> part<00:02:41.260> of<00:02:41.380> our<00:02:41.560> solar<00:02:41.860> system

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
would this be part of our solar system

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.010 
would this be part of our solar system
so<00:02:42.850> it's<00:02:43.000> part<00:02:43.180> of<00:02:43.240> our<00:02:43.330> songs<00:02:43.660> it's<00:02:43.930> be

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
so it's part of our songs it's be

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.650 
so it's part of our songs it's be
outside<00:02:44.560> it's<00:02:45.280> a<00:02:45.400> it's<00:02:45.580> a<00:02:45.670> hold<00:02:45.940> it's<00:02:46.360> a<00:02:46.480> whole

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
outside it's a it's a hold it's a whole

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.270 
outside it's a it's a hold it's a whole
new<00:02:46.840> zone<00:02:47.110> it's<00:02:47.380> called<00:02:47.560> it's<00:02:47.890> called<00:02:48.040> the

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
new zone it's called it's called the

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.410 
new zone it's called it's called the
they're<00:02:48.550> calling<00:02:48.760> it<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:48.910> inner<00:02:49.060> Oort<00:02:49.360> cloud

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
they're calling it the inner Oort cloud

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.390 
they're calling it the inner Oort cloud
you<00:02:50.290> don't<00:02:50.320> really<00:02:50.530> really<00:02:50.860> you<00:02:51.190> don't<00:02:51.310> really

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
you don't really really you don't really

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.470 
you don't really really you don't really
need<00:02:51.550> to<00:02:51.640> know<00:02:51.790> that<00:02:51.970> all<00:02:52.090> you<00:02:52.210> need<00:02:52.330> to<00:02:52.390> know

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
need to know that all you need to know

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.910 
need to know that all you need to know
is<00:02:52.600> there<00:02:52.930> really<00:02:53.110> are<00:02:53.320> these<00:02:53.440> two<00:02:53.680> solar

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
is there really are these two solar

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.380 
is there really are these two solar
systems<00:02:54.280> there's<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.550> solar<00:02:55.030> system<00:02:55.300> with

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
systems there's the solar system with

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.480 
systems there's the solar system with
the<00:02:55.810> classical<00:02:56.230> planets<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:56.800> then<00:02:57.340> there's

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
the classical planets and then there's

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.830 
the classical planets and then there's
this<00:02:57.670> whole<00:02:57.880> other<00:02:58.090> zone<00:02:58.360> we<00:02:58.600> haven't

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
this whole other zone we haven't

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.150 
this whole other zone we haven't
explored<00:02:59.170> and<00:02:59.560> now<00:02:59.740> they're<00:02:59.890> saying<00:03:00.040> because

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
explored and now they're saying because

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.790 
explored and now they're saying because
of<00:03:00.580> how<00:03:00.670> this<00:03:00.850> plant<00:03:01.120> this<00:03:01.300> new<00:03:01.930> dwarf<00:03:02.410> planet

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
of how this plant this new dwarf planet

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.200 
of how this plant this new dwarf planet
moves<00:03:03.010> that<00:03:03.430> there<00:03:03.550> may<00:03:03.640> actually<00:03:03.730> be<00:03:03.940> an<00:03:04.030> even

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
moves that there may actually be an even

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.450 
moves that there may actually be an even
bigger<00:03:04.360> planet<00:03:04.890> something<00:03:05.890> bigger<00:03:06.190> than<00:03:06.370> the

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
bigger planet something bigger than the

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.430 
bigger planet something bigger than the
earth<00:03:06.610> I<00:03:06.910> guess<00:03:07.000> that's<00:03:07.630> when<00:03:07.960> I<00:03:07.990> was<00:03:08.140> going<00:03:08.290> -

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
earth I guess that's when I was going -

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.590 
earth I guess that's when I was going -
did<00:03:08.620> you<00:03:08.710> study<00:03:08.950> this<00:03:09.160> all<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.490> time<00:03:09.700> is<00:03:09.970> that

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
did you study this all the time is that

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.570 
did you study this all the time is that
why<00:03:10.810> it's<00:03:10.960> so<00:03:11.110> significant<00:03:11.800> because<00:03:12.310> there's

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
why it's so significant because there's

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.460 
why it's so significant because there's
more<00:03:12.820> beyond<00:03:13.120> that<00:03:13.150> if<00:03:13.810> there's<00:03:14.020> more<00:03:14.260> beyond

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
more beyond that if there's more beyond

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.720 
more beyond that if there's more beyond
that<00:03:14.500> and<00:03:14.830> then<00:03:14.950> there's<00:03:15.100> more<00:03:15.220> beyond<00:03:15.430> that<00:03:15.490> I

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
that and then there's more beyond that I

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.120 
that and then there's more beyond that I
mean<00:03:15.910> I<00:03:15.940> think<00:03:16.000> what<00:03:16.720> we're<00:03:16.840> seeing<00:03:16.990> is<00:03:17.170> okay

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
mean I think what we're seeing is okay

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.770 
mean I think what we're seeing is okay
you<00:03:18.190> know<00:03:18.310> if<00:03:18.640> you<00:03:18.790> if<00:03:18.820> you<00:03:19.030> if<00:03:19.060> you<00:03:19.330> watch<00:03:19.540> the
