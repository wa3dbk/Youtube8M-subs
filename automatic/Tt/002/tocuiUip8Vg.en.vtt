00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:37.459 
progression I think there's a lot more
progression<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.479> go<00:01:36.630> but<00:01:36.810> it's<00:01:36.929> definitely<00:01:37.170> at

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:37.469 
progression to go but it's definitely at

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:39.620 
progression to go but it's definitely at
a<00:01:37.499> very<00:01:37.740> high<00:01:37.890> moment<00:01:38.460> right<00:01:38.909> now<00:01:38.969> it's<00:01:39.569> not

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
a very high moment right now it's not

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.300 
a very high moment right now it's not
plateaued<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:40.439> it's<00:01:40.590> it's<00:01:40.829> pretty<00:01:41.069> far<00:01:41.249> up

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
plateaued but it's it's pretty far up

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.550 
plateaued but it's it's pretty far up
there<00:01:41.609> what<00:01:42.149> else<00:01:42.329> can<00:01:42.539> dudes<00:01:42.869> do<00:01:43.079> where<00:01:43.380> is

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
there what else can dudes do where is

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.580 
there what else can dudes do where is
there<00:01:43.740> left<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.009> go<00:01:44.189> guys<00:01:44.759> can<00:01:44.999> start<00:01:45.240> doing

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
there left to go guys can start doing

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.270 
there left to go guys can start doing
different<00:01:46.590> tricks<00:01:46.770> in<00:01:46.889> the<00:01:46.950> backcountry

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
different tricks in the backcountry

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.800 
different tricks in the backcountry
you've<00:01:47.549> only<00:01:47.729> seen<00:01:47.999> a<00:01:48.060> few<00:01:48.149> doubles<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:48.780> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
you've only seen a few doubles in the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.749 
you've only seen a few doubles in the
backcountry<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.649> think<00:01:49.889> features<00:01:50.159> is

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
backcountry and I think features is

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.179 
backcountry and I think features is
where<00:01:51.420> we're<00:01:51.990> going<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.170> see<00:01:52.499> progression<00:01:52.770> as

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
where we're going to see progression as

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.950 
where we're going to see progression as
well<00:01:53.369> like<00:01:53.549> people<00:01:53.909> building<00:01:54.359> things<00:01:54.719> that

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
well like people building things that

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.629 
well like people building things that
don't<00:01:55.259> look<00:01:55.469> normal<00:01:55.950> people<00:01:56.369> are<00:01:56.459> going<00:01:56.549> to

00:01:56.629 --> 00:01:56.639 
don't look normal people are going to

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:58.249 
don't look normal people are going to
create<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.509> know<00:01:57.539> different<00:01:57.810> types<00:01:58.139> of

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
create you know different types of

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.779 
create you know different types of
features<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.859> do<00:01:59.009> radical<00:01:59.429> maneuvers

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
features and do radical maneuvers
