00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.210
 Welcome to Tutopolistv today I will show you how to complete the 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.480
 Display unit on an iPhone 6 changes. 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.260
 This repair is pretty easy and it can do the same as any home 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.510
 only problem is that it is quite expensive. 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.849
 If you are looking for a cheap alternative search then I recommend you part 1 and 2 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:15.849
 to look at. 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.520
 The instructions can be found at the end of this video linked or just on me channel 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.769
 Search for "Switch iPhone 6 Glass". 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:23.810
 Incidentally, in my video description you will find spare parts and tools I also 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.279
 just read through it. 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.679
 So pick up your tools and let's get started. 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:47.360
 So let's start with the iPhone first. 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.610
 Then we take a Pentalobenschraubzieher and solve the two lower screws. 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.140
 Next we take a suction cup and try to lift the glass should the glass 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.710
 To be extremely splintered like this case you have to take a plastic tool and the glass carefully 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:16.649
 levering. 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:20.060
 Now flip the display up and lean against a full bottle. 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.049
 Please put it so that it can not tilt. 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.799
 Then we solve a total of 5 screws. 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.859
 Attention the screws are different in length please do not confuse the screws later. 

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:39.909
 Now put the holder aside and use a plastic tool to gently undo the 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:46.549
 Display flex cable. 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:53.399
 So now we start disassembling the display to make it easier to get it on the glass. 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.960
 First, we solve the two screws of the Home Button bracket. 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:03.630
 Now put the holder aside. 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.630
 Then we separate the flex cable with a plastic tool and solve the whole 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.420
 Home button from glue. 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.290
 It's best to push the Home Button from the other side with your finger. 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:22.130
 Next we solve another flex cable attached to the heat shield. 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.740
 We now remove another bracket by loosening the 3 screws. 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.540
 Then put the holder aside. 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:41.750
 Now gently lift the front camera from right to left and remove the 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:58.040
 Earpiece, only then we can free the rest of the flex cables from the glue. 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:11.030
 Then we remove 7 screws of the display heat protection and remove it carefully. 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:22.570
 Now we solve all plastic holder from the glass. 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.460
 Attention the plastic mounts are very fragile, they do not try to break and pay attention to it 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.740
 that they do not fly around like me they are transparent and you could see them 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.050
 lose fast attention we need the plastic mounts necessarily if your 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.270
 new display the plastic parts are not there. 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.860
 If you can join, you can skip this step. 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.550
 Finally, removing the dust cover pushes him carefully out of the other side. 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.580
 So now we can start directly with the demolition. 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.470
 We now take the new display and bring all the plastic mounts and the dust cover 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.810
 Again, if you do not want to glue properly, use glue here for seconds. 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.000
 Please pay close attention to how they are glued on it. 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:17.150
 Next we bring the display heat protection and screw it back with the 7 screws 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.150
 firmly. 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:24.990
 Attention one of the upper flex cables must be clamped underneath. 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:34.620
 Now we bring the flex cable unit consist of proximity sensor front camera and environmental microphones 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.620
 back to. 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.750
 Before we can fix it completely, the earpiece has to be clamped in between 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.280
 only then we can fix it with the bracket and fasten it with the 3 screws. 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.870
 Attention, the golden pins of the earpieces must point upwards. 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:58.000
 Then we glue the home button back to the right position to connect the flex cable 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.760
 and fix it with the bracket and the 2 screws. 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:10.560
 So now we take the display and connect all 5 flex cables. 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:21.820
 Attention, be very careful not to damage flex cables or connectors. 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.880
 Then we take back our full bottle and reject the display again so that 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.020
 it can not tip over and fasten the bracket with the 5 screws. 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.800
 Pay attention to the correct order. 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.750
 Now we shut it all up and push the display down until it is in the right position 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.960
 is locked and bring the two lower screws back on and that's it 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.930
 Let's check if we did everything right and everything works properly. 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.300
 Now your iPhone 6 should look like new again. 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.740
 So people I hope I could save you a lot of money, time and trouble!
