00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.529
 well here in the park is cadet 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.810
 we have a very complete team 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.580
 from the people who take care of 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.230
 the horses the people that are in 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.119
 veterinary the people who are in the 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.650
 shows we all form a group in 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.649
 a team could say that one day 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.640
 normal starts with cleaning the 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:35.220
 stables 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.559
 from six in the morning to eight and a half 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.149
 the morning roughly ending the 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.010
 cleaning of the stables are 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.989
 provides concentrated food to 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.050
 horses respecting each one their 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.579
 ration and its diet good as they see 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.580
 This is one of the activities that 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.769
 we do in the park since eight and 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.720
 mean in the morning and it's cleaning 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:59.120
 helmets was too much brushing 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.120
 animals and then the bathroom 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.650
 in this part we are seeing what 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.300
 Benjamin does a cleanup of what 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.229
 it's the palm of the helmets because it 's 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.900
 where wet material is hit and if 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.940
 this cleaning is not done can reach 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.220
 cause us problems of disease 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.180
 the white line of the helmet 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.440
 the imprint of the foals is programmed 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.560
 consists in the sensitization of the 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.270
 foals since they are born until 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.190
 it's time to respect them and we 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.350
 It is very useful to contribute to the 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.240
 early training of these animals 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.890
 without greater risk on the other hand also 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.410
 It helps us that the visitor can 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.060
 touch them with the greatest security without 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.420
 can be attacked by these 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.420
 animals 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.760
 here the process consists and as 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.630
 teach us to work the horse go away 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.830
 and combining with one that is having 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.900
 contact with one and do not be afraid 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.330
 one that the horse works with his 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.320
 naturalness as is the horse of that it 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.850
 do on foot after you start to work 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.700
 mounted on the horse and is the same 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.040
 process that teach them to work to that 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.149
 they begin to obey what you 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.420
 is teaching 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.060
 once the horses are well 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.519
 attended in the morning we 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.209
 we take care of familiarizing them with the 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.209
 show 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:32.720
 already with the horses with the charros with 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:36.740
 the amazonas we focus on rescuing the 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.680
 Mexican tradition that is to hit us more 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.320
 to the bylaws of regulation as much as 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.940
 of costumes originality present 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.280
 the most you can to beat us as much 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.940
 that the originality of the suit can be 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.980
 charro that we carry with much pride 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.080
 part of the ingredient so that the 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.470
 show looks as it should be is 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.930
 have or bring it in the blood the pride 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.630
 of that charro is very important for 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.100
 this show and in the reason why 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.630
 which I work in horses is 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.070
 because I have been taught by the child 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.310
 love for horses I bring from 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.750
 that I was born the staff has to be a 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.060
 personal 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.880
 and committed to his work very 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.550
 responsible but above all I had 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.520
 love and passion for horses in 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.870
 personal to me that's the best thing that I 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.870
 it could have happened in all my life
