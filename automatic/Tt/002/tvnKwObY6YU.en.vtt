catalyst mines a three by three area in
front<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.450> when<00:01:12.810> it's<00:01:12.840> uncharged

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
front of you and when it's uncharged

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.320 
front of you and when it's uncharged
should<00:01:13.470> only<00:01:13.590> mindset<00:01:14.100> one<00:01:14.220> block<00:01:14.369> deep<00:01:14.549> when

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
should only mindset one block deep when

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.090 
should only mindset one block deep when
it's<00:01:15.450> fully<00:01:15.630> charged<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.170> mines<00:01:16.380> 16<00:01:16.950> blocks

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
it's fully charged it mines 16 blocks

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.530 
it's fully charged it mines 16 blocks
deep<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:18.240> uses<00:01:18.720> no<00:01:19.080> fuel<00:01:19.380> if<00:01:19.850> it<00:01:20.850> no<00:01:21.150> block<00:01:21.390> is

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
deep it uses no fuel if it no block is

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.840 
deep it uses no fuel if it no block is
broken<00:01:21.900> so<00:01:22.759> first<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.850> need<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.000> charge<00:01:24.270> it

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
broken so first you need to charge it

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.109 
broken so first you need to charge it
see<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:26.939> know<00:01:27.090> fuels<00:01:27.390> used<00:01:27.600> however<00:01:28.439> if<00:01:28.650> I

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
see you know fuels used however if I

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.569 
see you know fuels used however if I
open<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.150> up<00:01:30.360> take<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:30.930> out<00:01:31.400> now<00:01:32.400> it's

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
open this up take this out now it's

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.520 
open this up take this out now it's
fully<00:01:32.820> charged<00:01:35.210> 16<00:01:36.210> blocks<00:01:36.360> deep<00:01:36.600> not<00:01:37.320> quite

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
fully charged 16 blocks deep not quite

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.770 
fully charged 16 blocks deep not quite
16<00:01:37.950> but<00:01:38.189> well<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.820> 16<00:01:39.150> blocks<00:01:39.329> deep<00:01:39.600> because

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
16 but well it is 16 blocks deep because

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.460 
16 but well it is 16 blocks deep because
I<00:01:39.960> meet<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.470> for<00:01:40.770> long<00:01:41.030> Forks<00:01:42.030> tour<00:01:42.180> long

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
portable T&amp;T if you just right-click

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.220 
portable T&amp;T if you just right-click
with<00:02:26.069> it<00:02:26.239> as<00:02:27.239> you<00:02:27.390> can<00:02:27.510> see<00:02:27.660> it<00:02:27.900> made<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.080> little

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
with it as you can see it made a little

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:37.670 
with it as you can see it made a little
hole<00:02:29.090> charge<00:02:30.090> it<00:02:30.739> makes<00:02:31.739> a<00:02:31.800> bigger<00:02:31.950> hole<00:02:36.680> keep

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
hole charge it makes a bigger hole keep

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.670 
hole charge it makes a bigger hole keep
charging<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:39.050> makes<00:02:40.050> it<00:02:40.170> much<00:02:40.230> bigger<00:02:40.410> hole

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.670 

I'm<00:02:44.269> not<00:02:45.269> sure<00:02:45.330> if<00:02:45.750> this<00:02:45.900> explosion<00:02:46.350> does

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
I'm not sure if this explosion does

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.070 
I'm not sure if this explosion does
damage<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.239> animals<00:02:48.239> okay<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:48.989> does<00:02:50.600> it<00:02:51.600> does

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
damage to animals okay it does it does

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.430 
damage to animals okay it does it does
not<00:02:52.230> have<00:02:52.380> alternate<00:02:52.800> modes<00:02:54.110> so<00:02:55.110> for<00:02:55.380> example

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
not have alternate modes so for example

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.479 
not have alternate modes so for example
I<00:02:55.830> just<00:02:56.040> use<00:02:56.160> them<00:02:58.190> see<00:02:59.190> it's<00:02:59.310> more

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
I just use them see it's more

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.910 
I just use them see it's more
