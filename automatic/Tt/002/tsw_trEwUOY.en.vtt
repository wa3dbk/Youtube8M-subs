00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:12.840
 Actually this stage and this stage 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.660
 I had recorded that video but my voice was not included at all 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.360
 I will start from the middle 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.360

 Nainda go unless it first here to go to the front 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.039
 Hey, it's suddenly the boss fight again Heavy Snake 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:42.270
 I'm doing World 8 now, but because World 8 is really difficult 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.300
 I'm afraid I 'll be able to do this over the next week 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.300
 The 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.730
 English 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.899
 Heavy snakes have once fought 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.829
 There is an impression that was not so strong, but how is it 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:10.020
 Pretty in appearance is huge 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.020
 Oh look has changed 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.820
 Azo remembered so so I remembered 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.820
 Oh yes on this ah 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.380
 Climb on that plate 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.880
 Bento 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.770
 I have to kill 3 in a row but 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.770
 Oh my God come to that kind of thing 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.730
 Cormorants selfish 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.720
 Jan small violent 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.720
 A shot came in ah 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.120
 Bach 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.590
 It feels like the last time I had only spit a day 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.900
 I can not climb 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.640
 The lined 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.640
 After all this not so strong 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.220
 Even if I 'm not good at action games 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.780
 I can't climb Alley , but I can't climb , but what are you doing 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.540
 It told how 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.079
 I really like this 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.390
 It was rare that you said it was an easy win 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.160
 It's a bit messy to get a coin, but I'm not collecting it separately 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.740
 Husband one leaving is you 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.740
 I can't take it away 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:13.400
 I think the next one is probably a kupper but I have a bad feeling 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.400
 Will stage what about you Do not'm is likely 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:21.569
 Taking a coin 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.569
 Everybody throws up and sets up 1 million when 1 million yen of coins are set up 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.970
 It is really rare to break through a rare one-on-one 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.730
 I can go to Atsugi Kuppa Castle 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.020
 I'm glad i'm finally cooper 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.650
 170 not enough at all 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:05.270
 But eight after not enough at all 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.550
 Pakko mother 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:13.340
 I thought I could make a huge Kuppa castle 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:16.750
 Then I have to collect green stars 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.750
 I wonder what to do 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:23.430
 Soldier doctor 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:25.500
 I wonder since World 8 is really difficult 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.490
 And so 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.600
 I'm starting-I'm taking it 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.849
 Ooh 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:36.650
 Then let's do this a little more than once 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:41.740
 To's it today in 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.740
 It is in when you do not take the video that there is a work to collect the Green Star 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.620
 I remembered that it was difficult 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.620
 It was difficult this 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:04.259
 Oh But the very first Green Star okay okay because are taken 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.990
 Please people of a thin This is it husband's This 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:15.990
 It was Neto' brother 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:28.180
 There was a stamp on it but there was no way 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.180
 I can not see it anymore 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:39.010
 But after the end of one of the green star I'm sure there somewhere 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.010
 husband 

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.430
 at her a bit dangerous 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.190
 delicious 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.430
 That's it. 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:54.310
 Get off here 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:58.180
 eh 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:01.200
 Still Madema clients customers wait a little example I Wait a minute I'm not a goal 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.200
 It is not a goal yet 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:09.350
 That kind of goal like Musashi 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.350
 Goal-like 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:18.200
 e 0 Wait a moment 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:21.760
 The goal is where the last greeper is 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.760
 It's not like it's different here 

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:27.510
 Yup 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:31.280
 I really don't know where I really don't know 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:31.280
 Yes the biggest point 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:44.540
 I intended to do the ruined Kuppa castle, but issued because the Green Star is not enough 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:47.120
 I wonder if 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:50.139
 Oh, I took one now 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.139
 7 Do not you come 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.409
 That's right 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:06.009
 Well then, collect green stars when not taking videos 

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:08.310
 I think that I want to go to Kuppa Castle when I got 170 pieces this time 

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:12.210
 I'm short 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:18.800
 Wow was fucking action game is to me an extreme clumsiness guess that this time will enter smoothly 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:18.800
 I think I would like to finish it here
