 [Desteni] Interview with Cross-Dimensional Space Connections - Jack - Human History (65) Is the Earth Hollow? 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.010
 This is Jack. Is the earth hollow? 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.400
 It used to be, but not now 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:41.210
 I say this because - at the center of the earth - a long time ago... 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.680
 When the Atlantis and Annu are still busy deriving their plans 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:51.090
 When Anu brought Nibbi to the side of the earth to be able to take gold, it was... making gold 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.330
 And materialize the gold - from the magma in the center of the earth - 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.770
 The spatial gravity of the trans-dimensional dimension is placed at the center of the earth - 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.180
 Realizing gold, all within the core of the earth 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.210
 With and above, with in the center... 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:17.890
 They created one.... - This is before everything becomes materialized (* manifestation into matter) - Please, people, listen well 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:28.660
 Before everything became materialized, they placed a cross-dimensional spatial metal configuration in the center of the core. 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.600
 The reason is that: 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.520
 That is where people stay "stay" 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.000
 Where are the Annunaki stays? 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.220
 When they are taking gold from the Earth's core - when using the crystals in the four corners of the world to refine (gold) 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.300
 So, that is where they stay - Nibeiro is still isolated from the Earth; 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.490
 Near the earth, but not inside the earth 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:05.880
 So, that's where some of the Annunaki people are waiting - a few, not the whole planet - 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.510
 And this metal configuration is placed around to ensure that the Annunaki community does not affect - 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.830
 Or form a relationship with the Atlantis 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.380
 Because - still remember that I said 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.690
 Atlantis feels uncomfortable with Annunaki living on their planet 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.080
 Because that interaction relationship can happen 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.150
 And may affect Atlantis, as well as the performance of Annunaki... 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.120
 So, this metal layer - in the center of the earth 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.300
 Basically to ensure that the impact of this interaction does not exist 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.020
 Or interactive contact 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.900
 So Atlantis and Annunaki will not affect each otherâ€™s performance in existence. 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.090
 This metal configuration in the core center, basically - 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.740
 Separation (*two groups) and form a complete trans-dimensional space vacuum 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.730
 At the center of the core 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.290
 So Atlantis and Annunaki will not affect each other. 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.230
 However, I said the Annunaki ethnic group... After a while 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.290
 After the inevitable must leave - so they are gone 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.020
 And that's like...a hollow space...in the middle of the earth's core 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.810
 But that is no longer there, because that is a cross-dimensional spatial configuration. 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:31.120
 Just as everything is realized as a solid (* manifestation into matter), then the trans-dimensional metaphysical entity - solidified with the earth - 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.120
 But as far as magma is there, there are other things. 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.870
 It still exists across the dimensionality of the dimension, this metal configuration is still there - 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.460
 Even - the earth is not hollow - not 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.320
 Thank you, this is Jack.
