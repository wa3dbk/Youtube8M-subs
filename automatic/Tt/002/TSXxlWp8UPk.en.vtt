speed until blended does the batter will
be<00:01:20.320> stiff<00:01:22.049> now<00:01:23.049> this<00:01:23.289> was<00:01:23.770> more<00:01:24.009> than<00:01:24.039> stiff

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
be stiff now this was more than stiff

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.219

this<00:01:24.609> was<00:01:24.759> super<00:01:25.149> dry<00:01:25.390> now<00:01:25.689> I<00:01:25.719> think<00:01:26.109> the

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
this was super dry now I think the

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.469 
this was super dry now I think the
problem<00:01:26.649> here<00:01:26.680> was<00:01:26.890> that<00:01:27.729> I'm<00:01:27.880> having<00:01:28.359> the

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
problem here was that I'm having the

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.330 
problem here was that I'm having the
recipe<00:01:28.869> like<00:01:29.020> putting<00:01:29.259> half<00:01:29.469> the<00:01:29.740> eggs<00:01:29.920> half

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
recipe like putting half the eggs half

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.359 
recipe like putting half the eggs half
the<00:01:30.549> oil<00:01:30.579> and<00:01:31.090> so<00:01:31.600> on<00:01:31.630> but<00:01:32.350> the<00:01:32.590> brownie<00:01:32.859> mix<00:01:33.039> is

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
the oil and so on but the brownie mix is

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:36.179 
the oil and so on but the brownie mix is
not<00:01:33.549> half<00:01:33.850> of<00:01:34.060> a<00:01:34.180> 9<00:01:34.329> by<00:01:34.479> 13<00:01:34.689> mix<00:01:35.170> it's<00:01:35.560> it's<00:01:35.950> an<00:01:36.070> 8

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
not half of a 9 by 13 mix it's it's an 8

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:37.800 
not half of a 9 by 13 mix it's it's an 8
by<00:01:36.369> 8<00:01:36.399> which<00:01:36.820> is<00:01:37.000> probably<00:01:37.270> a<00:01:37.359> little<00:01:37.539> bit<00:01:37.630> more

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
by 8 which is probably a little bit more

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:38.940 
by 8 which is probably a little bit more
than<00:01:37.990> half<00:01:38.170> so<00:01:38.409> I<00:01:38.439> would<00:01:38.590> have<00:01:38.679> needed<00:01:38.770> a

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
than half so I would have needed a

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.919 
than half so I would have needed a
little<00:01:39.130> bit<00:01:39.189> more<00:01:39.399> than<00:01:39.579> half<00:01:39.759> of<00:01:39.969> the<00:01:40.750> wet

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
little bit more than half of the wet

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:43.740 
little bit more than half of the wet
ingredients<00:01:41.109> in<00:01:41.799> there<00:01:41.979> like<00:01:42.159> 2<00:01:42.369> eggs<00:01:42.570> or<00:01:43.570> like

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
ingredients in there like 2 eggs or like

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.230 
ingredients in there like 2 eggs or like
1<00:01:43.929> in<00:01:44.079> half<00:01:44.649> eggs<00:01:45.009> or<00:01:45.250> something<00:01:45.579> like<00:01:45.700> that<00:01:45.759> so

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
1 in half eggs or something like that so

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.810 
1 in half eggs or something like that so
what<00:01:47.200> I<00:01:47.229> decided<00:01:47.649> to<00:01:47.890> do<00:01:48.009> here<00:01:48.280> is<00:01:48.460> to<00:01:48.579> try<00:01:48.729> to

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
what I decided to do here is to try to

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.300 
what I decided to do here is to try to
salvage<00:01:49.119> this<00:01:49.509> is<00:01:49.780> to<00:01:50.469> add<00:01:50.799> a<00:01:50.829> little<00:01:51.070> bit<00:01:51.249> of

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
salvage this is to add a little bit of

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.849 
salvage this is to add a little bit of
water<00:01:52.950> yeah<00:01:53.950> I<00:01:54.100> gave<00:01:54.280> up<00:01:54.429> on<00:01:54.549> it<00:01:54.609> there<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.829> I

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:56.859 
water yeah I gave up on it there so I

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:59.429 
water yeah I gave up on it there so I
transferred<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.670> batter<00:01:57.850> into<00:01:58.359> a<00:01:58.439> large

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
transferred the batter into a large

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.319 
transferred the batter into a large
mixing<00:01:59.859> bowl<00:01:59.920> and<00:02:00.460> I<00:02:00.640> thought<00:02:00.820> I'd<00:02:00.969> mix<00:02:01.179> it

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
mixing bowl and I thought I'd mix it

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:02.639 
mixing bowl and I thought I'd mix it
with<00:02:01.420> some<00:02:01.570> beaters<00:02:01.899> to<00:02:02.079> see<00:02:02.229> if<00:02:02.350> it<00:02:02.439> made<00:02:02.619> a

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
with some beaters to see if it made a

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.999 
with some beaters to see if it made a
difference<00:02:02.890> and<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:05.200> was<00:02:05.380> still<00:02:05.619> dry<00:02:05.979> and

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
difference and it was still dry and

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.709 
difference and it was still dry and
crumbly<00:02:06.429> there's<00:02:06.700> no<00:02:06.880> way<00:02:07.030> that<00:02:07.299> that's<00:02:07.479> a

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
crumbly there's no way that that's a

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:09.180 
crumbly there's no way that that's a
batter<00:02:07.990> that's<00:02:08.440> a<00:02:08.590> crumble

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
batter that's a crumble

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.220 
batter that's a crumble
so<00:02:09.640> I<00:02:09.670> added<00:02:10.030> a<00:02:10.210> little<00:02:10.360> bit<00:02:10.509> of<00:02:10.569> water<00:02:10.840> and<00:02:11.110> I

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
so I added a little bit of water and I

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.260 
so I added a little bit of water and I
continue<00:02:11.680> to<00:02:11.710> add<00:02:11.920> water<00:02:12.160> to<00:02:12.520> about<00:02:13.000> another

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
continue to add water to about another

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.590 
continue to add water to about another
third<00:02:13.600> of<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.810> cup<00:02:14.080> of<00:02:14.140> water<00:02:15.010> until<00:02:15.910> I<00:02:16.210> got<00:02:16.570> a

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
third of a cup of water until I got a

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.660 
third of a cup of water until I got a
bad<00:02:16.990> a<00:02:17.230> brownie<00:02:17.470> batter<00:02:17.740> that<00:02:18.160> was<00:02:18.310> maybe<00:02:18.550> a

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
bad a brownie batter that was maybe a

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.000 
bad a brownie batter that was maybe a
little<00:02:19.060> bit<00:02:19.360> stiffer<00:02:20.020> than

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
little bit stiffer than

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.679 
little bit stiffer than
normally<00:02:21.370> would<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:21.760> I<00:02:21.819> imagine<00:02:22.299> that's<00:02:22.450> what

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:22.689 
normally would and I imagine that's what

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:24.539 
normally would and I imagine that's what
they<00:02:22.840> were<00:02:22.900> trying<00:02:23.560> to<00:02:23.799> get<00:02:24.010> at<00:02:24.129> when<00:02:24.370> they

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
they were trying to get at when they

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:31.350 
they were trying to get at when they
were<00:02:24.580> saying<00:02:25.390> a<00:02:25.629> stiff<00:02:26.049> batter<00:02:29.549> and<00:02:30.549> I

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
were saying a stiff batter and I

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.720 
were saying a stiff batter and I
prepared<00:02:31.810> an<00:02:31.959> 8<00:02:32.110> by<00:02:32.319> inch<00:02:32.650> baking<00:02:32.920> dish<00:02:33.129> in<00:02:33.579> the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
prepared an 8 by inch baking dish in the

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:34.979 
prepared an 8 by inch baking dish in the
background<00:02:34.180> thereby<00:02:34.480> spray<00:02:34.689> it<00:02:34.840> with<00:02:34.930> cooking

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
background thereby spray it with cooking

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.880 
background thereby spray it with cooking
spray<00:02:36.989> probably<00:02:37.989> have<00:02:38.079> been<00:02:38.170> better<00:02:38.349> off<00:02:38.470> with

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
spray probably have been better off with

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:48.300 
spray probably have been better off with
an<00:02:39.040> 8<00:02:39.220> by<00:02:39.400> 10<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:39.940> you'll<00:02:40.030> see<00:02:40.239> why<00:02:47.310> then

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
an 8 by 10 and you'll see why then

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.069 
an 8 by 10 and you'll see why then
you're<00:02:48.489> going<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:48.730> take<00:02:48.940> 1<00:02:49.239> cup<00:02:49.510> of<00:02:49.930> that

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
you're going to take 1 cup of that

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.559 
you're going to take 1 cup of that
batter<00:02:50.379> and<00:02:50.799> set<00:02:51.640> it<00:02:51.760> aside<00:02:51.879> because<00:02:52.420> that's

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
batter and set it aside because that's

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:54.599 
batter and set it aside because that's
going<00:02:52.689> to<00:02:52.780> be<00:02:52.870> like<00:02:52.989> a<00:02:53.049> topping<00:02:53.560> so<00:02:54.430> then

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
going to be like a topping so then

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.039 
going to be like a topping so then
you're<00:02:54.730> gonna<00:02:54.819> spread<00:02:55.150> this<00:02:55.420> into<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.840> bottom

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
you're gonna spread this into the bottom

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.250 
you're gonna spread this into the bottom
of<00:02:56.319> a<00:02:56.470> by<00:02:56.680> inch<00:02:57.220> baking<00:02:57.609> dish<00:02:58.079> then<00:02:59.079> you're

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
of a by inch baking dish then you're

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.119 
of a by inch baking dish then you're
gonna<00:02:59.349> bake<00:02:59.709> bake<00:03:00.519> this<00:03:00.760> part<00:03:01.090> at<00:03:01.989> 350<00:03:02.799> degrees

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:03.129 
gonna bake bake this part at 350 degrees

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.259 
gonna bake bake this part at 350 degrees
for<00:03:03.940> 10<00:03:04.209> to<00:03:04.859> 15<00:03:05.859> minutes<00:03:06.220> into<00:03:06.519> the<00:03:06.790> edges

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
for 10 to 15 minutes into the edges

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.379 
for 10 to 15 minutes into the edges
crack<00:03:08.129> now<00:03:09.129> the<00:03:09.190> brownie<00:03:09.579> itself<00:03:10.150> is<00:03:10.269> not

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:10.389 
crack now the brownie itself is not

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:11.879 
crack now the brownie itself is not
going<00:03:10.629> to<00:03:10.720> be<00:03:10.810> done<00:03:11.019> it's<00:03:11.260> just<00:03:11.440> gonna<00:03:11.620> have<00:03:11.859> a

going to be done it's just gonna have a
little<00:03:12.159> bit<00:03:12.310> of<00:03:12.430> cracked<00:03:12.670> edges<00:03:14.370> now<00:03:15.370> while

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
little bit of cracked edges now while

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.949 
little bit of cracked edges now while
that's<00:03:15.819> baking<00:03:16.090> you<00:03:16.389> can<00:03:16.420> prepare<00:03:16.780> the

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
that's baking you can prepare the

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.360 
that's baking you can prepare the
filling<00:03:17.319> part<00:03:17.560> of<00:03:17.680> it<00:03:17.849> and<00:03:18.959> that<00:03:19.959> is<00:03:20.220> half<00:03:21.220> a

filling part of it and that is half a

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.039 
filling part of it and that is half a
recipe<00:03:21.730> egg<00:03:21.819> once<00:03:22.060> again<00:03:22.329> which<00:03:22.569> is<00:03:22.720> an<00:03:22.840> egg

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.319 
half of 3 and 3/4 cups of confectioner's
sugar<00:03:42.430> which<00:03:42.849> is<00:03:43.000> 1<00:03:43.150> and<00:03:43.269> 1/2<00:03:43.650> plus<00:03:44.879> 1/4<00:03:45.879> plus

sugar which is 1 and 1/2 plus 1/4 plus
1/8<00:03:46.780> so<00:03:47.049> I'm<00:03:47.109> not<00:03:47.260> very<00:03:47.410> good<00:03:47.620> with<00:03:47.709> fractions

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
1/8 so I'm not very good with fractions

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.710 
1/8 so I'm not very good with fractions
so<00:03:48.280> I<00:03:48.310> had<00:03:48.400> to<00:03:48.489> split<00:03:48.699> it<00:03:48.879> up<00:03:49.000> that<00:03:49.209> way<00:03:49.419> but

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
so I had to split it up that way but

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.930 
so I had to split it up that way but
half<00:03:50.620> of<00:03:50.799> three<00:03:51.040> three<00:03:51.220> quarters<00:03:51.549> of<00:03:51.699> a<00:03:51.760> cup

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
half of three three quarters of a cup

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.030 
half of three three quarters of a cup
and<00:03:52.660> you're<00:03:52.810> gonna<00:03:52.930> add<00:03:53.109> that<00:03:53.290> in<00:03:53.530> gradually

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
and you're gonna add that in gradually

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.210 
and you're gonna add that in gradually
and<00:03:55.169> beat<00:03:56.169> it<00:03:56.319> in<00:03:56.470> till<00:03:56.739> you<00:03:56.769> get<00:03:56.949> a<00:03:56.980> nice

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
the reason you put it in a little at a

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.760 
the reason you put it in a little at a
time<00:04:08.310> is<00:04:08.490> to<00:04:08.670> avoid<00:04:08.940> the<00:04:09.210> the<00:04:09.240> the<00:04:10.140> powder

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
time is to avoid the the the powder

cobblestone part of the cobblestone
brownies<00:05:04.440> comes<00:05:04.650> from<00:05:04.830> because<00:05:04.980> once<00:05:05.160> it

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
brownies comes from because once it

brownies comes from because once it
bakes<00:05:05.400> up<00:05:05.670> it'll<00:05:06.510> look<00:05:06.540> like<00:05:06.810> an

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
bakes up it'll look like an

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.090 
bakes up it'll look like an
old-fashioned<00:05:07.530> cobblestone<00:05:08.070> road<00:05:08.660> in<00:05:09.660> a<00:05:09.720> way

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
old-fashioned cobblestone road in a way

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:14.030 
old-fashioned cobblestone road in a way
so<00:05:11.100> you<00:05:11.160> bake<00:05:11.460> this<00:05:11.760> at<00:05:12.000> 350<00:05:12.690> degrees<00:05:12.870> for<00:05:13.410> 45

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
so you bake this at 350 degrees for 45

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.490 
so you bake this at 350 degrees for 45
to<00:05:14.220> 50<00:05:14.910> minutes<00:05:15.240> that's<00:05:15.420> five<00:05:15.870> zero<00:05:16.230> minutes

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
to 50 minutes that's five zero minutes

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.460 
to 50 minutes that's five zero minutes
takes<00:05:17.370> a<00:05:17.490> long<00:05:17.670> time<00:05:18.060> until<00:05:18.300> the<00:05:18.930> toothpick<00:05:19.320> in

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
takes a long time until the toothpick in

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:20.810 
takes a long time until the toothpick in
the<00:05:19.560> center<00:05:19.590> comes<00:05:20.130> out<00:05:20.250> clean

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
the center comes out clean

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.450 
the center comes out clean
now<00:05:21.390> these<00:05:21.680> tasted<00:05:22.680> very<00:05:22.890> good<00:05:23.040> they<00:05:23.400> were

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
now these tasted very good they were

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.970 
now these tasted very good they were
super<00:05:24.090> moist<00:05:24.330> inside<00:05:25.020> they<00:05:25.560> were<00:05:25.620> a<00:05:25.740> little

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
super moist inside they were a little

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.770 
super moist inside they were a little
bit<00:05:26.220> too<00:05:26.520> thick<00:05:26.850> and<00:05:27.000> they<00:05:27.090> were<00:05:27.150> hard<00:05:27.450> to<00:05:27.600> cut

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
bit too thick and they were hard to cut

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.510 
bit too thick and they were hard to cut
that's<00:05:27.990> why<00:05:28.200> I<00:05:28.230> think<00:05:28.380> he'd<00:05:28.860> be<00:05:29.010> better<00:05:29.130> in<00:05:29.400> a

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
that's why I think he'd be better in a

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.330 
that's why I think he'd be better in a
bigger<00:05:29.700> pan<00:05:30.060> I<00:05:30.470> think<00:05:31.470> that<00:05:31.680> if<00:05:31.890> I<00:05:32.070> would<00:05:32.220> have

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
bigger pan I think that if I would have

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.960 
bigger pan I think that if I would have
done<00:05:32.520> this<00:05:32.900> using<00:05:33.900> a<00:05:34.140> 9<00:05:34.890> by<00:05:35.100> 13<00:05:35.280> inch<00:05:35.640> size

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
done this using a 9 by 13 inch size

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.900 
done this using a 9 by 13 inch size
brownie<00:05:36.690> mix<00:05:37.020> it<00:05:37.290> would<00:05:37.440> have<00:05:37.560> been<00:05:37.910> super

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910
