air<00:00:03.360> valve<00:00:04.190> now<00:00:05.190> last<00:00:05.460> time<00:00:05.549> I<00:00:05.670> had<00:00:05.850> a<00:00:05.910> hole

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
air valve now last time I had a hole

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.849 
air valve now last time I had a hole
that<00:00:06.990> I<00:00:07.049> had<00:00:07.140> drilled<00:00:07.290> in<00:00:07.440> this<00:00:07.529> out<00:00:07.649> there

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
that I had drilled in this out there

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.500 
that I had drilled in this out there
basically<00:00:08.460> what<00:00:08.639> I<00:00:08.700> did<00:00:08.760> was<00:00:09.000> I<00:00:09.030> just<00:00:09.120> dropped

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
I found in the first available screw

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.580 
I found in the first available screw
that<00:00:11.190> fit<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.490> hole<00:00:12.080> dropping<00:00:13.080> that<00:00:13.200> down<00:00:13.410> in

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
that fit the hole dropping that down in

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.609 
that fit the hole dropping that down in
there<00:00:13.740> cut<00:00:14.070> it<00:00:14.190> down<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.460> size<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:15.470> sealed<00:00:16.470> it

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
there cut it down the size and sealed it

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.840 
there cut it down the size and sealed it
up<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.949> little<00:00:17.340> bit<00:00:17.490> of<00:00:17.550> RTV<00:00:18.890> I<00:00:19.890> also<00:00:20.340> put<00:00:20.550> our<00:00:20.670> TV

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
up a little bit of RTV I also put our TV

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.359 
up a little bit of RTV I also put our TV
around<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.869> edges<00:00:22.140> right<00:00:22.289> here<00:00:22.470> since<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.250> is

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
around the edges right here since it is

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.009 
around the edges right here since it is
a<00:00:23.400> press<00:00:23.670> fit<00:00:23.880> most<00:00:24.150> likely<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.630> won't<00:00:24.720> need<00:00:24.990> it

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
a press fit most likely it won't need it

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.390 
a press fit most likely it won't need it
however<00:00:26.390> you<00:00:27.390> know<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.510> just<00:00:27.689> like<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.019> be<00:00:28.109> safe

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:28.400 
however you know I just like to be safe

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.759 
however you know I just like to be safe
so<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.429> decided<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.970> put<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.210> on<00:00:30.480> there<00:00:30.769> then

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
so I decided to put that on there then

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.650 
so I decided to put that on there then
we<00:00:31.890> have<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.160> cup<00:00:32.340> right<00:00:32.550> here<00:00:32.579> now<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.390> does

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
we have the cup right here now it does

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.620 
we have the cup right here now it does
have<00:00:33.690> stains<00:00:34.290> in<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.590> indicating<00:00:35.420> how<00:00:36.420> it

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
have stains in it indicating how it

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.319 
have stains in it indicating how it
originally<00:00:37.050> came<00:00:37.260> out<00:00:37.790> you<00:00:38.790> may<00:00:38.940> want<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.210> try

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
originally came out you may want to try

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.729 
originally came out you may want to try
to<00:00:39.450> line<00:00:39.690> those<00:00:39.899> up<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.260> get<00:00:40.410> them<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.590> there

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
to line those up and get them in there

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.069 
to line those up and get them in there
as<00:00:40.829> best<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.190> can<00:00:41.300> because<00:00:42.300> things<00:00:42.660> do<00:00:42.899> like

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
as best you can because things do like

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.250 
as best you can because things do like
to<00:00:43.200> go<00:00:43.290> together<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:44.010> way<00:00:44.100> they<00:00:44.250> came<00:00:44.399> apart

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
to go together the way they came apart

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.410 
to go together the way they came apart
so<00:00:46.260> there's<00:00:46.469> our<00:00:46.680> little<00:00:47.579> assembly<00:00:48.149> right

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
so there's our little assembly right

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.920 
so there's our little assembly right
there<00:00:49.190> bring<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.340> over<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.329> press<00:00:51.600> now

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
there bring it over to the press now

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.920 
there bring it over to the press now
remember<00:00:52.379> last<00:00:52.559> time<00:00:53.300> in<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.390> last<00:00:54.570> video<00:00:54.870> I

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
remember last time in the last video I

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.590 
remember last time in the last video I
told<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.260> you<00:00:55.620> want<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.860> make<00:00:55.980> sure<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.600> the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
told you you want to make sure that the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.119 
told you you want to make sure that the
the<00:00:58.559> circle<00:00:59.570> goes<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:01.070> the<00:01:02.070> top<00:01:03.530> the<00:01:04.530> top<00:01:04.559> port

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
the circle goes on the top the top port

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.820 
the circle goes on the top the top port
because<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.540> circle<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.170> actually<00:01:07.650> higher

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
because the circle is actually higher

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.600 
because the circle is actually higher
than<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.250> slit<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:10.740> case<00:01:10.979> slid<00:01:11.490> on

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
than the slit so in this case slid on

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.440 
than the slit so in this case slid on
the<00:01:11.700> right<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.920> circle<00:01:13.920> on<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.100> left<00:01:14.450> so

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450

is<00:02:07.950> actually<00:02:08.099> better<00:02:08.550> than<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.759> was<00:02:09.000> when<00:02:09.270> I

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
is actually better than it was when I

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.380 
is actually better than it was when I
took<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:09.959> apart<00:02:10.259> because<00:02:10.890> it<00:02:11.160> was<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.310> partially

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
took it apart because it was a partially

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.360 
took it apart because it was a partially
obstructing<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.290> whole<00:02:14.470> because<00:02:14.950> it<00:02:15.010> was<00:02:15.190> so

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
obstructing the whole because it was so

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.150 
obstructing the whole because it was so
filled<00:02:15.610> up<00:02:15.700> with<00:02:15.870> with<00:02:17.580> with<00:02:18.580> stuff<00:02:19.709> now<00:02:20.709> what

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
filled up with with with stuff now what

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.220 
filled up with with with stuff now what
I'm<00:02:21.250> going<00:02:21.370> to<00:02:21.459> do<00:02:21.550> is<00:02:21.819> once<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.450> RTV<00:02:22.900> cures

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
I'm going to do is once the RTV cures

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.770 
I'm going to do is once the RTV cures
I'm<00:02:23.890> going<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.220> go<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:24.819> boil<00:02:25.270> a<00:02:25.390> cup<00:02:25.510> of<00:02:25.630> water

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
I'm going to go and boil a cup of water

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.800 
I'm going to go and boil a cup of water
put<00:02:26.410> it<00:02:26.530> in<00:02:26.620> there<00:02:26.830> and<00:02:27.180> this<00:02:28.180> thing<00:02:28.420> should

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
put it in there and this thing should

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.640 
put it in there and this thing should
now<00:02:30.239> push<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:31.569> plunger<00:02:31.750> all<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.230> way<00:02:32.350> up<00:02:32.470> to

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
now push the plunger all the way up to

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.040 
now push the plunger all the way up to
completely<00:02:32.980> seal<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:34.000> tube<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:34.510> prevent<00:02:34.870> any

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
completely seal the tube and prevent any

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.470 
completely seal the tube and prevent any
air<00:02:35.260> from<00:02:35.500> going<00:02:35.739> through<00:02:35.770> it<00:02:36.069> if<00:02:36.880> it<00:02:37.060> doesn't

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
air from going through it if it doesn't

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.690 
air from going through it if it doesn't
then<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.080> next<00:02:38.290> step<00:02:38.440> is<00:02:38.470> going<00:02:38.709> to<00:02:38.770> be<00:02:38.860> to

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
then the next step is going to be to

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.510 
then the next step is going to be to
either<00:02:40.660> push<00:02:41.170> this<00:02:41.350> further<00:02:41.590> down<00:02:41.980> until<00:02:42.400> it

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
either push this further down until it

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.479 
either push this further down until it
does<00:02:42.670> or<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:44.530> can<00:02:44.739> as<00:02:45.300> a<00:02:46.300> last<00:02:46.510> resort<00:02:47.489> pinch

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
does or you can as a last resort pinch

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.750 
does or you can as a last resort pinch
this<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:48.970> some<00:02:49.150> sort<00:02:49.360> of<00:02:49.390> a<00:02:49.510> vise<00:02:49.959> or<00:02:50.230> pliers

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
this and some sort of a vise or pliers

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.620 
this and some sort of a vise or pliers
to<00:02:51.760> actually<00:02:52.150> push<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.930> plunger<00:02:53.110> up<00:02:54.630> making

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
to actually push the plunger up making

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.970 
to actually push the plunger up making
it<00:02:55.720> so<00:02:55.840> that<00:02:55.870> when<00:02:56.110> it<00:02:56.200> is<00:02:56.230> hot<00:02:56.500> it'll<00:02:56.769> it'll

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
it so that when it is hot it'll it'll

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.190 
it so that when it is hot it'll it'll
close<00:02:57.340> all<00:02:57.519> the<00:02:57.580> way<00:02:57.700> so<00:02:58.090> that's<00:02:58.209> about<00:02:58.390> it<00:02:58.480> all

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
close all the way so that's about it all

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.260 
close all the way so that's about it all
right
