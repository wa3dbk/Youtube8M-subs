00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
with the zto 1 2 1 and I just felt like

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.979 
with the zto 1 2 1 and I just felt like
stabbing<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:50.010> through<00:00:50.190> here<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:51.570> did<00:00:51.780> right

there that was the first stab and went

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:04.310 
there that was the first stab and went
in<00:00:58.190> pretty<00:00:59.190> far<00:01:00.980> you<00:01:01.980> know<00:01:02.809> when<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.840> pulled<00:01:04.140> it

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
in pretty far you know when I pulled it

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.870 
in pretty far you know when I pulled it
out<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:06.650> noticed<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.070> tip<00:01:08.310> was<00:01:08.490> snapped

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
out I noticed that the tip was snapped

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.590 
out I noticed that the tip was snapped
off<00:01:11.479> just<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.659> very<00:01:12.869> tip<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:14.150> and<00:01:15.150> what

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
off just the very tip of it and what

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.520 
off just the very tip of it and what
happened<00:01:16.020> was<00:01:17.119> the<00:01:18.119> tip<00:01:18.390> stuck<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.979> glass

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
happened was the tip stuck in the glass

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.700 
happened was the tip stuck in the glass
tube<00:01:23.360> and<00:01:24.360> when<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.630> pulled<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.110> out<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.290> must

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
tube and when I pulled it out I must

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.010 
tube and when I pulled it out I must
have<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.640> know<00:01:26.759> twisted<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.390> left<00:01:27.780> or<00:01:27.990> right

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
have you know twisted it left or right

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.899 
have you know twisted it left or right
because<00:01:28.530> I<00:01:28.770> was<00:01:28.890> actually<00:01:29.040> sitting<00:01:29.430> next<00:01:29.700> to

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
because I was actually sitting next to

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.429 
because I was actually sitting next to
this<00:01:30.150> on<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:31.170> chair<00:01:31.439> here<00:01:31.829> and<00:01:32.900> the<00:01:33.900> tip<00:01:34.079> is

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
this on the chair here and the tip is

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.580 
this on the chair here and the tip is
still<00:01:34.790> stuck<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.329> tube<00:01:36.509> shut<00:01:37.470> my

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
still stuck in the tube shut my

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.260 
still stuck in the tube shut my
flashlight<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.220> here<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.610> could<00:01:38.759> see<00:01:39.119> it

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
flashlight in here and I could see it

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.870 
flashlight in here and I could see it
sticking<00:01:40.259> out<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.710> glass<00:01:41.009> which<00:01:41.850> is

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
sticking out of the glass which is

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.530 
sticking out of the glass which is
pretty<00:01:42.210> funny<00:01:42.770> so<00:01:43.790> it<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:44.939> durable<00:01:45.270> knife

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
pretty funny so it is a durable knife

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.289 
pretty funny so it is a durable knife
good<00:01:45.990> knife<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.740> see<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:48.000> think<00:01:48.240> that

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
good knife you see that you think that

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.120 
good knife you see that you think that
scratches<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.140> finish<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.649> comes<00:01:49.860> right

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
scratches and the finish it comes right

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.190 
scratches and the finish it comes right
off<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.640> that's<00:01:51.119> just<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.540> residue<00:01:51.960> from<00:01:52.140> the

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
off so that's just the residue from the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.499 
off so that's just the residue from the
plastic<00:01:53.659> and<00:01:54.659> then<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.869> stab<00:01:55.170> back<00:01:55.470> here<00:01:56.509> even

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
plastic and then I stab back here even

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.959 
plastic and then I stab back here even
deeper<00:01:58.469> which<00:01:58.740> didn't<00:01:59.369> make<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.549> difference

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
deeper which didn't make a difference

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.170 
deeper which didn't make a difference
because<00:02:00.409> you<00:02:01.409> won't<00:02:01.619> hit<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.890> tube<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.850> far

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
because you won't hit the tube that far

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.570 
because you won't hit the tube that far
back

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.270 

but<00:02:06.510> uh<00:02:08.000> seen<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.119> bounce<00:02:09.660> off<00:02:10.050> hit<00:02:11.040> their

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
but uh seen a bounce off hit their

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.590 
but uh seen a bounce off hit their
