00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.600 

here<00:04:07.170> we<00:04:07.260> go<00:04:07.410> now<00:04:08.010> we're<00:04:08.190> going<00:04:08.280> to<00:04:08.370> wrap<00:04:08.430> the

human the white around and the white

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.570 
human the white around and the white
might<00:04:11.370> imitate<00:04:11.580> wings<00:04:12.060> who<00:04:12.270> knows<00:04:13.490> we<00:04:14.490> don't

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
might imitate wings who knows we don't

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.560 
might imitate wings who knows we don't
know<00:04:14.700> what<00:04:14.850> trout<00:04:15.030> are<00:04:15.180> thinking<00:04:17.300> go<00:04:18.300> around

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
know what trout are thinking go around

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.060 
know what trout are thinking go around
about<00:04:18.780> three<00:04:18.989> times<00:04:19.230> just<00:04:19.440> put<00:04:19.680> a<00:04:19.739> little<00:04:19.920> bit

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
about three times just put a little bit

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.650 
about three times just put a little bit
of<00:04:20.130> weight<00:04:20.280> on<00:04:20.340> the<00:04:20.520> front<00:04:20.670> of<00:04:20.820> it<00:04:20.940> it<00:04:21.330> makes<00:04:21.540> it

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
of weight on the front of it it makes it

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.070 
of weight on the front of it it makes it
easier<00:04:21.900> for<00:04:22.050> me<00:04:22.140> to<00:04:22.170> see<00:04:22.410> too<00:04:23.630> now<00:04:24.630> when<00:04:24.990> you

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
easier for me to see too now when you

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.540 
easier for me to see too now when you
start<00:04:25.320> getting<00:04:25.350> as<00:04:25.620> old<00:04:25.800> as<00:04:25.920> I<00:04:26.040> am<00:04:26.070> and<00:04:26.430> your

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
start getting as old as I am and your

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.650 
start getting as old as I am and your
eyes<00:04:26.700> are<00:04:26.730> going<00:04:27.120> bad<00:04:29.240> you<00:04:30.240> need<00:04:30.420> every

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
eyes are going bad you need every

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.330 
eyes are going bad you need every
advantage<00:04:30.750> you<00:04:31.110> can<00:04:31.230> get<00:04:31.530> all<00:04:32.010> right<00:04:32.160> that's

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
advantage you can get all right that's

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.890 
advantage you can get all right that's
it<00:04:32.460> plies<00:04:32.760> done<00:04:33.000> that<00:04:33.390> really<00:04:33.480> makes<00:04:33.750> it<00:04:33.840> stand

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
it plies done that really makes it stand

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.200 
it plies done that really makes it stand
out<00:04:34.230> on<00:04:34.350> the<00:04:34.380> front<00:04:34.710> yes<00:04:35.070> and<00:04:35.370> it<00:04:35.670> makes<00:04:35.880> it<00:04:36.030> so

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
out on the front yes and it makes it so

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.640 
out on the front yes and it makes it so
much<00:04:36.270> easier<00:04:36.390> to<00:04:36.780> see<00:04:36.960> what<00:04:37.110> is<00:04:37.200> floating<00:04:37.590> in

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
much easier to see what is floating in

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
much easier to see what is floating in
the<00:04:37.740> river<00:04:38.750> if<00:04:39.750> it's<00:04:40.050> just<00:04:40.350> all<00:04:40.560> brown<00:04:40.950> it's

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
the river if it's just all brown it's

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.040 
the river if it's just all brown it's
really<00:04:42.030> tough<00:04:42.210> to<00:04:42.240> sometimes<00:04:42.780> seat

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
really tough to sometimes seat

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.630 
really tough to sometimes seat
especially<00:04:43.380> in<00:04:43.740> some<00:04:43.920> rust<00:04:44.130> colored<00:04:44.400> water

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
especially in some rust colored water

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.510 
especially in some rust colored water
yeah<00:04:45.440> but<00:04:46.440> you<00:04:46.560> get<00:04:46.740> you<00:04:47.040> know<00:04:47.130> you<00:04:47.220> put<00:04:47.400> that

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
yeah but you get you know you put that

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.890 
yeah but you get you know you put that
little<00:04:47.700> bit<00:04:47.970> of<00:04:48.000> color<00:04:48.270> of<00:04:48.480> white<00:04:48.660> on<00:04:48.870> the

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
little bit of color of white on the

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.250 
little bit of color of white on the
front<00:04:49.230> of<00:04:49.320> it<00:04:49.440> and<00:04:50.720> it<00:04:51.720> makes<00:04:51.960> all<00:04:52.140> the

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
front of it and it makes all the

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.620 
front of it and it makes all the
difference<00:04:52.440> in<00:04:52.710> the<00:04:52.740> world<00:04:53.300> to<00:04:54.300> make<00:04:54.450> it

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
difference in the world to make it

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.930 
difference in the world to make it
easier<00:04:54.930> to<00:04:54.990> see<00:04:55.260> so<00:04:56.070> again<00:04:56.460> it's<00:04:56.640> a<00:04:56.730> nice

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
easier to see so again it's a nice

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.990 
easier to see so again it's a nice
little<00:04:57.210> fly<00:04:58.130> some<00:04:59.130> of<00:04:59.310> some<00:04:59.520> of<00:04:59.550> these<00:04:59.730> that

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
little fly some of some of these that

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.410 
little fly some of some of these that
got<00:05:00.150> in<00:05:00.270> the<00:05:00.390> way<00:05:00.540> there<00:05:01.520> and<00:05:02.520> it's<00:05:03.090> a<00:05:03.210> good

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
got in the way there and it's a good

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.810 
got in the way there and it's a good
searching<00:05:03.930> pattern<00:05:04.350> and<00:05:04.500> then<00:05:05.340> it's<00:05:05.490> just<00:05:05.640> a

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
searching pattern and then it's just a

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.910 
searching pattern and then it's just a
good<00:05:06.000> fly<00:05:06.270> just<00:05:06.570> it<00:05:06.720> floats<00:05:07.080> high<00:05:07.320> so<00:05:07.590> it's
