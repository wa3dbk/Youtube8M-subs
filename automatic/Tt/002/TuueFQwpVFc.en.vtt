00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.010
 Hi girls, how are you? 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.690
 today's video in day to bring 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.490
 some trends come out of sao paulo 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.710
 fashion week already spring-summer 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.730
 little things that rolled right there in the 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.220
 parades 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.050
 I did not go but I search a lot 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.689
 I even joined you and some 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.760
 tips and lots of people will have my god gone 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.220
 mine or winter has not arrived yet 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.840
 you're seeing things in the summer 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.179
 people can tell you with all 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.170
 sure the world that all stores already 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.540
 with their collections 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.790
 spring-summer ready or almost ready 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.160
 offering there for shopkeepers 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.410
 So I think it's already the process to 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.270
 inspire in places also does not do so much 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.190
 cold then the indication is worth a lot 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.079
 because surely in stores already have 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.420
 already will start to have these parts 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.070
 so if you want to invest in some 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.559
 thing forward 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.250
 it is very worth knowing what went there 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:01:00.030
 that goes again I already had is things 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.859
 who came back a long time ago so I 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.019
 I think it's very cool, and I 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.700
 I really hope you like it first. 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.610
 thing I wanted to talk about is about 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.040
 the color was a big surprise there is 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.900
 referring to the brown color because it is a 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.210
 something as much as winter 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.700
 but it came a lot there in several details 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.920
 or good that will come out of that thing 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.840
 boot will not move boot the hand because it goes 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.729
 If you will see then you will actually invest 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.430
 in detail there is a street I think or 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.320
 prints that I think will be very 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.119
 gorgeous even because brown is a color 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.909
 beautiful to match, right? 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.520
 beyond that color then who the pastel shades 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.000
 It's not a novelty, it's very 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.740
 a lot of raw color is that it is also 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.560
 always strong is joker and of several 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.500
 seasons but without even the same white 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.990
 very strong so it's worth investing 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.509
 much in this type of piece nor much max 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.329
 earring ring rather then think 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.280
 so I come back with everything I remember 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.479
 that an era wore those rings with 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.460
 rhinestones 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.490
 everybody said it looks like the wheel of 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.960
 wagon and I do not know it's too much gogo 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.490
 giant even very heavy earrings is 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.920
 very large combined up 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.650
 then there are some things that 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.420
 was exaggerated but it means a 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.730
 strong trend for summer is you 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.630
 You need to use an exaggerated thing like that. 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.520
 but good goes or looks beautiful is macular 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.300
 It also looks beautiful so goes several 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.520
 proposals there are the majority have finished 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.310
 then a comment with the law 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.650
 But you already know how to stay 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.860
 very handsome even is so fun and 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.230
 many dresses years and 60s if not me 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.930
 deceit is to return the consul of that format 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.290
 What are these dresses made to? 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.000
 very successful in the 60's and now comes 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.890
 with everything and I find a proposal well 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.470
 to determine body types 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.990
 which has texture comes very woven with 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.140
 texture comes much know that I am very 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:02.220
 scrambled texture very textured 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.660
 even many income many relevance and I 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.620
 I'm sure it's going to be the year. 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.120
 burst of rule then you can 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.400
 begin to understand one of the most 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.340
 strong that the kidney I saw much cut 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.850
 cast in waist high waist 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.580
 huh 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.260
 was also also widely worn dresses 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.110
 cut to the side 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.230
 dresses that appear all over the waist is 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.720
 used very own of with skirt then 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.640
 very strong again show waist 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.950
 and still mark the waist with certainty 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.530
 very strong spring summer trend 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.320
 There's a lot of pantyhose in there and I love that. 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.200
 trend I find very very anxious 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.780
 chic even I think so paid so to 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.330
 The beach was there as the biggest chemist was 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.280
 very lovely wonderful even then this 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.180
 It was one of the churches for sure but I 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:54.960
 I liked it very much and finished and 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:58.170
 erases so much diverted pants 30 time 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.060
 more short addict too, so I guess 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:04.230
 which it is a trend that was caught nec 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:07.860
 well but I say much more escaped then 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:11.060
 but more said it is up to a style 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.830
 more artisanal than I say more shredded 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.540
 Redd type so I do not know if you guys 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.920
 can understand good to see enough 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.380
 thing with mass 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.140
 seems the asymmetry comes very strong 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.990
 then in various parts of the body 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.670
 asymmetrical pieces thus gained a lot 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.010
 very many walkways 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.140
 I also saw a lot of frills also a base of 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.270
 more a big or small noise then 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.500
 I'm sure a lot of things will go 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.480
 stay here no classic bikini 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.590
 ruffle that everyone likes goes 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.190
 Continue 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.900
 so many pieces like this come out of 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.880
 frill has to be done by stopping 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.830
 tell me to tell you so a mix 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.650
 everything I 've seen like this has a lot of 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:55.290
 waist marked too much belly out 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:56.490
 a lot of texture is very much 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:01.080
 new 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.280
 too much income too much income 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.960
 clipping 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.540
 so I think the parts come well 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.220
 worked out of that 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.380
 traditionalisms the dress is no longer 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.410
 so straight he already has the record here already 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.090
 has the record here in the waist and I 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.340
 I thought it was a pretty cool proposal. 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.410
 I really liked it, I love that kind of thing. 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.280
 I think I value the body a lot 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.980
 of the woman 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.420
 So these were some little things that 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.740
 I wanted to talk to you 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.810
 I really hope you liked it.
