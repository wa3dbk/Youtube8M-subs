00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 before starting the video I would like to 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.180
 to point out that all games that have passed 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.919
 during the video are franchises 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.919
 abandoned by its developers 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:26.439
 It's good to know that the incredible franchise that 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.250
 made his childhood worth living in 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.830
 rental companies 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.930
 in which you bought magazines and 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.510
 that I just to know information about the 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.090
 sequence of this game that would be released 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.350
 soon and you were anxiously waiting 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.910
 the launch of this sequence because it is 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.489
 this is a time when producers 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.559
 games were more concerned with your 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.229
 reputation in launching good games in 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.720
 market all with the gains and profits that 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:55.239
 they would get them successfully 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.089
 over the years the producers and 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.640
 developers started to observe more 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.350
 the numbers than the quality and 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.500
 game creativity 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.290
 they began to focus their attention 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.570
 in games that sold faster and faster 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.909
 a profitable return 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.610
 but what remains a mystery in the 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.740
 head of gamers of the whole world is that 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.430
 some franchises have made a success 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.350
 and even though they were left behind 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.260
 to the producers 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.390
 Why did this happen as 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.120
 most famous example we have a mega man 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.310
 where practically here is how to launch a 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.000
 new mega man game almost all 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.970
 years 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.250
 then suddenly at a moment's notice 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.080
 capcom executives decided not to 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.180
 bring a mega man to the current generation 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.760
 of consoles very similar case 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.220
 happened to daycare that one day was the 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.190
 sony mascot and made a big hit 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.020
 no premium and today it was simply 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.210
 laid aside 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.210
 another example of success is chrono 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.550
 trigger that won fans around the world 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.560
 still hoping to see sequel 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.200
 of this game on the current consoles 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.750
 This leads us to a paradox if these 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.610
 franchises have been successful in their 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.099
 have brought great profits with their 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.680
 developers so why? 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:17.130
 abandon them that way many games 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.740
 that made the staff head is new 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.200
 and turned fever were left aside 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.120
 by its developers without any 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.430
 plausible explanation 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.120
 as an example I can cite shadow of the 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.870
 colossus star fox and nasty wars ninja 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:38.490
 gaiden bomberman streets of rage golden 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.170
 ax alex kidd is made against driver and 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:43.500
 various other games 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.410
 the list is so big it barely enough to 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.530
 quote here and it looks that I quoted just the 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.690
 most famous franchises in one of 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.900
 developers who most often leave 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.860
 their side franchises is to capcom as well 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.320
 mega man 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.670
 she also relegated to oblivion games 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:04.740
 as onimusha and dino crisis today 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.920
 quercus identifies making games like 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:10.650
 resident evil 6 it is just right for 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:14.040
 company even some genre of games 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.960
 are almost extinct today as per 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.000
 example a genre of games that became 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.610
 very famous in the 90's 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.890
 known as peter knapp the beats 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.600
 neps are those side screen games 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.540
 where the character walks out on the street 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.920
 and all the characters that 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.770
 meets the front 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.810
 are the famous first street games to 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.960
 example of games of this genre are 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.910
 streets of rage final fight power 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.570
 rangers ninja turtles 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.310
 among other great titles of success 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:47.490
 nowadays it is possible to count on the fingers 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.320
 the few games that come out in this style 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:52.080
 most thanks to developers 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.330
 Some independent producers are 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.120
 bringing great e-mails from games of the 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.459
 past as it is the case that the steam that 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.810
 has won a new updated version for 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.450
 xbox wine 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.530
 but unfortunately this is not yet the 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.110
 enough 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.760
 if things continue as they are good 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.430
 games and fell into oblivion of 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.160
 major producers for remaining there 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.790
 and the worst is that although the explanation is 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.549
 Obviously many questions remain 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.530
 responses to date, as is the case with 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.500
 franchises that have achieved success and 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.600
 public in the 90s but still 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.680
 ignored by the large 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.990
 video games 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.190
 will one day be famous franchises like 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.330
 koff dani skyrim and minecraft will be 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.070
 forgotten by their 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.290
 when you are no longer 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.770
 earning profits 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:46.740
 Good, this is a case to think about. 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.400
 it is clear that it is not just a 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.930
 question of money but in your opinion 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.180
 what is the reason for these franchises 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.070
 success have been abandoned 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.390
