00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
game from here now I've kind of reached

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.890 
game from here now I've kind of reached
my<00:00:29.490> breaking<00:00:29.550> point<00:00:29.910> with<00:00:30.119> this<00:00:30.269> game<00:00:30.449> because

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
my breaking point with this game because

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.959 
my breaking point with this game because
the<00:00:31.170> design<00:00:31.769> philosophies<00:00:32.399> just<00:00:32.669> don't<00:00:32.850> add

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
the design philosophies just don't add

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.270 
the design philosophies just don't add
up<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.840> me<00:00:34.430> they're<00:00:35.430> backwards<00:00:35.969> uh<00:00:37.160> what<00:00:38.160> I'm

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
up to me they're backwards uh what I'm

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.940 
up to me they're backwards uh what I'm
getting<00:00:38.610> from<00:00:38.790> this<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.480> I'm<00:00:40.379> not<00:00:40.410> surprised

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
getting from this and I'm not surprised

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.000 
getting from this and I'm not surprised
by<00:00:41.370> any<00:00:41.520> means<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.600> know<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.960> Blizzcon<00:00:43.440> panel

by any means you know the Blizzcon panel

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.330 
by any means you know the Blizzcon panel
was<00:00:44.250> lackluster<00:00:45.059> at<00:00:45.660> best<00:00:46.160> they're<00:00:47.160> not

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
was lackluster at best they're not

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.250 
was lackluster at best they're not
trying<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.730> address<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.210> problems<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.840> in

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
trying to address the problems and in

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.799 
trying to address the problems and in
their<00:00:49.469> mind<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.100> problems<00:00:50.789> like<00:00:51.390> limited

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
their mind the problems like limited

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.510 
their mind the problems like limited
gameplay<00:00:52.230> options<00:00:52.440> set<00:00:52.949> pieces<00:00:53.160> being

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
gameplay options set pieces being

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.660 
gameplay options set pieces being
mandatory<00:00:53.940> are<00:00:54.480> what<00:00:55.410> they<00:00:55.530> want<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:55.949> continue

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
mandatory are what they want to continue

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.389 
mandatory are what they want to continue
relying<00:00:57.390> on<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.109> this<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.890> absolutely

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
relying on and this is absolutely

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.729 
relying on and this is absolutely
ludicrous<00:00:59.760> in<00:01:00.270> my<00:01:00.390> opinion<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> game

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
ludicrous in my opinion this is a game

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.410 
ludicrous in my opinion this is a game
with<00:01:01.980> millions<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.579> items<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.239> yet

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
with millions of items in it and yet

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.350 
with millions of items in it and yet
you're<00:01:03.660> telling<00:01:03.870> me<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.170> only<00:01:04.619> twelve<00:01:05.360> two

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
you're telling me that only twelve two

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.730 
you're telling me that only twelve two
sets<00:01:06.979> basically<00:01:07.979> are<00:01:08.460> valuable<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.740> then

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
sets basically are valuable and then

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.710 
sets basically are valuable and then
crit<00:01:11.070> damage<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.670> crit<00:01:11.909> chance<00:01:12.390> on

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
crit damage and crit chance on

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.330 
crit damage and crit chance on
everything<00:01:13.229> else<00:01:13.400> vitality<00:01:14.400> main<00:01:15.000> stat<00:01:15.330> and

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
everything else vitality main stat and

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.719 
everything else vitality main stat and
all<00:01:17.340> resist<00:01:18.409> it's<00:01:19.409> absolutely<00:01:19.950> ridiculous

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
all resist it's absolutely ridiculous

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.280 
all resist it's absolutely ridiculous
how<00:01:21.570> many<00:01:22.130> affixes<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.490> need<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.759> worry<00:01:23.970> about

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
how many affixes you need to worry about

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.870 
how many affixes you need to worry about
but<00:01:25.290> at<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.470> same<00:01:25.650> time<00:01:25.920> only<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.400> handful<00:01:26.850> of

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
but at the same time only a handful of

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.260 
but at the same time only a handful of
them<00:01:27.030> are<00:01:27.270> viable<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:28.890> mentality<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.579> broken

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
them are viable the mentality is broken

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.130 
them are viable the mentality is broken
the<00:01:30.960> system<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.560> out<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.280> whack<00:01:32.900> let<00:01:33.900> me<00:01:33.990> go

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
the system is out of whack let me go

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.499 
the system is out of whack let me go
through<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.409> few<00:01:34.650> things<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:35.130> just<00:01:38.509> so

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
through a few things that just so

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.340 
through a few things that just so
basically<00:01:40.310> Blizzard<00:01:41.310> wants<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.640> try<00:01:41.850> to

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
basically Blizzard wants to try to

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.830 
basically Blizzard wants to try to
instead<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.619> fixing<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.159> itemization

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
instead of fixing the itemization

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.370 
instead of fixing the itemization
process<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.369> making<00:01:47.369> sets<00:01:47.810> fewer<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:49.049> number

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
process and making sets fewer in number

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.380 
process and making sets fewer in number
so<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.590> can<00:01:49.770> mix<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.159> match<00:01:50.250> they<00:01:51.000> want<00:01:51.270> to

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
so you can mix and match they want to

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.810 
so you can mix and match they want to
add<00:01:51.600> more<00:01:52.009> generic<00:01:53.009> six<00:01:53.549> piece<00:01:53.820> sets<00:01:54.180> and

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
add more generic six piece sets and

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.719 
add more generic six piece sets and
basically<00:01:56.820> force<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.540> in<00:01:57.689> two<00:01:57.869> more<00:01:58.170> sets

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
basically force you in two more sets

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.780 
basically force you in two more sets
yep<00:01:59.729> these<00:02:00.689> World<00:02:01.140> of<00:02:01.290> Warcraft<00:02:01.710> idiots<00:02:02.189> don't
