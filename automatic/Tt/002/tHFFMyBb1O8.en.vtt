a rescue dig last week just walking
across<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.270> beach<00:00:18.449> we<00:00:18.660> found<00:00:18.690> this<00:00:19.080> the

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
across the beach we found this the

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.109 
across the beach we found this the
surface<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.369> can<00:00:20.400> see<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:20.939> it's

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
surface and you can see that it's

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.490 
surface and you can see that it's
covered<00:00:21.449> in<00:00:21.539> little<00:00:21.990> hollows<00:00:22.289> and

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
covered in little hollows and

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.170 
covered in little hollows and
depressions<00:00:22.980> they've<00:00:23.490> been<00:00:23.640> washed<00:00:23.820> out<00:00:24.000> by

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
depressions they've been washed out by

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.029 
depressions they've been washed out by
the<00:00:24.210> sea<00:00:24.539> very<00:00:24.960> slowly<00:00:25.199> eroding<00:00:25.830> the

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
the sea very slowly eroding the

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.589 
the sea very slowly eroding the
sediments<00:00:26.460> away<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:27.000> uncovering<00:00:27.480> that

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
sediments away and uncovering that

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.179 
sediments away and uncovering that
surface<00:00:28.019> so<00:00:28.170> it's<00:00:28.320> very<00:00:28.500> fragile<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.949> very

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
surface so it's very fragile a very

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.040 
surface so it's very fragile a very
delicate<00:00:29.310> surface<00:00:29.910> we<00:00:30.480> wondering<00:00:30.869> whether

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
delicate surface we wondering whether

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.470 
delicate surface we wondering whether

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
and possibly even human footprints

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.350 
and possibly even human footprints
there's<00:00:36.660> one<00:00:36.870> just<00:00:37.410> around<00:00:37.710> here<00:00:38.100> with<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:39.059> bit

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
there's one just around here with a bit

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.690 
there's one just around here with a bit
of<00:00:39.480> bass<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.989> might<00:00:40.590> be<00:00:40.800> able<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.100> imagine<00:00:41.610> a

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
of bass you might be able to imagine a

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.130 
of bass you might be able to imagine a
bit<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.969> heel<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.480> arch<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:44.690> rub<00:00:45.690> part<00:00:45.989> of<00:00:46.079> the

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
bit of heel and arch and rub part of the

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.500 
bit of heel and arch and rub part of the
foot<00:00:46.350> but<00:00:46.820> really<00:00:47.820> what<00:00:47.969> we<00:00:48.059> have<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.210> do<00:00:48.360> is

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
foot but really what we have to do is

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.479 
foot but really what we have to do is
uncover<00:00:48.989> them<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.500> then<00:00:49.710> take<00:00:49.920> very<00:00:50.160> detailed

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
uncover them and then take very detailed

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.790 
uncover them and then take very detailed
photographs<00:00:50.969> from<00:00:51.329> different<00:00:51.930> angles<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.680> we

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
photographs from different angles so we

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.430 
photographs from different angles so we
can<00:00:52.920> build<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.250> 3d<00:00:53.670> reconstruction<00:00:54.260> this<00:00:55.260> is

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
can build a 3d reconstruction this is

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.840 
can build a 3d reconstruction this is
one<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.710> most<00:00:55.860> important<00:00:56.250> archaeological

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
one of the most important archaeological

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.729 
one of the most important archaeological
sites<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.270> Northern<00:00:57.899> Europe<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.289> if<00:00:58.559> these

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
sites in Northern Europe and if these

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.470 
sites in Northern Europe and if these
are<00:00:58.980> human<00:00:59.280> footprints<00:00:59.730> then<00:01:00.000> really<00:01:00.359> we've

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
are human footprints then really we've

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.599 
are human footprints then really we've
got<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.840> fantastic<00:01:01.109> evidence<00:01:01.859> early<00:01:02.250> humans

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
got this fantastic evidence early humans

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.240 
got this fantastic evidence early humans
that<00:01:02.940> we<00:01:03.059> don't<00:01:03.270> see<00:01:03.449> on<00:01:03.600> many<00:01:04.530> other<00:01:04.769> sites<00:01:05.040> in

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.610 
surface and what we're able to do here
is<00:03:38.940> look<00:03:39.390> at<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:39.840> pollen<00:03:40.200> from<00:03:40.230> these

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
is look at the pollen from these

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.560 
is look at the pollen from these
sediments<00:03:41.130> which<00:03:41.760> will<00:03:41.910> tell<00:03:42.060> us<00:03:42.150> about<00:03:42.330> the

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
sediments which will tell us about the

vegetation<00:03:43.230> at<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.590> time<00:03:43.800> but<00:03:44.190> also<00:03:44.400> look<00:03:44.640> at

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
vegetation at the time but also look at

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.430 
vegetation at the time but also look at
the<00:03:44.790> sediments<00:03:45.209> underneath<00:03:45.570> and<00:03:45.810> this<00:03:46.290> will

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
the sediments underneath and this will

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.199 
the sediments underneath and this will
help<00:03:46.590> us<00:03:46.800> understand<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.400> dating<00:03:48.030> of<00:03:48.120> the

be certain about the human species that

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.730 
be certain about the human species that
left<00:05:18.880> these<00:05:19.060> marks<00:05:19.510> but<00:05:20.050> we<00:05:20.230> know<00:05:20.380> from<00:05:20.560> the

left these marks but we know from the

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.800 
left these marks but we know from the
age<00:05:20.770> of<00:05:21.070> the<00:05:21.220> site<00:05:21.460> that<00:05:21.820> in<00:05:22.270> southern<00:05:22.600> Europe

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
age of the site that in southern Europe

it's<00:05:25.780> possible<00:05:26.290> these<00:05:26.650> tracks<00:05:26.950> were<00:05:27.430> actually

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
it's possible these tracks were actually

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.850 
it's possible these tracks were actually
the<00:05:28.000> footprints<00:05:28.420> left<00:05:28.690> by<00:05:28.960> that<00:05:29.110> early<00:05:29.560> human

truly an amazing archaeological finds
they're<00:05:35.680> without<00:05:36.160> doubt<00:05:36.520> the<00:05:36.730> oldest<00:05:37.180> human

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
they're without doubt the oldest human

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.240 
they're without doubt the oldest human
footprints<00:05:37.900> in<00:05:37.990> Europe<00:05:38.290> and<00:05:38.440> some<00:05:39.040> of<00:05:39.160> the
