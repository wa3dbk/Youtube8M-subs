 under vienna 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.980
 and because sometimes extreme 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.989
 represent what is clearly enough 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:44.180
 able to do it even though you are us 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:46.040
 help and insofar as you do that 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.670
 possibility there if you are slowly stuck 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.670
 that is against 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.930
 I need to roll truck without steering 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:41.070

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:49.979
 driving new business and we have 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:51.630
 now as relative has just been 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.740
 you did not see anything up in the turn 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.740
 how strong he is 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.030
 now it's winter and 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.979
 Summer tires to test against each other 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.569
 our was attacking with sports tires and the 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.039
 task is now full throttle 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:10.160
 and somehow try to move forward 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.160
 come 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.780
 I am now fully on the brake 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.250
 the lasts take takes takes 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.250
 until the car stops 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:36.950
 Swivel is somehow curve around here 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.950
 there is somehow 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:49.520
 phase four on winter tires on the way 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:53.770
 I give full throttle we drive with race 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.770
 to stand in the summer 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.819
 but different driving behavior 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:23.150
 will achieve then just make the 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:25.280
 difference now it has me in the 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.430
 Golf we are back on the 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:32.210
 see ice and what I have here now 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:35.330
 tried with the front wheel drive the 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:38.750
 whimsical around the curves to come then 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.930
 for their and great load changes 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.930
 4 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.390
 so let off the gas then 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.859
 is the rear and then I come 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.280
 actually people once micro themselves 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:58.280
 appoint 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.630
 to give in 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:19.200
 bad not much faster it is 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.200
 Not 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:49.080
 they come 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:02.580
 we found myself today is the 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:04.139
 prisoners subaru and gain 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:08.280
 spikes and that you could do it yourself 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:11.240
 those were the pros and the drive 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.240
 put on helmets 

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:07.769
 I can fly so that except that 

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:09.749
 Worth so over waves and so flows 

00:07:07.769 --> 00:07:12.659
 there just over it and otherwise can 

00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:16.469
 You also stop at 200 or so 

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:18.479
 Driving curves Whatever you do 

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:21.289
