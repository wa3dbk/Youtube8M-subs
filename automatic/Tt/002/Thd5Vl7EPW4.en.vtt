I'm<00:00:12.160> in<00:00:12.280> the<00:00:12.400> northern<00:00:12.790> Madison<00:00:13.300> range<00:00:13.570> right

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:14.470 
I'm in the northern Madison range right

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.890 
I'm in the northern Madison range right
off<00:00:14.650> of<00:00:14.680> buck<00:00:15.280> creek<00:00:15.519> ridge<00:00:15.820> and<00:00:16.240> this<00:00:16.720> is<00:00:16.869> a

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 
off of buck creek ridge and this is a

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.890 
off of buck creek ridge and this is a
south<00:00:17.320> east<00:00:17.560> facing<00:00:17.800> slope<00:00:18.340> at<00:00:18.939> around<00:00:19.119> 9,300

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:19.900 
south east facing slope at around 9,300

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.350 
south east facing slope at around 9,300
feet<00:00:19.930> and<00:00:20.710> yesterday<00:00:21.400> some<00:00:21.700> snowmobilers

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
feet and yesterday some snowmobilers

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.909 
feet and yesterday some snowmobilers
triggered<00:00:22.930> this<00:00:23.140> avalanche<00:00:23.650> and<00:00:23.860> I'm

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:23.919 
triggered this avalanche and I'm

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:26.640 
triggered this avalanche and I'm
standing<00:00:24.130> in<00:00:24.840> one<00:00:25.840> of<00:00:25.869> them<00:00:26.079> came<00:00:26.259> up<00:00:26.470> this

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
standing in one of them came up this

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.130 
standing in one of them came up this
slope<00:00:26.980> and<00:00:27.329> about<00:00:28.329> halfway<00:00:28.540> up<00:00:28.810> but<00:00:28.930> he<00:00:29.020> got

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
slope and about halfway up but he got

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.830 
slope and about halfway up but he got
stuck<00:00:29.439> three<00:00:30.399> of<00:00:30.520> his<00:00:30.610> friends<00:00:30.849> came<00:00:31.360> to<00:00:31.630> help

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
stuck three of his friends came to help

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.870 
stuck three of his friends came to help
him<00:00:32.020> get<00:00:32.140> unstuck<00:00:32.800> and<00:00:33.100> while<00:00:33.670> they<00:00:33.820> were

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:33.880 
him get unstuck and while they were

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.720 
him get unstuck and while they were
doing<00:00:34.210> that<00:00:34.570> another<00:00:35.470> rider<00:00:35.829> came<00:00:36.250> up<00:00:36.520> and

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
doing that another rider came up and

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.390 
doing that another rider came up and
triggered<00:00:37.480> the<00:00:37.600> slope<00:00:37.900> and<00:00:38.110> so<00:00:38.590> all<00:00:38.890> five

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
triggered the slope and so all five

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.490 
triggered the slope and so all five
people<00:00:40.030> were<00:00:40.120> caught<00:00:40.390> in<00:00:40.420> the<00:00:40.570> Avalanche<00:00:41.110> and

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
people were caught in the Avalanche and

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.790 
people were caught in the Avalanche and
I<00:00:41.790> went<00:00:42.790> downhill<00:00:43.030> no<00:00:43.750> one<00:00:44.050> was<00:00:44.230> completely

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
I went downhill no one was completely

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.320 
I went downhill no one was completely
buried<00:00:45.070> they<00:00:45.340> were<00:00:45.430> all<00:00:45.610> just<00:00:45.790> partially

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.330

buried no one was injured and everyone
was<00:00:49.150> able<00:00:49.300> to<00:00:49.480> dig<00:00:49.660> themselves<00:00:49.840> out<00:00:50.290> some

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
was able to dig themselves out some

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.590 
was able to dig themselves out some
people<00:00:51.340> were<00:00:51.490> buried<00:00:51.730> as<00:00:52.060> deep<00:00:52.090> as<00:00:52.450> the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
people were buried as deep as the

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.230 
people were buried as deep as the
armpits<00:00:53.050> but<00:00:53.980> luckily<00:00:54.310> everyone<00:00:54.730> was<00:00:54.910> okay

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.240 
armpits but luckily everyone was okay

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.720 
armpits but luckily everyone was okay
they<00:00:55.540> dug<00:00:55.930> out<00:00:56.079> the<00:00:56.110> sleds<00:00:56.560> and<00:00:56.860> they<00:00:57.670> were

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
they dug out the sleds and they were

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.970 
they dug out the sleds and they were
able<00:00:57.880> to<00:00:58.030> write<00:00:58.660> on<00:00:58.840> home<00:00:59.079> i'm<00:00:59.530> here<00:00:59.740> at<00:00:59.800> the

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
able to write on home i'm here at the

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.479 
able to write on home i'm here at the
crown<00:01:00.340> and<00:01:01.230> its<00:01:02.230> deepest<00:01:02.739> part<00:01:03.040> it's<00:01:03.250> about

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
crown and its deepest part it's about

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.580 
crown and its deepest part it's about
seven<00:01:04.000> feet<00:01:04.030> deep<00:01:04.299> so<00:01:04.600> this<00:01:04.839> is<00:01:04.960> quite<00:01:05.170> large

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
seven feet deep so this is quite large

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.989 
seven feet deep so this is quite large
it<00:01:06.130> is<00:01:07.060> just<00:01:07.360> rock<00:01:07.750> solid<00:01:08.110> hard<00:01:08.619> slab<00:01:09.009> and<00:01:09.369> it's

00:01:09.989 --> 00:01:09.999 
it is just rock solid hard slab and it's

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:12.120 
it is just rock solid hard slab and it's
a<00:01:10.119> steep<00:01:10.450> slope<00:01:10.479> the<00:01:11.140> average<00:01:11.319> steepness<00:01:11.799> is

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
a steep slope the average steepness is

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:25.160 
a steep slope the average steepness is
around<00:01:12.399> 44<00:01:13.060> degrees

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.249 

this<00:01:25.830> slope<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:26.400> heavily<00:01:26.850> wind<00:01:27.270> loaded<00:01:27.659> we<00:01:28.140> can

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
this slope is heavily wind loaded we can

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.899 
this slope is heavily wind loaded we can
see<00:01:28.470> up<00:01:28.590> on<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.920> ridge<00:01:29.189> crest<00:01:29.490> where<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.790> can

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
see up on the ridge crest where you can

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.480 
see up on the ridge crest where you can
make<00:01:30.090> out<00:01:30.299> all<00:01:30.420> those<00:01:30.570> rocks<00:01:30.990> all<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.040> snow

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
make out all those rocks all the snow

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.490 
make out all those rocks all the snow
from<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.360> side<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.869> hill<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.290> from<00:01:34.439> the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
from that side of the hill and from the

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.920 
from that side of the hill and from the
ridge<00:01:34.740> crest<00:01:35.040> gets<00:01:35.640> blown<00:01:36.030> over<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.479> this<00:01:36.600> side

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
ridge crest gets blown over to this side

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.160 
ridge crest gets blown over to this side
and<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.830> creates<00:01:38.159> these<00:01:38.369> really<00:01:38.850> dense<00:01:39.630> hard

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
and it creates these really dense hard

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.410 
and it creates these really dense hard
slabs<00:01:40.590> these<00:01:40.860> wind<00:01:41.159> slabs<00:01:41.460> right<00:01:41.729> here<00:01:42.000> and

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
slabs these wind slabs right here and

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.450 
slabs these wind slabs right here and
this<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:42.990> what<00:01:43.380> we're<00:01:43.560> definitely<00:01:43.799> concerned

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
this is what we're definitely concerned

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.279 
this is what we're definitely concerned
about<00:01:44.700> because<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.030> puts<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.330> lot<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.600> weight<00:01:46.020> on

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
about because it puts a lot of weight on

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.950 
about because it puts a lot of weight on
the<00:01:46.530> snow<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:47.460> wind<00:01:47.850> slab<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.479> sitting<00:01:48.869> on

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
the snow this wind slab is sitting on

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.160 
the snow this wind slab is sitting on
top<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.740> lot<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.310> weaker<00:01:50.729> faceted<00:01:51.390> snow<00:01:51.659> and

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
top of a lot of weaker faceted snow and

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.990 
top of a lot of weaker faceted snow and
this<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.560> where<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.860> broke<00:01:53.159> right<00:01:53.460> here<00:01:53.850> and

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
this is where it broke right here and

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.830 
this is where it broke right here and
right<00:01:54.030> where<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:55.020> broke<00:01:55.320> it's<00:01:56.070> really<00:01:56.840> faceted

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
right where it broke it's really faceted

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.820 
right where it broke it's really faceted
sugary<00:01:58.830> snow<00:01:59.490> and<00:02:00.020> what<00:02:01.020> happens<00:02:01.530> when<00:02:01.619> you

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
sugary snow and what happens when you

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.529 
sugary snow and what happens when you
have<00:02:02.009> a<00:02:02.039> weak<00:02:02.580> layer<00:02:02.819> like<00:02:03.060> this<00:02:03.299> near<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
have a weak layer like this near the

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.350 
have a weak layer like this near the
ground<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.319> it's<00:02:04.830> a<00:02:04.950> lot<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.220> times<00:02:05.429> easier<00:02:06.179> to

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
ground is it's a lot of times easier to

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.359 
ground is it's a lot of times easier to
trigger<00:02:06.780> these<00:02:07.049> slides<00:02:07.470> with<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.770> snow<00:02:08.039> packs

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
trigger these slides with a snow packs

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.539 
trigger these slides with a snow packs
thinner<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.450> if<00:02:09.539> we<00:02:09.690> look<00:02:09.959> down<00:02:10.259> hill<00:02:10.619> here<00:02:11.130> we

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:11.549 
thinner and if we look down hill here we

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:13.670 
thinner and if we look down hill here we
can<00:02:11.700> see<00:02:11.970> where<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.690> rocks<00:02:13.019> are<00:02:13.290> sticking

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
can see where the the rocks are sticking

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.729 
can see where the the rocks are sticking
out<00:02:13.799> of<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.010> slope<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.880> that's<00:02:15.690> likely<00:02:16.170> spots

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
out of the slope and that's likely spots
