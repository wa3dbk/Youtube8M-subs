00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.620
 basically are caterpillars 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.570
 out of hours on the road 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.820
 but in urgent cases it can 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.860
 nevertheless, this is what happens to them 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.920
 high tech machines also in the daytime 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.750
 Ski area accommodating in this case 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.360
 please pay attention to optical and 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:32.390
 acoustic warning signals or on 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:37.760
 Stop signs and also the experienced 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:39.710
 caterpillars parike , of course, great 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.120
 Lob locations for the caterpillars 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.190
 although not only the diamonds 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.109
 are dangerous 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.649
 only the cutter on the tail the snow 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:53.260
 Crushed even 150 ps and extremely 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:56.260
 Sharp sound tenant contact would be here 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.260
 life threatening 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:17.130
 At the end of the operation, the runways are 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:18.960
 but they should stay locked longer 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.899
 stay in a hut and leave later 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.299
 then be sure to note that they are off 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.909
 18 o'clock in the valley must be from this 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:34.560
 time, the caterpillars depend on until 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:38.060
 to 1200 meters long steel ropes parts 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.470
 which one can easily overlook 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.119
 this is somewhere on the ground and yes 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.700
 somewhere two meters or three meters in 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:52.350
 the air and can happen that on the 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:53.789
 edges and there are not and 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.429
 that's actually the dangerous thing 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.349
 the whole if the caterpillars so on 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:01.580
 rope is also the snow after 

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:01.580
 transported above 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.450
 prepared the result even better 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.770
 hang 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:14.390
 Preparations for fresh snow will be made 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.920
 also in addition in the early 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.420
 Morning at the slope preparation 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.310
 worked 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.800
 anyway, it may be because of the missing 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.320
 bonding the new snow with the as 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.750
 snow during the day to the education on the 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.390
 runways 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.070
 So this is the nature of the matter 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.530
 and is no sloppiness in the 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.040
 piste grooming please have it for you 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.040
 understanding
