thank you Nintendo was proud when we

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:20.890 
thank you Nintendo was proud when we
introduced<00:03:15.459> make<00:03:16.459> us<00:03:16.670> proud<00:03:17.950> but<00:03:18.950> I<00:03:19.310> think<00:03:20.030> we

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.150 

all<00:03:38.050> of<00:03:38.410> those<00:03:38.620> innovations<00:03:39.180> change<00:03:40.180> game<00:03:40.750> and

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
all of those innovations change game and

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:51.720 
all of those innovations change game and
so<00:03:42.160> will<00:03:43.000> Nintendo<00:03:43.630> DS<00:03:45.300> it<00:03:46.300> is<00:03:46.980> different<00:03:50.730> that

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
so will Nintendo DS it is different that

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.240 
so will Nintendo DS it is different that
same<00:03:52.060> word<00:03:52.590> different<00:03:54.090> also<00:03:55.090> defines<00:03:55.720> our

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
same word different also defines our

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.540 
same word different also defines our
approach<00:03:57.250> for<00:03:57.790> our<00:03:58.090> next<00:03:58.600> home<00:03:58.930> system<00:03:59.550> it

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
approach for our next home system it

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:03.180 
approach for our next home system it
won't<00:04:00.880> simply<00:04:01.120> be<00:04:01.330> new<00:04:01.720> it<00:04:02.050> want<00:04:02.650> to<00:04:02.770> simply

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
won't simply be new it want to simply

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:06.390 
won't simply be new it want to simply
include<00:04:03.790> new<00:04:04.000> technologies<00:04:05.400> better

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
include new technologies better

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.200 
include new technologies better
technology<00:04:07.030> is<00:04:07.150> good<00:04:07.480> but<00:04:08.260> technologies<00:04:09.250> not

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:10.210 
technology is good but technologies not

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:15.270 
technology is good but technologies not
enough<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:12.940> definition<00:04:13.570> of<00:04:13.860> new<00:04:14.860> machine

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
enough the definition of new machine

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.410 
enough the definition of new machine
must<00:04:15.820> be<00:04:16.000> different<00:04:16.510> I<00:04:17.820> want<00:04:18.820> you<00:04:18.970> to<00:04:19.150> know

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
must be different I want you to know
