 las vegas 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.870
 considered the biggest fair of electronics 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.910
 of the world there are announced the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.259
 main products that will reach the 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.120
 during the year 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.220
 the news of the event and other news 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.210
 the world of technology you confer 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.210
 now in sync 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.199
 samsung lg presented the first 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.399
 105-inch curved tvs 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.980
 the handsets have 5.120 by 2160 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.710
 Resolution pixels this value is higher 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.960
 even if the other definition to 4K 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.520
 screen ratio of 21 by nine the two 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.280
 televisions have the same price 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.379
 exorbitant take one of these home 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.180
 consumer needs to pay more than 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.090
 $ 70 thousand 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.289
 this value is equivalent to more than 165 thousand 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.660
 real 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.940
 amd also took advantage of the fair and launched 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.520
 your new generation of video cards 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.629
 for portable composite devices 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.310
 by the wise ons 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.830
 r9 r 7 and 5 m two hundred initially 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.680
 presented a model of each segment 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.350
 the company disclosed the 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.909
 air intake plate 5 m 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.070
 thirty and the top of the line at r9 n290 xe 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.229
 from the information it is possible to perceive 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.430
 that these are renamed models of the 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.070
 previous generation 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.159
 the hd 8 thousand while the input won 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.020
 a more turbo charged gpu plus memory and a 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.900
 support for new technologies 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.960
 the top of the line almost equal to 89 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.590
 70 m with just a few technologies to 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.689
 more 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.250
 the new cpus will be available 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:49.110
 initially on notebooks and laptops 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.939
 dalai or rms lenovo and clevo to intel 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.430
 announced this week the first Edson 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.320
 computer for wearable 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.259
 company has the format of a 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.909
 sd card and will support multiple 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.180
 operating systems and 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.619
 wireless technology integrated with 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.719
 company is intended to facilitate 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.670
 development of wearable technologies 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.220
 so that devices of the genre 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.910
 appear more and can be integrated into the 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.800
 style of 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.230
 people's life the edict will be 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.570
 available this semester 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.260
 another novelty is the transformer is 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.210
 asus 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.490
 the device is a tablet hybrid and 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.200
 notebook capable of running android and 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.600
 windows and the exchange between the two systems 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.730
 it only takes four seconds 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.380
 equipped with the fourth generation i7 core 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:36.630
 it will have 128 gb in ssd on the tablet and the hd 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.470
 1 terabyte additional one doc of 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.310
 keyboard 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.410
 the screen is touch full hd and has 13.3 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.790
 inches but what really impressed 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.180
 it was the price 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.750
 the transformer will cost $ 599 there 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.520
 out 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.830
 there is still no price information and 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.990
 availability in brazil we made a 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.450
 hands-on of the product and you can check 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.520
 here next to nvidia presented a 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.390
 processor version designed for 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.320
 to cars 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:07.260
 the tegra k1 vcm which has 192 nuclei of 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.150
 processing between capacities 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.310
 of the new chip embedded in cars 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.740
 detection of objects and 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.990
 real time information the driver 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.740
 based on images captured by 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.750
 cameras 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.580
 this way the processor could 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.070
 identify that the driver is en route 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.709
 collision with another vehicle or not 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.900
 It is more in the center of its range this 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.810
 would be the principle for creating 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.130
 autonomous vehicles 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.290
 another possibility is the use of 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.750
 additional processing for the creation 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.570
 of dynamic panels with more visual 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.030
 and use in information systems 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.160
 and fear that the related information 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.050
 traffic with entertainment to the 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.150
 driver and the other passengers 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:52.950
 the chip is compatible with the systems that 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:55.440
 the mx android and linux windows and maybe a 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.360
 processor already tested this year 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.150
 Google announced that it intends to equip 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.880
 cars with android still in 2014 through 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.300
 made a partnership with Nvidia and 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.770
 audi auto hyundai round and 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.930
 general motors 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.300
 the companies formed an open alliance 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.880
 automotive and intend to develop a 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.820
 common platform that will bring innovation 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.600
 and safer and more intuitive cars 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.880
 besides google apple and nokia too 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.580
 investing in the automotive software 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.520
 which shows that in 2014 we can see 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.530
 great news on connected cars 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.360
 an idc survey showed that the 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.400
 windows phone was the system that most 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.280
 grew in the penultimate quarter and 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.120
 exceeded the iphone in sales in 24 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.370
 countries 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.770
 the markets that sold more devices 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.200
 with windows phone than iphones are in 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.540
 mostly emerging markets and the 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.220
 Brazil is off the list 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.110
 we now have to wait for the result of the 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.240
 last quarter which corresponds to the 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.430
 Christmas and New Year sales to see if the 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.360
 microsoft will be even closer to the 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.280
 s 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.200
 As for android, it's good that she expects a 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.480
 a bit more because a survey of 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.850
 gartner estimates that devices with 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.770
 google's system go from one million and 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.200
 100 million this year 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.940
 who uses gmail and google else goes 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.770
 be able to send an email to any 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.020
 person registered in both services 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.730
 even without her address 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.760
 when you start entering a recipient 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.860
 will show two categories one of the 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.680
 gmail contacts and other connections 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.480
 google + in the latter will not be 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.760
 displayed the email addresses of the 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.440
 recipient and the means received from 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.030
 google + users who are in your 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.250
 circle of friends go to the category 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.230
 main input box 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.540
 already sent because you do not 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.460
 knows go to social section 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.130
 the sender can only send a second 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.680
 message in case you add in your 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.750
 circles or answer the first who 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.820
 was concerned about privacy can 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.870
 relax because the use of the function is 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.210
 optional 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.850
 users can choose whether to receive and 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.640
 mails from everyone in google + from circles 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.300
 extended from specific circles or from 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.860
 nobody 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.560
 change must be implemented from 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:06.380
 next week just a little bit like this 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.600
 How google does it, I do not know 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.640
 This week it stays here on the site you 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.880
 can check the complete news 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:16.790
 if you are in 2014 and analysis of the game notebook 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.120
 ms we publish until next week 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:19.120
 bye
