00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.569
 Good morning, good morning, good morning. 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.160
 So who won the shirt on the 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.759
 wood performance 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.969
 the crash of the speedy recalls that gave the 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.970
 departure is to make the technician then hit 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.150
 who said it was the whip car 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.760
 by an evil starting engine that knows 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.920
 congratulations, who won the first one there? 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.609
 gave the right answer there according to the 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.740
 The post order was murilo augustus 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.700
 Congratulations and put there was the cable 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.500
 whip was really on the way to the 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.840
 Start engine 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.210
 this is a relatively common 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.950
 happens with a certain frequency is okay 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.190
 The car is not well cracked in the car. 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.890
 the starting engine of the time that you 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.780
 button amperage the voltage to alienate 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.879
 interact very loud so you need to be 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.739
 very well it is cracked if you do not have it 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.309
 creates a kind of spark between the 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.070
 between the local rate and the 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.710
 engine and does not jump and does not 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.390
 and do not pass electric current to come 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.080
 to keep match has to be very well 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.600
 in the key 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.479
 in this case it is up to one he takes from one 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.650
 Also, that's okay. 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.299
 just to crash 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.450
 so this is it there happens a certain 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.850
 relativity is with time is more then 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.680
 Once again , congratulations to the augusto murilo. 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.970
 seko who got the answer but had 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.770
 people who also put the same 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.600
 response in a different way as well 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.820
 there were people who said it was a cable 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.680
 earth is the same and I 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.630
 would also consider a response if it 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.630
 first that it was logical that 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.909
 were the cracked grumpy land car 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.829
 badly tight is also considered then 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.290
