your<00:00:50.670> handle<00:00:51.239> for<00:00:51.449> turning<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.770> then<00:00:52.980> there's

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
your handle for turning and then there's

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.549 
your handle for turning and then there's
three<00:00:53.430> Clips<00:00:54.239> here<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:54.719> hold<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.289> circle

paper<00:00:56.010> in<00:00:56.280> place<00:00:56.489> now<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.449> can<00:00:57.690> make<00:00:57.840> these

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
paper in place now you can make these

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:07.219 
paper in place now you can make these
shapes<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.440> designs<00:01:04.909> see<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.060> whole<00:01:06.180> page<00:01:06.450> by

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
shapes and designs see the whole page by

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.800 
shapes and designs see the whole page by
following<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:09.020> pattern<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.290> number<00:01:10.799> 10<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.810> a

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
following this pattern so number 10 is a

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.039 
following this pattern so number 10 is a
50<00:01:13.500> C<00:01:14.119> of<00:01:15.119> 15<00:01:15.840> H<00:01:16.400> actually<00:01:17.400> it's<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.759> 50<00:01:18.119> C<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.630> G

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
50 C of 15 H actually it's a 50 C and G

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.850 
50 C of 15 H actually it's a 50 C and G
a<00:01:19.290> 15<00:01:20.250> H<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:21.450> 10<00:01:21.780> H<00:01:21.990> hmm

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
a 15 H and a 10 H hmm

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.260 
a 15 H and a 10 H hmm
well<00:01:24.110> look<00:01:25.110> here<00:01:25.549> let's<00:01:26.549> move<00:01:26.729> this<00:01:26.909> up<00:01:27.119> a

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
well look here let's move this up a

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.960 
well look here let's move this up a
little<00:01:27.390> this<00:01:28.350> lever<00:01:28.710> here<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.310> would<00:01:29.640> be<00:01:29.790> the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
little this lever here is would be the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.460 
little this lever here is would be the
50<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:31.500> you'd<00:01:31.650> set<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.340> 50<00:01:32.909> mark<00:01:33.090> and

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
50 so you'd set that to the 50 mark and

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.300 
50 so you'd set that to the 50 mark and
then<00:01:35.090> these<00:01:36.090> centerpieces<00:01:36.720> here<00:01:37.590> would<00:01:38.130> be

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
then these centerpieces here would be

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.889 
then these centerpieces here would be
the<00:01:38.460> letter<00:01:38.729> C<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.479> have<00:01:40.759> ABCD<00:01:41.759> efg<00:01:42.420> all<00:01:42.659> the

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
the letter C you have ABCD efg all the

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.219 
the letter C you have ABCD efg all the
way<00:01:42.990> down<00:01:43.399> both<00:01:44.399> sides<00:01:44.670> they<00:01:44.880> match<00:01:45.119> up<00:01:46.220> so<00:01:48.229> how

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
way down both sides they match up so how

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.319 
way down both sides they match up so how
about<00:01:49.320> we<00:01:49.470> do<00:01:49.590> our<00:01:49.740> own<00:01:49.860> design<00:01:50.159> though<00:01:50.329> we're

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
about we do our own design though we're

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.490 
about we do our own design though we're
gonna<00:01:51.420> take<00:01:51.720> an<00:01:51.869> e<00:01:52.170> on<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.799> pin<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.399> an<00:01:53.939> e<00:01:54.270> on

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
gonna take an e on this pin and an e on

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.550 
gonna take an e on this pin and an e on
this<00:01:55.500> pin<00:01:55.860> now<00:01:56.219> see<00:01:56.549> those<00:01:56.790> are<00:01:56.969> locked<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.560> so

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
this pin now see those are locked in so

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.770 
this pin now see those are locked in so
this<00:01:58.770> Creek<00:01:59.130> handles<00:01:59.670> what<00:01:59.850> you<00:01:59.969> turn<00:02:00.270> you're

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
this Creek handles what you turn you're

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.380 
this Creek handles what you turn you're
supposed<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.079> put<00:02:01.290> pressure<00:02:01.619> down<00:02:01.799> here<00:02:02.390> just

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
supposed to put pressure down here just

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.270 
supposed to put pressure down here just
lightly<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.930> hold<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.200> pencil<00:02:04.439> in<00:02:04.680> place<00:02:04.950> and

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
lightly to hold the pencil in place and

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.459 
lightly to hold the pencil in place and
then<00:02:06.000> turn<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.630> crank<00:02:06.810> now<00:02:07.110> I'm<00:02:07.200> gonna<00:02:07.350> do<00:02:07.439> a

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
then turn the crank now I'm gonna do a

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.690 
then turn the crank now I'm gonna do a
little<00:02:07.590> differently<00:02:08.039> here<00:02:08.310> because<00:02:08.520> it's

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
little differently here because it's

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.609 
little differently here because it's
hard<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.000> do<00:02:09.119> in<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.360> camera<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.410> I'm<00:02:10.500> gonna

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
hard to do in the camera so I'm gonna

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.160 
hard to do in the camera so I'm gonna
put<00:02:10.860> pressure<00:02:11.069> here<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.819> then<00:02:12.360> turn

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
put pressure here and then turn

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:23.120 
put pressure here and then turn
the<00:02:13.260> crank<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:21.170> right<00:02:22.170> now<00:02:22.349> what<00:02:22.800> I'm<00:02:22.920> making

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
the crank and right now what I'm making

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:30.080 
the crank and right now what I'm making
is<00:02:23.580> this<00:02:24.650> Center<00:02:26.150> shape<00:02:27.150> here<00:02:28.880> kind<00:02:29.880> of<00:02:29.970> hard

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
is this Center shape here kind of hard

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:39.210 
is this Center shape here kind of hard
to<00:02:30.150> do<00:02:30.300> like<00:02:30.510> this

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.630 

I<00:02:39.310> think<00:02:40.030> my<00:02:40.150> pencils<00:02:40.540> right<00:02:40.690> now<00:02:40.840> -<00:02:41.280> okay<00:02:42.280> so

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
I think my pencils right now - okay so

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.580 
I think my pencils right now - okay so
now<00:02:42.790> let<00:02:43.150> me<00:02:43.240> move<00:02:43.360> this<00:02:43.510> out<00:02:43.660> of<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:43.840> way<00:02:43.990> we

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
now let me move this out of the way we

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.280 
now let me move this out of the way we
just<00:02:44.740> did<00:02:44.830> this<00:02:45.210> circular<00:02:46.210> pattern<00:02:47.080> right

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
just did this circular pattern right

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.350 
just did this circular pattern right
here<00:02:48.390> whisk<00:02:49.390> up<00:02:49.600> a<00:02:49.720> little<00:02:50.760> we<00:02:51.760> just<00:02:51.970> made<00:02:52.120> this

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
here whisk up a little we just made this

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.690 
here whisk up a little we just made this
pattern<00:02:52.870> and<00:02:53.500> it<00:02:53.620> just<00:02:53.800> follows<00:02:54.190> around<00:02:54.520> my

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
pattern and it just follows around my

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.260 
pattern and it just follows around my
pencil<00:02:55.060> needs<00:02:55.210> to<00:02:55.300> be<00:02:55.420> sharpened<00:02:55.750> by<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:55.930> way

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
pencil needs to be sharpened by the way

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.420 
pencil needs to be sharpened by the way
okay<00:02:58.270> so<00:02:58.630> does<00:02:58.930> that<00:02:59.050> make<00:02:59.200> sense<00:02:59.230> now<00:02:59.710> you

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
okay so does that make sense now you

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.700 
okay so does that make sense now you
want<00:03:00.610> to<00:03:00.640> make<00:03:00.760> a<00:03:00.820> circle<00:03:01.390> you<00:03:02.320> would<00:03:02.410> put

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
want to make a circle you would put

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.490 
want to make a circle you would put
these<00:03:03.340> pins<00:03:03.730> here<00:03:04.150> you'd<00:03:04.870> match<00:03:05.110> the<00:03:05.320> letter

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
these pins here you'd match the letter

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.230 
these pins here you'd match the letter
say<00:03:05.860> you<00:03:05.920> wanna<00:03:07.260> let's<00:03:08.260> go<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.500> Jay<00:03:08.920> Jay<00:03:09.850> here

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
say you wanna let's go to Jay Jay here

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.750 
say you wanna let's go to Jay Jay here
and<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:11.440> Jay<00:03:11.890> here<00:03:12.850> and<00:03:13.500> now<00:03:14.500> it's<00:03:15.190> gonna<00:03:15.400> fix

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
and a Jay here and now it's gonna fix

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.640 
and a Jay here and now it's gonna fix
this<00:03:15.940> in<00:03:16.150> place<00:03:16.420> it's<00:03:17.140> not<00:03:17.260> gonna<00:03:17.410> work

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
this in place it's not gonna work

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.620 
this in place it's not gonna work
because<00:03:17.830> I<00:03:18.130> need<00:03:18.310> to<00:03:18.340> sharpen<00:03:18.640> my<00:03:18.820> pencil<00:03:19.420> and

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
because I need to sharpen my pencil and

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.660 
because I need to sharpen my pencil and
then<00:03:19.990> you<00:03:20.140> would<00:03:20.290> just<00:03:20.320> come<00:03:20.650> around<00:03:20.770> and<00:03:21.220> then

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
then you would just come around and then

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.110 
then you would just come around and then
move<00:03:24.780> this<00:03:25.780> flying<00:03:26.650> pressure<00:03:26.950> here<00:03:27.370> and<00:03:27.970> what

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
move this flying pressure here and what

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:35.520 
move this flying pressure here and what
you're<00:03:28.270> gonna<00:03:28.360> get<00:03:28.630> is<00:03:28.870> a<00:03:29.800> circle<00:03:34.230> hard<00:03:35.230> to<00:03:35.350> see

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
you're gonna get is a circle hard to see

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.420 
you're gonna get is a circle hard to see
but<00:03:35.800> it's<00:03:35.980> there

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
but it's there

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.600 
but it's there
there's<00:03:37.030> my<00:03:37.270> circle<00:03:37.690> goes<00:03:38.290> around<00:03:38.320> here<00:03:39.010> okay

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
there's my circle goes around here okay

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.100 
there's my circle goes around here okay
do<00:03:40.570> we<00:03:40.630> need<00:03:40.780> to<00:03:40.870> sharpen<00:03:41.110> so<00:03:42.810> you<00:03:43.810> can<00:03:43.959> use

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
do we need to sharpen so you can use

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.440 
do we need to sharpen so you can use
their<00:03:44.290> presets<00:03:44.950> by<00:03:45.489> following<00:03:46.030> their<00:03:46.269> letter

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
their presets by following their letter

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.620 
their presets by following their letter
combinations<00:03:47.230> like<00:03:47.500> this<00:03:48.250> one<00:03:48.430> here<00:03:48.670> it<00:03:49.000> says

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
combinations like this one here it says

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.590 
combinations like this one here it says
take<00:03:50.620> your<00:03:50.650> set<00:03:51.130> it<00:03:51.220> to<00:03:51.340> D<00:03:51.610> and<00:03:51.880> then<00:03:51.940> just

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
take your set it to D and then just

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.810 
take your set it to D and then just
change<00:03:53.160> to<00:03:54.160> a<00:03:54.190> 50<00:03:54.790> 60<00:03:55.209> and<00:03:55.720> 70<00:03:56.350> now<00:03:57.040> that<00:03:57.250> what's

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
change to a 50 60 and 70 now that what's

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.370 
change to a 50 60 and 70 now that what's
called<00:03:58.060> the<00:03:58.239> shift<00:03:58.540> lever<00:03:58.810> so<00:03:59.140> you<00:03:59.200> would

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
called the shift lever so you would

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.440 
called the shift lever so you would
change<00:03:59.530> it<00:03:59.650> to<00:03:59.800> 50<00:04:00.100> 60<00:04:00.250> 70<00:04:00.790> leave<00:04:00.970> it<00:04:01.090> on<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.269> D

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
change it to 50 60 70 leave it on the D

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.820 
change it to 50 60 70 leave it on the D
and<00:04:01.630> move<00:04:02.500> your<00:04:03.459> hootenanny<00:04:04.090> crank<00:04:04.989> around

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
and move your hootenanny crank around

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.410 
and move your hootenanny crank around
and<00:04:06.070> that's<00:04:06.370> how<00:04:06.519> you<00:04:06.580> get<00:04:06.730> these<00:04:06.880> panners<00:04:07.269> now

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
and that's how you get these panners now

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.030 
and that's how you get these panners now
we<00:04:07.480> have<00:04:07.690> 35<00:04:08.250> about<00:04:09.360> 35<00:04:10.360> blank<00:04:10.750> discs<00:04:11.260> and<00:04:11.410> this

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
we have 35 about 35 blank discs and this

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:05.149 
let's see if we can redo that Street do

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:07.480 
let's see if we can redo that Street do
a<00:05:05.179> circle<00:05:05.689> and<00:05:05.809> okay<00:05:06.199> okay<00:05:06.949> we're<00:05:07.099> moving<00:05:07.339> to<00:05:07.459> a

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
a circle and okay okay we're moving to a

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.629 
a circle and okay okay we're moving to a
K<00:05:07.849> that's<00:05:08.809> gonna<00:05:08.959> give<00:05:09.199> us<00:05:09.289> a<00:05:09.439> small<00:05:09.740> circle<00:05:10.369> in

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:10.639 
K that's gonna give us a small circle in

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:14.529 
K that's gonna give us a small circle in
the<00:05:11.419> center<00:05:12.020> for<00:05:12.649> the<00:05:12.679> K<00:05:13.219> let's<00:05:13.969> see<00:05:14.240> if<00:05:14.330> we<00:05:14.389> can

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
the center for the K let's see if we can

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:25.929 
the center for the K let's see if we can
do<00:05:14.629> it<00:05:14.749> this<00:05:14.899> way<00:05:23.889> pretty<00:05:24.889> unstable<00:05:25.339> in<00:05:25.699> my

00:05:25.929 --> 00:05:25.939 
do it this way pretty unstable in my

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:27.999 
do it this way pretty unstable in my
booth<00:05:26.149> here<00:05:26.479> oh<00:05:26.659> there<00:05:27.469> you<00:05:27.589> go

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:28.009 
booth here oh there you go

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:32.019 
booth here oh there you go
yeah<00:05:28.189> with<00:05:28.369> my<00:05:28.519> circle<00:05:29.169> now<00:05:30.610> let's<00:05:31.610> just<00:05:31.819> say

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:32.029 
yeah with my circle now let's just say

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:34.389 
yeah with my circle now let's just say
these<00:05:32.990> clips<00:05:33.289> don't<00:05:33.529> hold<00:05:33.740> it<00:05:33.889> down<00:05:34.009> very<00:05:34.339> well

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:34.399 
these clips don't hold it down very well

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:36.369 
these clips don't hold it down very well
so<00:05:34.939> that's<00:05:35.119> why<00:05:35.300> you<00:05:35.360> get<00:05:35.569> movement<00:05:35.779> you'd

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:36.379 
so that's why you get movement you'd

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:38.350 
so that's why you get movement you'd
have<00:05:36.529> to<00:05:36.649> be<00:05:36.740> pretty<00:05:36.979> stable<00:05:37.309> on<00:05:37.699> a<00:05:37.759> stable

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
have to be pretty stable on a stable

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.570 
have to be pretty stable on a stable
surface<00:05:38.539> and<00:05:39.169> you<00:05:39.439> have<00:05:39.619> to<00:05:39.769> make<00:05:39.889> sure<00:05:39.919> the

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
surface and you have to make sure the

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.519 
surface and you have to make sure the
