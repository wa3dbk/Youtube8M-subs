00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.980
 so a question from up to sharp against Bayer 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.159
 so Ott 

00:00:09.159 --> 00:00:13.619
 11 the atmosphere at the 3 of the predecessor is forward is still good 

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:18.479
 We would have determined since we already sunk so 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.839
 Elaine knows the route like the CEO 

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:23.640
 and so on 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.239
 I know, but this is not the predecessor here 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:29.239
 is the ban Masters but 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.899
 I think different though 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.420
 it is not that 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.190
 the TM series is not the predecessor of 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.090
 to my knowledge 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.090
 she also clarifies the question 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.790
 and for the others in the team too 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.010
 I had said yes that if such a question sometimes 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.010
 we speak and now 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.190
 we have to go around here a bit and start and finish now I think 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:02.920
 how good the place 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.520
 Fourth place one on 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.520
 that he is not Doldinger now 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.960
 Descent fights 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.760
 although school prescribed 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.760
 that cars weirdest track anyway 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.450
 to have 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.550
 but who am I too often too often 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.890
 Today I want to rammed her because there must be a penalty at the same time 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.970
 but really get involved 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.110
 I can do that too 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.290
 that is not yet and stand 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.290
 and just cut short 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.090
 Borken 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.090
 I've already stopped giving her gas, and there's more 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.819
 but that was a good jump now 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.609
 Since I do not have God to give gas to Eco that they are right Seca for the 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:21.029
 to see the rest 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:23.639
 but 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:25.769
 Vienna's Vostro 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.769
 the garden bath Roters how much I brake 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:32.369
 red-white is full of such 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:40.039
 Dr at the Comet still over 

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:42.539
 even though Beijing is me 

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:45.459
 BP was not 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.459
 Hilden what 

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:50.609
 seen as men 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.099
 Haste goes like this 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.129
 LG 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.129
 ca 

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:08.289
 so rest year saved in fourth place 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.949
 excellent at watching me when James Hunter s 

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:17.519
 repeat again later 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.109
 also textually 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:22.699
 "We do not do it with a long voice. I'm better again 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:27.209
 it is indeed st4 pass from the wharton before taz up to look at you even further against 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.259
 St 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:32.609
 at least with them often wood routes 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.369
 two routes two laps 

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:38.369
 Goals 9 seconds VontE zero to a hundred 

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:43.709
 however 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.709
 lie to me 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:52.159
 With 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:55.159
 4 

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:58.760
 currently Veith Werner Spec are no surprise 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.760
 although who the surprise so far behind 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:13.249
 I think I know which 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.580
 nearby I have no obsolete respect 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.279
 Rohrer 

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:37.279
 the pitch touched once again and I was already gone 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.990
 and I think that they still have nothing to do with the man 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:44.819
 the Anne Naumann 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:47.819
 instead of the vehicles do not quite tolerate 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:58.439
 maybe like the first one 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:05.629
 but they are also shadows 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:13.659
 are it wear 4 on normal 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.460
 Dear people you know what else there 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.659
 only between Ramsau 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:29.999
 Year or deceive the ore 

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:32.999
 Diarra 

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:46.839
 from the company the choir left 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.580
 Bossert no if nnnn one 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:55.379
 well or in the yellow area already 

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:58.379
 Region the 

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:10.039
 Leon 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:13.199
 Yes 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:16.199
 somehow keep the lead 

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:23.189
 Defend place 

00:06:26.379 --> 00:06:29.379
 and hope that 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.520
 but he is not 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.580
 inap sda 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.580
 meanwhile too 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.680
 Hohenwart 

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:48.199
 but they are already demanding the Muslims 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:52.139
 the mandate was not so 

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:58.240
 would leave the track 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.439
 in the area may not do that that no more 

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:03.439
 Rolf Stober protests 

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:09.569
 UL 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:19.710
 also given to Sheens 

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:28.860
 There is quite a lot of cult art 

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.860
 Here's the favorite other vehicle 

00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:37.490
 I do not think so 

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.490
 which one again two percent 

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:47.520
 Ulm 

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.520
 although Joppich a bit Golden Globes piece and schools 

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:57.509
 where I'm not so accurate and also reference person Bauroth York so 

00:07:59.749 --> 00:08:00.689
 Church through the door 

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:03.689
 Do not buy from the nets all the years working here 

00:08:09.889 --> 00:08:11.960
 fortunately only two laps 

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.960
 put to bad luck 

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.770
 I knew well too 

00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:30.960
 Oak Brook is coming 

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.079
 the 

00:08:32.079 --> 00:08:33.530
 Rotthaus 

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.690
 At the same time, she also gives this a fascinating evening 

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.510
 it's time for her in Bissau Monster 

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:41.310
 Nothing 

00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:44.510
 through and 

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:46.390
 Dr 

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:48.540
 you need 

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:51.540
 it goes with the 

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.280
 through Abdi 

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.400
 more to make over 

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.070
 and Wolgast 

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:03.500
 she would know 

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:04.920
 "It's an exciting thing to do 

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.920
 We are not the vehicles now 

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.740
 like the first, nothing at all 

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.500
 15 days that is 

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.880
 maybe another turn and one in a joke 

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:31.930
 the accelerated much too 

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:39.810
 EPS 

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.810
 Now we do not give up 

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:46.630
 okay he's eleventh place 

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.700
 the temple is dead so what is this punishment for? 

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:02.630
 if that's not seen or awards 

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.780
 take care there front 

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:15.550
 he rings that 

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.160
 has to liberate me to be so nice to send 

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:32.420
 he understood 

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:35.420
 bring a bit forward here 

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:42.510
 is Bernard wool 

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.010
 Jan 

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:49.010
 I say now that still must come 

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:54.370
 Egidien percent dare still a chance 

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:57.370
 maybe Scheidegg LZ Saar 

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.980
 he does not cut much better that was really nice 

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.610
 Torch Axima Shift Sun 

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:15.610
 and I push back 

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.760
 not quite 

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.540
 already standing in the defense on the spot 

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.900
 how to tap Thomas 

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:53.520
 built in these so flat the 

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.520
 Vehicles there's no slipstream 

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:03.630
 from whom I can what from the Japanese turbines 

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:18.020
 Colonel but class "Did you see that? 

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:21.020
 stay one too 

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:24.950
 according to 1 &amp; 1 goal 

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:27.550
 it also has to be punished 

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.550
 as our first punitive first leg match 

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:35.260
 Fifth place and took on time but one type of data 

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.880
 he drives for the same drive-through penalty is so mean 

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:45.080
 publishes 

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.080
 This was once the Admira poet 

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:52.390
 That is not always 

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.040
 because it's heavier too 

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:11.010
 I give my best second place is not bad 

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.320
 good 

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:29.460
 they also have to be a bit low me most way but I turn right 

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:29.850
 path 

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:32.850
 and he does not carry on way 

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:36.770
 finally cracked 

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:45.370
 and that's no criminal or what 

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.550
 Boyles is in seventh place 

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:57.280
 Aalen 

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.280
 now is with 

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.430
 imaginative first marriage before 

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:13.430
 he shares that until now 

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.660
 ice 

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.270
 Troost years continued because I watch Sat 1 on the first place 

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:30.390
 rich enough it has burst that is of course nice 

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.509
 Class well done and on 

00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:38.839
 This game modes for three races during his lifetime a reason for the 

00:14:38.839 --> 00:14:41.839
 Multiplayer 

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:44.470
 marched above 

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:45.830
 that is very nice 

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:47.760
 really very demanding
