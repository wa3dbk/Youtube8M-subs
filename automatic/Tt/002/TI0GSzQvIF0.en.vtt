00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
I think there is a more i think it's

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.770 
I think there is a more i think it's
it's<00:02:18.470> about<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.160> idea<00:02:19.520> that<00:02:19.580> everybody<00:02:20.030> has

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
it's about the idea that everybody has

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.500 
it's about the idea that everybody has
wings<00:02:21.110> they're<00:02:21.739> invisible<00:02:22.360> invisible<00:02:23.360> wings

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
on their back and i think that this film

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.420 
on their back and i think that this film
is<00:02:26.870> about<00:02:27.020> discovering<00:02:27.500> our<00:02:27.950> wings<00:02:28.190> and
