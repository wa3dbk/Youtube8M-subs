00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.220
 we're going to put it to brown a little 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:52.950

 I have ground shrimp, I'm going to 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.350
 incorporate there I know that I do not have to 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.740
 incorporate it but I'm going to do it 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.780
 this is four ounces of weight for the 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.580
 dry whole shrimp can also 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.400
 do so the most lotus are a little bit and 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.150
 they already grind it 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.150
 okay 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.979
 and here I do not know why my camera does not 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:41.179
 he did it but from here as he exposed it from 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.820
 nuances feels new about to 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.880
 nougat and I'm going to incorporate the 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.679
 mix that is shrimp with rice 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.979
 now we are going to incorporate it very 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:50.979
 all right 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.390
 well now let's make the sauce of your 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.940
 cooking the chiles there I only have 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.540
 and half a spoonful of cumin and a half 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.540
 garlic clove 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.800
 good is the mixture already has to have 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:10.100
 your pan ready to make your pancakes 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.850
 already with his hot oil and we're leaving 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.850
 helping there 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.160
 and so will be your are their pancakes 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.849
 until they are finished mixing 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.849
 obviously 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.040
 now we already finished the pancakes in 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.990
 the same pot we put a little bit more 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.140
 of oil now let's continue a little 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:35.050
 of onion so that it takes flavor 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.240
 sauce there are the pancakes already in this 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.430
 point they have to have their nopales already 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.690
 cooked and its sauce obviously diamond and 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.380
 of everything 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.510
 now let's put the nopales 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.450
 can chop stratification like 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.890
 bolton 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.019
 forgive me right now I'm just 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.670
 sick and I know that my voice is heard 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.970
 little sketchy but because here we speak and 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.800
 you know 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.850
 now we are going to put it here they stay 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:05.340
 about two minutes together and here he makes a 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.140
 serious mistake do not do as he says do 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.380
 as I'm telling you they have to strain 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.980
 the sauce please what is the sauce to me 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.820
 which earned me was that if I did not 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.640
 Much came to me and I already put a more water 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.830
 because the pancakes of 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.230
 they collected so much liquid is absorbed 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.110
 and I already put it on, I did not put it as a 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.970
 teaspoon of salt to taste and now yes 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.790
 we go already after the sauce is 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.580
 seasoned with nopales alone and some 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.380
 pancakes for about 15 minutes leave in the 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.350
 chair after putting on the pancakes 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.750
 for 5 more minutes but do not put it 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.580
 salt and your shrimp mixture because the 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.950
 shrimp is very salty 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.310
 the truth this was delicious was 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.530
 peaks and so on and nothing else is left 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.950
 that they arrange their tortillas leave them 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:59.340
 about 5 more minutes 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.800
